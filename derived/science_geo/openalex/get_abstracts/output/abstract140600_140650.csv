A variety of studies have highlighted defective sterol trafficking from lysosomes in NP-C cells. However, the heterogeneous nature of additional accumulating metabolites suggests that the cellular lesion may involve a more generalized block in retrograde lysosomal trafficking.Immunocytochemical studies in fibroblasts reveal that theNPC1 gene product resides in a novel set of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2)(+)/mannose 6-phosphate receptor(−) vesicles that can be distinguished from cholesterol-enriched LAMP2(+) lysosomes. Drugs that block sterol transport out of lysosomes also redistribute NPC1 to cholesterol-laden lysosomes. Sterol relocation from lysosomes in cultured human fibroblasts can be blocked at 21 °C, consistent with vesicle-mediated transfer. These findings suggest that NPC1(+) vesicles may transiently interact with lysosomes to facilitate sterol relocation.Independent of defective sterol trafficking, NP-C fibroblasts are also deficient in vesicle-mediated clearance of endocytosed [14C]sucrose. Compartmental modeling of the observed [14C]sucrose clearance data targets the trafficking defect caused by mutations in NPC1 to an endocytic compartment proximal to lysosomes. Low density lipoprotein uptake by normal cells retards retrograde transport of [14C]sucrose through this same kinetic compartment, further suggesting that it may contain the sterol-sensing NPC1 protein.We conclude that a distinctive organelle containing NPC1 mediates retrograde lysosomal transport of endocytosed cargo that is not restricted to sterol.

Induction of cholesterol-mediated homeostatic responses is proposed to be delayed because of deficient enrichment of regulatory sterol pools in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E.

Lipid. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).NP-C is also characterized by lysosomal accumulation of other metabolites. Phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, sphingoid bases, cystine, and glycoproteins, as well as cholesterol, are stored in a tissue-specific pattern (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar, 12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To date, it has been assumed that the transport defect in NP-C cells is specific to cholesterol and that other metabolites accumulate secondarily to cholesterol. However, in the brain, where functional impairment is progressive and ultimately fatal, massive accumulation of glycolipids occurs, with little, if any, excessive cholesterol storage (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar, 12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Extensive glycolipid storage in fetal human NP-C liver further suggests that this storage is an early event in the development of the disorder (12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These glycolipid storage anomalies do not readily integrate into a unified pathogenic mechanism involving a primary defect in sterol trafficking. The possibility that the NP-C lesion might alternatively reflect a more generalized defect in trafficking out of lysosomes has not been previously explored.Here we provide evidence that sterol transport from lysosomes is vesicle-mediated, as suggested by a previous report (13Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We show that NPC1 resides in a novel set of vesicles that appear to interact with cholesterol-filled lysosomes. We further show that mutations in NPC1 do not exclusively affect sterol transport, but rather, target a vesicle-mediated retrograde transport pathway, potentially affecting a wide range of endocytosed material. Cholesterol, in addition to being a cargo, appears to modulate NPC1 vesicle-mediated transport from lysosomes.DISCUSSIONThe well documented lesions in lysosomal sterol processing that occur in Niemann-Pick C disease have established a role for NPC1 in sterol transport out of lysosomes. The identification of putative sterol-sensing domains in the recently cloned NPC1 gene further links this protein to cellular sterol processing (2Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J.Z. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A.M. Brown A. Kaneski C.R.

Brady R.O. Vanier M.T. Pentchev P.G. Tagle D.A. Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Our present studies reveal that in cultured human fibroblasts, NPC1 identifies a novel vesicle that appears to interact with cholesterol-filled lysosomes. We provide evidence that NPC1 mediates a vesicular form of transport out of lysosomes and that the cargo transported along this pathway is not restricted to sterol.We have shown that NPC1 protein (Fig. 2) resides in a novel set of vesicles that are LAMP2(+) (Fig. 3) and MPR(−) (Fig. 4) and that do not accumulate endocytosed lysosomal markers (Fig. 3). The ganglioside GM2 exclusively localizes to NPC1(+) vesicles and not to lysosomes containing endocytosed cholesterol, confirming their unique identity. 4E. J. Blanchette-Mackie, manuscript in preparation. We found that drugs that block sterol transport out of lysosomes (U18666A and progesterone) also trap NPC1 in cholesterol-laden lysosomes (Fig. 5). Sterol relocation from lysosomes can be blocked by low temperature (Figs. 6 and 7) and drugs (13Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that affect vesicular trafficking. Taken together, these findings suggest that NPC1 vesicles transiently interact with lysosomes to transfer sterol to other cellular sites. Definitive characterization of the novel NPC1(+) vesicular compartment as well as other organelles that may participate in retrograde lysosomal transport is currently under investigation.Several independent lines of research have provided evidence for retrograde lysosomal transport. Lysosomal membrane proteins appear to continuously cycle between lysosomes and the plasma membrane via endosomal compartments (32Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. J.

The NPC1(+) cholesterol-laden lysosome induced by drugs in the current studies (Fig. 5) could represent a hybrid organelle analogous to that which forms from the fusion of a late endosome with a lysosome (44Bright N.A. Reaves B.J. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2027-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Fearon C.W. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Drugs that retard cholesterol transport from lysosomes may allow fusion of NPC1 vesicles with lysosomes but block their subsequent fission. The observed reappearance of NPC1 vesicles as well as presumed lysosomes cleared of sterol after removal of progesterone from cell cultures (data not shown) is consistent with a reversible mechanism of drug interdiction involving blocked fission of a hybrid organelle.NP-C fibroblasts were found to be defective in vesicle-mediated retrograde transport of [14C]sucrose in the absence of lysosomal cholesterol storage (Fig. 8). Compartmental modeling was used to identify the kinetic compartment associated with this intracellular trafficking defect. The modeling targets the defect in retrograde transport to a late endocytic compartment (Fig. 9) and predicts that this defect is primarily responsible for the lysosomal storage (TableI) seen in NP-C cells. The extent of the predicted defect in the rate of [14C]sucrose transport from the late endocytic compartment to the cell surface is comparable to the reported defect in endocytosed sterol transport from lysosomes to the cell surface in NP-C fibroblasts (approximately 50%) (6Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The kinetically defined late endocytic compartment likely represents the immunocytochemically defined NPC1 vesicles.The role that endocytosed sterol plays in NP-C disease may be quite different than previously envisioned. The defect in vesicle-mediated egress of both [14C]sucrose and cholesterol suggests that the NPC1-mediated transport pathway is not restricted to sterol mobilization. Defective cellular clearance of a fluid-phase marker in the absence of lysosomal cholesterol storage in NP-C suggests that generalized, bulk retrograde transport of vesicular components is impaired. Several studies have provided evidence that endocytosed lipids (47Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and proteins (48Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Huari H.-P. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recycle to the cell surface from late endocytic compartments. Increasingly, attention has focused on the sorting and trafficking of endocytosed plasma membrane glycolipids (49Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). The defect in retrograde vesicular transport that we presently report could account for the excessive GM2 accumulation seen in endosomal compartments of some NP-C cell lines (50Yano T. Taniguchi M. Akaboshi S. Vanier M.T. Tai T. Sakuraba H. Ohno K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1996; 72: 214-219Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that endocytosed GM2 is a specific marker for the NPC1 vesicle,4 consistent with a role for this organelle in the intracellular trafficking of both glycolipids and cholesterol. Disruption of glycolipid transport might contribute to the cellular pathology associated with NP-C. Glycolipids, such as GM2, accumulate extensively in the absence of excessive cholesterol storage in NP-C neurons (51Siegel D.A. Walkley S.U. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1852-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 52Goodman L.A. Walkley S.U. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 93: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in the whole brain (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar,12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glycolipids and cholesterol are the major lipid components of membrane microdomains found in rafts; detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes; and caveolae (49Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Preliminary cellular extraction studies show that NPC1 has the solubility properties of a raft-associated protein. 5J. Incardona, unpublished observations. Future studies will clarify the possible structural and functional relationships that NPC1 and lipid microdomains might share.We also provide preliminary evidence that endocytosed sterol itself may modulate functions of NPC1. Cellular sterol enrichment retards the clearance of endocytosed [14C]sucrose from normal fibroblasts (Fig. 10) and, like NPC1 mutations, specifically targets a late endocytic compartment (Fig. 9). Thus, in addition to being cargo, endocytosed sterol appears to alter the rate of vesicular trafficking along this pathway, possibly interacting with the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1.In conclusion, the present findings suggest that a novel NPC1 organelle mediates retrograde lysosomal trafficking of a potentially wide spectrum of lysosomal cargo. The tissue-specific pattern of metabolites that accumulate in NP-C disease likely reflects the diverse cargo that is transported along this pathway. In the liver, where endocytosed lipoprotein processing can be significant, sterol may represent a major portion of the endocytosed cargo utilizing this pathway. Alternatively, in neurons and other types of cells in which little sterol may be exogenously derived, NPC1 may predominantly regulate retroendocytic glycolipid trafficking.

Lipid. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NP-C is also characterized by lysosomal accumulation of other metabolites. Phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, sphingoid bases, cystine, and glycoproteins, as well as cholesterol, are stored in a tissue-specific pattern (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar, 12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To date, it has been assumed that the transport defect in NP-C cells is specific to cholesterol and that other metabolites accumulate secondarily to cholesterol. However, in the brain, where functional impairment is progressive and ultimately fatal, massive accumulation of glycolipids occurs, with little, if any, excessive cholesterol storage (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar, 12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Extensive glycolipid storage in fetal human NP-C liver further suggests that this storage is an early event in the development of the disorder (12Vanier M.T Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These glycolipid storage anomalies do not readily integrate into a unified pathogenic mechanism involving a primary defect in sterol trafficking. The possibility that the NP-C lesion might alternatively reflect a more generalized defect in trafficking out of lysosomes has not been previously explored. Here we provide evidence that sterol transport from lysosomes is vesicle-mediated, as suggested by a previous report (13Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We show that NPC1 resides in a novel set of vesicles that appear to interact with cholesterol-filled lysosomes. We further show that mutations in NPC1 do not exclusively affect sterol transport, but rather, target a vesicle-mediated retrograde transport pathway, potentially affecting a wide range of endocytosed material. Cholesterol, in addition to being a cargo, appears to modulate NPC1 vesicle-mediated transport from lysosomes. DISCUSSIONThe well documented lesions in lysosomal sterol processing that occur in Niemann-Pick C disease have established a role for NPC1 in sterol transport out of lysosomes. The identification of putative sterol-sensing domains in the recently cloned NPC1 gene further links this protein to cellular sterol processing (2Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J.Z. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J. Krizman D.B. Nagle J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Sturley S.L. Ioannou Y.A. Higgins M.E. Comly M. Cooney A.M. Brown A. Kaneski C.R.

Our present studies reveal that in cultured human fibroblasts, NPC1 identifies a novel vesicle that appears to interact with cholesterol-filled lysosomes. We provide evidence that NPC1 mediates a vesicular form of transport out of lysosomes and that the cargo transported along this pathway is not restricted to sterol.We have shown that NPC1 protein (Fig. 2) resides in a novel set of vesicles that are LAMP2(+) (Fig. 3) and MPR(−) (Fig. 4) and that do not accumulate endocytosed lysosomal markers (Fig. 3). The ganglioside GM2 exclusively localizes to NPC1(+) vesicles and not to lysosomes containing endocytosed cholesterol, confirming their unique identity. 4E. J. Blanchette-Mackie, manuscript in preparation. We found that drugs that block sterol transport out of lysosomes (U18666A and progesterone) also trap NPC1 in cholesterol-laden lysosomes (Fig. 5). Sterol relocation from lysosomes can be blocked by low temperature (Figs. 6 and 7) and drugs (13Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) that affect vesicular trafficking. Taken together, these findings suggest that NPC1 vesicles transiently interact with lysosomes to transfer sterol to other cellular sites. Definitive characterization of the novel NPC1(+) vesicular compartment as well as other organelles that may participate in retrograde lysosomal transport is currently under investigation.Several independent lines of research have provided evidence for retrograde lysosomal transport. Lysosomal membrane proteins appear to continuously cycle between lysosomes and the plasma membrane via endosomal compartments (32Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. J.

The NPC1(+) cholesterol-laden lysosome induced by drugs in the current studies (Fig. 5) could represent a hybrid organelle analogous to that which forms from the fusion of a late endosome with a lysosome (44Bright N.A. Reaves B.J. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2027-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mullock B.M. Bright N.A. Fearon C.W. Gray S.R. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Drugs that retard cholesterol transport from lysosomes may allow fusion of NPC1 vesicles with lysosomes but block their subsequent fission. The observed reappearance of NPC1 vesicles as well as presumed lysosomes cleared of sterol after removal of progesterone from cell cultures (data not shown) is consistent with a reversible mechanism of drug interdiction involving blocked fission of a hybrid organelle.NP-C fibroblasts were found to be defective in vesicle-mediated retrograde transport of [14C]sucrose in the absence of lysosomal cholesterol storage (Fig. 8). Compartmental modeling was used to identify the kinetic compartment associated with this intracellular trafficking defect. The modeling targets the defect in retrograde transport to a late endocytic compartment (Fig. 9) and predicts that this defect is primarily responsible for the lysosomal storage (TableI) seen in NP-C cells. The extent of the predicted defect in the rate of [14C]sucrose transport from the late endocytic compartment to the cell surface is comparable to the reported defect in endocytosed sterol transport from lysosomes to the cell surface in NP-C fibroblasts (approximately 50%) (6Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G.

The kinetically defined late endocytic compartment likely represents the immunocytochemically defined NPC1 vesicles.The role that endocytosed sterol plays in NP-C disease may be quite different than previously envisioned. The defect in vesicle-mediated egress of both [14C]sucrose and cholesterol suggests that the NPC1-mediated transport pathway is not restricted to sterol mobilization. Defective cellular clearance of a fluid-phase marker in the absence of lysosomal cholesterol storage in NP-C suggests that generalized, bulk retrograde transport of vesicular components is impaired. Several studies have provided evidence that endocytosed lipids (47Sandhoff K. Kolter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and proteins (48Volz B. Orberger G. Porwoll S. Huari H.-P. Tauber R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recycle to the cell surface from late endocytic compartments. Increasingly, attention has focused on the sorting and trafficking of endocytosed plasma membrane glycolipids (49Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). The defect in retrograde vesicular transport that we presently report could account for the excessive GM2 accumulation seen in endosomal compartments of some NP-C cell lines (50Yano T. Taniguchi M. Akaboshi S. Vanier M.T. Tai T. Sakuraba H. Ohno K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1996; 72: 214-219Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently we demonstrated that endocytosed GM2 is a specific marker for the NPC1 vesicle,4 consistent with a role for this organelle in the intracellular trafficking of both glycolipids and cholesterol. Disruption of glycolipid transport might contribute to the cellular pathology associated with NP-C. Glycolipids, such as GM2, accumulate extensively in the absence of excessive cholesterol storage in NP-C neurons (51Siegel D.A. Walkley S.U. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1852-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 52Goodman L.A. Walkley S.U. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 93: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in the whole brain (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J.

Res. 1999; 24: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glycolipids and cholesterol are the major lipid components of membrane microdomains found in rafts; detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched complexes; and caveolae (49Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Preliminary cellular extraction studies show that NPC1 has the solubility properties of a raft-associated protein. 5J. Incardona, unpublished observations. Future studies will clarify the possible structural and functional relationships that NPC1 and lipid microdomains might share.We also provide preliminary evidence that endocytosed sterol itself may modulate functions of NPC1. Cellular sterol enrichment retards the clearance of endocytosed [14C]sucrose from normal fibroblasts (Fig. 10) and, like NPC1 mutations, specifically targets a late endocytic compartment (Fig. 9). Thus, in addition to being cargo, endocytosed sterol appears to alter the rate of vesicular trafficking along this pathway, possibly interacting with the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1.In conclusion, the present findings suggest that a novel NPC1 organelle mediates retrograde lysosomal trafficking of a potentially wide spectrum of lysosomal cargo. The tissue-specific pattern of metabolites that accumulate in NP-C disease likely reflects the diverse cargo that is transported along this pathway. In the liver, where endocytosed lipoprotein processing can be significant, sterol may represent a major portion of the endocytosed cargo utilizing this pathway. Alternatively, in neurons and other types of cells in which little sterol may be exogenously derived, NPC1 may predominantly regulate retroendocytic glycolipid trafficking. The well documented lesions in lysosomal sterol processing that occur in Niemann-Pick C disease have established a role for NPC1 in sterol transport out of lysosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2088211862,"RNA transcripts encoding the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>) receptor (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R) undergo adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing events at up to five specific sites. Compared with rat brain, human brain samples expressed higher levels of RNA transcripts encoding the amino acids valine-serine-valine (5-HT<sub>2C-VSV</sub>) and valine-glycine-valine (5-HT<sub>2C-VGV</sub>) at positions 156, 158, and 160, respectively. Agonist stimulation of the nonedited human receptor (5-HT<sub>2C-INI</sub>) and the edited 5-HT<sub>2C-VSV</sub>and 5-HT<sub>2C-VGV</sub> receptor variants stably expressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that serotonergic agonists were less potent at the edited receptors. Competition binding experiments revealed a guanine nucleotide-sensitive serotonin high affinity state only for the 5-HT<sub>2C-INI</sub> receptor; the loss of high affinity agonist binding to the edited receptor demonstrates that RNA editing generates unique 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs that couple less efficiently to G proteins. This reduced G protein coupling for the edited isoforms is primarily due to silencing of the constitutive activity of the nonedited 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R. The distinctions in agonist potency and constitutive activity suggest that different edited 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs exhibit distinct responses to serotonergic ligands and further imply that RNA editing represents a novel mechanism for controlling physiological signaling at serotonergic synapses."

N-terminal mAbs recognized specific residues that span the first 13 amino acids of CCR5, while nearly all ECL2 mAbs recognized residues Tyr-184 to Phe-189. In addition, all MD epitopes involved ECL2, including at least residues Lys-171 and Glu-172. We found that ECL2-specific mAbs were more efficient than NH2- or MD-antibodies in blocking RANTES or MIP-1β binding. By contrast, N-terminal mAbs blocked gp120-CCR5 binding more effectively than ECL2 mAbs. Surprisingly, ECL2 mAbs were more potent inhibitors of viral infection than N-terminal mAbs. Thus, the ability to block virus infection did not correlate with the ability to block gp120 binding. Together, these results imply that chemokines and Env bind to distinct but overlapping sites in CCR5, and suggest that the N-terminal domain of CCR5 is more important for gp120 binding while the extracellular loops are more important for inducing conformational changes in Env that lead to membrane fusion and virus infection. Measurements of individual antibody affinities coupled with kinetic analysis of equilibrium binding states also suggested that there are multiple conformational states of CCR5. A previously described mAb, 2D7, was unique in its ability to effectively block both chemokine and Env binding as well as coreceptor activity. 2D7 bound to a unique antigenic determinant in the first half of ECL2 and recognized a far greater proportion of cell surface CCR5 molecules than the other mAbs examined. Thus, the epitope recognized by 2D7 may represent a particularly attractive target for CCR5 antagonists.

The HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein is proteolytically processed from a gp160 precursor to form a mature noncovalent multimeric complex of gp120/41 subunits.

Coreceptor binding is thought to lead to additional conformational changes in Env that result in exposure of the hydrophobic fusion peptide in gp41, which mediates mixing of the viral and cellular membranes (1Doms R.W.

Chemokine receptors are members of the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor family. Seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors have complex membrane topologies consisting of an N-terminal domain, three extracellular and intracellular loops, and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. Studies with mutant and chimeric coreceptors have indicated that Env interactions with CCR5 are complex, requiring cooperativity between multiple extracellular domains and with multiple residues on the chemokine receptor (1Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. Virology. 1997; 235: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 44-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Berson J.F. Doms R.W.

Further, there are differences in how virus strains interact with CCR5, with R5X4 strains being particularly sensitive to alterations in the N-terminal domain of CCR5 (31Rucker J. Samson M.

However, whether CCR5 domains involved in Env binding and in conformational change induction are distinct, overlapping, or identical is not yet clear. In this paper, we generated a large panel of anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to probe the structural determinants of CCR5 chemokine receptor and coreceptor function. We mapped the epitopes of these antibodies to the extracellular domains of CCR5 using chimeric and mutant receptors, and correlated this information with the ability of these mAbs to block chemokine and HIV-1 Env binding as well as coreceptor function. We found that CCR5 has several immunodominant epitopes on its extracellular face and provide evidence for distinct but overlapping sites on CCR5 for chemokine and Env binding. mAbs to the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CCR5 were more effective at blocking chemokine than Env binding, while mAbs to the N-terminal domain blocked gp120 binding but had little effect on CCR5-chemokine interactions. Despite this, antibodies to ECL2 more effectively neutralized virus than did antibodies to the N terminus of CCR5. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of CCR5 is more important for Env binding, while the extracellular loops are more important for inducing the conformational changes in Env that lead to membrane fusion. Measurement of the relative affinities of these mAbs for CCR5 combined with analysis of equilibrium binding kinetics suggested that there are multiple conformational states of CCR5 on the cell surface. Finally, the epitope maps of these mAbs were used to provide constraints on a theoretical model of CCR5 structure. All constructs unless otherwise specified were made in pcDNA3. Plasmids expressing the CCR5/CCR2 chimeras have been described previously (31Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J. Yi Y. Collman R.G. Vassart G. Broder C.C. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Cell. 1996; 87: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The additional chimeras 55(2/5)5 and 55(5/2)5 were constructed by replacing aClaI-EcoRI cassette in wild-type CCR5 with a fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction as described earlier for N-terminal domain chimeras (31Rucker J. Samson M. Doranz B.J. Libert F. Berson J. Yi Y. Collman R.G. Vassart G. Broder C.C. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Cell. 1996; 87: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The junction between CCR5 and CCR2 sequences is at the conserved cysteine (Cys-178) that is presumably involved in a disulfide bond with the first extracellular loop. The mutant cassettes were transferred as needed into other backgrounds, such as CCR2b or the (5/2)222 chimera. The generation of the alanine scan mutants of CCR5 have also been described previously (32Doranz B.J. Lu Z. Rucker J. Zhang T. Sharron M. Cen Y. Wang Z. Guo H. Du J. Accavitti M.A. Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6305-6314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine scan mutants not previously reported were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All final constructs were verified by sequencing before their use in transfection experiments. mAbs 45501, 45502, 45517, 45519, 45523, 45533, 45529, 45531, and 45549 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice using syngeneic mouse myeloma (NSO) cells stably transfected to express the full-length human CCR5 sequence. An immunization protocol for soluble protein (35Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Between 0.5 and 2 million viable transfected cells were injected on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. The priming immunization was done by mixing the cell suspension in PBS with an equal volume (50 μl) of emulsified MPL/TDM adjuvant (Ribi); subsequent boosts used cells in 50 μl of PBS alone. Following immunization, popliteal lymph node cells were used for polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion. The hybridoma supernatants were then screened by cell-surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (105cells/well) for the presence of antibodies that bound to the immunizing cells. The positive subset was further tested on a panel of untransfected and irrelevantly transfected cells for specificity and finally confirmed by FACS analysis on the unfixed immunizing cells. The panel of candidates was subcloned two or three times each before extensive testing was performed on purified antibody derived from ascites. mAbs CTC2, CTC5, CTC8, CTC9, and CTC12 (PDL, Inc., Fremont, CA) were generated from BALB/c mice with CHO-CCR5 transfectants as immnogens using intraperitoneal injections every 2 weeks for 2 months; the first injection was performed with complete Freund's adjuvant. mAbs mCR35.4 and mCR40.3 (PDL, Inc.) were generated from AKR mice with NSO-CCR5 transfectants using footpad immunizations every 3 days for 21 days; the first injection was performed with Ribi adjuvant. Fusion was performed as described using spleen cells and lymph nodes from BALB/c and AKR mice, respectively. Screening was performed exclusively by FACS staining using the immunogen and the parental untransfected cells as positive and negative controls, respectively. More than 10,000 fusions were screened to generate about 20 clones, only a subset of which were further analyzed. mAb 2D7 is a previously characterized CCR5 antibody (14Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N.

For FACS analysis, all antibodies were serially titrated against a high expressing 293-CCR5 stable cell line (293-R5–7) and used at a concentration of at least 2-fold above saturating concentrations. Unless specified otherwise, 293T cells were transfected (via CaPO4 precipitation) with either wild-type CCR5 or the appropriate mutant/chimeric construct and allowed to express for 18 h. Prior to primary antibody staining, transfected cells were lifted off with 2 mm EDTA, washed once with PBS, and incubated with FACS staining buffer (PBS, 2.5% calf serum, 0.5% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Antibodies were added to a final concentration of 12.8 μg/ml, followed by secondary detection by affinity-purified phycoerythrin-conjugated horse anti-mouse antibody (1:100 dilution; Vector Laboratories). FACS analysis was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The mean channel fluorescence (MCF) was used to compare the levels of coreceptor expression. Results were normalized for the MCF obtained for a particular antibody against wild-type CCR5 (normalized as 100%) after subtraction of the background MCF obtained against pcDNA3-transfected cells (normalized as 0%). 293 and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 2 mmpenicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. 293-CCR5 stables were made by transfecting (via CaPO4 precipitation) 293 cells with pcDNA3-Zeo-CCR5 (a kind gift from Dennis Kolson) followed by 4 weeks of 0.3 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) selection. Foci that emerged after selection were plated together and the whole population subjected to FACS sorting for CCR5-positive cells using mAb 2D7. The highest expressing 5% of cells were sorted, expanded, and resorted by the same criteria to give high CCR5-expressing 293 cells. These cells are designated as 293-R5–7 cells. After 6 months of continual selection, these cells still gave a MCF value of >1000 on a background of <20 on the FL-2 channel when stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated 2D7 (PharMingen). Chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1β) were obtained from Preprotech. Recombinant vaccinia was used to produce soluble JRFL gp120. Briefly, recombinant vaccinia expressing soluble JRFL gp120 was used to infect 293T cells at 10 multiplicities of infection. Cells were exposed to virus for 4 h, washed twice with PBS, and replenished with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At 24 h after infection, the supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation at 500 × g, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and inactivated with 0.2% Triton X-100. The recombinant protein was purified by lectin chromatography using Galanthus nivalis lectin-coupled agarose beads. 125I-Labeled MIP-1β or RANTES was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Soluble JRFL gp120 produced as described above was iodinated using IODOGEN reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Chemokine and Env binding was performed in Hepes binding buffer (HBB: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) with 0.5% and 5% BSA, respectively. A final concentration of 0.25 nm radiolabeled agonist (∼70,000 cpm) was added to 0.5 × 105 293T cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-CCR5. Concentrations of radiolabeled Env added can vary depending on the specific activity of the Env preparation, but ∼100,000 cpm of Env was usually added per binding reaction. Binding was allowed to occur for 1 h at room temperature, and the radiolabeled agonist recovered on 25-mm GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) presoaked in 0.2% polyethyleneimine using a 10-well manual harvester following two washes with modified HBB (no BSA with 0.5 m NaCl). Filters were counted in a Wallac 1470 Wizard γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by the amount of counts recovered on the filter when no cells were used. Luciferase reporter viruses were prepared as described previously (37Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 36Chen B.K.

Target cells used were GHOST cells stably expressing CCR5 (D. R. Littman, NIH AIDS Reference and Reagent Program). Infections were performed in 24 wells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. At 4 days after infection, cells were lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and an appropriate aliquot analyzed for luciferase activity.

To more fully investigate CCR5 structure and function, we generated a panel of mAbs that could be used as immunological probes to identify regions of CCR5 important for Env and chemokine binding as well as for the induction of the conformational changes in Env that lead to membrane fusion. Since our previous attempts to generate anti-CCR5 antibodies by immunizing mice with peptides corresponding to CCR5 extracellular domains were disappointing, we immunized mice with cells stably expressing CCR5 in order to preserve the molecule's native conformation. CCR5-specific mAbs were identified by screening against CCR5-stable transfectants using the parental cell line as a negative control. Specificity was confirmed by testing the ability of each mAb to recognize cells expressing high levels of other chemokine receptors, including CCR2 to which CCR5 is most closely related (data not shown). A total of 18 mAbs to CCR5 were generated by this approach. To identify domains of CCR5 to which each mAb was directed, we expressed a panel of CCR5/CCR2 chimeras in 293T cells and examined mAb reactivity to each by FACS. We first examined receptor chimeras in which a single extracellular domain of CCR5 was placed into a CCR2 background to determine if any of the mAbs bound to epitopes contained within any single extracellular domain of CCR5. We found three general classes of mAb epitope specificities: 1) N-terminal (NH2) epitopes, 2) second extracellular loop (ECL2) epitopes, and 3) multidomain (MD) epitopes composed of more than one extracellular domain. For example, CTC5 was designated an NH2-antibody because it recognized the chimera 5222, while mCR35.4 was designated an ECL2- antibody because it recognized 2252 (Fig.1). Antibodies such as 45549 that did not recognize any single extracellular domain of CCR5 in the context of CCR2 (Fig. 1) were designated MD-antibodies (summarized in TableI). Interestingly, we did not find a single mAb that recognized ECL3 of CCR5 alone (2225), perhaps because the sequence of human CCR5 ECL3 is identical to that of the murine receptor. We confirmed that chimera 2225 was appropriately expressed on the cell surface, as determined by staining with a CCR2 mAb specific for the CCR2 N terminus (data not shown). However, we were unable to determine whether any of the mAbs recognized ECL1 alone because chimera 2522 was not well expressed (data not shown).Table ISummary of epitope specificities of selected anti-CCR5 mAbAntibodyEpitope specificityNH2ECL2MDCTC2+−−CTC5+−−CTC8+−−CTC9+−−CTC12+−−CTT14+−−45502+−−45519+−−ECL2-A ECL-2B45529−− +−45531−− +−mCR35.4−− +−mCR40.3−− +−2D7−+ −−45501+/−aMay have minimal recognition of CCR5 N terminus although N terminus is neither necessary (2555 is recognized) or sufficient for its epitope.+bConsidered a MD antibody even though it may posses moderate recognition of ECL2 alone (2252) because removal of ECL1 or mutations of particular residues in ECL1 impairs epitope recognition.+45517−−cConsidered a MD antibody because removal of ECL2 abrogates epitope recognition, but ECL2 alone (2252) is not sufficient for full epitope recognition.+45523+/−aMay have minimal recognition of CCR5 N terminus although N terminus is neither necessary (2555 is recognized) or sufficient for its epitope.+bConsidered a MD antibody even though it may posses moderate recognition of ECL2 alone (2252) because removal of ECL1 or mutations of particular residues in ECL1 impairs epitope recognition.+45533−−cConsidered a MD antibody because removal of ECL2 abrogates epitope recognition, but ECL2 alone (2252) is not sufficient for full epitope recognition.+45549−−cConsidered a MD antibody because removal of ECL2 abrogates epitope recognition, but ECL2 alone (2252) is not sufficient for full epitope recognition.+a May have minimal recognition of CCR5 N terminus although N terminus is neither necessary (2555 is recognized) or sufficient for its epitope.b Considered a MD antibody even though it may posses moderate recognition of ECL2 alone (2252) be"

Using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation and chemical cross-linking, we show here that Chinese hamster HSP27 is expressed in cells as homotypic multimers ranging from dimers up to 700-kDa oligomers. Treatments with arsenite, which induces phosphorylation on Ser15 and Ser90, provoked a major change in the size distribution of the complexes that shifted from oligomers to dimers. Ser90 phosphorylation was sufficient and necessary for causing this change in structure. Dimer formation was severely inhibited by replacing Ser90 with Ala90 but not by replacing Ser15 with Ala15. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, two domains were identified that were responsible for HSP27 intermolecular interactions. One domain was insensitive to phosphorylation and corresponded to the C-terminal α-crystallin domain. The other domain was sensitive to serine 90 phosphorylation and was located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Fusion of this N-terminal domain to firefly luciferase conferred luciferase with the capacity to form multimers that dissociated into monomers upon phosphorylation. A deletion within this domain of residues Arg5–Tyr23, which contains a WDPF motif found in most proteins of the small heat shock protein family, yielded a protein that forms only phosphorylation-insensitive dimers. We propose that HSP27 forms stable dimers through the α-crystallin domain. These dimers further multimerize through intermolecular interactions mediated by the phosphorylation-sensitive N-terminal domain.

The protein is phosphorylated on serine residues in a cascade of protein kinases involving MAPKAP kinase 2/3 and the stress-activated protein kinase SAPK2 (also called p38). The kinase cascade is activated, and HSP27 is phosphorylated in cells in response to chemical and physical stress such as heat shock, oxidative stress, or hyperosmotic stress and also in response to various physiological agonists involving serpentine, tyrosine kinase, or cytokine receptors (11Huot J.

It has been suggested that phosphorylation-induced changes in the ultrastructure may regulate the biochemical activities of HSP27. Two biochemical activities have been described for HSP27 in vitro. A first activity is restricted to monomeric HSP27. In solution, purified monomers behave as F-actin cap-binding proteins and inhibit actin polymerization (35Miron T. Wilchek M. Geiger B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only unphosphorylated HSP27 could block actin polymerization, hence providing a mechanism to explain the in vivo observations that phosphorylation of HSP27 during stress or growth factor stimulation regulates actin polymerization and modulates filament stability or reorganization (3Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar,9Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second activity has been described for the oligomeric HSP27 complex. In vitro, high molecular weight recombinant HSP27 complexes can absorb heat-denatured proteins on their surface, preventing their aggregation and keeping them in a folding-competent state. The subsequent action of other chaperone proteins such as HSP70 leads to the renaturation of the unfolded proteins. (39Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Although not yet directly demonstrated, the mechanism proposed for this activity as well as studies performed with other smHSP suggested that the chaperone activity is limited to the oligomeric complexes (39Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24646-24656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both the chaperone and actin modulation activities could explain the protective action of HSP27 in vivo. However, specific chaperone functions regulating the activity or the stability of specific target proteins may also contribute to the homeostatic functions of HSP27. For example, oligomeric HSP27 binds to activated protein kinase B, a protein that lies in a survival pathway during stress (42Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 44Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Monomers and dimers of HSP27 bind to granzyme A, a protease involved in granule-mediated cell lysis (45Beresford P.J. Jaju M. Friedman R.S. Yoon M.J. Lieberman J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a close relative of HSP27, MKBP, binds and modulates the activity of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (46Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu-i N. Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The role of HSP27 phosphorylation and multimeric state in modulating these interactions is unknown. In the present study, we studied the relationships between the phosphorylation and the oligomerization properties of HSP27. Chinese hamster HSP27 (HaHSP27) is phosphorylated on two serine residues, Ser15 and Ser90. We show here that phosphorylation on Ser90 is sufficient and necessary to cause HSP27 to shift from a 700-kDa multimeric structure to dimers. Two homotypic binding domains were identified in HSP27. A first one, located within residues 95–186 of HaHSP27 (87–178 in HuHSP27), mediates dimerization and is insensitive to phosphorylation. A second one includes a small conserved stretch in the extreme amino terminus and is destabilized by phosphorylation of Ser90. We show that the N-terminal domain of HSP27 is sufficient to confer firefly luciferase with a phosphorylation-sensitive multimerization capacity. pSVHa27WT codes for wild type HaHSP27. It contains the HaHSP27 sequences from pH8 (8Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inserted at the HindIII site of the vector pSVT7. Other HaHSP27 constructs were made from a derivative of pSVHa27WT, pSVHa27Mlu, in which a MluI restriction site was created by introducing a silent mutation in the third codon of HaHSP27. pSVHa27AA, pSVHa27EE, pSVHa27SA, pSVHa27AS, pSVHa27AE, and pSVHa27EA express phosphorylation site mutants of HaHSP27, the last two letters in the names corresponding to the replacement amino acid residues at position 15 and 90, respectively. Mutations were introduced in pSVHa27Mlu by polymerase chain reaction using specific synthetic oligonucleotide primers replacing the serine codon AGC by the alanine codon GCC or the glutamate codon GAA. pSVHa27Δ5–23 was prepared by deleting the fragmentMluI–KpnI in pSVHa27Mlu, yielding a protein lacking residues 5–23. pCMVHa5–109.Luc expresses a fusion protein made from residues 5–109 of HaHSP27 and the cytoplasmic firefly luciferase (L550V conversion in the peroxisomal localization signal; Ref. 47Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The expression construct was made in two steps. First, aPvuII–SalI–MluI–BglII polylinker was added at the HindIII–XhoI site of the vector pCMVnlsLL/V (47Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Konings A.W. Kampinga H.H. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), thereby removing the NLS site. This new vector named pCMVLuc yields the expression of a cytoplasmic luciferase with 12 amino acids added at the N terminus. Then, the fragment MluI–HincII from pSVHa27Mlu was inserted at the SalI–BglII restriction sites of pCMVLuc, resulting in a final expression construct coding for the fusion protein Met-Asn-Ser-Try(HaHSP27)5–109-Leu-Leu-Glu-Asn-(luciferase)4–549-Val. CCL39 and NIH3T3 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.2 g/liter NaHCO3 and 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum or 10% calf serum, respectively. NIH3T3 cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a concentration of 5000–16,000 cells/cm2 in a 75-cm2 culture flask. Transfection by calcium phosphate precipitation was done as described before using 10 μg of plasmid/flask (2Landry J. Chrétien P. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). 50 μm chloroquine was added for the first 5 h of transfection. The cells were used 48–72 h after transfection. When indicated, the cells were then treated for 2 h with 200 μm arsenite to induce phosphorylation of the expressed proteins. After treatment, the cells were lysed by brief sonication in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 3.33% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used directly for glycerol gradient centrifugation or glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The cell lysates (0.5 ml) were loaded on top of a 12.6-ml linear gradient of glycerol (10–40%) made in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The tubes were centrifuged for 18 h at 30000 rpm in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 4 ° C. The gradient were fractionated in 44 fractions. Aliquots were diluted in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS) and dot-blotted on nitrocellulose membrane. HSP27 was revealed by immunoblotting using an antibody against the HaHSP27 C-terminal AGKSEQSGAK peptide (3Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with a 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Detection and quantification were done using a Storm imaging system from Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Varying amounts of supernatant were also analyzed to confirm the linearity of the detection method. Luciferase was revealed from its activity. Aliquots (10 μl) of each fraction were diluted in 300 μl of 25 mm glycyl/glycine buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured in a Berthold Lumat 9501 luminometer for 30 s after the addition 100 μl of the substrate d-luciferin (50 μmfinal concentration). The gradient was calibrated from the positions of known protein complexes. The positions of the 20 S (700 kDa) and 15 S (340 kDa) proteasomes were determined by Western blot using an anti-HC8 antibody and confirmed by pore exclusion electrophoresis on native gel (48Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The position of the 62-kDa firefly luciferase (produced in NIH3T3 cells transfected with pRSVLL/V (49de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

The position of p38/stress-activated protein kinase 2 (38 kDa) was determined using an antibody against the C-terminal sequence PPLQEEMES of murine p38 (19Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were mixed with one volume of 0–0.8% glutaraldehyde in water. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding one volume of 1 m TRIS-HCl containing 10% SDS and 10 mmEDTA. Aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 3–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Crossed-linked HSP27 species were detected by immunoblotting with antibody to HSP27. Two-hybrid assays were performed essentially as described in the CLONTECHMatchmaker Library user manual. Full-length Chinese hamster or human HSP27 cDNAs were cloned in the pBTM116 (TRP1) vector to produce the bait fusion protein LexA-HaHSP27 or LexA-HuHSP27 (50Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practival Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The LexA-HaHSP27 construct was used to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library constructed at the EcoRI–XhoI site of the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pGADGH (LEU2) (CLONTECH). The LexA-HuHSP27 protein was used to screen a human kidney cDNA library constructed at theEcoRI site of the GAL4 activation domain plasmid pGAD10 (LEU2) (CLONTECH). Screening was performed by sequential transformation of bait and library vectors in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) (50Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practival Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar, 51Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Colonies that arose on Trp−/Leu−/His−-selective plates were replica-plated, and one set was transferred to filter disks (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) lysed by freezing, and tested for β-galactosidase expression by incubation at 30 °C with 0.1m NaPO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, pH 7.0. LEU2 plasmids were isolated from the blue colonies and retested by co-transfection with Ras(V12) or lamin C fused to LexA to eliminate false positive clones (52Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Inserts from the pGADGH or pGAD10 plasmids of the remaining true positive clones were sequenced to identify sequences of proteins belonging to members of the smHSP family (HSP27 and αA- and αB-crystallin). Further two-hybrid assays were performed between pairs of GAL4 activation domain and LexA binding domain plasmids. GAL4 plasmids containing full-length HuHSP27, αA- and αB-crystallin cDNA, and N-terminal deletion mutants of HuHSP27 and αB-crystallin were as obtained from the screenings described above. LexA plasmids were constructed by recloning the insert of the GAL4 plasmids into pBMT116. Additional GAL4 and LexA C-terminal deletion mutants of HuHSP27 and αB-crystallin were obtained after digesting their corresponding full-length cDNA with HincII (yielding HuHSP27-(1–101) and αB-crystallin-(1–77)) and recloning in pBTM116 and pGADGH. All DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Interactions were determined by co-transfecting the pBTM116 and pGADGH or pGAD10 constructs in pairs in L40. Positive interactions were determined by the ability of the transformed yeast to grow on Trp−/Leu−/His− media and for their capacity to express β-galactosidase (blue colonies) within 5 h. CCL39 cell extracts were fractionated by ultracentrifugation on glycerol gradient, and each fraction was analyzed for the presence of HSP27 by immunoblotting. HSP27 sedimented as complexes of heterogeneous sizes distributed between the top of the gradient and fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of about 700 kDa (Fig. 1 A). To better assess the nature of the HSP27 complex, increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde was added to the cell extracts, and the cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and HSP27 immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). With increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde, HSP27 was cross-linked progressively in species showing a uniform ladder distribution of sizes with apparent molecular masses in multiples of 28 ± 1 kDa (determined by linear regression analysis of the position of the cross-linked products). These data indicate that no other proteins were associated stoichiometrically with HSP27 and, thus, that in situ the HSP27 complex is mainly a homopolymer. Some 700-kDa species, dimers, and monomers resisted cross-linking even at the highest concentration of glutaraldehyde. At this concentration, glutaraldehyde started to produce a general cross-linking of all proteins as revealed from the fainting of all protein bands on the Coomassie-stained gel (data not shown). These properties agreed with the sedimentation profile data and suggested that HSP27 was expressed in cells as large polymers of about 700 kDa in equilibrium with smaller species, mainly monomers and dimers. HaHSP27 is phosphorylated on Ser15 and Ser90 by MAPKAP kinase 2, a serine kinase activated by the stress sensitive SAPK2/p38 kinase (20Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 22Huot J. Lambert H. Lavoie J.N. Guimond A. Houle F. Landry J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To analyze changes in the size distribution of HSP27 upon phosphorylation, CCL39 cells were exposed to arsenite for 2 h before extraction. Such treatment induced almost complete phosphorylation of HSP27 (data not shown) and a dramatic change in the size distribution profile of HSP27. After treatment, essentially all HSP27 was recovered in the first few fractions at the top of the glycerol gradient, between stress-activated protein kinase 2 (38 kDa) and firefly luciferase (62 kDa), and most of it could not be cross-linked in larger species than dimers (Fig. 1). To confirm that phosphorylation was directly involved in modulating the supramolecular organization of HSP27, phosphorylation mutants of HaHSP27 were prepared by replacing Ser15 and Ser90 with alanine to mimic nonphosphorylatable serine residues (HaHSP27-AA) or with glutamate to mimic constitutively phosphorylated residues (HaHSP27-EE). These constructs were expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, and their size distribution was investigated as above. NIH 3T3 cells were chosen as recipient cells because they express negligible amounts of endogenous HSP27. As expected, HaHSP27-AA had a sedimentation profile and cross-linking pattern similar to those obtained with wild type HSP27 in untreated cells (Fig.2) but did not shift to smaller sizes upon treatments that induce phosphorylation (not shown). In contrast, HaHSP27-EE was found almost exclusively as dimers and monomers in both control (Fig. 2) and treated cells (not shown). The relative importance of each site of phosphorylation was investigated by expressing single site mutants. HaHSP27, in which serine 15 was changed for alanine (HaHSP27-AS), behaved as the wild type protein (Fig.3, B versus A). It distributed mainly as large multimers in control cells. After stress, it was found essentially as dimers and monomers (Fig. 3 B). The data indicated that phosphorylation of serine 90 was sufficient and that phosphorylation of serine 15 was not required to cause the ultrastructural changes in HaHSP27. In contrast, HaHSP27 in which serine 90 was converted to alanine (HaHSP27-SA) had a normal size distribution in control cells and did not produce dimers or monomers after phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). This indicated that phosphorylation of serine 15 was not sufficient and that phosphorylation of serine 90 was necessary for the production of small molecular weight species. The results were confirmed by analyzing HaHSP27-EA and HaHSP27-AE double mutants. As expected, HaHSP27-EA was found mostly in large oligomeric complexes, whereas HaHSP27-AE was mostly found at the top of the gradient (Fig. 3 D). We reproducibly observed that phosphorylated HaHSP27-SA and HaHSP27-EA yielded a peak slightly smaller than control HSP27. There is therefore a possibility that phosphorylation of serine 15 might affect the stability of the very high molecular weight species, causing a size shift in the 500–800-kDa range.Figure 3Size distribution of individual phosphorylation site mutants of HSP27. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with pSVHa27WT (A), pSVHa27AS (B), pSVHa27SA (C), pSVHa27EA (▪ in D) or pSVHa27AE (■ in D) and treated (●) or not (▪, ■) with 200 μm arsenite for 2 h.

https://openalex.org/W2007419421,"S-Nitrosylation of protein thiol groups by nitric oxide (NO) is a widely recognized protein modification. In this study we show that nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (BF4NO), a NO+ donor, modified the thiol groups of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) byS-nitrosylation and caused enzyme inhibition. The resultant protein-S-nitrosothiol was found to be unstable and to decompose spontaneously, thereby restoring enzyme activity. In contrast, the NO-releasing compound S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) promoted S-glutathionylation of a thiol group of GAPDH both in vitro and under cellular conditions. The GSH-mixed protein disulfide formed led to a permanent enzyme inhibition, but upon dithiothreitol addition a functional active GAPDH was recovered. This S-glutathionylation is specific for GSNO because GSH itself was unable to produce protein-mixed disulfides. During cellular nitrosative stress, the production of intracellular GSNO might channel signaling responses to form protein-mixed disulfide that can regulate intracellular function."
https://openalex.org/W2049022764,"The mutation in the Z deficiency variant of alpha1-antitrypsin perturbs the structure of the protein to allow a unique intermolecular linkage. These loop-sheet polymers are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes to form inclusions that are associated with neonatal hepatitis, juvenile cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The process of polymer formation has been investigated here by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, circular dichroic spectra and extrinsic fluorescence with 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid and tetramethylrhodamine-5-iodoacetamide. These biophysical techniques have demonstrated that alpha1-antitrypsin polymerization is a two-stage process and have allowed the calculation of rates for both of these steps. The initial fast phase is unimolecular and likely to represent temperature-induced protein unfolding, while the slow phase is bimolecular and associated with loop-sheet interaction and polymer formation. The naturally occurring Z, S, and I variants and recombinant site-directed reactive loop and shutter domain mutants of alpha1-antitrypsin were used to demonstrate the close association between protein stability and rate of alpha1-antitrypsin polymerization. Taken together, these data allow us to propose a kinetic mechanism for alpha1-antitrypsin polymer formation that involves the generation of an unstable intermediate, which can form polymers or generate latent protein."
https://openalex.org/W2066569500,"Serine/threonine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) has been implicated as a negative regulator of insulin signaling. Prior studies have indicated that this negative regulation by protein kinase C involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation of serine 612 in IRS-1. In the present studies, the negative regulation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was compared with that induced by endothelin-1, an activator of protein kinase C. In contrast to endothelin-1, the inhibitory effects of PDGF did not require mitogen-activated protein kinase or the phosphorylation of serine 612. Instead, three other serines in the phosphorylation domain of IRS-1 (serines 632, 662, and 731) were required for the negative regulation by PDGF. In addition, the PDGF-activated serine/threonine kinase called Akt was found to inhibit insulin signaling. Moreover, this inhibition required the same IRS-1 serine residues as the inhibition by PDGF. Finally, the negative regulatory effects of PDGF and Akt were inhibited by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), one of the downstream targets of Akt. These studies implicate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase cascade as an additional negative regulatory pathway for the insulin signaling cascade.

Src homology mammalian target of rapamycin insulin receptor substrate mitogen-activated protein platelet-derived growth factor FKBP-rapamycin-associate protein phosphatidylinositol hydroxytamoxifen hemagglutinin polymerase chain reaction After insulin binds to its receptor, it activates an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of endogenous substrates including insulin receptor substrates 1–4 (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of these tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates to the Src homology (SH)1 domain-2 of the regulatory subunit of the heterodimeric p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase leads to a 3–5-fold stimulation in its enzymatic activity and an increase in the PI 3,4-bisphosphate and 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the cell (2Rordorf-Nikolic T.

A variety of data from several approaches has demonstrated a role for the production of these lipid products in mediating many, if not all, of the subsequent actions of insulin including for example the stimulation of glucose uptake, activation of both the glycogen synthase and the 70-kDa S6 kinase (4Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The effects of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate may in part be mediated through the activation of the Ser/Thr kinases called Akt or one of the atypical protein kinase Cs (4Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 5Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

Because of the critical role of the activation of this lipid kinase in inducing subsequent biological responses, increasing interest has focused on the regulation of this process. Indeed, several mechanisms for regulating this process have been identified. First, long term treatment of cells with insulin or the glucocorticoid dexamethasone has been shown to induce the degradation of IRS-1 (6Turnbow M.A. Keller S.R. Rice K.M. Garner C.W. J. Biol.

Commun. 1993; 190: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been observed after treatment of cells with either activators of protein kinase C, Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors like okadaic acid, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, angiotensin II, or activation of cellular stress pathways by tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines (8Tanti J.-F.

In addition, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been shown to interfere with the ability of the IRS-1 to interact with the insulin receptor (16Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Karasik A. Elhanany E. Kanety H. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In the case of cells treated with an activator of protein kinase C, an increase in the serine phosphorylation of a particular serine, serine 612, in the IRS-1 molecule was found to play a prominent role in this inhibition (12DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 12939-12947Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This residue appeared to be phosphorylated by one of the MAP kinases (also called extracellular signal-regulated kinases), and an increase in MAP kinase activity was shown to inhibit subsequent signaling by the insulin receptor kinase (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, as noted above, a number of other stimuli also appear to negatively regulate the ability of the insulin receptor to tyrosine-phosphorylate IRS-1 by serine phosphorylation. In particular, PDGF has recently been shown to stimulate the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and to inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PI 3-kinase (14Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since PDGF can activate multiple signaling pathways including the MAP kinase cascade (18Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar), the present studies were therefore designed to examine whether PDGF was affecting IRS-1 via the same pathway as was observed after PKC activation. In particular, we have tested whether the negative regulation of insulin signaling by PDGF was also mediated via MAP kinase and the phosphorylation of Ser-612 in the IRS-1 molecule. We have found that treatment of cells with PDGF inhibits the insulin signaling pathway via a distinct mechanism, possibly by activation of a serine kinase modulated by the Akt pathway, which appears to require the serine phosphorylation of distinct residues on the IRS-1 molecule. In contrast, we find that endothelin-1, an activator of PKC (19Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Anderson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits the insulin signaling pathway via the MAP kinase pathway and the serine phosphorylation of Ser-612 in IRS-1. These results indicate that there are MAP kinase-dependent and -independent pathways that regulate the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase. A Myc-tagged wild type IRS-1 was obtained by PCR using pCLDN/IRS-1 as the template and the same primers described previously (12DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 12939-12947Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The SalI-digested PCR product was subcloned into the retroviral vector pWZL-neo (20Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J.

The single mutants of IRS-1 were generated by using either the Transformation-based mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH or a PCR-based strategy. In order to make the triple mutant of IRS-1 (S632A/S662A/S731A), two initial PCR reactions were performed using puc18/IRS-1/S632A and puc18/IRS-1/S731A as templates. One set of primers consisted of a 5′-flanking primer and a 3′-internal S662A mutagenesis primer; the other set consisted of a 5′-internal S662A mutagenesis primer and a 3′-flanking primer. Both PCR products were combined in a final PCR reaction with only the flanking 5′ and 3′ primers. This amplified fragment was then subcloned into the pWZL-neo vector. The quadruple IRS-1 mutant (S612A/S632A/S662A/S731A) was made by introducing S612A single mutation into the IRS-1 triple mutant. The sequence of the constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were infected with the pWZL-expressing IRS-1 constructs as described previously (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In brief, 70% confluent Phoenix packaging cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). After the final media change, the cells were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C, 5% CO2, to generate the viral supernatant. Fifty percent confluent 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with the viral supernatant, centrifuged for 90 min at 2,500 rpm, and then cultured until confluent. Cells were selected in complete media containing 1 mg/ml G418. The total pool of selected cells was used in all subsequent experiments. In the case of the IRS-1 pWZL infections of the 3T3-L1 cells expressing MER-Akt (21Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C.

In most experiments, the cells were utilized when they became confluent. In the indicated experiments, cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were serum-starved overnight before performing each experiment. PDGF (the B/B isoform, from Boehringer Mannheim), endothelin-1 (Sigma), and PD98059 and rapamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added as described in the figure legends. The Akt kinase assay of the expressed HA-tagged MER-Akt was performed after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies and using the GSK-3 peptide (sequence GRPRTSSFAEG) as substrate as described (21Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

The phosphorylated peptide was separated on a 40% urea gel, and the identified peptide band was cut out and counted. IRS-associated PI 3-kinase was assayed after immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with control antibodies, anti-Myc antibodies (BabCo), anti-IRS-1 antibodies (1D6), or anti-IRS-2 antibodies. The precipitates were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity as described (12DeFea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 12939-12947Crossref Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or visualized by immunoblotting with an antibody to the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase (Transduction Laboratories). Confluent cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaPPi, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were incubated with either anti-Myc antibodies or normal mouse Ig prebound to protein G-agarose (Pharmacia), washed twice each with lysis buffer and a low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were developed with either anti-IRS-1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Measurements of the formation of phospho-MAP kinase were performed by immunoblotting total cell lysates with antibodies specific to the activated phospho-MAP kinase (Promega). As recently reported (14Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar), PDGF treatment of 3T3-L1 cells rapidly inhibited the subsequent ability of insulin to stimulate the association of an expressed Myc-tagged IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase by about 80% (Fig.1 B). To test whether this inhibition was mediated via MAP kinase, we utilized the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (22Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). This compound had no significant effect on the inhibitory response induced by PDGF (Fig. 1 B). A control Western blot verified that in these cells PDGF was stimulating the formation of the activated, phosphorylated MAP kinase and this stimulation was completely inhibited by the MEK-inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig.1 A). Since prior studies have indicated that endothelin-1, an activator of the PKC and the MAP kinase pathways (19Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Anderson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could also induce insulin resistance in rat adipocytes (23Chou Y.C. Perng J.C. Huan C.C. Jang S.Y. Kwok C.F. Chen W.L. Fong J.C. Ho L.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we tested whether this hormone would inhibit the insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase. Endothelin-1 was found to inhibit by 50% the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase in the 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1 C). However, in contrast to the results with PDGF, this endothelin-1 response was completely blocked by the MEK-inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 1 C). These results indicated that the inhibition observed with PDGF is unlikely to be due to MAP kinase. The other major signaling pathway stimulated by PDGF is the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR kinase pathway (18Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies had shown that the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked the PDGF-induced inhibition of the insulin response (14Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To see if the downstream members of this pathway were also involved, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (also called FRAP), was tested for its effect (24Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rapamycin was found to largely block the ability of PDGF to inhibit the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1). These results are consistent with a role for the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway being involved in the PDGF inhibition of the insulin signaling cascade and suggest that different signaling cascades are utilized by PDGF and endothelin to inhibit the subsequent ability of insulin to stimulate a response. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, to block the PDGF and endothelin-1 effects. To accomplish this, we measured the ability of wortmannin to affect the ability of PDGF and endothelin to inhibit the insulin-induced association of IRS-1 with the PI 3-kinase. In agreement with the above studies, both PDGF and endothelin inhibited the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase, with PDGF being more potent then endothelin-1 (Fig. 1 D). Wortmannin blocked the effect of PDGF but had no significant effect on the inhibition observed with endothelin-1 (Fig. 1 D). Controls verified that the amount of IRS-1 precipitated in each case was the same. These results support the hypothesis that the ability of PDGF to interfere with the insulin pathway utilizes the PI 3-kinase cascade whereas the endothelin-1 effect is via a distinct pathway. 3T3-L1 cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding Myc-tagged wild type IRS-1 molecules or various mutant IRS-1 molecules in which particular serine residues have been changed to alanine. In particular, mutant IRS-1 molecules were expressed in which either serine 612 (S612A), serines 632, 662, and 731 (S632A/S662A/S731A), or serines 612, 632, 662, and 731 (S612A/S631A/S662A/S731A) were changed to alanine. In each case, expression of the mutant molecules was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies to the Myc epitope and insulin was found to stimulate their tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2and data not shown). The levels of expressed IRS-1 were comparable to those of the endogenous IRS-1, as demonstrated by the approximate 2-fold increase in immunoreactive IRS-1 observed in the blots of total lysates of infected cells in comparison to the control cells (Fig. 2). Of most interest was the finding that, although PDGF inhibited the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the wild type expressed IRS-1, it did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the quadruple IRS-1 mutant (S612A/S631A/S662A/S731A) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, PDGF did not inhibit the subsequent insulin-stimulated association of the quadruple mutant of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3 A). To verify that these transfected cells were still responsive to PDGF, the supernatants from the anti-IRS-1 precipitates were adsorbed with antibodies to IRS-2. The insulin-stimulated association of IRS-2 with the PI 3-kinase was inhibited by PDGF in the cells expressing both the wild type IRS-1 as well as the quadruple IRS-1 mutant (Fig.3 B), indicating that the cells expressing the mutant IRS-1 had not lost their PDGF responsiveness.Figure 3Effect of PDGF on the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase and the quadruple mutant (quad mut) IRS-1. 3T3-L1 cells expressing either the wild type or quadruple mutant IRS-1 were pretreated with or without 50 ng/ml PDGF for 20 min, then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min and lysed, and the Myc-tagged IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated and tested for its associated PI 3-kinase activity (A). The supernatants from these precipitations were adsorbed with anti-IRS-2 antibodies, and the amount of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity was then analyzed (B). To directly measure the amount of associated PI 3-kinase, the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (C). The panels shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The quadruple mutation in the IRS-1 molecule could affect the activation of the PI 3-kinase independently of its association. To test this possibility, we also directly examined the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase with the wild type and quadruple mutant IRS-1 molecules. As observed for the PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity, the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase with the wild type IRS-1 was inhibited by PDGF whereas the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase with the quadruple mutant IRS-1 was not affected by PDGF (Fig. 3 C). To further characterize the role of particular serines in the ability of PDGF to regulate the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase with the mutant IRS-1 molecules, cells expressing the single, triple, or quadruple mutation were examined. PDGF treatment was found to inhibit the insulin-stimulated association of the single mutant IRS-1 (S612A) with PI 3-kinase by about 80%, a level comparable to that observed with the wild type IRS-1 (Fig.4). In contrast, the endothelin-1 inhibition of the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase was essentially abolished with the same single mutation (data not shown). However, the mutation of three other serines (Ser-631, Ser-662, and Ser-731) dramatically reduced the inhibition with PDGF treatment (Fig. 4). Since PDGF can stimulate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway as well as the MAP kinase cascade (18Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether Akt could also modulate the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase. 3T3-L1 cells expressing a hydroxytamoxifen-regulatable form of Akt (called MER-Akt) (21Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were stimulated with insulin either with or without a prior treatment with hydroxytamoxifen and lysed, and the amount of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase was measured. Treatment of cells expressing the MER-Akt with hydroxytamoxifen caused a 75% inhibition in the insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase (Fig. 5). In contrast, no significant inhibition was observed in the control 3T3-L1 cells, which do not express MER-Akt after a prior pretreatment with hydroxytamoxifen. The inhibition in the MER-Akt-expressing cells was dependent upon the dose of hydroxytamoxifen used to stimulate the cells and paralleled the increase in Akt activity in these cells (Fig.6).Figure 6Dose-dependent activation of MER-Akt and its inhibition of the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase. A, IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. 3T3-L1-expressing MER-Akt cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of HT for 4 h and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 5 min as indicated. The cells were lysed, and the IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was analyzed as described above. B, activation of Akt. 3T3-L1 cells were treated as in A, lysed, and the MER-Akt was precipitated and assayed for enzymatic activity by utilizing a GSK-3-based peptide. A representative autoradiograph of the phosphorylation of the peptide is shown as well as the mean -fold activations ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the inhibition observed via Akt activation was mediated via the mTOR pathway, we utilized the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. As was observed for PDGF inhibition, rapamycin significantly blocked the inhibitory response observed with Akt activation (Fig.7 A). Since the PDGF inhibition of the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase and IRS-1 was dependent upon the presence of specific serine residues in the phosphorylation domain (Fig. 4), we tested whether a similar requirement was also present for the inhibition via Akt. To this end, the quadruple IRS-1 mutant (S612A/S632A/S662A/S731A) as well as the epitope-tagged wild type IRS-1 were expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells containing the MER-Akt. These cells were stimulated with insulin either with or without a prior activation of the MER-Akt and lysed, and the amount of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase was measured. The activation of the MER-Akt was found to inhibit the insulin-stimulated association of PI 3-kinase with the wild type expressed IRS-1 but not with the expressed quadruple IRS-1 mutant (Fig. 7 B). Prior studies have demonstrated that increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 can be stimulated by a number of factors including activators of protein kinase C, Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitors like okadaic acid, PDGF, insulin, or activation of cellular stress pathways by tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines (8Tanti J.-F.

This serine phosphorylation may be a contributing factor in the development of insulin resistance since an increase in serine phosphorylation interferes with the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor and its subsequent association with PI 3-kinase. Thus, it is important to identify the kinase cascades responsible for the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Prior studies have identified several kinases that can phosphorylate IRS-1. These include casein kinase II (25Tanasijevic M.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18157-18166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (26Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), MAP kinase (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and even a lipid kinase, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (27Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Li P.M. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of MAP kinase, a particular serine (serine 612) has been identified in the IRS-1 molecule as being responsible for causing the subsequent inhibition of insulin-stimulated association with PI 3-kinase (17De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this prior work, the MAP kinase was activated by phorbol esters, a potent but non-physiological activator of protein kinase C. In the present work, endothelin-1, a normal regulator of protein kinase C (19Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Anderson M.B. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also found to inhibit the ability of insulin to stimulate the IRS-1 association with PI 3-kinase. This inhibition also appeared to be mediated via the activation of MAP kinase since the MEK inhibitor PD98059 completely blocked the response to endothelin-1. Moreover, this inhibition required the phosphorylation of Ser-612 since endothelin-1 did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated association of a Ser-612 mutant of IRS-1 with the PI 3-kinase (data not shown). Since endothelin-1 can inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in vivo as well asin vitro (23Chou Y.C. Perng J.C. Huan C.C. Jang S.Y. Kwok C.F. Chen W.L. Fong J.C. Ho L.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Juan C.C. Fang V.S. Huang Y.J. Kwok C.F. Hsu Y.P. Ho L.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 23: 694-699Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the levels of endothelin-1 are elevated in obesity and diabetes mellitus (30Sarman B. Toth M. Somogyi A. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Ferri C. Bellini C. Desideri G. Baldoncini R. Properzi G. Santucci A. DeMattia G. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1997; 105: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), this pathway may contribute to insulin resistance in these conditions. In the present studies, we have also examined the pathway that is involved in the PDGF-induced negative regulation of the insulin signaling cascade. Although PDGF did induce the activation of MAP kinase in the 3T3-L1 cells, this pathway did not appear to be required for the negative regulation of the insulin signaling cascade. In contrast to the results with endothelin-1, the MEK inhibitor had essentially no effect on the PDGF-induced inhibition in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase, although it completely inhibited the ability of PDGF to stimulate MAP kinase in these cells. This finding of a lack of inhibition by the MEK inhibitor of the PDGF response was also recently reported by Staubs et al. (15Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PDGF is most likely regulating the insulin-induced increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase by a pathway independent of the MAP kinase cascade. Further evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by the finding that the IRS-1 mutant lacking Ser-612 is still negatively regulated by PDGF. However, a mutant IRS-1 lacking three other serines in the same domain (Ser-632, -662, and -731) was found to lose its ability to be negatively regulated by PDGF treatment of cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the negative regulation occurs via the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1; however, the sites required for this effect appear to differ from that required for the negative regulation by MAP kinase. In addition to activating the MAP kinase cascade, PDGF also stimulates the PI 3-kinase/Akt/70-kDa S6 kinase cascade in cells (18Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown that the activation of the PI 3-kinase is important in mediating the negative regulation of the insulin response (14Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19814-19818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Staubs P.A. Nelson J.G. Reichart D.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prior work, wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase, did block the PDGF inhibitory effect on the insulin-stimulated association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase. However, wortmannin had no effect on the endothelin response, further indicating that these two hormones exert their effects through distinct signaling cascades. To determine whether molecules further downstream in this kinase cascade could also induce a negative regulation of the insulin-signaling pathway, we have utilized a conditionally active form of Akt (21Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This kinase can be turned on independently of other signals by treatment of cells with the estrogen antagonist, hydroxytamoxifen. Activation of this chimeric Akt by treatment of cells with hydroxytamoxifen was found to inhibit the insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase. Control experiments verified that no significant inhibition was induced by hydroxytamoxifen in cells not expressing this chimeric Akt. The inhibition induced by hydroxytamoxifen in MER-Akt-expressing cells paralleled the increase in Akt enzymatic activity of this chimera. This inhibition by Akt also appeared to require the same serines as those required for the negative regulation by PDGF since activation of Akt did not inhibit the insulin-induced association of PI 3-kinase and a mutant IRS-1 lacking these serines. The finding that Akt can negatively regulate the insulin-induced increase in IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase is important since it suggests that, during the insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, there is also a feedback inhibition. This would also explain the insulin resistance that occurs during periods of hyperinsulinemia (32Olefsky J.M. Nolan J.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1995; 61: 980S-986SCrossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Finally, it would explain the decrease in insulin-stimulated biological responses that is observed in cells overexpressing various Akt constructs (21Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 33Scott P.H.

One explanation of these results is that PDGF activates Akt and Akt itself directly phosphorylates IRS-1, thereby inhibiting its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with PI 3-kinase. However, the sites identified as the important regulatory ones (serines 612, 632, 662, and 731) do not fit the consensus Akt phosphorylation site (34Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that a kinase activated by Akt is responsible for this phosphorylation. One such candidate is the enzyme called the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, or FRAP (24Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of this enzyme has been shown to be regulated by Akt, insulin, and PDGF (33Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 35Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In addition, the sites phosphorylated by this enzyme in one of its substrates, PHAS-I (for properties of heat and acid stability-I), are similar to the regulatory sites identified in IRS-1 in that both have a (Ser/Thr)-Pro motif (36Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally, the finding that rapamycin at least partly inhibits the negative regulation by both PDGF and Akt is consistent with this hypothesis.

Enforced CCT expression accelerated the rate of PtdCho synthesis. However, the amount of cellular PtdCho did not increase as a result of the turnover of both the choline and glycerol components of PtdCho. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated that cells compensated for elevated CCT activity by the degradation of PtdCho to glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Phospholipase D-mediated PtdCho hydrolysis and phosphocholine formation were unaffected. Most of the GPC produced in response to excess phospholipid production was secreted into the medium. Cells also degraded the excess membrane PtdCho to GPC when phospholipid formation was increased by exposure to exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine or lysophosphatidylethanolamine. The replacement of the acyl moiety at the 1-position of PtdCho with a non-hydrolyzable alkyl moiety prevented degradation to GPC. Accumulation of alkylacyl-PtdCho was associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation, demonstrating that alternative pathways of degradation will not substitute. GPC formation was blocked by bromoenol lactone, implicating the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 as a key participant in the response to excess phospholipid. Owing to the fact that PtdCho is biosynthetically converted to PtdEtn, excess PtdCho resulted in overproduction and exit of GPE as well as GPC. Thus, general membrane phospholipid homeostasis is achieved by a balance between the opposing activities of CCT and phospholipase A2.

Biol. 1989; 9: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), although the activation of Cho kinase also makes a significant contribution to the PCho pool (12Ratnam S. Kent C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Another example of balanced PtdCho synthesis and degradation was found during the G1 stage of the cell cycle (19Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdCho synthesis increased in G1; however, the total phospholipid mass was maintained as a result of a concomitant increase in PtdCho degradation.Taken together, these experiments suggest the existence of a system that coordinates PtdCho biosynthesis and degradation to maintain a constant membrane phospholipid content. The goals of this study were to determine if the coupling between CCT activity and PtdCho turnover is a manifestation of a general mechanism for phospholipid homeostasis and to investigate the phospholipase(s) responsible for regulated PtdCho degradation.DISCUSSIONA large body of work has identified CCT as a key regulator of PtdCho synthesis. Both the positive and negative regulation of CCT activity by lipid modulators and phosphorylation exert control over phospholipid formation (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Cornell R.B. Gross R.W. Advances in Lipobiology. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 1-38Google Scholar, 6Yang W. Boggs K.P. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, regulation of biosynthesis at the CCT step is not the only mechanism to control PtdCho content. Enforced expression of CCTα significantly accelerates PtdCho biosynthesis, but does not increase cellular phospholipid content (9Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). This is surprising when one considers that PtdCho constitutes 72% of the phospholipid in HeLa cells (data not shown). Another method to deregulate PtdCho synthesis is to overload cells with exogenous LPC. LPC is a potent inhibitor of CCT but circumvents thede novo PtdCho biosynthetic pathway by being directly acylated to form PtdCho (3Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7757-7764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cells balance increased PtdCho production with an increased rate of phospholipid degradation to GPC, thereby maintaining the size of the PtdCho pool. The exit and accumulation of GPC in the culture medium suggests that the glycerol and choline moieties of PtdCho are not readily reutilized during exponential growth of cultured cells.The perturbation of cell physiology with enforced CCT expression and overloading with exogenous LPC reveals the regulated deacylation of PtdCho to GPC as a key process in membrane phospholipid homeostasis. PtdCho is the predominant membrane phospholipid and the precursor to the other two major phospholipids, sphingomyelin (31Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and PtdEtn (32Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), in cultured animal cells. The metabolic interconnection between the major phospholipids means that the synthesis and degradation of PtdEtn (and likely sphingomyelin) reflects that of PtdCho. Overloading the PtdCho pool with exogenous lysoPAF (a molecular species of LPC) also increases the PtdEtn pool as alkylacyl-PtdCho is converted to alkylacyl-PtdEtn (Fig. 9 B). Excess PtdCho can lead not only to stimulated GPC production but also to excess PtdEtn, and this is reflected by the increased production of GPE (Fig. 8 B). Conversely, the stimulated production of GPC in response to overloading cells with LPE (Fig. 8 A) can be explained if PtdCho accumulates as a result of a block in its conversion to PtdEtn. Cells maintain a specific profile of phospholipids when PtdCho synthesis is accelerated (data not shown) by degrading PtdEtn to GPE in addition to degrading PtdCho to GPC. Cells also maintain a specific phospholipid profile when PtdCho synthesis is inhibited by antineoplastic ether lipids such as ET-18-OCH3 (5Boggs K.P. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The data reveal the general nature of the cellular response to excess phospholipid and suggest that the maintenance of the PtdCho pool is synonymous with the preservation of total membrane phospholipid content and composition in cultured cells. The rapid and virtually complete uptake of exogenous phospholipid (Fig. 9 A) suggests that cells must have a physiological mechanism to adjust to variations in serum lipid composition while maintaining their typical membrane composition and function.Our finding that loading cells with non-hydrolyzable alkyl-phospholipid analogs inhibits proliferation suggests that the regulated deacylation of membrane phospholipids is critical to normal cell proliferation. These data also demonstrate that alternative pathways of degradation will not substitute. The doubling of membrane phospholipid mass is a periodic, cell cycle-regulated event that occurs during S phase (19Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid turnover is high during the G1 phase, and the accumulation of phospholipid in S phase correlates with the abrupt cessation of phospholipid turnover at the G1/S boundary (19Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the down-regulation of the excess phospholipid response is likely instrumental in permitting the accumulation of phospholipid mass in preparation for cell division.The inhibition of the excess phospholipid response by BEL implicates a calcium-independent (group VI) phospholipase A2 as an initiator of the cellular response to excess phospholipid. The identification of GPC and GPE as the primary products generated in response to phospholipid overproduction points to a phospholipase A2 as the initiating event. There are several classes of phospholipase A2 enzymes, and understanding their physiological roles and regulatory properties is an area of active investigation (29Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 33Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). BEL is an irreversible mechanism-based inhibitor of iPLA2 and is known not to effect the activities of other phospholipase A2 enzymes (29Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 35Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, BEL inhibition of PtdCho deacylation points directly to iPLA2 as a phospholipase that is critical to the response of cells to excess phospholipid. BEL is not a completely selective iPLA2 inhibitor since it also blocks the activity of Mg2+-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphatase (37Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), some proteases (38Daniels S.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and perhaps other enzymes as well. However, the degradation of PtdCho to GPC in response to the acylation of exogenous LPC does not involve phosphatidic acid phosphatase. There are a number of lysophospholipases in cells (39Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and one or more of these enzymes may participate in the removal of the second fatty acid to form GPC. BEL also decreased the formation of GPC in cells that were not stimulated to overproduce phospholipids, indicating that iPLA2-dependent phospholipid breakdown via GPC formation occurs under normal physiological circumstances. However, BEL did not eliminate GPC formation in cells, indicating that there is another mechanism or process that impacts on the steady-state levels of this metabolite. Cellular GPC is an organic osmolyte that is modulated in response to changes in medium osmolarity and the activity of a zinc-dependent phosphodiesterase (40Zablocki K.S. Miller P.F. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7820-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 42Bauernschmitt H. Kinne R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1148: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the portion of GPC metabolism that is not affected by BEL may be part of an osmotic regulatory system that operates independently of phospholipid homeostasis.The ubiquitous occurrence of iPLA2 and the absence of regulation by phosphorylation or calcium are consistent with a fundamental, housekeeping role for this class of enzymes in cell physiology as opposed to an involvement in cell signaling and eicosanoid release (29Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The iPLA2 enzymes are universally expressed, and iPLA2s are being purified and characterized from an increasing number of sources (43Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The participation of iPLA2 in the remodeling of membrane phospholipids is the most clearly defined function for this enzyme (29Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This process is an ongoing cycle of phospholipid deacylation followed by the reacylation of the resulting lysophospholipid that generates a different phospholipid molecular species with new biophysical properties (17Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar,53Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This remodeling cycle is a major route for the incorporation of arachidonic acid into phospholipids, and the inhibition of this process by BEL (17Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and iPLA2 antisense RNA (54Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (197) Google Scholar) support a role for iPLA2 in the deacylation component of this cycle. Experiments with BEL have also implicated iPLA2 as the phospholipase responsible for the stimulated release of fatty acids from glycerophospholipids during Fas-mediated apoptosis (55Atsumi G. Tajima M. Hadano A. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13870-13877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our results point to a determinant role for iPLA2 in the deacylation reactions involved in phospholipid homeostasis and reveal another manifestation of the housekeeping functions of iPLA2. One of the major challenges for the future is understanding how iPLA2 activity is modulated. The potential role of oligomerization of iPLA2 (43Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol.

Claesson H.-E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) are two possible mechanisms that warrant evaluation.The second step in GPC formation is the action of a lysophospholipase on the LPC generated by iPLA2. The lysophospholipases are grouped into two categories based on their molecular size, and representatives of both classes have been cloned. The low molecular mass (24.7 kDa) lysophospholipase is similar to bacterial esterases in that it has a GXSXG motif associated with the active sites of serine esterases (39Wang A. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12723-12729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 56Sugimoto H. Hayashi H. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7705-7711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The high molecular mass (60 kDa) lysophospholipases are also widely distributed in tissues. Like the iPLA2, the 60-kDa lysophospholipase cloned from rat liver possesses ankyrin repeats (57Sugimoto H. Odani S. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12536-12542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of these protein-protein interaction domains on these two phospholipases suggests that their similar biochemical properties may collaborate in membrane phospholipid homeostasis. PtdCho1 is the major membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells, and regulation of its biosynthesis and turnover is critical to maintaining membrane structure and function. CCT is a key regulatory step in PtdCho biosynthesis in mammalian cells (for reviews, see Refs. 1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar and 2Cornell R.B. Gross R.W. Advances in Lipobiology. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1996: 1-38Google Scholar). CCT activity is regulated primarily through the interaction of lipid modulators with its amphipathic α-helical domain, which stimulate (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23951-23957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CCT is also a phosphoprotein (1Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) that is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues within its carboxyl-terminal domain (7MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the highly phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain attenuates enzyme activation by lipid modulators (8Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Enforced CCTα (9Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdCho synthesis increased in G1; however, the total phospholipid mass was maintained as a result of a concomitant increase in PtdCho degradation. Taken together, these experiments suggest the existence of a system that coordinates PtdCho biosynthesis and degradation to maintain a constant membrane phospholipid content. The goals of this study were to determine if the coupling between CCT activity and PtdCho turnover is a manifestation of a general mechanism for phospholipid homeostasis and to investigate the phospholipase(s) responsible for regulated PtdCho degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2069809502,"In a systematic effort to design potent inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic tyrosine kinase BTK (Bruton′s tyrosine kinase) as anti-leukemic agents with apoptosis-promoting and chemosensitizing properties, we have constructed a three-dimensional homology model of the BTK kinase domain. Our modeling studies revealed a distinct rectangular binding pocket near the hinge region of the BTK kinase domain with Leu460, Tyr476, Arg525, and Asp539 residues occupying the corners of the rectangle. The dimensions of this rectangle are approximately 18 × 8 × 9 × 17 Å, and the thickness of the pocket is approximately 7 Å. Advanced docking procedures were employed for the rational design of leflunomide metabolite (LFM) analogs with a high likelihood to bind favorably to the catalytic site within the kinase domain of BTK. The lead compound LFM-A13, for which we calculated a K i value of 1.4 μm, inhibited human BTK in vitro with an IC50 value of 17.2 ± 0.8 μm. Similarly, LFM-A13 inhibited recombinant BTK expressed in a baculovirus expression vector system with an IC50 value of 2.5 μm. The energetically favorable position of LFM-A13 in the binding pocket is such that its aromatic ring is close to Tyr476, and its substituent group is sandwiched between residues Arg525 and Asp539. In addition, LFM-A13 is capable of favorable hydrogen bonding interactions with BTK via Asp539 and Arg525 residues. Besides its remarkable potency in BTK kinase assays, LFM-A13 was also discovered to be a highly specific inhibitor of BTK. Even at concentrations as high as 100 μg/ml (∼278 μm), this novel inhibitor did not affect the enzymatic activity of other protein tyrosine kinases, including JAK1, JAK3, HCK, epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, and insulin receptor kinase. In accordance with the anti-apoptotic function of BTK, treatment of BTK+ B-lineage leukemic cells with LFM-A13 enhanced their sensitivity to ceramide- or vincristine-induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, LFM-A13 is the first BTK-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the first anti-leukemic agent targeting BTK.

Therefore, an improved understanding of the molecular basis of apoptosis and the pro-apoptotic versus anti-apoptotic regulatory signals may provide further insights into the pathogenesis of human lymphoid malignancies and have important implications for treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK),1 a member of the BTK/Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), is a cytoplasmic PTK involved in signal transduction pathways regulating growth and differentiation of B-lineage lymphoid cells (8Rawlings D.J. Witte O.N. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 138: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Uckun F.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BTK participates in signal transduction pathways initiated by the binding of a variety of extracellular ligands to their cell-surface receptors; following ligation of B cell antigen receptors, BTK activation by the concerted actions of the PTKs Lyn and Syk (9Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) is required for induction of phospholipase C-γ2 mediated calcium mobilization (9Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human BTK gene are the cause of X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a male immune deficiency disorder characterized by a lack of mature, immunoglobulin-producing, peripheral B cells (11Tsukada S. Saffran D.C. Rawlings D.J. Parolini O. Allen R.C. Klisa K.I. Sparkes R.S. Kubagawa H. Mohandas T. Quan S. Cell. 1993; 72: 279-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar,12Vetrie D. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A. Flinter F. Hammerstrom L. Kinnon C. Levinsky R. Bobrow M.E.A. Nature. 1993; 361: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). In mice, mutations in the BTK gene have been identified as the cause of murine X-linked immune deficiency (13Rawlings D.J. Saffran D.C. Tsukada S. Largaespada D.A. Grimaldi J.C. Cohen L. Mohr R.N. Bazan J.F. Howard M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Witte O.N. Science. 1993; 261: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). BTK has an N-terminal region consisting of a 140-residue pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by an 80-residue proline-rich Tec homology (TH) domain. The PH domain is the site of activation by phosphatidylinositol phosphates and G-protein βγ subunits and inhibition by protein kinase C (14Tsukada S. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Katz A. Prog. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11256-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The remaining portion of BTK contains Src homology (SH) domains SH3 (49 residues), followed by SH2 (96 residues), and a 250-residue C-terminal SH1 kinase domain. The SH2 domain mediates binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide motifs on other molecules, and the SH3 domain mediates binding to proline-rich motifs. BTK is activated by transphosphorylation of Tyr551in the SH1 domain, followed by autophosphorylation of Tyr223 in the SH3 domain (9Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr223 may function to disrupt an intramolecular TH-SH3 domain interaction, allowing BTK TH domain binding with SH3 domains in the Src family kinases FYN, LYN, and HCK, and BTK SH3 domain binding with a proline-rich region of Cbl (9Kurosaki T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3465-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutations in the catalytic domain, SH2 domain, as well as PH domain of the BTK have been found to lead to maturational blocks at early stages of B cell ontogeny in human X-linked agammaglobulinemia (17Vihinen M. Cooper M.D. de Saint Basile G. Fischer A. Good R.A. Hendriks R.W. Kinnon C. Kwan S.P. Litman G.W. Notarangelo L.D. et al.Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BTK-deficient mice generated by introducing PH domain or catalytic domain mutations in embryonic stem cells showed defective B cell development and function (18Kerner J.D. Appleby M.W. Mohr R.N. Chien S. Rawlings D.J. Maliszewski C.R. Witte O.N. Perlmutter R.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 301-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, different regions of BTK are important for its physiologic functions. In murine B cells, BTK has been shown to act as an anti-apoptotic protein upstream of Bcl-xL in the B cell antigen receptor (but not the CD40 receptor) activation pathway (19Anderson J.S. Teutsch M. Dong Z. Wortis H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10966-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our recent studies provided biochemical and genetic evidence that BTK is an inhibitor of the Fas/APO-1 death-inducing signaling complex in B-lineage lymphoid cells (20Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that BTK also prevents ceramide- and vincristine-induced apoptosis (present study). The fate of leukemia/lymphoma cells may reside in the balance between the opposing proapoptotic effects of caspases activated by the death-inducing signaling complex and an upstream anti-apoptotic regulatory mechanism involving BTK and/or its substrates (20Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors of BTK are likely to enhance the chemosensitivity of leukemia/lymphoma cells. In a systematic effort to design potent inhibitors of BTK as anti-leukemic agents with apoptosis-promoting properties, we have constructed a three-dimensional homology model of the BTK kinase domain. Advanced docking procedures were employed for the rational design of leflunomide metabolite (LFM) analogs with a high likelihood to bind favorably to the catalytic site within the kinase domain of BTK. Here, we first report the identification of the LFM analog α-cyano-β-hydroxy-β-methyl-N-(2,5-dibromophenyl)-propenamide (LFM-A13) as a potent and specific inhibitor of BTK.LFM-A13 inhibited recombinant BTK with an IC50value of 2.5 μm, but it did not affect the enzymatic activity of other protein tyrosine kinases, including Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2, Src family kinase HCK, and receptor family tyrosine kinases EGF-receptor kinase (EGFR) and insulin receptor kinase (IRK), at concentrations as high as 278 μm. LFM-A13enhanced the chemosensitivity of BTK-positive B-lineage leukemia cells to vincristine and ceramide. The leflunomide metabolite (LFM) and two of its analogs (LFM-A12 and LFM-A13) were crystallized using various solvents by evaporation or liquid-liquid diffusion. X-ray data from single crystals were collected using a SMART CCD area detector (Bruker Analytical X-ray Systems, Madison, WI) with MoKα radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å). The space group was determined based on systematic absence and intensity statistics. A direct methods solution provided most of the non-hydrogen atoms from the electron density map. Several full-matrix least squares/difference Fourier cycles were performed to locate the remaining non-hydrogen atoms. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were placed in ideal positions and refined as riding atoms with relative isotropic temperature factors. The structure was refined using full matrix least squares on F 2. Crystal structure calculations were performed using a Silicon Graphics INDY R4400-SC computer (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA) or a Pentium computer using the SHELXTL V 5.0 suite of programs (21Sheldrick G.M. SHELXTL-Plus Reference Manual, Version 5.0. Bruker Analytical X-Ray Systems, Madison, WI1996Google Scholar). We have constructed a homology model of BTK using crystal structures of homologous kinase domains of protein kinases HCK (22Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), FGFR (23Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), IRK (24Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (25Zheng J. Trafny E.A. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 362-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) since no experimentally determined three-dimensional coordinates have been reported for the BTK kinase domain. The homology modeling of BTK was carried out by first obtaining the protein sequence of BTK (Swiss-Prot accession number Q06187, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland) from GenBankTM (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). Next, the most reasonable sequence alignment between the BTK kinase and a coordinate template was determined. This was done by first superimposing the C-α coordinates of the kinase domains of HCK, FGFR, IRK, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase using the InsightII program (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) to provide the best overall structural comparison. All four sequences were then aligned based on the superimposition of their structures (amino acid sequences were aligned together if their C-α positions were spatially related to each other). The sequence alignment accommodated such features as loops in a protein that differed from the other protein sequences. The structural superimposition was done using the homology module of the InsightII (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) program and a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 computer (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA). The sequence alignment was manually adjusted based on the previously mentioned considerations and produced a sequence variation profile for each superimposed C-α position. The sequence variation profile served as a basis for the next procedure, which was sequence alignment of all four proteins with BTK kinase. In this procedure, the sequence of BTK kinase was read into the program and manually aligned with the four known kinase proteins based on the sequence variation profile described previously. Next a set of three-dimensional coordinates was assigned to the BTK kinase sequence using the three-dimensional coordinates of HCK as a template, which employed the Homology module within the InsightII program (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar). The coordinates for a loop region where a sequence insertion occurs (relative to HCK without the loop) was chosen from a limited number of possibilities automatically generated by the program and manually adjusted to a more ideal geometry using the program CHAIN (27Sack J.S. CHAIN-A Crystallographic Modeling Program, J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 244-245Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the constructed model of BTK was subjected to energy minimization using the X-plor program (28Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar) so that any steric strain introduced during the model-building process could be relieved. The model was screened for unfavorable steric contacts, and if necessary such side chains were remodeled either by using a rotamer library data base or by manually rotating the respective side chains. The final homology model of the BTK kinase domain had a root mean square deviation of 0.01 Å from ideal bond lengths and 2.2° from ideal bond angles after energy minimization. The homology model of BTK was then used, in conjunction with model coordinates of LFM and its analogs (which were later compared with crystal structures), for our modeling studies of the BTK·inhibitor complexes. Modeling of the BTK·LFM analog complexes was done using the Docking module within the program INSIGHTII (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) and using the Affinity suite of programs for automatically docking a ligand to the receptor. Energy-minimized coordinates for each LFM molecule were generated and interactively docked into the ATP-binding site of BTK based on the position of quercetin in the HCK/quercetin crystal structure (22Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The hydrogen atoms on the kinase domain of BTK were generated, and potentials were assigned to both receptor and ligand prior to the start of the docking procedure. The docking method in the InsightII (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) program used the CVFF force field and a Monte Carlo search strategy to search for and evaluate docked structures. While the coordinates for the bulk of the receptor were kept fixed, a defined region of the binding site was allowed to relax, thereby allowing the protein to adjust to the binding of different inhibitors. A binding set was defined within a distance of 5 Å from the inhibitor, allowing residues within this distance to shift and/or rotate to energetically favorable positions to accommodate the ligand. An assembly was defined consisting of the receptor and inhibitor molecule, and docking was performed using the fixed docking mode. Calculations approximating hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions were used to determine the 10 best docking positions of each LFM analog in the BTK catalytic site. The various docked positions of each LFM analog was qualitatively evaluated using Ludi (29Bohm H.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1992; 6: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 30Bohm H.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) in INSIGHTII (26.Insight II (1996) Molecular Simulations Inc. San Diego, CA.Google Scholar) which was then used to estimate a binding constant (K i) for each compound in order to rank their relative binding capabilities and predicted inhibition of BTK. The K i trends for the LFM analogs were compared with the trend of the experimentally determined tyrosine kinase inhibition IC50 values for the compounds, in order to elucidate the structure-activity relationships determining the potency of LFM analogs. Sf21 (IPLB-SF21-AE) cells (20Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar), derived from the ovarian tissue of the fall armyworm Spodotera frugiperda, were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained at 26–28 °C in Grace's insect cell medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1.0% antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stock cells were maintained in suspension at 0.2–1.6 × 106/ml in 600-ml total culture volume in 1-liter Bellco spinner flasks at 60–90 rpm. Cell viability was maintained at 95–100% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Recombinant baculovirus containing the murine BTK gene was constructed as described (20Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, the gene encoding BTK was excised from pBluescript SKII+ vector (Stratagene) by digestion with BamHI, and this fragment was then ligated into pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting vector, pFastBac1-BTK, was then used to generate the recombinant baculovirus by site-specific transposition in Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) which harbor a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid), bMON14272. The resulting recombinant bacmid DNA was introduced into insect cells by transfection with the standard liposome-mediated method using Cellfectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Four days later, transfection supernatants were harvested for subsequent plaque purification and analyzed as above. Kinase-dead BTK was generated as described (20Vassilev A. Ozer Z. Navara C. Mahajan S. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 1646-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and cloned into the baculovirus expression vector as described above for wild-type BTK. Baculovirus expression vectors for JAK1 and JAK3 kinases were constructed and introduced into insect cells, as previously reported (31Goodman P.A. Niehoff L.B. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17742-17748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were infected with a baculovirus expression vector for BTK, JAK1, or JAK3 as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were harvested and lysed (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and the kinases were immunoprecipitated from the lysates, as reported (20Vassilev A.

S., Snyder, S. H., and Rosen, G. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24173–24176). In the presence ofl-arginine, NOS I produces nitric oxide (NO⋅). Yet the competition between O2 and l-arginine for electrons, and by implication formation of O·̄2, has until recently remained undefined. Herein, we investigated this relationship, observing O·̄2 generation even at saturating levels ofl-arginine. Of interest was the finding that the frequently used NOS inhibitor N G-monomethyll-arginine enhanced O·̄2 production in the presence of l-arginine because this antagonist attenuated NO⋅formation. Whereas diphenyliodonium chloride inhibited O·̄2, blockers of heme such as NaCN, 1-phenylimidazole, and imidazole likewise prevented the formation of O·̄2 at concentrations that inhibited NO⋅ formation from l-arginine.

The significance of this observation would, surprisingly, remain dormant for nearly a decade, even though it was known that l-arginine was the endogenous activator of this enzyme (5Deguchi T. Yoshioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10147-10151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the purification and characterization of a unique monooxygenase, NOS I, capable of oxidizingl-arginine to l-citrulline, and NO⋅ (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar,7Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar), a new class of small molecules (8Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. J.

The versatility of this free radical in controlling a myriad of brain functions will undoubtedly result in new and provocative findings. Of special interest will be research that can distinguish NO⋅ from NOS I-secreting neurons versus NO⋅ from NOS III-containing endothelial cells and NO⋅ from NOS II-stimulated microglial cells. Until the recent development of specific antagonists for each of the NOS isozymes (10Moore P.K. Wallace P. Garren Z. Hart S.L. Babbedge R.C. Br. J.

Nitric-oxide synthase is known to catalyze the production of NO⋅from l-arginine (13Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Masters B.S.S.

In the absence of substrate, we have previously demonstrated that purified NOS I can use O2as the terminal electron acceptor, generating O·̄2 (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have been confirmed because O·̄2 has been spin-trapped in l-arginine-depleted NOS I-transfected human kidney cells (16Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). During the course of our earlier studies (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we noted to our surprise that purified NOS I appeared to produce O·̄2 even in the presence of l-arginine. The current study, therefore, explores this phenomenon in depth. Herein, we demonstrate that NOS I, like NOS II (17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and NOS III (18Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H.

However, unlike NOS II, the heme of NOS I is the locus for the production of both free radicals. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings; particularly relevant is the ability of l-NMMA to enhance NOS I-derived O·̄2 even in the presence of saturating concentrations of l-arginine. NADPH, calmodulin, l-arginine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, ferricytochrome c, xanthine,N G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), N G-monomethyll-arginine (l-NMMA), EGTA, HEPES, and penicillin G-streptomycin solution were purchased from Sigma. Imidazole, 1-phenylimazole, sodium cyanide, and diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI) were obtained from Aldrich. Tetrahydrobiopterin was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Cation exchange resin Dowex 50W-X8 hydrogen form resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden).l-[14C]Arginine was purchase from ICN Radiochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine calf serum was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Superoxide dismutase and xanthine oxidase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was synthesized according to the procedure of Bonnett et al. (21Bonnett R. Brown R.F.C. Clark V.M. Sutherland I.O. Todd A. J. Chem. Soc. 1959; : 2094-2102Crossref Google Scholar). NOS I-transfected kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). NOS I was purified from these cells by the method of Bredt and Snyder (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3111) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were removed from the culture flasks and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline via centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (4 mg/ml) and homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, model PCU-2 at setting 2 for 10 s). The remaining mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min to separate unbroken cells, and the supernatant was applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column. After washing the column three times with 0.45 m NaCl and standard buffer, NOS was eluted with standard buffer containing 10 mm NADPH. Excess NADPH was removed by washing and concentrating the eluate with CentriCell-30 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) until the concentration of NADPH was approximately 1–1.5 mm as assessed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε = 6.2 × 103m−1 cm−1). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NOS I activity was assayed by measuring the formation of l-[14C]citrulline from l-[14C]arginine as described previously (23Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified NOS I was added into a reaction mixture containing l-[14C]arginine (0.6 μCi/ml),l-arginine (1 mm), NADPH (1 mm), calmodulin (100 units/ml; 23.6 μg/ml), free calcium ions (CaCl2, 1 μm; calculated as described in Ref.24Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar), and standard phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 (final volume = 0.150 ml). After incubating at room temperature for exactly 10 min, the reaction was terminated by adding HEPES (20 mm, 2 ml) containing EDTA (2 mm, pH 5.5).l-[14C]Citrulline was separated by passage through an 0.5-ml column of Dowex-50-X8 cation exchange, and radioactivity was counted using a Beckman β counter. Spin trapping experiments with purified NOS I were conducted by mixing all the components described in the figure legends to a final volume of 0.25 ml. The experiment was initiated by adding freshly purified NOS I. Reaction mixtures were then transferred to a flat quartz cell and fitted into the cavity of the EPR spectrometer (Varian Associates, model E-109), and spectra were recorded at room temperature 1 min after addition of the enzyme. Instrumentation settings are presented in the figure legends. The assessment of the effect ofl-NAME on the ability of xanthine/xanthine oxidase to produce O·̄2 was evaluated as described previously (25Pou S. Cohen M.S. Britigan B.E. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12299-12302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, xanthine oxidase was added to a solution containing xanthine (400 μm) and ferricytochrome c (80 μm) such that the rate of O·̄2 formation, measured as the SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c at 550 nm (26Kuthan H. Ullrich V. Estabrook R.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was 1 μm/min. The effect of various concentrations of l-NAME on the rate of O·̄2generation was estimated. The rate of NADPH oxidation by NOS I was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε = 6.2 × 103m−1 cm−1). Before determining the ability of NOS I to generate O·̄2, our initial series of studies were devoted to determining theK m and the V max for NOS I, because these constants will help dictate future experimental designs. Based on these studies, the K m and theV max were found to be 3.47 μm and 216 nmol min−1 mg−1, respectively, well within the ranges (K m of 2–4.3 μm andV max of 74–3400 nmol min−1mg−1) reported by others (27Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). In the absence of l-arginine, NOS I has previously been shown to generate O·̄2 (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), whereas at high concentrations of l-arginine (1 mm), complete inhibition of O·̄2 production had been noted (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect that intermediate concentrations of l-arginine would have on the ability of NOS I to generate O·̄2. As shown in Fig.1, l-arginine, in a dose-dependent manner, blocked O·̄2 secretion from NOS I, exhibiting an EC50 = 5 μm. Inhibition of NOS I-generated O·̄2 at 100 μml-arginine was nearly complete. Under these conditions, the rate of NADPH oxidation decreased as l-arginine concentration increased from 1.96 μmol/min/mg protein in the absence of substrate to 1.53 μmol/min/mg protein at 100 μml-arginine. Thereafter, the rate of NADPH consumption remained constant. This result suggests that for NOS I the transfer of electrons from NADPH to O2 in the absence of substrate is faster than the transfer of electrons to catalyze the formation of NO⋅ and l-citrulline from l-arginine. In contrast to NOS I, O·̄2 generation by purified NOS II was unaffected by 100 μml-arginine. In fact, it was still possible to detect this free radical even in the presence of 1 mml-arginine (17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for NOS III (18Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 19Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). These are surprising observations, considering the fact that the K m for NOS II varies between 2.8 to 32 μm, whereas for NOS III, theK m has been reported to be 2.9 μm(27Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar). These data nevertheless point to a substantial difference between the three isozymes of NOS with respect to O·̄2 secretion. For NOS II, it was found that O·̄2 was generated by electron leakage from the flavin domain (17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), based on the finding that 100 μm NaCN did not significantly inhibit O·̄2generation as estimated by spin trapping experiments (17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In contrast, either 100 μm NaCN (19Xia Y. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) or 1 mm NaCN (18Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N.

These data suggest that the heme domain of NOS III is the site of O·̄2 production (18Vásquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martásek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The initial step in the generation of NO⋅ by NOS is the transport of electrons from NADPH to the oxidized flavin, FAD, resulting in FADH2, after abstraction of a proton from the surrounding milieu. Disproportionation between the flavins leads to FADH⋅/FMNH⋅. The electron donation from FMNH⋅ to Fe3+ gives the reduced heme, Fe2+ and FADH⋅/FMN ⇔ FAD/FMNH⋅ (28Galli C. MacArthur R. Abu-Soud H.M. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2804-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding of O2in the sixth ligand position would give the hypothetical intermediate [Fe2+–O2] (29Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the absence ofl-arginine, O2 accepts an electron from NOS, generating O·̄2 (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). When l-arginine is present, however, there is a binding of the guanidino nitrogen in an ordered position near the heme (30Tierney D.L. Martasek P. Doan P.E. Masters B.S.S. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2983-2984Crossref Google Scholar), which allows the oxidation ofl-arginine to proceed. Based on a K m of 3.47 μm for the NOS I oxidation of l-arginine and on data presented in Fig. 1, NO⋅ and O·̄2 are both generated. The rate of each free radical produced, however, cannot accurately be estimated by spin trapping. Fig. 1 indicates that NOS I at l-arginine concentration around theK m is capable of producing O·̄2 at about 60% of the rate of that generated in the absence of l-arginine. For NOS II, electron transport from FMNH⋅ to Fe3+appears not to be so tightly coupled, because some leakage from the flavin domain results in the formation of O·̄2, even in the presence of 1 mml-arginine (17Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For NOS I, the site of O·̄2 generation has not yet been defined. We suggest, however, that during the oxidation of l-arginine to l-citrulline and NO⋅, direct competition with O2 results in O·̄2 formation. At a fixed concentration of O2, the ratio of NO⋅ and O·̄2 is dependent, therefore, on the concentration ofl-arginine. To explore the mechanism of O·̄2 generation by NOS I, it is important to determine how electrons are transferred through the enzyme. Thus, we undertook a series of inhibition experiments exploring the effects of two well known inhibitors of NOS, l-NAME andl-NMMA, on O·̄2 production. Before conducting these experiments, we estimated the capacity of these NOS inhibitors to blockl-citrulline formation and, by implication, the generation of NO⋅. The dose-response curves forl-[14C]citrulline formation froml-[14C]arginine by NOS I in the presence ofl-NAME and l-NMMA are shown in Fig.2. l-NMMA was found to be slightly more potent (EC50 = 5 μm) thanl-NAME (EC50 = 10 μm). For NOS III, l-NAME has been reported to be a more effective inhibitor of this isozyme than l-NMMA (31Gross S.S. Jaffe E.A. Levi R. Kilbourn R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 823-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). With these data in mind, we then defined the ability of l-NAME andl-NMMA to prevent O·̄2 production by NOS I. Fig.3 shows the effect of increased concentrations of l-NAME on the ability of NOS I to generate O·̄2. Similar to l-arginine,l-NAME antagonized the spin trapping of this free radical by DMPO in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 = 40 μm. In contrast, l-NMMA did not appreciably depress the formation of O·̄2 by NOS I even at concentrations as high as 10 mm (Fig. 3). Consistent with these findings, the rate of NADPH oxidation by NOS I was inhibited by >70% as the concentration of l-NAME reached 100 μm, whereas the rate of NADPH oxidation remained constant at about 50% of control with increasing concentration ofl-NMMA up to 10 mm (Fig.4). These results suggested thatl-NAME, but not l-NMMA, inhibited the formation of O·̄2 by impeding the electron transport to O2. To confirm this hypothesis, the effect of l-NAME (1 mm) on the xanthine/xanthine oxidase production of O·̄2, as measured by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec, was assessed. Within experimental error, this rate was unchanged. These data indicate that l-NAME did not scavenge O·̄2 but rather that l-NAME acted specifically on NOS I, inhibiting generation of this free radical. Becausel-NMMA is a potent antagonist of NOS-generated NO⋅, we explored whether l-NMMA could block the ability ofl-arginine to inhibit NOS I production of O·̄2. These findings are presented in Fig. 5. As expected, l-arginine (100 μm) almost completely inhibited the NOS I formation of O·̄2 (Fig.5 B), which confirmed earlier studies (15Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Heinzel B. John M. Klatt P. Bohme E. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Surprisingly,l-NMMA, in a dose-dependent manner, reversed the inhibitory properties of l-arginine (Fig. 5,C–E), almost reaching control values, in the absence ofl-arginine, at 1 mm (Fig. 5, E andF). Our findings support the theory that l-NAME antagonizes the transfer of electrons to either l-arginine or O2, whereas l-NMMA prevents the oxidation ofl-arginine by competing for the same binding site on the enzyme (33Abu-Soud H.M. Feldman P.L. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32318-32326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although NO⋅ production is inhibited by the presence of l-NMMA, NOS I still has the capacity to transfer electrons from NADPH to O2 (Fig. 4 and 5).Figure 3Effect of l-NMMA (♦) andl-NAME (⊡) on O·̄2 generation by purified NOS I as assessed by spin trapping/EPR spectroscopy.

Because cytochrome P-450 and NOS I are members of the same superfamily of enzymes (34Masters B.S.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we looked to cytochrome P-450 to gain insight as to potential loci for NOS I-derived O·̄2. There are two sites on cytochrome P-450 and NOS I where O·̄2 may be generated: the flavins of the reductase and the iron of the heme. For cytochrome P-450, the heme domain is the origin of O·̄2 formation (35White R.E. Lechner M.C. Cytochrome P450 Biochemistry, Biophysics and Molecular Biology. John Libbey Eurotext, Paris1994: 333-340Google Scholar). Would NOS I behave in a similar manner? First, we needed to demonstrate that our NOS I preparation was capable of transferring electrons from the flavin site to the heme domain. For this purpose we investigated the effect of DPI, a compound known to block the electron flow at the flavin locus (36Stuehr D.J. Fasehun O.A. Kwon N.S. Gross S.S. Gonzalez J.A. Levi R. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), on NO⋅ and O·̄2 formation by NOS I. As shown in Fig.6, DPI is a potent inhibitor ofl-citrulline generation by NOS I with an EC50 = 10 μm. Similarly, DPI at 10 μm almost completely inhibited the spin trapping of NOS I-secreted O·̄2(Fig. 7 B). In contrast, DPI (10 μm) did not inhibit the reaction of DMPO with O·̄2 generated from FMN/NADPH (Fig.8 D). Even though these data indicate that the electron flow is through the flavin domain, these experiments cannot establish whether O·̄2 is produced solely at this site or at the heme domain. To further address this query, we investigated the effect of NaCN and two imidazoles (known to inhibit cytochrome P-450 and NOS (37Banci L. Bertini I. Marconi S. Pieratteli R. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4866-4873Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Chabin R.M. McCauley E. Calaycay J.R. Kelly T.M. MacNaul K.L. Wolfe G.C. Hutchinson N.I. Madhusudanaraju S. Schmidt J.A. Kozarich J.W. Wong K.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9567-9575Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by blocking the heme site) on the generation of this free radical. First, however, we had to demonstrate that NaCN, imidazole, and 1-phenylimidazole inhibited the metabolism ofl-arginine to l-citrulline by NOS I. Fig. 6depicts the dose-response curves forl-[14C]citrulline formation froml-[14C]arginine by NOS I in the presence of NaCN, imidazole, and 1-phenylimidazole. NaCN was the least potent of these inhibitors with an EC50 = 10 mm, whereas imidazole and 1-phenylimidazole were considerably more potent with values for EC50 = 20 μm and 80 μm, respectively. Once completed, we were confident that if similar inhibitory properties toward O·̄2 generation were revealed, then the heme was most likely the site of this free radical formation. At 1 mm NaCN, there was a minimal decrease in the peak height of DMPO-OOH (Fig. 7 C), whereas at 10 mm NaCN inhibition of O·̄2 was nearly complete (Fig.7 D). In an independent series of experiments, NaCN at 10 mm was found to inhibit (by 50%) the spin trapping of O·̄2 from the model O·̄2 generating system consisting of FMN/NADPH (Fig. 8 E). Because NaCN is known to react with DMPO (21Bonnett R. Brown R.F.C. Clark V.M. Sutherland I.O. Todd A. J. Chem. Soc. 1959; : 2094-2102Crossref Google Scholar), thereby decreasing the effective concentration of DMPO available to react with O·̄2, the findings in Fig. 8 Ecan only suggest that the heme domain in NOS I was the site of O·̄2 production. Alternative antagonists for NOS were sought. Recently, imidazoles have been reported to block the heme site of NOS (38Chabin R.M. McCauley E. Calaycay J.R. Kelly T.M. MacNaul K.L. Wolfe G.C.

To ensure specific assembly, their subunits must present complementary recognition domains to each other. These domains may be located on the ectodomains and/or the transmembrane segments (TMSs).1 Interactions between TMSs are currently intensely studied, since they usually form autonomous α-helices and have been found to direct subunit assembly or support correct folding of many membrane proteins (1Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Dieckmann G.R. DeGrado W.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 486-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biochemical and functional analyses, molecular modeling, and structural studies indicated that the self-assembly of transmembrane helices is driven by a close packing of their characteristically shaped surfaces. These packing interactions may result in pairs of α-helices with a right-handed twist as exemplified by glycophorin A (3Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other TMS interactions involve a leucine zipper type of side-chain packing as known from certain soluble proteins. Within soluble leucine zippers, the interacting residues form repeated heptad (abcdefg) motifs. Residues at a- and d-positions constitute the hydrophobic core of the interfaces; side-chains at the e- and g-positions are frequently charged, form salt bridges to each other, and make hydrophobic contacts to the core (6Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Heptad motifs were also suggested to form the TMS interfaces of phospholamban (7Arkin I.T.

Based on a quantitative evaluation of high resolution structures, we recently confirmed previous observations (10Rees D.C. Komiya H. Yeates T.O. Allen J.P. Feher G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 607-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) in demonstrating that TMSs primarily interact via a leucine zipper type of packing within bacteriorhodopsin, the photosynthetic reaction center, and cytochrome c oxidase. There, the heptads are repeated on average 2–3 times, and the motif gaxxdexgaxxdexga covers the central parts of the membrane-spanning interfaces. Salt bridges are absent due to the hydrophobic nature of most membrane-embedded residues (12Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins. 1998; 31: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To establish a simplified model of membrane-spanning leucine zipper domains, we designed artificial TMSs on the basis of leucine and alanine residues. We show that an oligoleucine sequence or agaxxdexgaxxdexga motif of leucine residues elicits specific self-assembly in membranes and in detergent solution. Interestingly, variants of this motif are found within the TMSs of a diverse set of natural membrane proteins, where they appear to be important for oligomeric assembly. Construction of plasmids pToxRΔTM and pSNiRΔTM was described previously (5Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). All other pToxR constructs were made by ligating synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding the desired sequences into the plasmid pHKToxR(TMIl4)MalE (14Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Götze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) previously cut with NheI and BamHI. For the nuclease A fusions, the oligonucleotide cassettes were ligated into plasmids pSNiR (5Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or pSNiR2 previously cut withNheI and BamHI. Details on the pSNiR and pSNiR2 plasmids will be described elsewhere. All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Transcription activation was determined upon expression of the pToxR constructs in the indicator strain FHK12 as described (15Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures to enhance the dynamic range of the produced β-galactosidase signals (in Miller units (MU), means ± S.D.) elicited by the different constructs in several independent experiments. This effect is thought to result from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced expression of an F′-plasmid-encoded truncated β-galactosidase, which competes with full-length enzyme in the formation of functional tetramers. The previously (15Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) described construct pToxR/GPA13 elicited 1240 ± 298 MU under these conditions. pSNiR and pSNiR2 fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen), solubilized in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 2% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA and quantitated as described (5Laage R. Langosch D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Volumes of 300 μl at concentrations of 4 or 20 μm fusion protein were separated on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system) using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA as running buffer. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed for fusion protein with a dot blot procedure (16Becker C.-M. Hoch W. Betz H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody directed against the c-myc marker epitope for detection. The elution profiles were constructed from the antigen content, and the apparent molecular weights were calculated with reference to standards given in the legend to Fig. 3. The Swiss-Prot data base (release 35.0) was searched with the LLXXLLXLLXXLLXLL motif using the Findpatterns option of the HUSAR sequence analysis package made available by the German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg). Up to three mismatches were allowed. To selectively retrieve TMSs, any amino acid except the charged residues lysine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, or the helix-breaker proline was allowed for those positions not occupied by leucine. Western blotting was done as described with an antiserum recognizing the maltose-binding protein (MalE) moiety of the constructs, and the bands were quantitated densitometrically (13Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The ability of our constructs to complement the MalE deficiency of PD28 cells was tested by measuring the cell densities of transformed bacteria in minimal medium containing maltose at 640 nm after different growth periods (13Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). NaOH extraction was done as described (17Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by vortexing whole bacteria with cold 0.1m NaOH followed by centrifugation to separate soluble from membrane-bound proteins. Leucine is the most prevalent amino acid within the interface of leucine zippers (18Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar), which is probably related to its ability to adopt multiple conformations (19Schrauber H. Eisenhaber F. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 592-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the flexible leucine side chain may be particularly well suited to form a well packed membrane-spanning leucine zipper. The methyl side chain of alanine, in contrast, is expected to be too small for efficient interaction with other alanine residues. This prediction was tested by comparing the self-association of oligoleucine and oligoalanine sequences, which are known to form stable α-helices (20Zhang Y.-P. Lewis R.N.A.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11579-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Marqusee S. Robbins V.H. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5286-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). One of the experimental approaches we used is based on an engineered version of the ToxR transcription activator. This protein is anchored by a single TMS of choice within the inner membrane of expressingEscherichia coli cells, where it is thought to exist in a monomer/dimer equilibrium. The dimeric form binds to the cholera toxin promoter, thus activating expression of a downstream lacZgene in a reporter strain (Fig. 1; Ref.14Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Götze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase expression is therefore diagnostic of ToxR self-assembly in the membrane. We previously established this system as a sensitive tool to study TMS interactions using the structurally well characterized glycophorin A TMS dimer for reference (13Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Here, we found that a sequence of 16 leucine residues (designated L16) elicited strong transcription activation (924 ± 209 MU; mean ± S.D.). In contrast, a sequence of 16 alanine residues (designated A16), elicited only a weak signal (210 ± 53 MU) (Fig.2, A and B). This suggests that the oligoleucine sequence self-assembles in the membrane, whereas the oligoalanine sequence stays largely monomeric. Thus, the latter can be used as host for a leucine zipper motif. Based on thegaxxdexgaxxdexga motif representing the central parts of most transmembrane helix-helix interfaces within crystallized membrane proteins (12Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins. 1998; 31: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a simplified version of a membrane-spanning leucine zipper interaction domain was designed. In this model, thea, d, e, and g positions are occupied by leucine and all others by alanine. The construct with this hybrid sequence (AZ2) self-interacted to a similar degree (929 ± 186 MU) as the parental L16 protein (Fig. 2, Aand B). To demonstrate that the leucine residues contained within AZ2 constitute the helix-helix interface, we mutated some of them to alanine and assessed the consequences for self-interaction. None of the single mutations made (L2A, L5A, L9A) significantly reduced the signal (data not shown). However, when either four a andd (L2A/L5A/L9A/L12A) or four g and e(L6A/L8A/L13A/L15A) positions were simultaneously mutated, the signal dropped by about 50% (516 ± 106 or 596 ± 102 MU). Thus, the leucine residues are critical for the interaction and, hence, most likely make up the interface. Further, ad- andeg-positions seem to be of similar importance for helix-helix packing. Introducing a glycine-proline pair into the center of the AZ2 sequence (L9G/A10P) similarly affected the interaction (584 ± 100 MU), consistent with the known destabilization of α-helices by glycine (22Serrano L. Neira J.-L. Sancho J. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and their kinking by proline (23von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) residues. We also replaced the leucines of AZ2 by three different random sequences consisting of the most abundant residues found within TMSs (leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, alanine) (24Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) while maintaining total hydrophobicity and side-chain surface (25Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. Freeman, New York1993: 142Google Scholar). Compared with AZ2, these random sequences also self-assembled much less efficiently, thus emphasizing the superior suitability of the leucine side chain for helix-helix packing (e.g. “random,” 446 ± 72 MU; Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). The reductions in signal strength of the mutants compared with AZ2 are statistically highly significant (two-tailed Student'st test, p < 0.001). Comparing the concentrations of our ToxR constructs by Western blot analysis indicated that most of them were expressed at similar levels, whereas consistent overexpression was noted for the A16 construct (Fig.2 C). When we extracted the cells with NaOH to separate membrane proteins (pellet) from soluble proteins (alkali supernatant) (17Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), all constructs cosedimented quantitatively with the membranes as expected except A16, which could be partially alkali-extracted (Fig.2 C). Thus, a fraction of the A16 protein seems to remain in a soluble compartment, which is probably due to the comparably low hydrophobicity of the oligoalanine sequence. This fraction is thought not to interfere with the assay. To assess correct integration of the proteins into the inner membrane, we tested their ability to functionally complement the MalE deficiency of PD28 cells. Due to a MalE deletion, this E. coli strain is unable to grow in minimal medium with maltose as the only carbon source (26Bedouelle H. Duplay P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In cells expressing correctly inserted ToxR membrane proteins with the ToxR moiety facing the cytoplasm and the MalE domain exposed to the periplasmic space (see Fig. 1), however, the MalE domain allows maltose uptake and thus cell growth (13Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 14Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Götze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Here, expression of all constructs including A16 complemented the MalE deficiency of PD28 cells to comparable degrees (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, a control construct where the TMS is deleted (ToxRΔTM) proved unable to support cell growth as expected from its presumed cytoplasmic localization. In sum, equivalent amounts of all ToxR proteins analyzed here for self-assembly appear to be correctly integrated into the inner bacterial membrane, and the obtained β-galactosidase activities can thus be directly compared. To examine self-assembly of our artificial TMSs by an independent approach, their oligomeric states were directly compared in detergent solution (Fig. 3). The L16, A16, AZ2, ΔTM, L9G/A10P, and “random” sequence segments were genetically fused to the C terminus of a fusion moiety based onStaphylococcus aureus nuclease A, a monomeric soluble protein. The fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli, solubilized with CHAPS, and subjected to gel filtration chromatography at concentrations of 4 or 20 μm. When injected at 20 μm, both L16 and AZ2 fusion proteins eluted as broad peaks with mean apparent molecular masses of ∼300 kDa plus minor peaks at 47 kDa. At 4 μm, the 300-kDa peaks were decreased in favor of the 47-kDa peaks, indicating equilibrium between both forms of the proteins (data not shown). Whereas the 300-kDa peaks clearly indicate assembly to multimers whose stoichiometry is currently not clear, the 47-kDa peaks most likely reflect monomers that may migrate at increased apparent molecular weights due to bound detergent (calculated molecular masses: L16, 21.2 kDa; AZ2, 20.9 kDa). In contrast to that, the ΔTM, A16, L9G/A10P, and “random” constructs gave rise to major peaks at 17, 22, 31, and 41 kDa at both concentrations. These peaks are consistent with monomers (calculated masses: 19.5, 20.5, 20.9, and 20.9 kDa, respectively) whose migration may be influenced by different amounts of bound detergent depending on the presence and the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic segments. Taken together, two independent experimental approaches indicate that both the oligoleucine sequence and the model leucine zipper motif AZ2 self-assemble in a sequence-specific way in membranes as well as in detergent solution. Given the self-assembly of the AZ2 model, we assessed whether TMSs with similar leucine patterns exist in naturally occurring proteins. The Swiss-Prot data base was searched for hydrophobic sequence segments with the motif LLXXLLXLLXXLLXLL allowing for up to three mismatches. This search yielded 38 predicted N-terminal signal sequences, 30 TMSs predicted within polytopic membrane proteins, and 15 predicted TMSs from bitopic membrane proteins when homologous proteins from different species were counted only once. Whereas the signal sequences and TMSs of polytopic proteins were not further investigated here, the TMS sequences corresponding to the bitopic proteins are shown in Table I. Self-interaction of a subset was examined with the ToxR system. The TMS eliciting the strongest signal was derived from the erythropoietin receptor followed by the TMSs of the Friend spleen focus-forming virus envelope protein, E-cadherin, and hemagglutinin of canine distemper virus. Other TMSs corresponding to papillomavirus E5 protein, mouse poliovirus receptor homolog, and chick asialoglycoprotein receptor gave rise to intermediate values suggesting lower levels of self-assembly (Fig. 4 A and Table I). A Western blot run for control revealed roughly similar expression levels (Fig. 4 B).Table IHeptad motifs of leucine residues in natural TMSsSwiss-prot IDaSwiss-Prot sequence identifiers are as follows: CAD1_XENLA, Xenopus laevis E-cadherin; CAD3_HUMAN, human P-cadherin; CADB_CHICK, chick B-cadherin; CADF_HUMAN, human M-cadherin; CD72_MOUSE, mouse CD72 antigen; ENV_FRSFB, envelope protein from friend spleen focus-forming virus; EPOR_MOUSE, mouse erythropoietin receptor; GPBB_HUMAN, human platelet glycoprotein Ib β-chain; HEMA_CDVO, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase from canine distemper virus; LECH_CHICK, chick hepatic lectin; PVR_MOUSE, mouse poliovirus receptor homolog; SRPB_MOUSE, mouse signal recognition particle receptor β-subunit; TNRC_MOUSE, mouse lymphotoxin-β receptor; VE5A_BPV1, E5 protein from bovine papilloma virus; VGLX_HSVBS, glycoprotein GX from bovine herpesvirus.TMS sequencebSequences representing those parts of the TMSs that cover the query pattern.

Open table in a new tab The data predict that these TMSs are important for oligomerization of the corresponding proteins. A survey of previously reported experimental evidence and our own experiments indicated this indeed to be the case for several of these proteins or related homologs as discussed below. We demonstrate that an artificial TMS of leucine residues efficiently self-assembles in membranes and in detergent solution. A heptad motif of leucine residues suffices to elicit self-assembly, which therefore is thought to be driven by the type of side-chain packing known from leucine zipper interaction domains. The main implications of our results are 2-fold. (i) They establish a simplified model system of short membrane-spanning leucine zippers. (ii) They suggest that similar interaction domains may play a role in subunit-subunit recognition of certain natural membrane proteins. We assume that the L16 and AZ2 TMSs form α-helical bundles upon self-assembly. Self-assembly is thought to involve self-complementary helix surfaces that associate which each other via a “knobs-into-holes” type of side-chain packing characteristic of leucine zippers (6Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The highly flexible leucine side chain (19Schrauber H. Eisenhaber F. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 592-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) may be particularly well suited for this type of packing interaction. Consistent with this concept, leucine-rich heptad motifs have previously been applied in the design of helix bundles forming transmembrane ion channels (27Lear J.D. Wasserman Z.R. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1988; 240: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) or of a folded polytopic membrane protein (28Whitley P. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, leucine helices have frequently been used as experimental models to study TMS interactions with lipid bilayers. For some of these studies (20Zhang Y.-P. Lewis R.N.A.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11579-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Nezil F.A. Bloom M. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3156-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), both termini of the leucine helices were capped with lysine residues whose repulsive interaction may keep them in a monomeric state (31Subczynski W.K. Lewis R. McElhaney R.N. Hodges R.S. Hyde J.S. Kusumi A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3156-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In other cases (17Chen H. Kendall D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14115-14122Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol.

A leucine zipper type of side-chain packing also accounts for TMS interactions within phospholamban (7Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brünger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and different polytopic membrane proteins (12Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins. 1998; 31: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to our leucine-based model, these heptad motifs are made up of different hydrophobic amino acids, which may generate the characteristically shaped helix surfaces ensuring specific, stoichiometric, and/or heterophilic assembly of these natural proteins. Data base searching identified leucine-rich heptad motifs within different naturally occurring TMSs, and an analyzed subset of these indeed exhibited various levels of self-interaction. This predicts a role of TMS interactions in the assembly of the corresponding membrane proteins. This is also implied by studies on the corresponding full-length proteins as will be briefly discussed below. Cadherins are calcium-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecules. Their function depends on lateral clustering within the plasma membrane (34Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), which is believed to involve interactions between extracellular (35Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grübel G. Legrand J.-F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) and juxtamembrane domains (36Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). On the other hand, leucine-rich heptad motifs are evolutionarily conserved in the TMSs of different cadherin families, and our data demonstrating self-interaction of the E-cadherin TMS suggest a role of TMS interactions in clustering. Strong support for this hypothesis is provided by our recent experimental evidence indicating that mutations reducing the TMS interaction likewise affect the adhesive properties of full-length E-cadherin expressed in eukaryotic cells. 2O. Huber, R. Kemler, and D. L., manuscript submitted. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR)is required for erythrocyte maturation. In analogy to other growth factor receptors, erythropoietin binding is thought to trigger homo-dimerization followed by receptor activation (37Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3535-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Apart from the case of the Neu oncogene product, where a point mutation within the TMS triggers ligand-independent receptor activation (38Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the role of the TMS in growth factor receptor activation is currently not clear. Since ligand binding is translated into activation of cytoplasmic domains, it has been postulated that the subunit-subunit interface of growth factor receptors extends across the membrane and that TMS interactions contribute to ligand-induced subunit assembly in a nonspecific way (1Lemmon M.A. Engelman D.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 27: 157-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our finding that the EpoR TMS is capable of self-interaction indeed suggests its contribution to ligand-induced receptor assembly. Alternatively, the EpoR may exist as a preformed dimer activated by ligand binding. Precedence for the latter model is given by the insulin receptor or the aspartate chemoreceptor; in both cases, ligand-binding activates preformed receptor oligomers (39Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent dimerization has also been proposed for the epidermal growth factor receptor (40Gadella T.W.J. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Enveloped viruses enter the cytoplasm of host cells upon fusion of viral and cellular membranes mediated by fusogenic viral envelope proteins. These proteins exist as oligomeric complexes (41Hernandez L.D. Hoffman L.R. Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 627-661Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and both their fusogenicity and oligomerization appear to depend on their TMSs. For example, the influenza hemagglutinin TMS is required for full membrane fusion (42Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the trimeric complex (43Doms R.W. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 833-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, mutations of conserved leucine residues within the TMS of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase of Newcastle disease virus affected tetramerization and fusion promotion (44McGinnes L. Sergel T. Morrison T. Virology. 1993; 196: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Extending these findings, our data suggest a role of the TMS in oligomerization of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase from canine distemper virus and of the Friend leukemia virus envelope protein. Apart from homooligomerization, a heterophilic and functionally important interaction has been reported between the EpoR and the gp55 protein of Friend spleen focus-forming virus, which is derived from its envelope protein (45Wolff L. Kaminchik J. Hankins W.D. Ruscetti S.K. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 570-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the surface of infected erythroid cells, the EpoR and gp55 form a noncovalent complex, which results in erythropoietin-independent cell differentiation (46Tarr K. Watowich S.S. Longmore G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9099-9107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Complex formation is therefore thought to cause persistent EpoR activation (47Li J.-P. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 343: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Notably, both the gp55 TMS and the EpoR TMS have been shown to be crucial for this heterophilic interaction (48Chung S.-W. Wolff L. Ruscetti S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7957-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Zon L.I. Moreau J.-F. Koo J.-W. Mathey-Prevot B. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since both TMS sequences have been identified by our data base search and shown to self-interact, we propose that formation of the heteromeric complex proceeds from preformed gp55 and EpoR homomers. The papillomavirus E5-protein is a transforming membrane protein that exists as a disulfide-bonded dimer (50Horwitz B.H. Burkhardt A.L. Schlegel R. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4071-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Its transforming activity presumably rests on interaction with, and ligand-independent activation of, the receptors for epidermal growth factor, colony-stimulating factor (51Martin P. Vass W.C. Schiller J.T. Lowy D.R. Velu T.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or platelet-derived growth factor (52Petti L. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the case of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, binding to the E5 protein has been directly demonstrated to involve the TMSs plus extracellular flanking regions of both receptor and E5 protein (53Petti L.M. Reddy V. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7318-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the E5 protein extracellular region and the glutamine residue within the TMS are important for activity (54Kulke R. Horwitz B.H. Zibello T. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 505-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that the leucine-rich surface of its TMS aids in homodimer formation and/or binding to the various growth factor receptor TMSs. The hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors remove abnormally glycosylated proteins from blood circulation (55Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The chick homolog exists as a homotrimer whose formation and stability depends on the TMS and flanking sequences (56Loeb J.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3022-3029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,57Verrey F. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This is consistent with self-interaction of its TMS shown here. These examples demonstrate that assembly of several different natural membrane proteins depends on their TMSs as predicted by the presence of leucine-rich heptad repeats. Future studies will show whether these TMS interactions are based on the leucine zipper type of packing as inferred for our self-assembling model TMSs L16 and AZ2. TMS interactions may be modulated by the lipid composition of the respective host membrane. Further, they may not be the exclusive cause of subunit-subunit recognition but may be complemented by interactions between extramembraneous domains in particular cases. We thank Drs. W. Hoch, G. Schönrich, and A. Skerra for critically reading the manuscript; Dr. H. Bedouelle for providing strain PD28; M. Seiler for constructing pSNiR2; A. Szabowski for initial experiments; and Dr. W. B.

The demand for cotton has not fallen despite the rapid growth in synthetic fiber production since 1960. The major biotic yield constraints are animal pests and weeds, although in all growing regions there are also diseases causing losses of cotton yields. Cotton plants appear to have little inherent defense against attack by insect pests. In fact, many insect species have been reported on cotton, and some of these species are regarded as major pests that can destroy the plants in a few days. In most growing regions, the principal pests are larvae of lepidopteran species that attack the roots, leaves, flowers, and bolls. This is in particular the case for the following species: Pectinophora gossypiella (pink bollworm), Heliothis armigera (American bollworm), H. virescens (tobacco budworm), and Earias spp. (spiny bollworm). Each year, these species cost the cotton industry millions of dollars in yield loss and control measures (1Oerke E.-C. Dehne H.-W. Schönbeck F. Weber A. Crop Production and Crop Protection. Elsevier, Amsterdam1994Google Scholar). In this context, the knowledge of the immune response mechanisms of the lepidopteran larvae is of great interest. Indeed, these mechanisms can represent a potential target for controlling these pests. In the present study, we have chosen H. virescens as a biological model. The host defense of insects relies on cellular and humoral mechanisms. The cellular response consists of phagocytosis and encapsulation of invading microorganisms by blood cells (for a review, see Ref. 2Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M.

The humoral facet of the defense reactions of insects has been extensively studied, and it is now clear that it is essentially based on the synthesis of a battery of cationic antibacterial and antifungal peptides/polypeptides exhibiting broad activity spectra. These antimicrobial molecules are produced in the fat body (a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver) and released into the hemolymph (blood). Today, more than 150 antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from various insect species. Although they exhibit great structural diversities, certain common structural patterns are apparent, and the peptides are often grouped into four families: (i) cecropins, (ii) cysteine-rich peptides, (iii) proline-rich peptides, and (iv) glycine-rich peptides/polypeptides (for reviews, see Refs.2Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 309-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cecropins, which were the first inducible antibacterial peptides to be characterized (5Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engström A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), are linear 4-kDa cationic peptides isolated from Lepidoptera and Diptera. They are devoid of cysteine residues and consist of two α-helices linked by a short hinge (for a review, see Ref. 6Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Cecropins are frequently C-terminally amidated. They kill Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The group of cysteine-rich peptides contains members with 1–4 disulfide bridges with molecular masses ranging from 2 to 6 kDa. The most widespread of insect antimicrobial compounds, the insect defensins, belong to this group. They contain six cysteine residues involved in three disulfide bridges (7Cociancich S. Ghazi A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19239-19245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Defensins are active against Gram-positive bacteria. Their presence has been reported from many insect orders and also from scorpions and molluscs (8Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21808-21813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Hitherto, they had not been isolated from Lepidoptera. In addition to these antibacterial cysteine-rich peptides, two cysteine-containing peptides with antifungal activity have been characterized so far from insects: drosomycin from the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster (10Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thanatin from the hemipteran Podisus maculiventris (11Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Chernysh S. Briand J.P. Roussel J.P. Letellier L. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In response to septic injury, larvae and adults of Drosophila produce considerable amounts of drosomycin, a 5-kDa peptide with eight cysteine residues that are engaged in the formation of four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Drosomycin is inactive against bacteria. It shows significant homology with plant defensins, e.g. Rs-AFP2 fromRaphanus sativus (10Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thanatin is a 2-kDa peptide exhibiting both fungicidal and bactericidal activities. The third group of antimicrobial peptides from insects, the proline-rich molecules, have been isolated from Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera (for a review, see Ref. 3Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Response in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1998: 40-66Google Scholar). They are active against Gram-negative bacteria, and for some members of this group activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi was also reported. Some of the proline-rich peptides are O-glycosylated (e.g.drosocin (12Bulet P. Dimarcq J.-L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Finally, the glycine-rich peptides/polypeptides, which are mostly large (8–24 kDa), are active against Gram-negative cells. They include attacins, characterized in Lepidoptera and Diptera (13Hultmark D. Engström A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Andersson K. Steiner H. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar); sarcotoxins II (14Kanai A. Natori S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6114-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); and diptericins from Diptera (15Dimarcq J.L. Keppi E. Dunbar B. Lambert J. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann D. Rankine S.M. Fothergill J.E. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Bulet P. Hegy G. Lambert J. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7394-7400Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As regards the order of Lepidoptera, to which belongs H. virescens, a number of inducible antibacterial peptides had already been isolated when we engaged in the present study. These include, in addition to the cecropins and attacins mentioned above, gloverin (17Axen A. Carlsson A. Engström A. Bennich H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), moricin (18Hara S. Yamakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29923-29927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and lebocins (19Hara S. Yamakawa M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Gloverin is a 14-kDa inducible cationic antibacterial polypeptide isolated from pupae of the giant silk moth Hyalophora cecropia. It contains a large number of glycine residues but is devoid of cysteine residue. Moricin is a 4-kDa antibacterial peptide isolated from Bombyx mori. Neither moricin nor gloverin range into any of the four groups of antimicrobial peptides/polypeptides defined above. Finally, lebocins that were isolated from hemolymph of immunized B. mori are structurally related to proline-rich peptides. Interestingly, the unique threonine residue in each lebocin isO-glycosylated. From H. virescens, our experimental model, the presence of cecropin-like and attacin-like molecules has been described, but no amino acid sequences have been published (20Ourth D.D. Lockey T.D. Renis H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Lockey T.D. Ourth D.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, no cysteine-rich peptides have been reported so far from Lepidoptera, and no antifungal activities have been recorded from this order. We present here the isolation of a novel inducible antifungal peptide, the structure of which shares similarities with insect defensins, with the Drosophila antifungal peptide drosomycin, and with antifungal plant defensins. Fifth instar larvae of the lepidopteran H. virescenswere individually pricked with a 30-gauge needle dipped into a combined bacterial pellet obtained after centrifugation of 37 °C overnight cultures of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli 1106. After 24 h, the insects were chilled on a bed of ice, and several drops (30 μl/larva) of hemolymph were recovered by sectioning an abdominal appendix and gently squeezing the abdomen. The hemolymph was pooled in ice-cold polypropylene tubes containing aprotinin as a protease inhibitor (20 μg/ml final concentration) and phenylthiourea as a melanization inhibitor (20 μm final concentration). After a centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 1 min at 4 °C, the cell-free hemolymph was frozen at −20 °C until use. In a control experiment, a hemolymph sample from unchallenged H. virescens larvae was processed in the same manner. Two ml of cell-free hemolymph, from untreated or bacteria-challenged larvae, were acidified to pH 3 with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The acidic extraction was performed for 30 min under gentle shaking in an ice-cold water bath. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatant was loaded onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) equilibrated with acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Elutions were performed with 10, 40, and 100% acetonitrile in acidified water. All fractions were first concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge (Speed-Vac, Savant) in order to remove the organic solvent and trifluoroacetic acid and subsequently reconstituted with MilliQ water. The two 40% Sep-Pak fractions from immunized and control insects were purified in parallel by reversed-phase HPLC1 on a semipreparative Aquapore RP-300 C8 column (250 × 7.0 mm, Brownlee) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile in acidified water. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 2 to 60% acetonitrile in acidified water over 120 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The fraction with antifungal activity was applied on an analytical Aquapore OD-300 C18 column (220 × 4.6 mm, Brownlee) developed with a linear biphasic gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water from 2 to 22% over 10 min and from 22 to 32% over 50 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The fraction that contained the antifungal activity was further applied on a narrow bore reversed-phase column (Delta Pak HPIC18, 2 × 150 mm, Waters) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile in acidified water and developed with a linear biphasic gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water from 2 to 24% over 10 min and from 24 to 44% over 100 min at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and at a temperature of 30 °C. The first and second steps of HPLC purification were performed with a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. The last step of purification was carried out at a temperature of 30 °C using an all PEEK Waters HPLC system (Waters model 626 pump) attached to a tunable absorbance detector (Waters model 486) and equipped with an oven. During the purification procedure, the internal diameter of the column was chosen according to the amount of peptide to be purified, while the modification of the gradient was necessary to increase peptide separation. In all HPLC purification steps, the column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 225 nm to have the most appropriate signal/noise ratio. Fractions were hand-collected in order to have one individual peak per fraction. The presence of antimicrobial activity was detected using liquid growth inhibition assays under the conditions described below. The following are the bacterial strains used with their source (gifts from colleagues): M. luteusA270 from the Pasteur Institut Collection (Paris) and E. coli SBS363 and E. coli 1106 from P. L. Boquet (Center d'Etudes Nucléaires, Saclay). The filamentous fungi and the yeast strains used in this study were generous gifts from different colleagues: Aspergillus fumigatus (H. Koenig, Laboratoire de Mycologie, Faculté de Médecine, Strasbourg, France),Fusarium culmorum (IMI 180420), Fusarium oxysporum (MUCL 909), Nectria hematococca (Collection Van Etten 160-2-2), Neurospora crassa (CBS 327-54),Trichoderma viride (MUCL 19724) (Université Catholique de Leuven, Belgique), Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans (H. Koenig, Laboratoire de Mycologie, Faculté de Médecine, Strasbourg, France), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SociétéTransgène, Strasbourg, France). During the various steps of purification, antibacterial activity was monitored by a liquid growth inhibition assay on the Gram-positive strain M. luteus and on the Gram-negative strain E. coli 363. Ninety μl of a suspension of a midlogarithmic phase culture of bacteria at a starting A 600 = 0.001 in Poor Broth nutrient medium (1% Bacto-Tryptone and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.5) were added to 10 μl of fraction to analyze. Microbial growth was assessed by an increase in A 600 after a 24-h incubation at 30 °C using a microtitration plate reader. Fungal spores (final concentration 104 spores/ml) were suspended in ½ Potato Dextrose Broth (Difco), and the yeast strains were suspended at a starting A 600= 0.001 in the yeast complete medium YPG (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 2% glucose). The medium was supplemented with tetracyclin (10 mg/ml) and cefotaxim (100 μg/ml), dispensed by aliquots of 80 μl into wells of a microplate containing 20 μl of either water or the fraction to be analyzed. Growth of fungi and yeast was evaluated after 24 h at 30 °C by optical microscopy and after 48 h by measuring the culture absorbance at 595 nm using a microplate reader. In the conditions where the antifungal assay was performed in the presence of salt, the ½ Potato Dextrose Broth medium was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, 137 mm NaCl. The procedure used for the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was identical to that for the antifungal assay. The MIC values are expressed as an interval (a–b), wherea is the highest peptide concentration tested at which fungi or yeast are still growing and b is the lowest concentration that causes 100% growth inhibition. Spores of N. crassa were cultured in the presence of 0.04–20 μm peptide. After 48 h, the ½ Potato Dextrose Broth medium containing the peptide was removed and replaced by fresh medium. Two days later, the cultures were examined microscopically and spectrometrically. Peptide purity was ascertained by capillary zone electrophoresis. Analysis was performed on a model 270-HT capillary electrophoresis system (PE Applied Biosystems). Two nl of the sample were injected using vacuum to a 50 μm × 72-cm fused silica capillary and run in 20 mm citrate buffer at pH 2.5 under 20 kV from anode to cathode at 30 °C for 20 min. Migration was monitored at 200 nm. Automated Edman degradation of the native and pyridylethylated peptides and detection of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were performed on a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (PE Applied Biosystems, model 473A). One nmol of purified peptide was submitted to reduction andS-pyridylethylation. The procedure used was reported previously (22Bulet P. Cociancich S. Reuland M. Sauber F. Bischoff R. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on a Bruker BIFLEXTM(Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer operating in a positive linear mode as described previously (23Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Moniatte M. Lambert J. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The pyridylethylated peptide (200 pmol) was treated with endoproteinase Lys-C (Achromobacter protease I; Takara, Otsu, Japan). Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 6 h in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9) in the presence of 0.01% Tween 20 at a peptide/enzyme ratio of 1:40 (w/w). The reaction was stopped by acidification with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide fragments were separated on a narrow bore reversed-phase column (Delta Pak HPIC18, 2 × 150 mm, Waters). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) from 2 to 60% over 80 min at 37 °C at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The fragments were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS, and the enzymatically derived fragment corresponding to the C terminus of the protein was sequenced by Edman degradation. Eight μg of the native peptide were treated with thermolysin at a peptide/enzyme ratio of 1:2 (w/w) for 1 h in 0.1m MES buffer at pH 7.4 at 37 °C in presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The digestion was stopped by adding 50 μl of 70% formic acid. The peptide mixture resulting from the enzymatic digestion was subjected to the same reversed-phase HPLC column as above. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water from 2 to 50% over 100 min after an isocratic period at 2% acetonitrile during 10 min. The peptides generated by protease treatment were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS. The E. coli strain DH5α was used in the cloning procedures, and the S. cerevisiae strain TGY 48–1 was used for expression of recombinant peptide. Yeast cells were transformed using the lithium acetate method (24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura K. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformed colonies were selected on YNBG medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 1% glucose) supplemented with 0.5% casamino acids, lacking uracil. A synthetic gene encoding the 44-amino acid peptide was constructed by ligating three double-stranded oligonucleotide cassettes, preceded by the last five amino acids of the MFα1 proregion, into the HindIII and BamHI sites in the polylinker of pBS/SK+ (Stratagene). For this purpose, the six following oligonucleotides were used: SEA-5 (5′-AGCTTGGATAAAAGAGACAAGTTGATTGGCAGCTGTGTTTGGGGCGCCGTCA-3′), SEA-6 (5′-ACTACACTAGTGACTGCAACGGCGAGTGCAAGCGCCGCGGTTACAAGGGTGG-3′), SEA-7 (5′-CCATTGTGGATCCTTCGCTAACGTTAACTGTTGGTGTGAAACCTGATAGGTCGACA-3′), SEA-8 (5′-GATCTGTCGACCTATCAGGTTTCACACCAACAGTTAACGTTAGCGAAGGATC-3′), SEA-9 (5′-CACAATGGCCACCCTTGTAACCGCGGCGCTTGCACTCGCCGTTGCAGTCACT-3′), and SEA-10 (5′-AGTGTAGTTGACGGCGCCCCAAACACAGCTGCCAATCAACTTGTCTCTTTTATCCA-3′). Sites for restriction enzymes, which do not alter the coding sequence were incorporated into the synthetic gene where possible. TheHindIII–SalI fragment of the resulting plasmid containing the synthetic gene and theSphI–HindIII fragment of M13JM132 containing the MFα1 promoter and the preprosequence were subcloned into theSphI and SalI sites of JM138 to create the vector pSEA1. The SphI–SalI fragment of pSEA1 containing the full expression cassette for peptide production in yeast was then cloned into the yeast shuttle vector pTG4812 to give the expression plasmid pSEA2 (for more details, see Ref. 25Michaut L. Fehlbaum P. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Reichhart J.-M. Bulet P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The plasmids were all controlled by sequencing. S. cerevisiae strain TGY 48–1 was transformed with the expression plasmid pSEA2, and transformants were selected by growth at 29 °C on YNBG medium supplemented with casamino acids lacking uracil. For large scale peptide preparation, the culture medium was inoculated at a dilution of 1:50 with a 48-h preculture of the selected transformant, and an additional 48-h growth was performed at 29 °C. Yeast were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully decanted, and the pellet was discarded as the recombinant peptide was secreted from the cells. The supernatant was subjected to solid-phase extraction on an open column filled with C18 reversed phase (preparative C18, 125 Å, Waters; 48 g of phase/4 liters of supernatant), solvated with methanol, and further equilibrated with acidified water. Elution was performed with 40% acetonitrile in acidified water and lyophilized under vacuum, reconstituted in MilliQ water (Millipore Corp.), and applied on a cation column (Aquapore cation, 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm, Brownlee) equilibrated in 25 mm ammonium acetate buffer at pH 3.6. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–100% 1 m NaCl in ammonium acetate buffer over 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. During the purification step, the column effluent was monitored by absorbance at 225 nm. The collected fraction containing the peptide was desalted on a reversed-phase column (Aquapore preparative C18, 250 × 10 mm, Brownlee) equilibrated with 2% acetonitrile in acidified water. Elution was performed with a linear biphasic gradient of acetonitrile in acidified water from 2 to 20% over 10 min and from 20 to 40% over 30 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The fraction containing the peptide was lyophilized and kept as dry powder. One hundred fifth instar larvae ofH. virescens were challenged by injection of bacteria, and their hemolymph (2 ml) was collected after 24 h. In parallel, 2 ml of hemolymph from unchallenged larvae were treated under the same conditions. The hemocytes were removed by centrifugation, and the antimicrobial peptides were extracted from the cell-free hemolymph in acidic condition during 30 min in an ice-cold water bath under gentle shaking. The acidic extracts were then submitted to prepurification by solid phase extraction onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. Elution was sequentially performed with 10, 40, and 100% acetonitrile in acidified water. After concentration, the various fractions obtained from both acidic extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity by liquid growth inhibition assays against M. luteus, E. coli 363, and N. crassa. Only the 40% Sep-Pak fractions were found to contain antimicrobial activity and were further applied on an Aquapore RP-300 C8 column. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, and aliquots of the eluted fractions were tested for their antimicrobial activity by liquid growth inhibition assays against the three test organisms. Several fractions from immune larvae were found to contain strong antifungal and/or antibacterial activity (Fig. 1); in contrast, weak activities were detected in the control experiment (data not shown). Here we have focused on the purification of the compound present in fraction A eluted at 28% acetonitrile in acidified water, which exhibited the strongest antifungal activity. The active molecule was further purified by a two-step purification procedure (see “Materials and Methods”). Pure antifungal compound was obtained, as judged by capillary zone electrophoresis (data not shown). MALDI-TOF-MS gave a single molecular mass at 4784.8 Da, confirming the purity of the antifungal molecule (data not shown). One nmol of purified antifungal peptide was subjected to reduction andS-pyridylethylation and subsequently to MALDI-TOF-MS measurement. The obtained molecular mass at 5422.3 Da, in excess of 637.5 Da to the mass measured on the native molecule, corresponds to six pyridylethylated groups, suggesting the presence of six cysteine residues. One hundred pmol of the S-pyridylethylated peptide were then submitted to Edman degradation, and a partial 41-residue NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained (Fig.2). The mass calculated for this N-terminal sequence is lower by 333.4 Da than the measured molecular mass of the native peptide at 5422.3 Da. This clearly establishes that the sequence obtained by Edman degradation is only a partial sequence. To obtain the full sequence, we used endoproteinase Lys-C to cleave the pyridylethylated peptide after the Lys residues at positions 2, 23, and 28 under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” The digest was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (data not shown), and the peptide fragments were measured for their respective molecular masses by MALDI-TOF-MS. Five major peaks (2661.7, 2001.2, 2779.3, 2535.7, and 5422.5 in MH+) were obtained. The peak at 5422.5 MH+ (mass/charge) corresponds to the native molecule, while the peptide fragments yielding the molecular masses at 2778.3 and 2534.7 Da correspond to the predicted fragments from the N-terminal sequence. Only the fragments at 2661.7 and 2001.2 MH+ did not fit with any possible cleavage product, suggesting that both include the C-terminal end. The mass difference of 659.5 Da between these two fragments can be explained by the presence of the additional sequence Arg-Arg-Gly-Tyr-Lys (residues 24–28) in the N-terminal part of the 2661.7 MH+ fragment obtained by Edman degradation of the native peptide. To obtain the C-terminal sequence information, the shortest fragment was subjected to Edman degradation and the following sequence was obtained: Gly-Gly-His-Cys*-Gly-Ser-Phe-Ala-Asn-Val-Asn-Cys*-Trp-Cys*-Glu-Thr, where Cys* represents a pyridylethylated cysteine residue. The calculated mass of the sequence is in perfect agreement with the molecular mass of 2000.2 Da measured by MALDI-TOF-MS, establishing that there is no C-terminal amidation. The overlap observed with the N-terminal sequence confirmed the identity of this fragment as the C-terminal part of this 44-amino acid antifungal peptide. The full sequence of the molecule is shown in Fig. 2. The comparison between the calculated mass after Edman degradation (4791.3 Da) and the measured mass by MALDI-TOF-MS (4784.8 Da) indicates that the six cysteine residues are engaged in the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The data bank analysis (BLAST program in the data base Swiss-Prot; Ref. 26Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Biol. Mol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) showed that the peptide has significant sequence similarities with the Drosophila antifungal peptide drosomycin and insect defensins. Therefore, we assumed that the cysteine arrangement is identical to that of insect defensins (Cys(1)–Cys(4), Cys(2)–Cys(5), and Cys(3)–Cys(6)) (27Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Immunol.

https://openalex.org/W2048355846,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) activates transcription of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) gene through a major TGFβ-responsive region (−740 and −647) in the PAI-1 promoter. This process requires the Smad family of signaling molecules. Upon phosphorylation by the TGFβ receptors, Smad2 and Smad3 homoligomerize and heteroligomerize with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of TGFβ responsive genes. Smad3 and Smad4 have been shown to bind to various sites in the PAI-1 promoter. To determine the number of Smad-binding sites within the 94-base pair major TGFβ-responsive region and the mechanism of Smad-mediated transactivation, we systematically mapped the Smad-binding sites and show that Smad4 and Smad3 bind cooperatively to two adjacent DNA elements in this region. Both elements were required for TGFβ-induced, Smad3- and Smad4-dependent activation of PAI-1 transcription. Contrary to previous reports, transactivation of the PAI-1 promoter was mediated by the amino- but not carboxyl-terminal domains of the Smads. Furthermore, oligomerization of Smad3 markedly enhanced its binding to the two binding sites. Finally, a Smad4 mutation identified in a human pancreatic carcinoma that inactivates Smad4 signaling abolished Smad4 DNA binding activity, hence preventing transactivation of TGFβ-responsive genes. These results underscore the importance of the Smad4 DNA binding activity in controlling cell growth and carcinogenesis.

These results underscore the importance of the Smad4 DNA binding activity in controlling cell growth and carcinogenesis. transforming growth factor β polymerase chain reaction base pair Smad-binding element plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 glutathione S-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)1 is a multipotent cytokine that elicits many biological functions including inhibition of the growth of cells of epithelial, endothelial, and lymphoid origins, production of extracellular matrix components, and regulation of differentiation of many cell types (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 421-472Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by the cell surface types I and II TGFβ receptors, TβRI and TβRII, which are receptor serine/threonine kinases (2Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F.

Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, while the TβRI kinase is inactive, the TβRII kinase is constitutively active and the receptor is autophosphorylated (2Lin H.Y. Wang X.F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 5Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Binding of TGFβ1 to TβRII results in the formation of a heteromeric complex containing TβRI and TβRII, followed by transphosphorylation of TβRI by the TβRII kinase (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2116) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TβRI by TβRII is thought to activate the TβRI kinase activity, allowing it to phosphorylate and activate downstream Smad2 (7Baker J.C. Harland R.M.

A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The Smad family proteins are critical components of the TGFβ signaling pathway. Depending on their mechanisms of action, the Smads can be divided into three classes: pathway-restricted Smads, common-mediator Smads, and inhibitory Smads (13Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). All Smad proteins share considerable homology in their primary sequence and most contain two highly conserved Mad homology domains: MH1 in the amino-terminal half and MH2 in the carboxyl-terminal half separated by a diverse proline-rich linker. Upon stimulation by TGFβ1, the pathway restricted Smads, Smad2, and Smad3, interact with the TGFβ receptor complex, and become phosphorylated on three serine residues located at the carboxyl termini of the molecules (9Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 10Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S.

Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 then form a heteromeric complex with the common mediator Smad4 (14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), translocate into the nucleus, and activate transcription of TGFβ responsive genes. As the common mediator, Smad4 plays a central role in downstream signal transduction by the TGFβ receptor family members. By forming heteromeric complexes with various pathway restricted Smads, Smad4 participates in the activation of multiple signaling pathways initiated by TGFβ family members and may be directly involved in transcriptional activation of many downstream genes (14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As such, it plays a key role in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Indeed, mutations that inactivate Smad4 function have been detected in many types of human cancer, including cancers of the pancreas, colon, breast, neck, and stomach (17Barrett M.T. Schutte M.

Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, many of these Smad4 mutants are defective in transcriptional activation. The mechanisms by which Smad proteins activate transcription of specific genes are not well understood. The COOH-terminal MH2 domains of Smad1 have been shown to act as transcriptional activators when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (22Liu F. Hata A. Baker J.C. Doody J. Carcamo J. Harland R.M. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 381: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 have been shown to interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as FAST-1 and FAST-2 and participate in the regulation of transcriptional activation of specific promoters (23Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 24Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that a sequence-specific DNA-binding partner is required to bring the MH2 domain of the Smads into close proximity of a TGFβ responsive promoter in order to activate transcription. In agreement with this model, overexpression of the MH2 domains of Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 is sufficient to activate transcription of the p3TPlux luciferase reporter construct in a breast cancer cell line (14Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 15Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Smad3 may cooperate with general transcription factors such as Sp1 (26Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), AP1 (27Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R.

Recently, the NH2-terminal MH1 domains ofDrosophila Mad and human Smad3 and Smad4 were shown to possess sequence-specific DNA binding activity (30Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although Smad2 shares 91% sequence identity with Smad3, it does not bind DNA. Using a PCR-based selection procedure, an 8-bp palindromic DNA sequence (GTCTAGAC) was selected from a random pool of oligonucleotides as the optimal Smad-binding element (SBE) for both Smad3 and Smad4 (33Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the MH1 domain of Smad3 bound to SBE determined a minimal Smad box (GTCT) required for binding to Smad3 (34Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), although a high affinity interaction may require additional sequences. These results suggest that direct DNA binding of Smad3 and Smad4 may play a role in transcriptional activation by TGFβ. However, since the involvement of the MH1 domains of Smads in TGFβ-induced transcriptional activation has not been demonstrated, the exact role of the DNA binding activity of Smads in transactivation is not clear. The plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) promoter is the best characterized TGFβ-inducible promoter. Activation of PAI-1 gene expression occurs mostly at the level of transcription with fast kinetics (<30 min) and can reach up to 68-fold over the basal level (35Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Westerhausen Jr., D. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletional analysis suggested that there are multiple TGFβ responsive elements present in the PAI-1 promoter that, together, mediate optimal activation by TGFβ. Among these elements, a 94-bp region between −740 and −647 upstream of the initiation site was found to be the major TGFβ-responsive element that can mediate up to 50-fold activation of PAI-1 transcription (35Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Westerhausen Jr., D. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several AP1-like sequences within this region have been proposed to play an important role in mediating TGFβ responsiveness (35Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how TGFβ induces transcriptional activation through this element. Recently, Dennler et al. (32Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar) reported identification of a CAGA sequence found in three different locations in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene that, when concatemerized three times, can mediate direct binding of the Smad3 and Smad4 MH1 domains. Only one of the CAGA containing sequences is located within this 94-bp major TGFβ responsive element. Song et al. (37Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) reported that a 12-bp sequence which overlaps with the above described CAGA sequence can mediate Smad binding. We decided to carry out a detailed analysis of this major TGFβ responsive region to determine how many binding sites there are in this region of the PAI-1 promoter and whether the Smad-binding sites can mediate transcriptional activation in response to TGFβ. We have identified two specific Smad-binding sites in this region which mediate cooperative binding of Smad3 and Smad4 and are required for TGFβ-induced transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 promoter. These two sites mediate a much stronger binding to Smads than the previously reported CAGA containing sequences. A point mutation identified in human pancreatic cancer that inactivates Smad4 function was found to destroy the DNA binding activity of Smad4. Finally, we showed that oligomerization of the Smad proteins are not required for DNA binding. Flag-tagged human Smad2 and Smad4 cDNA in pCMV5B as well as Smad4 in pGEX-4T were kindly provided by J. Wrana and L. Attisano (9Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Human Smad3 cDNA was a generous gift from R. Derynck (11Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). To express full-length Smad3 and Smad3 and Smad4 mutants in Escherichia coli, the Smad3 and Smad4 mutants were PCR amplified and cloned into pGEX4T-1. NH2- and COOH-terminal Smad mutants included the following amino acid residues: Smad4N, 1–318; Smad4C, 319–551; Smad3N, 1–201; and Smad3C, 230–426. Mutations were generated using a PCR based approach and verified by sequencing. p3TPlux was kindly provided by J. Massague (38Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). To generate 4 × wild-type PAI-1(−740/−647), a DNA fragment containing sequences between −647 and −740 from the PAI-1 promoter (39van Zonneveld A.J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The PCR product was digested with BamHI and BglII and self-ligated in the same orientation. A fragment containing four copies of the PAI-1 promoter sequence in the same orientation was then cloned into pGL2-promoter vector (Promega) at the BglII site. PAI-1 promoter sequences containing various point mutations were generated by PCR, and multimerized similarly as described for the wild-type promoter constructs. 293T cells were kindly provided by W. Pears (40Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8366-8392Crossref Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Hep3B, a human hepatoma cell line (ATCC), was maintained in minimum essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TGFβ1 is a kind gift from R&D systems. The monoclonal antibody against the Flag tag (M2) was purchased from Kodak and Sigma. The antibody against Smad2/3 (E-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal antibody against a NH2-terminal peptide sequence of Smad4 was kindly provided by X. Liu. GST fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from E. coli as described (41Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 16.7.1-12.7.7Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage was performed with proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose (41Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 16.7.1-12.7.7Google Scholar). After elution, glycerol was added to 15% and proteins were stored at −80C. Flag-tagged and HA-tagged Smad proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from transfected 293T cells as described (42Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and Flag- or HA-tagged proteins isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or anti-HA affinity beads. Proteins were eluted from the antibody column with the elution solution containing 1 mg/ml Flag or HA peptide (Sigma) and quantified by Western blotting. 293T cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (5Luo K. Lodish H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hep3B cells were transfected using a LipofectAMINE protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). For luciferase assay, a total of 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 1 μg of Smad proteins) was used for each transfection. 24 h after transfection, Hep3B cells were starved in serum-free media for 8 h and stimulated with 50 pm TGFβ1 for 16 h as described (26Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For EMSA assays, various amounts of recombinant proteins were incubated with 2 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled probes for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 35 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% Nonidet P-40). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% TBE. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in the EMSA assay are: Probe A (PAI-1 promoter region, −688/−660): wild-type: 5′- GAGAGTCTGGACACGTGGGGAGTCAGCCG-3′; M1 5′-GAGAGTCTGGACACGTGGGCATTAAGCCG-3′; M2 5′-GAGACATTGGACACGTGGGGAGTCAGCCG-3′; M3 5′-GAGACATTGGACACGTGGGCATTAAGCCG-3′. Probe B (PAI-1 promoter region, −675/−647): wild-type 5′-CGTGGGGAGTCAGCCGTGTATCATCGGAG-3′; M4 5′-CGTGGGCATTAAGCCGTGTATCATCG-3′; M5 5′-CGTGGGGAGTCAGCCGAATATACTCGGAG-3′. Probe C (PAI-1 promoter region, −732/−698): wild-type 5′GCCAGACAAGGTTGTTGACACAAGAGAGCCCTCAG-3′. Probe D (PAI-1 promoter region, −740/−714): wild-type 5′-CAACCTCAGCCAGACAAGGTTGTTGAC-3′; M6 5′-CAACCTCAGCTATGTAAGGTTGTTGAC-3′. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, and gel-purified (43Buratowski S. Chodosh L.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 12.2.1-12.2.11Google Scholar). The complete PAI-1 −740/−647 region was digested from p3TPlux usingBamHI and end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA were used to determine whether Smad3 and Smad4 directly bind to the major TGFβ responsive region between −740 and −647 upstream of the initiation site in the PAI-1 promoter. Recombinant full-length Smad3 and Smad4 were purified from E. coli and incubated with the 32P-labeled 94-bp DNA fragment (probe FL). As shown in Fig.1, both GST-Smad4 and GST-Smad3 bound to this DNA fragment and induced a shift in the mobility of the labeled probe (lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 1). To further pinpoint the region that mediates Smad binding, four overlapping oligonucleotide probes that cover the entire 94-bp region were synthesized and tested in the EMSA assay (Fig. 1). Among the four probes, probe A mediated strongest binding to Smad4 (lane 3, Fig. 1), while the other three probes all bound weakly (lanes 4–6, Fig. 1). Therefore, the sequences between −688 and −660 covered by probe A contain the major binding sites for Smad4. Similar results were obtained for Smad3 (data not shown). The CAGA containing sequence that was previously reported to mediate Smad3 binding is covered by probes C and D. The 12-bp region that was reported by Song et al. (37Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to bind Smad3 was also included in probes C and D. Neither probes displayed a significant affinity for Smads in our experiment (Fig. 1). A careful examination of the DNA sequences between −688 and −660 revealed two potentially important sequence motifs: one is similar to the SBE identified previously as the optimal Smad-binding sequence (33Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) with a single A to G change at position 5 (SBE, GTCTAGAC; PAI-1 −684/−677, GTCTGGAC), but the minimal Smad box is intact (34Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Six base pairs 3′ to the SBE-like element is an AP1-like motif which contains a single base pair change from the consensus AP1 site (AP1, TGA(g/c)TCA; PAI-1 −670/−664, GGAGTCA) (Fig.2 A). This AP1-like site has been implicated in mediating TGFβ-induced transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene (35Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the type I collagen gene (44Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The last four nucleotides in this AP1-like motif is also homologous to the Smad box (GTCT) (34Shi Y. Wang Y.-F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) with 1-bp mismatch (GTCA). To determine whether the two motifs are required for interaction with Smad4, oligonucleotide probes containing point mutations in either of the two elements were generated (Fig.2 A) and their ability to complex with Smad4 was tested by EMSA (Fig. 2 B). Mutation of either the SBE-like site or AP1-like site significantly reduced binding by GST-Smad4 (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 2 B), while mutation of both site I and site II completely abolished binding of Smad4 (lane 4, Fig. 2 B). This suggests that there are two Smad4-binding sites in probe A and that both sites are important for interaction with Smad4. Between the two sites, site I is the predominant one since mutation of this site (probe M2) resulted in a greater decrease in Smad4 interaction (lane 3, Fig.2 B). Interaction of Smad4 with site II, although weaker, was also specific (see below and Fig. 3). As a control, GST alone did not bind to probe A (lane 10, Fig.2 B). Furthermore, cleavage of GST by thrombin resulted in a Smad4 that bound to probe A in a manner indistinguishable from that of the GST-fusion proteins (lanes 5–8, Fig. 2 B), confirming that the observed DNA binding activity was not due to the presence of GST.Figure 2Smad3 and Smad4 bind to two adjacent DNA regions in the PAI-1 promoter in a cooperative manner.

https://openalex.org/W2036953184,"Helicobacter pylori secretes a cytotoxin (VacA) that induces the formation of large vacuoles originating from late endocytic vesicles in sensitive mammalian cells. Although evidence is accumulating that VacA is an A-B toxin, distinct A and B fragments have not been identified. To localize the putative catalytic A-fragment, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding truncated forms of VacA fused to green fluorescence protein. By analyzing truncated VacA fragments for intracellular vacuolating activity, we reduced the minimal functional domain to the amino-terminal 422 residues of VacA, which is less than one-half of the full-length protein (953 amino acids). VacA is frequently isolated as a proteolytically nicked protein of two fragments that remain noncovalently associated and retain vacuolating activity. Neither the amino-terminal 311 residue fragment (p33) nor the carboxyl-terminal 642 residue fragment (p70) of proteolytically nicked VacA are able to induce cellular vacuolation by themselves. However, co-transfection of HeLa cells with separate plasmids expressing both p33 and p70 resulted in vacuolated cells. Further analysis revealed that a minimal fragment comprising just residues 312–478 functionally complemented p33. Collectively, our results suggest a novel molecular architecture for VacA, with cytosolic localization of both fragments of nicked toxin required to mediate intracellular vacuolating activity.

Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In general, the B component of an A-B toxin binds to specific mammalian cell-surface receptors and facilitates the membrane translocation of an enzymic A moiety into the cytosol. The A moiety covalently modifies a specific intracellular target molecule, resulting in the disruption of important cellular functions. VacA has recently been shown to bind to specific, high affinity cell surface receptors (28Pagliaccia C. de Bernard M. Lupetti P. Ji X. Burroni D. Cover T.L. Papini E. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L.

By transfecting HeLa cells with plasmids expressing VacA and thereby eliminating the necessity for receptor binding and membrane translocation, de Bernard and co-workers (24de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) demonstrated that VacA functions from within the host cell cytosol. Significantly, vacuolation of host cells was observed before VacA was detectable in the cells, indicating that the potency of the toxin may be attributed to a discrete enzymatic moiety, which amplifies the effects of the toxin within the cell (27Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 35Montecucco C. Papini E. Schiavo G. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1026-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although these data strongly suggest that VacA is an A-B toxin, distinct A and B fragments have not been identified. Because a catalytic function has not yet been identified for VacA, it is not currently feasible to identify the putative A-fragment by testing truncated toxin fragments for enzymatic activity. However, we hypothesized that the A-fragment would induce vacuolation from the host cell cytosol in the absence of the B fragment of the toxin. To localize the putative VacA A-fragment, we genetically constructed amino and carboxyl-terminal truncations of VacA. Plasmids encoding these fragments were used to transfect HeLa cells, which were analyzed for vacuolation. These investigations revealed that a discrete VacA fragment can function from the host cell cytosol to induce vacuoles with properties similar to those caused by full-length toxin added externally to cells. In addition, we discovered that determinants from both fragments of proteolytically nicked toxin can function in trans within the host cell cytosol to induce degenerative vacuolation. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings with respect to the molecular organization of VacA. Importantly, the identification of a discrete A fragment may be a critical step preceding discovery of the enzymatic activity of the toxin, because a number of bacterial toxins, including diphtheria and cholera, are secreted as proenzymes, which require activation to elaborate their catalytic activities (36Drazin R.

Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). High fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleotides were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

Vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase (ATCC 2153-VR) and H. pylori strain 60190 (ATCC 49503) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

The gene for VacA was amplified directly from H. pylori strain 60190 genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pTRE (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA), which was the parent plasmid used as template for all the VacA-GFP fusions and VacA fragments generated for these investigations. The gene encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) was extracted from pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) and subcloned into pET20b replacing the BamHI andNotI fragment in the polyclonal region. All the VacA fragments were cloned into the modified pET20b-GFP, or pET-20b alone, which harbors a T7 promoter, replacing theNdeI-BamHI fragment of the polyclonal region. Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed for the two fragments of nicked VacA based on previous reports describing the cleavage site between the two fragments of the nicked protein (5Telford J.

These two fragments comprise residues 1–311 and 312–953, and are referred to as p33 and p70 respectively based on their calculated molecular weights of approximately 33 and 70 kDa. Plasmids were recovered from transformedE. coli XL1-blue, purified, and used for HeLa cell transfections as described below. Full-length VacA and all VacA fragments were sequenced across the length of the entire open reading frame using the Thermo Sequenase dye terminator cycle sequencing pre-mix kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HeLa cells were cultured as monolayers in 25-ml plastic flasks (Corning; Cambridge, MA) in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM)1 containing 10% fetal bovine calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Twenty-four h before experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well titration plates in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine calf serum at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. HeLa cells were plated (200 μl) at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning; Cambridge, MA) in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine calf serum, 100 units penicillin/ml, and 100 mg of streptomycin/ml. HeLa cells were first infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7) bearing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (39Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus stock was trypsinized at 37 °C for 30 min and added to HeLa cells (24de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After infection for 30 min, virus stock was removed, and the HeLa cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (38Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). After the transfection procedure, the cells were incubated in DMEM + 5 mm NH4Cl at 37 °C for 20 h before analysis. We quantified relative vacuolation based on the HeLa cell uptake of the dye neutral red as described previously (40Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in 96-well plates, and neutral red uptake was determined using a Dynatech MR5000 microtiter plate reader to measure the absorbances at 530 nm (minus the absorbance at 410 nm). To confirm green fluorescence protein (GFP) fluorescence in transfected HeLa cells, the cells were visualized using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope outfitted with a Xenon lamp and fluorescence filter combinations for fluorescence microscopy. Two h after transfection of HeLa cells, transfection reagents were replaced with DMEM and 5 mm NH4Cl supplemented with the indicated concentrations of bafilomycin A1 or monensin and incubated for 20 h under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The minimal VacA vacuolating domain was mapped by transfecting HeLa cells with pET-20b harboring genes encoding either the mature VacA peptide (residues 1–953) cloned from the 60190 toxigenic strain of H. pylori or truncated fragments of VacA fused to GFP. To improve protein expression, HeLa cells were first infected with recombinant vaccinia virus (vT7) bearing the gene for phage T7 RNA polymerase followed by transfection with pET-20b encoding VacA fragments fused to GFP (24de Bernard M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Using this system, 50–70% of the cells clearly demonstrated GFP fluorescence (data not shown), which appeared essentially identical to previously published data (24de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells transfected with VacA-GFP, vacuolation was observed only in those cells demonstrating GFP fluorescence. VacA-GFP fusions could be detected by GFP fluorescence 5–8 h after transfection, whereas vacuoles were already clearly visible after 4 h, also confirming previously reported results that vacuolation was detected before GFP fluorescence could be visualized in the cell cytosol (24de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed to express multiple VacA fragments lacking portions of the carboxyl terminus. These deletions yielded VacA amino-terminal fragments of 349, 373, 394, 422, 478, 538, 670, and 741 amino acids with or without GFP fusions (Fig.1 B). Purified plasmids expressing either full-length toxin or truncation mutants were used to transfect HeLa cells, which had been previously infected with vT7. Twenty h after transfection, HeLa cells were analyzed for both GFP fluorescence and uptake of neutral red. Analysis of the truncation mutants revealed that when VacA is directly expressed in the host cell cytosol, the carboxyl terminus is not essential for inducing vacuole formation (Fig. 1). Residues 1–478 (475 carboxyl-terminal deletion of VacA) fused to GFP induced vacuolation of HeLa cells, whereas a fragment comprising VacA residues 1–422 fused to GFP (531 carboxyl-terminal deletion of VacA) was unable to induce detectable vacuolation (Fig. 1 A). To test if the carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion interfered with the vacuolating activity of the 422-residue VacA fragment, this fragment was also expressed in the HeLa cell cytosol without the GFP fusion. Although the 422-residue VacA fragment with a free carboxyl terminus was sufficient to mediate vacuolation, neither a shorter VacA fragment comprising residues 1–394 nor any smaller fragment induced vacuolation (Fig. 1 B). To determine the importance of the VacA amino terminus in the intracellular activity of the toxin, a series of amino-terminal truncation mutants fused to GFP were generated comprising residues 18–741, 57–741, and 198–741 (Fig.2 B). The plasmids encoding these fragments were used to transfect HeLa cells after infection of the cells with vT7. The extent of vacuolation was determined by quantifying neutral red uptake. The expression of VacA fragments fused to GFP was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy. None of the amino-terminal truncations were able to induce intracellular vacuolation (Fig. 2). Deletion of only 17 residues resulted in the loss of VacA-mediated vacuolating activity (Fig. 2 A), indicating that in contrast to the carboxyl terminus, the VacA amino terminus appears to be essential for inducing intracellular vacuolation. VacA is often isolated as a proteolytically nicked protein of two fragments comprising residues 1–311 and 312–953 of the mature protein (p33 and p70, respectively) (5Telford J. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Tecci M. Censini S. Covacci A. Xiang Z. Papini E. Montecucco C. Parente L. Rappuoli R. J. Exp.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As previously reported, HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding either of these fragments separately were not vacuolated (24de Bernard M. Arico B. Papini E. Rizzuto R. Grandi G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether p33 and p70 can induce vacuolation when introduced together into cells, we co-transfected HeLa cells with separate plasmids encoding these two fragments. These co-transfection experiments revealed that the two fragments were able to functionally complement each other to induce fully vacuolated cells (Fig. 3). Notably, GFP fused to the carboxyl terminus of p33 did not interfere with p70 complementation. If VacA is an A-B toxin, this would be the first example in which two distinct fragments functionally complement each other from within the host cell cytosol to mediate toxin activity. Having demonstrated that more than 500 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of nonnicked VacA are not required for intracellular vacuolation (Fig. 1), we next tested whether the entire p70 carboxyl terminus was required when co-expressed with p33. Plasmids encoding smaller fragments of p70 were designed based on the carboxyl-terminal truncations described above. Co-transfection experiments revealed that a 167-residue VacA fragment comprising amino acids 312–478 with or without GFP fusions functionally complemented inactive p33 to induce intracellular vacuolation (Fig. 3 A). However, the smaller 111-residue p70 fragment comprising VacA residues 312–422 did not complement p33, regardless of whether or not the fragment was expressed as a fusion protein with GFP. Ammonium ions potentiate VacA-mediated cellular vacuolation regardless of whether toxin is added externally or introduced directly into the cytosol of HeLa cells (42Cover T.L. Vaughn S.G. Cao P. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The potentiation mechanism is believed to involve osmotic swelling of vacuolar vesicles, which have taken up NH4Cl subsequent to a VacA-induced perturbation of cellular endocytic trafficking (42Cover T.L. Vaughn S.G. Cao P. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, when HeLa cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding the minimal functional VacA fragment (residues 1–422), vacuole formation was potentiated by the presence of 5 mm NH4Cl. Likewise, in co-transfection experiments in which VacA fragments were expressed from separate plasmids, vacuolation of HeLa cells was also potentiated by 5 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 4). In the absence of NH4Cl, VacA fragments expressed in the cytosol of host cell were attenuated in vacuolation activity, as demonstrated by the inhibited uptake of neutral red by transfected HeLa cells. Cell vacuolation induced by VacA is strictly dependent on the function of vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps (34Papini E. Gottardi E. Satin B. de Bernard M. Massari P. Telford J. Rappuoli R. Sato S.B. Montecucco C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 45: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether vacuoles formed by the fragments of VacA expressed in the cytosol are similar to those produced by full-length VacA, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids expressing full-length VacA fused to GFP or the active VacA fragment comprising residues 1–422. In addition, we co-transfected HeLa cells with plasmids expressing p33-GFP and p70-GFP. We introduced bafilomycin A1 (2–25 nm), which targets vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps and has been shown to inhibit VacA-induced cellular vacuolation (43Cover T.L. Reddy L.Y. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, 5–10 nmbafilomycin A1 inhibited neutral red uptake by approximately 50%. Increasing, the drug to 25 nm nearly abolished vacuole formation, indicating that the vacuoles formed intracellularly by minimal VacA fragments also require active vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps. Monensin was also reported in earlier studies to inhibit vacuole formation when the toxin was added externally to the cells (42Cover T.L. Vaughn S.G. Cao P. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To compare whether monensin inhibits the intracellular activity of VacA as well as the activity of externally added toxin, we tested the effects of monensin (0.2–5.0 μg/ml) on these same VacA fragments expressed from the cytosol of HeLa cells. Monensin addition yielded a concentration-dependent blockage of VacA-induced vacuolation (Fig. 5 B); 0.75–2.0 μg/ml monensin inhibited neutral red uptake by approximately 50%, and 5 μg/ml almost completely inhibited neutral red uptake. Collectively, these results indicate that vacuoles induced by VacA fragments functioning directly from within the host cell cytosol are similar to those induced by full-length toxin. In the absence of a defined biochemical activity for VacA, it is not currently possible to localize an isolated catalytic domain using enzyme activity assays to analyze smaller toxin fragments. However, we expressed VacA fragments in the cytosol of HeLa cells to determine the minimal domain, which induces vacuolation similar to whole toxin added externally to cells. By eliminating the necessity for receptor binding and translocation, we hypothesized that the B fragment of the toxin could be entirely removed without affecting the ability of the toxin to act intracellularly. Other toxin A fragments have been shown to be entirely functional when translocated into host cells by alternative means in the absence of the B fragment of the toxin. For example, catalytically active A fragments of diphtheria toxin,Pseudomonas exotoxin A, and shiga toxin have all been successfully introduced into mammalian cells using the B fragment of anthrax toxin (44Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 45Blanke S.R. Milne J.C. Benson E.L. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our investigations demonstrated that an amino-terminal fragment of approximately 422 residues comprises a minimal VacA domain that can mediate vacuole formation from the host cell cytosol. More than 50% of the 953 amino acids can be deleted from the VacA carboxyl terminus without affecting intracellular vacuolating activity, supporting the hypothesis that VacA contains a discrete A domain responsible for catalytic activity. Furthermore, truncations of greater than 17 residues from the amino-terminal end of VacA abolished vacuolating activity, emphasizing the importance of the amino terminus to vacuolating activity. Although HeLa cells transfected with plasmids encoding truncated VacA-GFP fusion proteins exhibited fluorescence, it cannot be ruled out at this time that the lack of detectable cellular vacuolation is because of amino-terminal loss or degradation by way of selective proteolysis. Based on our data, we propose that the putative A-fragment of VacA is located in the amino-terminal half of the toxin, whereas the B-fragment receptor binding and translocation determinants comprise the carboxyl-terminal half of the toxin. We isolate VacA from H. pylori primarily as two distinct fragments (p33 and p70) that remain noncovalently associated and retain vacuolating activity subsequent to proteolytic nicking at amino acid 311 (5Telford J. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Tecci M. Censini S. Covacci A. Xiang Z. Papini E. Montecucco C. Parente L. Rappuoli R. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although it was initially speculated that p33 and p70 may constitute A and B fragments of the toxin, neither p33 nor p70 alone were able to induce vacuolation when HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids separately encoding these genes. This suggests that the A fragment of the toxin may include domains from both fragments (25Cover T.L. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support this proposal, indicating that both p33 and the amino terminus of p70 are required to intracellularly induce vacuolation. In single transfection experiments, 422 residues of VacA were essential for vacuolating activity. However, in co-transfection experiments, a larger fragment of p70 (residues 312–478) was required to complement inactive p33. It is not known whether residues 423–478 are required for direct interaction with p33 or alternatively, if the relatively short 111-amino acid polypeptide (residues 312–422) is unable to fold into a functional domain. Our results suggest an interesting and perhaps unique molecular structure for VacA among the A-B toxins. Complementation of inactive p33 with a 167-residue fragment of p70 indicates that both fragments are essential. However, it is unclear whether both fragments comprise essential domains of the putative catalytic core of the toxin. We also show that GFP fused to the p33 carboxyl terminus does not interfere with functional complementation by p70, suggesting that the essential determinants of toxin activity are not contiguous across the p33-p70 cleavage site at residue 311. In addition, these results are consistent with a recently published report that 46 residues at the interface between the two VacA fragments could be eliminated without affecting toxin activity (48Burroni D. Lupetti P. Pagliaccia C. Reyrat J.M. Dallai R. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5547-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if VacA possesses a discrete catalytic domain, it is unlikely that it spans the p33-p70 interface. It is possible that a putative VacA catalytic domain may be composed of noncontiguous domains requiring assembly before elaborating the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although some enzymes can be dissected and the fragments functionally reassembled (23Corradin G. Harbury H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3036-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Kato I. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1004-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Shiba K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this has not previously been demonstrated for any toxin A-fragment. Alternatively, p33 and p70 could conceivably possess independent functions, both of which are required for mediating an undefined mechanism to induce formation of vacuoles within the host cell cytosol. In summary, we have provided the first direct evidence for localization of the putative VacA A-fragment to the amino-terminal half of the toxin. Furthermore, determinants from both fragments of proteolytically nicked VacA are required for the elaboration of toxin activity from within the host cell cytosol. Investigations are ongoing to further localize a discrete catalytic core. Mapping this functional domain as well as the receptor binding and translocation domains, will not only be important to begin understanding the mechanism of VacA cytotoxicity and toxin structure-function relationships but will also be critical to identify stable, nontoxic subdomains as immunogens for incorporation into protective vaccines against H. pylori.

Human B-lymphocyte lines do express truncated, inactive iPLA2 sequences that contain the ankyrin repeat domain but lack the catalytic domain and are thought to arise from alternative splicing of the transcript (21Larsson P.K.A. Claesson H.-E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the truncated sequences with full-length human iPLA2 attenuates catalytic activity (21Larsson P.K.A. Claesson H.-E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because the active form of iPLA2 is an oligomeric complex (8Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22Ackerman E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that may result from subunit associations through ankyrin repeat domains (8Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), this suggests that formation of hetero-oligomeric complexes represents a means to regulate iPLA2 activity (21Larsson P.K.A. Claesson H.-E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). That mechanisms of iPLA2regulation differ among human cell types is suggested by the fact that stimuli that induce iPLA2-catalyzed arachidonate release and leukotriene production in human granulocytes fail to induce these events in human lymphocyte lines, even though both classes of cells express iPLA2 and leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes (17Larsson Forsell P.K.A. Runarsson G. Ibrahim M. Bjorkholm M. Claesson H.-E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,21Larsson P.K.A. Claesson H.-E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One human cell type in which iPLA2 may be biomedically important is the pancreatic islet beta cell. Impaired beta cell survival and signaling functions underlie development of types I and II diabetes mellitus, respectively; these are the most prevalent human endocrine diseases. In rodent islets, iPLA2 has been proposed to play a signaling role in glucose-induced insulin secretion (8Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13499-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but iPLA2mRNA has not been demonstrated in human islets. We have cloned human beta cell iPLA2 cDNA here and find that human islets express mRNA species encoding two iPLA2 isoforms with different sizes (85 and 88 kDa) and catalytic properties. We have also determined the human iPLA2 gene structure and its chromosomal location and find that the transcript encoding the short isoform arises from an exon-skipping mechanism of alternative splicing. The compounds [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [35S]dATPS (1000 Ci/mmol), andl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (50 mCi/mmol) and ECL detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the BEL ((E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one) iPLA2 suicide substrate was obtained from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). A human placental genomic DNA library in lambda FIX II was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Human promonocytic U937 cells (30Sundstrom C. Nilsson K. Int. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), labeled with32P, and used to screen a human insulinoma cDNA library (32Ferrer J. Wasson J. Permutt A. Diabetologia. 1996; 38: 891-898Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) provided by Dr. Alan Permutt of Washington University. Insert sizes in clones that hybridized with the probe were determined by digestion with restriction endonucleases, and their sequences were determined from the double strand (33Sanger F. Nickeln S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Two cDNA species were obtained that contained about 1.80 and 1.59 kb, respectively, of the 3′-sequence of human iPLA2 cDNA, including the poly(A) tail. Neither contained the 5′-end of the full coding sequence, and RT-PCR was therefore performed with human islet RNA. Islets were isolated from human pancreata in the Washington University Diabetes Research and Training Center (34Ricordi C. Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Olack B.J. Scharp D.W. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 413-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured as described (35Ramanadham S. Hsu F.-F. Bohrer A. Nowatzke W. Ma Z. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4553-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from human islets and promonocytic U937 cells and first strand cDNA prepared by reverse transcription (RT) using standard procedures (36Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battery J.F. Wonsiewicz M. Greenfield S. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Appleton and Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 335-338Google Scholar). PCRs were performed under described conditions (10Ma Z.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (36Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battery J.F. Wonsiewicz M. Greenfield S. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Appleton and Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 335-338Google Scholar). Primers used to generate the 5′ portion of human iPLA2 cDNA were sense (5′-GATGCAGTTCTTTGGACGCCTGG-3′), antisense (5′-T-CAGCATCACCTTGGGT-TTCC-3′), and nested antisense (5-AATGGCCAGGGCCAGGATG-C-3′). Two distinct cDNA fragments were obtained, subcloned, sequenced, and found to extend from the 5′-initiator codon through about 1.59 and 1.79 kb of DNA, respectively. The cDNA fragments obtained from screening the human insulinoma cell cDNA library overlapped at their 5′-ends with 3′-ends of cDNA fragments from RT-PCR of human islet RNA, and the overlapping region contained anNcoI site. The fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SK. Fragments from RT-PCR of human islet RNA contained the iPLA2 5′-coding sequence and were released from plasmids with EcoRI and NcoI. Products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated with a plasmid containing the 3′-end of human iPLA2 cDNA that had been treated withNcoI. Ligation product plasmids were used to transform bacterial host cells and sequenced. The resultant cDNA species contained complete coding sequences of human iPLA2 isoforms and were inserted into appropriate vectors for expression and used to prepare 32P-labeled human iPLA2 cDNA for genomic screening. The cDNA species encoding full-length human islet iPLA2 isoforms were subcloned in-frame into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pET-28c (Novagen). The constructs were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, sequenced, and transformed into bacterial expression host BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cells transformed with pET28c without insert were negative controls. Protein expression was induced by treating cells with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses with Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblotting under described conditions (10Ma Z.

The Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf9) insect cell-baculovirus system used to express other PLA2 enzymes in catalytically active forms (37Becker G.W. Miller J.R. Kovacevic S. Ellis R. Louis A.I. Small J.S.

The iPLA2cDNA inserts were released from pBluescript SK plasmids by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned intoEco RI and Xho I sites of pBAC-1 baculovirus transfer plasmid (Novagen). Sf9 cells were co-transfected with this transfer plasmid and linearized baculovirus DNA (BacVector-2000, Novagen) to construct recombinant baculovirus with human islet iPLA2 isoform cDNA inserts. Infection and culture were performed under described conditions (47Nowatzke W. Ramanadham S. Ma Z. Hsu F.-F. Bohrer A. Turk J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At 48 h after infection, Sf9 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mmimidazole, pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. Cytosolic and membranous fractions were prepared by sequential centrifugations (10,000 × g for 10 min and 100,000 ×g for 60 min) and used for PLA2 activity assays. The protein content of Sf9 cell cytosolic and membranous fractions was determined by Bio-Rad assay, and iPLA2 activity was measured in aliquots (approximately 20 μg of protein) added to assay buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; total assay volume, 200 μl) containing 5 mm EGTA with or without 1 mmATP. Some aliquots were pretreated (2 min) with BEL (10 μm) before the assay. Reactions were initiated by injecting substrate (l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine; specific activity, 50 Ci/mol; final concentration, 5 μm) in ethanol (5 μl). Assay mixtures were incubated (3 min at 37 °C), and reactions were terminated by adding butanol (0.1 ml) and vortexing. After centrifugation (2000 × g for 4 min), products in the butanol layer were analyzed by silica gel G TLC in hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1). The TLC region containing free arachidonic acid (R F, 0.58) was scraped into vials, and its14C content was determined. A 32P-labeled human islet iPLA2cDNA was used to screen a human placental Lambda FIX II genomic DNA library (Stratagene). Clones that hybridized with the probe were isolated and plaque-purified, and the lambda DNA fragments containing genomic DNA inserts were purified by standard procedures (36Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battery J.F. Wonsiewicz M. Greenfield S. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Appleton and Lange, East Norwalk, CT1994: 335-338Google Scholar). Inserts were excised with NotI and subcloned into a pBluescript SK plasmid for restriction site mapping. Sequences of intron-exon boundaries were determined by comparing sequences of genomic DNA and cDNA. Intron sizes were estimated from lengths of PCR products from reactions using genomic DNA as template and primers that hybridize to sequences in adjacent exons. A human iPLA2genomic DNA clone was biotinylated with dATP (40Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and used as a probe to map the chromosomal location of the human iPLA2gene. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of the locus of hybridization of the fluorescent probe with chromosomal DNA was performed by See DNA Biotech Inc.

Human blood lymphocytes were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fatal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. Bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml, Sigma) was used to synchronize the cell populations, which were then washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and recultured (37 °C, 6 h) in α-minimal essential medium with thymine (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were harvested and slides were prepared by standard procedures, including hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air-drying (40Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), and the slides were baked (55 °C, 1 h). After RNase treatment, slides were denatured in 70% formamide and dehydrated with ethanol. Probes were denatured (75 °C, 5 min) in a hybridization mixture (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and human cot I DNA). After incubation (15 min, 37 °C) to suppress repetitive sequences, probes were loaded on denatured chromosomal slides, which were incubated overnight, washed, and subjected to detection and amplification procedures. FISH signals and DAPI banding patterns were recorded in separate photographs. Assignment of FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI banding pattern on the chromosomes (40Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the intracellular signal(s) involved in regulating this process remain unknown. Using nuclearly encoded cytochromec, we show that its expression in muscle cells is increased by changes in cytosolic Ca2+ using the ionophore A23187. Treatment of myotubes with A23187 increased cytochrome cmRNA expression up to 1.7-fold. Transfection experiments using promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs revealed that this increase could be transcriptionally mediated since A23187 increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity by 2.5-fold. This increase was not changed by KN62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases II and IV, and it was not modified by overexpression of protein kinase A and cAMP response element-binding protein, demonstrating that the A23187 effect was not mediated through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase- or protein kinase A-dependent pathways. However, treatment of myotubes with staurosporine or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate reduced the effect of A23187 on cytochrome ctransactivation by 40–50%. Coexpression of the Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase C isoforms α and βII, but not the Ca2+-insensitive δ isoform, exaggerated the A23187-mediated response. The short-term effect of A23187 was mediated in part by mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2) since its activation peaked 2 h after A23187 treatment, and cytochromec transactivation was reduced by PD98089, a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor.

Since Ca2+ cannot be metabolized like other second messengers, cells tightly regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration through a set of specialized molecules by sequestering Ca2+ into intracellular compartments. In skeletal muscle, depolarization causes the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and a subsequent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This rise triggers muscle contraction (5Melzer W. Hermann-Frank A. Lüttgau H.Ch. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and promotes mitochondrial metabolism (6Hansford R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 71-76Google Scholar). However, it is not known to what extent Ca2+ is involved in the phenotypic adaptations observed in skeletal muscle in response to an altered functional demand, such as chronic contractile activity. Mitochondrial biogenesis is one of the striking responses observed in skeletal muscle cells in response to a variety of physiological conditions (see Refs. 8Essig D.A. Ex. Sport Sci. Rev. 1996; 24: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Freyssenet D. Berthon P. Denis C. Arch. Physiol. Biochem. 1996; 104: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Hood D.A.

The synthesis of mitochondrial proteins involves the expression of genes originating from two distinct genetic compartments. Thirteen proteins are derived from the mitochondrial genome, whereas the remaining gene products are transcribed from the nuclear genome, translated, and subsequently imported into the mitochondria. In skeletal muscle, chronic contractile activity is known to markedly increase the mRNA levels of several nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding mitochondrial proteins (11Hood D.A. Zak R. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Seedorf U. Leberer E. Kirschbaum B.J. Pette D. Biochem.

Chem. 1986; 261: 376-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since contractile activity necessarily involves the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (5Melzer W. Hermann-Frank A. Lüttgau H.Ch. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and since Ca2+ is an important signaling ion in muscle and other tissues (15Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Ca2+ could play a role as an intracellular signal leading to mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. Several arguments support this possibility. First, changes in internal Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle cells using the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 are known to induce alterations in gene expression (16Kubis H.-P. Haller E.-A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a Ca2+-regulated, calcineurin-dependent pathway has been implicated in determining skeletal muscle phenotype (18Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Third, the treatment of myotubes in culture with the Ca2+ionophore A23187 has been shown to increase the mitochondrial enzyme activities of citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarate hydratase (16Kubis H.-P.

Physiol. 1983; 244: C348-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, myotubes cultured in low Ca2+medium possess very low levels of mitochondrial citrate synthase (20Schudt C. Gaertner U. Dölken G. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fifth, DNA sequencing and footprinting analyses within the rat cytochrome c promoter have demonstrated the existence of multiple binding sites, including two cAMP response elements (CRE)1 (21Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) on Ser133 by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) IV and its binding to the CRE are known to enhance the transcriptional activation of specific genes (23Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 24Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Finally, electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle cells has been shown to induce the translocation of the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosolic to the plasma membrane fraction (25Cleland P.J.F. Appleby G.J. Rattigan S. Clark M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17704-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to cause an increase in the activity of PKC in the nucleus (26Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, to define more precisely the potential role of Ca2+in skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, we began with a systematic study of the effect of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 on cytochrome c gene expression in skeletal muscle. We report here, using the L6E9 muscle cell line, that the treatment of myotubes with A23187 increases cytochrome c gene expression through a PKC-dependent pathway that depends, in part, on the activation of MAPK. A23187, KN62, TPA, and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma. They were prepared as stock solutions in Me2SO at concentrations of 0.25 mm, 2 mm, 0.25 mm, and 1 μm, respectively. PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem and prepared as a 25 mm solution in Me2SO. [14C]Chloramphenicol, [α-32P]dCTP, nylon membrane (Hybond N), and the ECL immunoblot detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Thin-layer chromatography plates were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Unionville, Ontario). The CREB antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas the MAPK antibody was from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Other cell culture and molecular biology reagents were purchased from Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, Ontario) and were of the highest grade available. L6E9 myoblasts were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air on 100-mm gelatin-coated plastic dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At ∼70% confluence, cells were switched to a lower serum differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Treatments began when the plates contained 85–90% myotubes (4–6 days later). All experiments were done with differentiated cells (myotubes) and were matched with vehicle-treated controls. The dose-dependent effects of A23187 on cytochrome c mRNA were evaluated at final concentrations ranging between 0.25 and 1 μm. Total RNA was extracted 72 h later as described below. In time course experiments, myotubes were incubated with 1 μm A23187 for 24, 48, or 72 h prior to the RNA extraction. To isolate total RNA, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of lysis solution consisting of 1 volume of solution containing 4 mguanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol; 1 volume of phenol; and 0.1 volume of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0. The cell lysate was then mixed with 0.2 ml of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min. The upper phase was removed and added to 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol to precipitate the RNA. Total RNA was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, dried in a vacuum desiccator, and finally resuspended in 30–50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel and transferred overnight to a nylon membrane. The quality of the total RNA isolated in this fashion was high as indicated by 1) an ∼2-fold greater intensity of the 28 S rRNA band, compared with 18 S rRNA, on ethidium bromide-stained gels; 2) highA 260/A 280 ratios; and 3) a lack of visible RNA degradation or DNA contamination. Membranes were hybridized with random primer-labeled cDNA probes encoding cytochrome c and 18 S rRNA, as done previously (27Connor M.K. Takahashi M. Hood D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Hood D.A. Simoneau J.-A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1092-C1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final stringent washes of the blots were done in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 55 °C followed by 15 min at 60 °C. Signals were quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instrument Co.), and specific cytochrome c mRNA levels were corrected for differences in loading using the 18 S rRNA signal. Plasmid constructs used for cytochromec mRNA expression (pRC4) and promoter analysis (pRC4CAT) were generously provided by Dr. Richard Scarpulla (Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) (20Schudt C. Gaertner U. Dölken G. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Hood D.A. Simoneau J.-A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1092-C1096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pRC4CAT/−726 construct contains sequences of the rat cytochrome c gene extending from position −726 upstream of the start site of transcription fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Truncated cytochromec promoter constructs (pRC4CAT/−326 and pRC4CAT/−66) were also used. pRSV/β-gal was used to direct the synthesis of β-galactosidase, whereas pRSV/CREB (provided by Dr. R. Gaynor, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX) and pCαEV (provided by Dr. G. S. McKnight, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) were used for the overexpression of CREB (30Muchardt C. Li C. Kornuc M. Gaynor R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4296-4305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (31Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15202-15207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Expression vectors encoding PKC isoforms α, βII, and δ were originally described by Ono et al. (32Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Fuji T. Kurokawa T. Asaoka Y. Sekiguchi K. Ase K. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Science. 1987; 236: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. J. McDermott (Department of Kinesiology, York University, Toronto, Canada). L6E9 myoblasts at 60% confluence were transfected with the appropriate cytochromec promoter-reporter construct (10 μg/100-mm dish). pRSV/β-gal (2 μg/dish) was used as an internal control to assess and correct for variations in transfection efficiency. However, no differences in β-galactosidase activity were found in A23187- and vehicle-treated cells. Where indicated, 5 μg of pRSV/CREB, pCαEV (PKA), PKCα, PKCβII, or PKCδ were cotransfected. Total DNA concentration was maintained constant in transfection experiments by adding pGEM-4Blue (Promega) or the specific empty vector as a carrier plasmid. Transfections were done using the poly-l-ornithine method followed by a Me2SO shock (33Dong Y. Skoultchi A.I. Pollard J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 771-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Robey R.B. Osawa H. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 40-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were then switched to low serum medium to allow differentiation. Where indicated, myotubes were preincubated for 24 h with KN62, staurosporine, or TPA prior to A23187 treatment. Some cells were treated with PD98059 (12.5 μm) for 0.5 h or with EGTA (1 mm) for 5 h prior to A23187 treatment. To prepare cell extracts for CAT and β-galactosidase expression assays, myotubes were scraped and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.9, and then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in an ethanol/dry ice slurry. Cell debris was centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and used directly in the assays. CAT activity was determined using 10–20 μl of cell extract in the presence of 1 mm acetyl-CoA and 0.23 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 40 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h, extracted with ethyl acetate, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Acetylated and non-acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were resuspended in 30 μl of ethyl acetate and separated by thin-layer chromatography for 30 min at room temperature with chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v) as the mobile phase. The percent conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated products was quantified by electronic autoradiography. Results were corrected for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity of the cotransfected plasmid. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using 10–30 μl of cell extract in a reaction mixture consisting of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.66 mm o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation for 2.5 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m NaCO3, and the reaction product absorbance was read at 420 nm. To prepare whole cell extracts for MAPK immunoblotting, myotubes were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 200 μl of modified Laemmli buffer (20% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were sonicated (3 × 10-s pulses) on ice, heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and spun briefly to pellet insoluble material. Extracts (100 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nylon membranes by electrotransfer (35Takahashi M. Chelsey A. Freyssenet D. Hood D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1380-C1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts used to detect CREB were the same as those used in the CAT assay, with the addition of 1 volume of lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The extracts were heat-denatured for 5 min, and 30 μg of protein/lane were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels followed by transfer to nylon membranes. Primary antibody incubations using dilutions of 1:1000 (CREB) and 1:250 (MAPK) were carried out at 4 °C overnight. Signals were detected by the use of an anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The data are presented as means ± S.E. One-way analyses of variance were used to evaluate the effect of A23187 incubation time and concentration on cytochrome c mRNA levels. Individual mean differences were assessed with Scheffé's post-hoc test. Two-way analyses of variance were employed to examine the effects of A23187 incubation time and cotransfection of plasmids on cytochrome c transactivation. Unpaired t tests were used for evaluating the effects of PD98059, staurosporine, and TPA on CAT activity compared with A23187 alone and to evaluate the effect of PKC isoforms on CAT activity. An α level of 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Northern blot analyses were first used to determine the effect of A23187 treatment on cytochrome c mRNA levels. Concentrations of A23187 ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 μm elicited a progressive increase in cytochromec mRNA levels by up to 1.7-fold (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 A). Higher concentrations did not further enhance the response (data not shown). The effect of A23187 on cytochrome c mRNA levels was also time-dependent (Fig. 1 B). By 48 and 72 h of exposure to the ionophore, mRNA levels were increased by 1.6- and 1.7-fold (p < 0.05), respectively. This effect was abolished when myotubes were preincubated with the extracellular Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, these data show a calcium-dependent increase in cytochrome c mRNA levels and indicate that A23187 exerts its effect by increasing the intracellular calcium concentration from the extracellular Ca2+ pool. Preliminary work suggested that the A23187 effect on cytochromec mRNA was not mediated by a change in mRNA stability. 2M. Di Carlo and D. A. Hood, unpublished observations. Thus, to determine whether the effect of A23187 on cytochrome cmRNA levels was mediated via transcriptional activation, L6E9 myoblasts were transfected with pRC4CAT/−726, allowed to differentiate, and incubated with 1 μm A23187 or vehicle. Analysis of variance revealed significant main effects of time and A23187 on the response. After 24 and 48 h of treatment, the activity of the CAT reporter gene was significantly increased by 2.3- and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig.2 A), indicating that A23187 increases cytochrome c mRNA levels through transcriptional activation. In addition, as previously shown with cytochrome c mRNA, preincubation of the myotubes with 1 mm EGTA abolished the A23187-dependent increase in transcriptional activation, indicating a requirement for extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). Next, we investigated the potential role of cis-elements present in the cytochrome cpromoter in response to A23187, particularly the role of the two Ca2+/cAMP response elements. One CRE (CRE-1) is located −281 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, whereas another CRE (CRE-2) is found at position −119 (22Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of variance indicated that significant main effects of A23187 and promoter construct existed, but that the effect of A23187 depended on the construct used. A23187 increased cytochrome ctransactivation mediated by the −726 promoter construct by 2.4-fold (p < 0.05). Elimination of 400 base pairs downstream of position −726 using pRC4CAT/−326 did not modify the magnitude of the transcriptional activation induced by A23187 (Fig. 2 B), as expected on the basis of the locations of the CREs. Surprisingly, myotubes transfected with pRC4CAT/−66 showed a greater relative response (3.9-fold) to A23187 treatment compared with cells transfected with pRC4CAT/−726 or pRC4CAT/−326, despite drastic reductions in absolute CAT activity. These experiments verify that the DNA sequence encompassed between positions −326 and −66 is necessary for a high constitutive level of cytochrome c gene expression in L6E9 cells and that A23187-induced transcriptional activation does not seem to involve the activation of the CRE sites. To specifically investigate the role of CREB in cytochrome cgene expression, cotransfection experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of CREB and PKA expression plasmids. A23187 alone produced a 3-fold increase (p < 0.05) in CAT activity. Transfection of myotubes with pRSV/CREB elicited 7.2 ± 1.3-fold (n = 5) increases in CREB protein levels (Fig.3 A, inset). Cotransfection with CREB or PKA alone or in combination did not further enhance the typical response elicited by A23187 (Fig. 3 A). These results show that cytochrome c gene expression in skeletal muscle cells does not appear to involve a PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CREB. To examine the possibility that the Ca2+-mediated effect on cytochrome c gene expression occurs through a CaM kinase-dependent pathway, KN62, a potent inhibitor of both CaM kinases II and IV, was used. Inhibition of CaM kinases was ineffective in abolishing the A23187-induced increase (p < 0.05) in cytochrome c transcriptional activation, suggesting that neither CaM kinase II nor CaM kinase IV mediates the intracellular pathway triggered by A23187 (Fig.3 B). Next, we examined the possibility that the induction of cytochrome cgene expression by A23187 was mediated through a PKC-dependent pathway. In these experiments, A23187 induced a 2.6-fold increase in cytochrome c transactivation. In the presence of staurosporine, a nonspecific inhibitor of PKC, cytochromec transactivation by A23187 was still evident (p < 0.05), but was markedly reduced to a 1.4-fold effect, significantly less than that observed in the absence of staurosporine (Fig. 3 B). To more specifically inhibit PKC, myotubes were preincubated for 24 h with the phorbol ester TPA. Long-term treatment with TPA has been shown to down-regulate PKC expression in skeletal muscle (26Huang C.-F. Tong J. Schmidt J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in L6 cells (36Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Palmer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thus providing a useful tool to test the involvement of PKC in the signaling pathway. TPA treatment reduced the effect of A23187 on cytochrome ctransactivation from 2.6- to 1.6-fold (40%) (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the effect of A23187 is partly mediated by a PKC-dependent pathway. Therefore, we also evaluated the role of specific PKC isoforms in determining this effect. Cotransfection experiments were performed using pRC4CAT/−326 along with either the Ca2+-sensitive PKCα or PKCβII isoform or the Ca2+-insensitive PKCδ isoform. Transcriptional activation by A23187 was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced in the presence of the α and βII isoforms compared with the empty vector pTB, but not in the presence of the Ca2+-insensitive PKCδ isoform (Fig. 4 A). These experiments confirmed the involvement of Ca2+-sensitive PKC isoforms in the response triggered by A23187. Since various lines of evidence (37Schönwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) indicate that PKC isoforms activate the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs, we examined the possible activation of a MAPK cascade in response to A23187 treatment. Myotubes that were preincubated for 30 min with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (38Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) demonstrated a 38% decrease (p < 0.05) in Ca2+-induced cytochromec gene transactivation (Fig. 4 B). Immunoblot analyses using a phospho-specific MAPK antibody showed that the effect of A23187 was a relatively early event since a transient 4.5 ± 0.7-fold (n = 4) activation of ERK1 (p42 MAPK) and ERK2 (p44 MAPK) occurred with a peak at 2 h (Fig. 4 C). This activation was completely prevented by preincubation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059. The stimulatory effect of A23187 was still present at 24 h, but was undetectable at 48 h after treatment with A23187 (data not shown). This transient pattern observed could also not be explained by differences in gel loading since both Ponceau staining and immunostaining of the same blot with a p44 antibody to illustrate total p44 levels revealed equal loading in all lanes (data not shown). It is well known that oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+concentration play a fundamental role in the contraction and relaxation of striated muscles. It is also established, mainly from work in other tissue types, that Ca2+ is active in signaling alterations in gene expression (1Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 2Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 15Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). Recent investigations have documented that this occurs in skeletal myofibers (18Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and that artificially induced increases in Ca2+ concentration lead to muscle phenotypic adaptations (16Kubis H.-P. Haller E.-A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These investigations are physiologically relevant since sustained elevations in internal Ca2+ occur during contractile activity (39Streter F.A. Lopez J.R. Alamo L. Mabuchi K. Gergley J. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C296-C300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a situation in which marked alterations in muscle phenotype have been documented (40Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of earlier work that demonstrated that mitochondrial enzyme activities could be modified by the presence or absence of Ca2+ (19Lawrence J.C. Salsgiver W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: C348-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Schudt C. Gaertner U. Dölken G. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 60: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that modifications in Ca2+concentration could represent a putative signal leading to the enhanced expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, thereby enhancing organelle biogenesis. To begin addressing this question, we have specifically studied the behavior of cytochrome c, a nuclearly encoded mitochondrial protein of the respiratory chain, in response to a model of augmented cellular Ca2+concentration using the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration of 3–10-fold are typically obtained 10 min after the addition of the ionophore, apparently lasting up to 16 days following addition of the drug (16Kubis H.-P. Haller E.-A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This treatment has previously been used to document changes in acetylcholine receptor (17Walke W. Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acetylcholinesterase (41Rubin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7121-7125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and myosin isoform (16Kubis H.-P. Haller E.-A. Wetzel P. Gros G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) gene expression. Here, we show for the first time that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration brought about by A23187 can increase the transcriptional activation of a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial protein (i.e. cytochromec). This effect may be applicable to other nuclearly encoded genes since we have observed a similar finding using the cytochromec oxidase subunit Vb promoter. 3P. Kumar and D. A. Hood, unpublished observations. We were surprised to find that the augmentation of cytochromec transcriptional activation was independent of the involvement of the two CRE sites present in the cytochrome cpromoter as well as the activation of the CaM kinase-dependent pathway since a CREB/CRE pathway of cytochrome c transcriptional activation was previously found in Balb/c/3T3 cells (22Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our observations are consistent with those of others using cardiac myocytes, in which the CRE appears to interact with c-Jun rather than CREB (42Xia Y. Buja M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12593-12598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The difference between these results and those previously reported in Balb/c/3T3 cells (22Gopalakrishnan L. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that cytochrome c gene expression is regulated via different transduction pathways in a variety of cell types. This appears to be true even within striated muscles since we have previously shown differences in the regulation of cytochrome c gene expression between heart and skeletal muscle during development and in response to variations in thyroid status (43Stevens R. Nishio M.L. Hood D.A. Cell. Mol. Biochem. 1995; 143: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports using other cell types (21Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we show that the DNA sequence of the cytochrome c promoter encompassed between positions −326 and −66 is necessary for a high constitutive level of cytochrome c gene expression in L6E9 muscle cells. Despite this, the minimal cytochrome cpromoter (pRC4CAT/−66) still possessed a high degree of Ca2+ responsiveness. The Ca2+-responsive element downstream of position −66 is currently under investigation. Although there are no apparent AP-1 or CRE sites in this region, the response may be related to the presence of CCAAT box-like sequences at positions +23 and +48 of the first intron. This sequence has previously been shown to confer A23187-mediated transcriptional activation of the grp78 promoter (44Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It does not appear that Sp1 by itself is involved since preliminary investigations have shown that Sp1 overexpression actually reduces transcriptional activation of the full-length cytochrome c promoter and that restoration of transcriptional activation by A23187 is independent of Sp1.2 PKC exists as a family of 11 homologous serine/threonine kinases, of which four isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ) are Ca2+-dependent (45Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the effect of the ionophore on cytochrome c transactivation is dramatically reduced by PKC inhibitors, indicating that a Ca2+-sensitive, PKC-dependent pathway is involved in L6E9 cells. This conclusion is further fortified by the fact that cells cotransfected with the Ca2+-sensitive PKCα and PKCβII isoforms illustrate a greater response to the Ca2+ ionophore than cells cotransfected with the Ca2+-insensitive PKCδ isoform. Since it was reported that the only detectable Ca2+-sensitive isoform in L6 cells under non-transfected conditions is PKCα (36Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Palmer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that this isoform is known to be down-regulated by prolonged treatment with TPA (36Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Palmer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the Ca2+-mediated effect on cytochrome c gene expression occurs via PKCα. However, it appears that other regulatory influences exist as well since ∼25% of the response triggered by A23187 was not abolished by TPA treatment, but was eliminated by the nonspecific PKC inhibitor staurosporine. The broader spectrum of action of staurosporine likely inhibited other kinases involved in parallel signal transduction pathway(s) that could have been activated by the ionophore. Such a candidate may be c-Jun N-terminal kinase since recent work using contractile activity to increase cytosolic Ca2+ levels in cardiac myocytes (46McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B. Mellon N.R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24046-24053Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (47Aronson D. Dufresne S.D. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25636-25640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have demonstrated its activation. In vitro, PKCα has been shown to phosphorylate c-Raf (48Kolch K. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D. Rap U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and c-Raf is known to phosphorylate and activate MEK directly (49Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), thus leading to the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs. The facts that the A23187-induced increase in cytochrome ctransactivation was enhanced by PKCα, that it was reduced by treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059, and that A23187 induced an increase in ERK1 and ERK2 activities with a time course consistent with their involvement in downstream cytochrome ctransactivation strongly suggest that this pathway is active in Ca2+-mediated cytochrome c expression. Thus, the following sequence of events is supported by our data: 1) A23187 mobilizes Ca2+ from the extracellular pool to increase its intracellular concentration, which 2) triggers the activation of a PKC/MEK/MAPK-dependent pathway leading to 3) the transactivation of cytochrome c. This is the likely cause of the subsequent increase in cytochrome c mRNA observed. Further work will define the requirement for de novo protein synthesis as well as the Ca2+-responsive element involved and whether an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels can act as a general signal mediating an increase in the expression of a variety of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.

In T cells, the 14-3-3τ isoform has been shown to associate with protein kinase C θ and to negatively regulate interleukin-2 secretion. Here we present data that 14-3-3τ interacts with protein kinase C μ (PKCμ), a subtype that differs from other PKC members in structure and activation mechanisms. Specific interaction of PKCμ and 14-3-3τ can be shown in the T cell line Jurkat by immunocoprecipitiation and by pulldown assays of either endogenous or overexpressed proteins using PKCμ-specific antibodies and GST-14-3-3 fusion proteins, respectively. Using PKCμ deletion mutants, the 14-3-3τ binding region is mapped within the regulatory C1 domain. Binding of 14-3-3τ to PKCμ is significantly enhanced upon phorbol ester stimulation of PKCμ kinase activity in Jurkat cells and occurs via a Cbl-like serine containing consensus motif. However, 14-3-3τ is not a substrate of PKCμ. In contrast 14-3-3τ strongly down-regulates PKCμ kinase activity in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3τ significantly reduced phorbol ester induced activation of PKCμ kinase activity in intact cells. We therefore conclude that 14-3-3τ is a negative regulator of PKCμ in T cells.

Much attention has been focused on the role of PKCs in T cell signaling (for review see Refs.1Szamel M. Resch K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Hug H. Sarre T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester responsive PKCs in general have long been associated with T cell activation and a prominent role of one particular subtype, PKCθ, belonging to the novel PKC subfamily (4Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is suggested from recent studies: PKCθ is translocated upon antigen-specific stimulation to the membrane interface between T cells and antigen presenting cells, implicating a physical interaction of PKCθ either directly with the T cell receptor complex or other T cell receptor proximal signaling molecules (5Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). During T cell signaling events evidence of an involvement of members of the 14-3-3 proteins, an abundant group of acidic proteins originally found in brain extracts (6Aitken A.

For example, it has been demonstrated that the 14-3-3τ isotype interacts with the catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (9Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y.C. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 22: 10142-10146Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the Cbl protooncogene (10Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H.

Besides T cell-specific functions 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to be involved in mitogenic pathways of other cells as well, affecting regulation of the Raf kinase (7Burbelo P.D. Hall A. Curr.

The mechanism, by which 14-3-3 influences Raf is still unresolved, as recent data suggest that activation of Raf by 14-3-3 may in fact be due to stabilization of an activation complex rather than a direct stimulation of Raf activity (17Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 2: 174-179Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A stabilizing role in the formation of signaling complexes can be deduced from the capacity of 14-3-3τ isoform to form dimers in vitro (10Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14591-14595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The recruitment of signal transducers like Cbl (10Liu Y.C. Elly C. Yoshida H.

Evidence for an active regulatory function of 14-3-3 proteins stems from the finding that 14-3-3τ binding to PKCθ negatively affects the stimulation of the interleukin-2 promotor and prevents PKCθ translocation to the membrane (18Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 10: 5782-5791Crossref Google Scholar), supporting a role of 14-3-3 proteins in the regulation of PKC activation in T cells. We have recently described a novel PKC isotype termed PKCμ (19Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which, although ubiquitously expressed, shows particularly high expression in thymus and hematopoetic cells (20Rennecke J. Johannes F.J. Richter K.-H. Kittstein W. Marcks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PKCμ displays, in addition to the conserved kinase and regulatory domains in common to all PKC isoforms, structural features like a hydrophobic amino-terminal domain, an acidic regulatory domain (21Gschwendt M. Johannes F.-J. Kittstein W. Marcks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20742-20746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and a pleckstrin homology domain (22Gibson T.J. Hyvönen M. Birney E. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 343-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). First evidence for involvement of PKCμ in diverse cellular functions stems from reports showing enhancement of constitutive transport processes in PKCμ overexpressing epithelial cells (23Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and PKCμ activation during antigen receptor-mediated signaling in B cells (24Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Klaus S.J. Chandren K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate by binding studies and pulldown assays as well as by transient expression in the T cell line Jurkat that PKCμ specifically associates in vitro and in vivo with 14-3-3τ proteins. The 14-3-3τ binding site within PKCμ could be located to the C1 regulatory region. 14-3-3τ interacts preferentially with the activated, phosphorylated PKCμ and down-regulates kinase activity, suggesting that 14-3-3τ is a regulator of PKCμ functions in T cells. The production of Sf158 insect cells overexpressing PKCμ (25Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Böttinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the construction of 14-3-3τ and ζ glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins has been described previously (9Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y.C. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 22: 10142-10146Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The human T lymphoma cell line Jurkat-TAg (26Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. GST fusion proteins were isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In brief fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and quantitated upon Coomassie staining by densitometric scanning, calibrated against an albumin standard. PKCμ deletion mutant PKCμΔ1–79 was constructed by digesting pBpl4 (19Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with ApaI and NsiI. Overhanging 5′ and 3′ ends were filled with the Klenow enzyme, and the 2.9 kilobase PKCμ fragment was isolated and ligated in EcoRV-digested pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). PKCμΔ1–340 was constructed by cutting pCDNA3/PKCμΔ1–79 with HindIII, isolating a 800-base pair HindIII fragment followed by religating the vector/PKCμ portion. Additionally these mutants were cloned in other expression vectors and verified by transient expression (27Nishikawa K. Toker A. Wong K. Marignani P.A. Johannes F.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23126-23133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PKCμ point mutations (serine to alanine exchange) were created using a polymerase chain reaction approach according to the manufacturer's instructions (Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis, Stratagene) and were verified by dideoxy sequencing of both strands. COS transfectants stably overexpressing PKCμ were generated by transfecting COS cells with PKCμ wild type cloned in the expression vector pCDNA3 followed selection of transfectants in neomycin (400 μg/ml) containing media for a period of 20 days. Single colonies were analyzed for PKCμ overexpression by Western blot analysis. Sf158 or Jurkat-TAg cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm nitrophenylphosphate) using a sonifier. After centrifugation of cell debris (15 min, 15 000 rpm, type 5403, Eppendorf) GST precipitation was done by incubation with the indicated amounts of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose in 1-ml lysate portions (500 000 Sf 158 cells or 60 × 106Jurkat-TAg cells) for 90 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of PKCμ from Jurkat-TAg cells, a PKCμ antiserum was used as described earlier (28Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were harvested by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia, 30 μl/2 × 107 cell equivalents) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes or GST complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE following transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot detection of PKCμ or 14-3-3τ was performed according to standard conditions using monoclonal antibodies as described earlier (18Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 10: 5782-5791Crossref Google Scholar, 28Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GST was detected using an anti-GST mAb (Santa Cruz). Visualization for all Western blots shown was performed using an alkaline phosphatase-based detection system according to standard conditions. 7.5 × 106 Jurkat-TAg cells were seeded per 60-mm-diameter dish in 5 ml of RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with 5 μg of DNA and 20 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested and analyzed 48 h upon transfection by immunoprecipitation analysis as described above. In the case of 14-3-3τ overexpression experiments, PKCμ was immunoprecipitated andin vitro autophosphorylated as described below. Exponentially growing 293 cells, 40–80% confluent, were transfected with the indicated plasmids using 2 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Superfect reagent for each well of a 6-well plate or 10 μg of DNA and 60 μl of Superfect reagent for a 100-mm plate. Extracts from one well were used for each immunoprecipitation and GST 14-3-3τ precipitation of PKCμ. Jurkat-TAg cells were stimulated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu, 100 nm) for the indicated times, lysates were prepared, and PKCμ was immunoprecipitated. PKCμ autophosphorylation was determined in anin vitro kinase assay as described previously (28Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were mixed with 10 μl of phosphorylation buffer containing 0.2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to a nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by phosphoimaging (Molecular Dynamics). For the in vitroinhibition assays, 80 ng of purified PKCμ enzyme from Sf158 cells (25Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Böttinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.-J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used with the indicated amounts of GST 14-3-3τ or GST added. PKCμ was immunoprecipitated from 5 × 106 Sf158 cells using 4 μl of a rabbit antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal epitope. Protein G-Sepharose bound immune complexes were in vitro phosphorylated as described above and washed twice to remove nonincorporated [γ-32P]ATP. Bound PKCμ was eluted in a final volume of 100 μl upon adding 50 μl of immunizing peptide (1 mg/ml) by incubating 30 min at 4 °C. PKCμ was incubated with Phosphatase 2A (0.4 units) for the indicated times. Equal aliquots were subjected either to GST 14-3-3τ precipitation followed PKCμ immunodetection or to direct immunoblot analysis to compare precipitation efficacies. For Far Western analysis, PKCμ from 80 × 106 Jurkat TAg cells was immunoprecipitated as described. Aliquots of immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. PKCμ detection was carried out using a PKCμ mAb. 14-3-3τ binding to activated PKCμ was analyzed essentially as described (29Tarn W.Y. Hsu C.H. Huang K.T. Chen H.R. Kao H.Y. Lee K.R. Cheng S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Detection of bound 14-3-3τ was carried out by a 2-h incubation with 10 μg/ml GST 14-3-3τ fusion protein and visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-GST secondary antibody. 14-3-3τ has been recently reported to associate with PKCθ, which is highly expressed in T cells (4Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To test whether 14-3-3τ would also interact with another T cell expressed isoform, PKCμ, we analyzed recombinant PKCμ for potential 14-3-3τ association. GST 14-3-3τ fusion proteins were used to precipitate PKCμ expressed in Sf158 cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, in GST pulldown assays a 14-3-3τ dose-dependent binding of PKCμ can be detected by immunoblot analysis (upper panel), showing best detection using 4 μg of 14-3-3τ GST fusion protein. 14-3-3τ binding to PKCμ is specific because no binding to the respective amount of GST proteins was detectable. Only a fraction of total recombinant PKCμ was precipitated with 14-3-3τ GST protein, as shown by comparison with PKCμ immunoprecipitation by PKCμ-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1 A, left lane), even when the GST 14-3-3τ concentration was increased to 20 μg (data not shown). Next, the association of 14-3-3 proteins with endogenous PKCμ was investigated. 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins were used to precipitate PKCμ from extracts of Jurkat-TAg cells. As shown in Fig.1 B, endogenous PKCμ could be specifically precipitated from lysates of Jurkat-TAg cells. Both 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3τ and 14-3-3ζ (30Zupan L.A. Steffens D.L. Berry C.A. Landt M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8707-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were equally suited to precipitate PKCμ. The respective controls, glutathione S-transferase, and as a control for nonspecific binding, the pleckstrin homology domain of PKCμ expressed as a GST fusion protein did not detectably precipitate PKCμ in pulldown assays (Fig. 1 B, left lanes). 14-3-3τ association with PKCμ was also shown in coprecipitation experiments using PKCμ-specific antibodies. As in 293 cells endogenous PKCμ levels are too low to detect 14-3-3τ association (data not shown); cotransfection of PKCμ and 14-3-3τ was performed in 293 cells. Additionally, 14-3-3 was transiently overexpressed in stable COS-PKCμ transfectants, and PKCμ was immunoprecipitated from lysates of double transfectants. In both cases, different amounts of 14-3-3 DNA were used for transfection to ensure optimum expression. As shown in Fig. 1 C (left panels), in cotransfected 293 cells 14-3-3τ can be readily detected in PKCμ immunoprecipitates upon appropriate expression of both cDNAs (PKCμ/14-3-3 DNA ratio 1:10). Likewise, in stably PKCμ expressing COS transfectants, 14-3-3τ can also be coprecipitated with PKCμ upon transient overexpression using 10 μg of the respective 14-3-3τ expression construct (Fig. 1 C, lower right panel). As the subtype-specific anti-14-3-3τ mAb is directed against an epitope within the potential binding site of target proteins, 2Y. C. Liu, unpublished observations. the reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment was precluded. The cysteine fingers in the C1 region of PKCs have been previously reported to be the binding site for second messengers as well as for regulatory proteins affecting protein kinase activity (31Kazanietz M.G.

In an attempt to identify potential binding sites of 14-3-3τ, we transiently overexpressed in 293 cells an amino-terminal PKCμ deletion mutant and a mutant lacking in addition the C1 binding region. The mutants PKCμΔ1–79 and PKCμΔ1–340 constructed by deletion analysis initiating translation at Met-80 or Met-341 (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used. Transfection of these mutants in 293 cells resulted in the expression of approximately 100- and 70-kDa variants of PKCμ as shown by immunoprecipitation (Fig.2 B). 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins were used to precipitate PKCμ, and the mutants from lysates of 293 cells were transfected with the respective expression constructs. As shown in Fig. 2 C, PKCμ could be readily detected in 14-3-3τ GST precipitates from 293 cells expressing wild type PKCμ and the PKCμΔ1–79mutant. Although expressed at high level (Fig. 2 B), the PKCμΔ1–340 mutant was not detectable in 14-3-3τ GST precipitates (Fig. 2 C). Similar data were obtained by overexpressing the PKCμ kinase domain (data not shown). These findings indicate a binding of 14-3-3τ approximately within the region between amino acid 80–340 containing the complete C1 regulatory domain of PKCμ. 14-3-3τ binding has been reported to involve a serine consensus motif like RSXS XP (35Muslin A.J.

Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched for potential serines matching the predicted consensus sequences within the C1 region of PKCμ. Two serine regions, serine 205/208 (RRLSNVSLT) and serine 219/223 (IRTSSAELST; Fig. 2 A), show some similarity to the predicted 14-3-3τ binding consensus sequences. Of interest, these regions also exert homology to the predicted consensus sequence of PKCμ substrates (38Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), therefore potentially representing an autophosphorylation site (see below). The indicated serine pairs were mutated to alanine (PKCμS205A,S208A and PKCμS219A,S223A) and expressed in 293 cells (Fig. 2,A and B). The sets of mutants were further combined in another expression plasmid carrying the double mutant (PKCμDM: S205A,S208A/S219A,S223A; Fig. 2 A) and, upon transient expression in 293 cells, analyzed for 14-3-3τ binding capacity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all mutants were equally well expressed in 293 cells. In 14-3-3τ GST precipitates, both the PKCμS205A,S208A mutant and the PKCμS219A,S223A mutant, were still detectable, but in contrast, the mutant lacking both serine motifs, PKCμDM, could hardly be detected in 14-3-3τ GST precipitates (Fig.2 C). This suggests that both serine motifs, Ser-205/208 and Ser-219/223, are involved in PKCμ binding. To investigate potential autophosphorylation of serine 205/208 or serine 219/223, the mutants were expressed in 293 cells, and in vitroautophosphorylation assays were performed. As shown in Fig.2 D, the double mutant showed significant reduction in autophosphorylation (30%) compared with PKCμ wild type, whereas both PKCμS205A,S208A and PKCμS219A,S223A mutants display only weak reduction in PKCμ autophosphorylation (data not shown). PKCμ contains approximately 10 phosphorylation sites. 3F. J. Johannes and T. Herget, unpublished observations. Thus likely mutation of one site is probably below the detection level. Together with the data of the 14-3-3 pulldown assays, these findings, point to serine 205/208 and serine 219/223 as functional important phosphorylation sites in PKCμ. As shown for the association of 14-3-3τ with Cbl, serine phosphorylation of Cbl is essential (37Liu Y.C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether activated PKCμ, which has been shown to be exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues (28Johannes F.-J. Prestle J. Dieterich S. Oberhagemann P. Link G. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), displays enhanced binding of 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins. Indeed, PKCμ could be more efficiently precipitated with 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins upon phorbol ester stimulation of Jurkat-TAg cells (Fig.3 A). Upon stimulation of cells with phorbol ester for 5 and 10 min, respectively, an approximately 4- and 10-fold enhancement of 14-3-3τ binding to PKCμ was observed (Fig. 3 A). Control immunoprecipitation of PKCμ performed in parallel from aliquots (20 × 106 cells) of the culture verified approximately equal amounts of PKCμ in each group (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Activation of PKCμ by phorbol ester treatment of cells was assessed by in vitroautophosphorylation of immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A,middle panel). This revealed in accordance with earlier findings (20Rennecke J. Johannes F.J. Richter K.-H. Kittstein W. Marcks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) a moderate stimulation of kinase activity by phorbol ester, which is also evident from a shift toward slower migrating bands (Fig. 3 A, middle and lower panels). Enhanced binding of 14-3-3τ to phosphorylated PKCμ explains its relatively weak binding to PKCμ isolated from untreated Sf158 cells (Fig. 1 A) that displays only a low basal PKCμ activity. Association of 14-3-3τ with in vivo activated PKCμ was further demonstrated by Far Western analysis, where binding of 14-3-3τ to PKCμ was probed with 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins and subsequent detection by anti-GST antibodies. Although upon cellular stimulation by PdBu PKCμ was present in equal amounts in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 B, right panel), detection of PKCμ with the 14-3-3 probe was only possible upon preactivation of PKCμ (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Binding of 14-3-3τ to PKCμ is dependent on endogenous kinase activity. A kinase dead PKCμ mutant, PKCμK612W (27Nishikawa K. Toker A. Wong K. Marignani P.A. Johannes F.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23126-23133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 39Johannes F.J. Horn J. Link G. Haas E. Sieminski K. Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) displaying no detectable autophosphorylation (Fig.4, upper panel) was tested for potential precipitation by 14-3-3τ GST fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, upon overexpression of the PKCμK612W mutant, no detectable autophosphorylation and subsequently no precipitation by 14-3-3τ was detectable. In contrast, PKCμ wild type and a pleckstrin homology domain deletion mutant, which has been previously shown to exert constitutive kinase activity (40Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), were shown to be efficiently precipitated by 14-3-3τ GST proteins (Fig. 4, upper panel). These data provide further evidence that 14-3-3τ association requires autophosphorylation of PKCμ. In an independent approach to scrutinize phosphorylation dependence of 14-3-3τ binding, PKCμ immunoprecipitates from Sf158 cell were in vitroautophosphorylated and subsequently treated with phosphatase 2A. Concommitant with a time-dependent dephosphorylation of PKCμ, a strong reduction in the amount of 14-3-3-precipitable kinase was noted (Fig. 5, top andbottom panel). Western blot analysis ensured that phosphatase treatment did not affect PKCμ protein levels (Fig. 5,middle panel).Figure 514-3-3τ binding to PKCμ is phosphatase-sensitive. PKCμ immunocomplexes from Sf158 cells were in vitroautophosphorylated. PKCμ was eluted from the protein G beads by incubating with immunizing peptide and subjected to phosphatase 2A treatment for the indicated times. Aliquots were removed, subjected to direct SD"

The mutation results in the conversion of leucine to arginine at amino acid 156 in ATPase 6, one of the two mtDNA-encoded subunits of the F0 portion of the mitochondrial ATPase complex (complex V). It has been reported that very high levels of mutant mtDNA are required for the clinical phenotype to be expressed (3Tatuch Y. Christodolou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutation is “recessive” in nature. Cultured cells harboring high levels (>95%) of the T8993G mutation have decreased ATP synthase activity (5Tatuch Y. Robinson B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), implying that a defect in oxidative ATP production is the most likely cause of both disorders. Nevertheless, cultured fibroblasts from NARP and MILS patients do not display any growth abnormalities under standard culture conditions, despite often being homoplasmic for the mutation (i.e.containing 100% mutant mtDNA). Nevertheless, we hypothesized that we could identify culture conditions that would not only allow for selection against mutant cells, but would also affect the intracellular proportion of mutant mtDNAs. We took advantage of two factors that eventually allowed us to develop such a system. First, fibroblasts from patients with diverse mitochondrial disorders grow poorly when glucose is replaced by galactose as the sole carbon source (7Robinson B.H. Petrova-Benedict R. Buncic J.R. Wallace D.C. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1992; 48: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Second, resistance to the antibiotic oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial function, is associated with at least two mutations in the yeast ATPase 6 gene (8John U.P. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and with at least one mutation in the hamster ATPase 6 gene (9Breen G.A.M. Miller D.L. Holmans P.L. Welch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); interestingly, not only are all three mutations located within a single transmembrane domain of the polypeptide, but the T8993G (L156R) mutation is located within this domain as well (Fig.1). We show here that, when grown in galactose-containing medium, cells harboring the T8993G mutation are more susceptible to oligomycin than are normal cells. We also show that galactose-oligomycin medium can be used as a tool to cause shifts in heteroplasmy among cells. Human fibroblasts were cultivated from a skin biopsy from a patient with MILS syndrome who harbored the T8993G mutation (patient 1 in Ref. 6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and from a healthy age-matched control (6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Transmitochondrial hybrids (cybrids) were generated by fusion of platelets containing 20% T8993G mutant mtDNA (obtained from the asymptomatic grandmother of a patient with MILS) with human osteosarcoma 143B cells lacking mtDNA (ρo cells) as described by King and Attardi (10King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 2,250 × g for 10 min; the platelet pellet was washed three times in DMEM; 1 × 106 ρo cells were added; cells and platelets were pelleted together, and all traces of medium were removed; 0.5 ml of a 50% solution of polyethylene glycol in DMEM was added for 40 s; and the cells were diluted in 40 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml uridine, and 100 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine. After 24 h the cells were grown in uridine-lacking medium, to select those that had been repopulated with platelet mtDNA. Approximately 100 clones survived in selective medium. The colonies were trypsinized in a cloning ring when they reached approximately 1 mm in diameter, and expanded in a 100-mm plate. DNA was extracted from each clone, and the mtDNA was analyzed as described below. Fibroblasts were grown either in DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/literl-glutamine, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate or in the same medium without glucose but supplemented with 5 mm galactose. For growth rate measurements, 2.5 × 104 fibroblasts were plated into 30-mm tissue culture dishes containing either glucose or galactose growth medium, as described above, with increasing concentrations of oligomycin (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1 ng/ml). Cells were harvested from duplicate plates at daily intervals and counted in a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Inc.). For evaluating the efficiency of the selective conditions, patient and control fibroblasts were mixed in different proportions (1:4 and 1:19) and grown in galactose medium plus oligomycin (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 ng/ml) for 6 days; thereafter, the cells were rinsed and the medium was changed to glucose/DMEM without oligomycin to allow them to recover. After 6 days, the fibroblasts were harvested, and DNA was extracted for analysis of the relative content of mutant and wild-type mtDNA as described below. Cybrid clones harboring different proportions of the T8993G mutation were plated at 5 × 104 cells/plate in 30-mm dishes and grown in galactose medium containing 0.1 ng/ml oligomycin for 5 days, followed by 5 days of growth in glucose medium without oligomycin. In some experiments, 0.6 nm rotenone (an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I activity) was substituted for oligomycin. Both attached and floating (i.e. dead) cells were counted every day during both the selection and recovery periods. An aliquot of the cells was retained each day for mtDNA analysis. DNA extraction from cell pellets was performed as described by Zeviani et al. (11Zeviani M. Moraes C.T. DiMauro S. Nakase H. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. Rowland L.P. Neurology. 1988; 38: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, we performed an RFLP analysis for the mtDNA T8993G point mutation on PCR-amplified products obtained using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to mtDNA positions (5′ → 3′) 8657–8679 and 9298–9277. PCR conditions were: 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min for 25 cycles. The last cycle was carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. A 642-bp DNA fragment encompassing nt-8993 was amplified, and 10% of the PCR products were digested with the endonuclease AvaI. DNA molecules containing a G at nt-8993 (i.e. NARP/MILS mutation) are cleaved by AvaI into two fragments of 336 and 306 bp, whereas those containing a T at nt-8993 (i.e. wild-type) are not cleaved by this restriction enzyme. The digestion products were electrophoresed through an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the intensities of the AvaI-digested DNA fragments were quantitated by scanning the gel in a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad, Model GS-363). In cybrids, we performed an RFLP analysis for the T8993G mutation on PCR products obtained using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to mtDNA positions 8900–8922 and 9422–9400. PCR conditions were the same as above, except that the extension was at 62 °C. A 523-bp DNA fragment encompassing nt-8993 was amplified, and 10% of the PCR products were digested with the endonucleaseHpaII, which cleaves mutant mtDNA into three fragments (301, 130, and 92 bp) but wild-type mtDNA into only two fragments (393 and 130 bp). The digestion products were electrophoresed through a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantitated as described above. Cells were diluted serially in DMEM to an average 1 cell/μl. 1-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were transferred to 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The cells were subjected to alkaline lysis as described by Sciacco et al. (12Sciacco M. Bonilla E. Schon E.A. DiMauro S. Moraes C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and then to PCR amplification. The PCR reaction was carried on as described above for cybrid cells, except that the number of cycles was increased to 40. RFLP analysis and quantitation of the mutant molecules was as above. The data were analyzed using Student's paired ttest. ATP synthesis in fibroblasts was assayed as reported (6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) on isolated mitochondria prepared as described by Millis and Pious (13Millis A.J.T. Pious D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis in cybrid cell lines was measured in living cells after digitonin permeabilization (14Maechler P. Haiyan W. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using the luciferin-luciferase system to report ATP content. 2A. Spinazzola, S. DiMauro, E. A. Schon, and G. Manfredi, manuscript in preparation. In brief, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 150 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KHPO4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were first incubated with 25 μg/ml digitonin (14Maechler P. Haiyan W. Wollheim C.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) at room temperature for 15 min, and then incubated in a final concentration of 7 μm luciferin, 7 ng/ml luciferase, 40 mm ADP, 100 mm succinate, and placed in a recording luminometer (MGM Instruments). Mitochondrial-specific ATP synthesis was measured as the difference between the light produced in the absence and the presence of atractyloside. The patient's fibroblasts were homoplasmic for the mtDNA T8993G mutation (i.e. 100% mutant), whereas control fibroblasts contained only wild-type mtDNA. The three cybrid lines used in the oligomycin selection experiments contained 100% wild-type mtDNA (clone JCP213), 100% mutant mtDNA (clone JCP261), and 84 ± 4% mutant mtDNA (clone JCP239). The analysis of the growth rates revealed essentially no difference between patient and control fibroblasts when glucose medium was used (not shown), and there was only a modest reduction in the growth rate of the patient's fibroblasts when they were grown in galactose medium (Fig.2 A). However, we observed a dramatic decrease in the growth rate of the patient's fibroblasts, as compared with control, when the cells were grown in medium containing galactose plus oligomycin present at concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 ng/ml (Fig. 2, B and C); both cell lines died in galactose medium containing 0.2 ng/ml oligomycin (Fig. 2 D). Importantly, oligomycin concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 ng/ml in medium containing glucose did not affect the growth rate of the cell lines (not shown) and, in this medium, an oligomycin concentration of at least 1 ng/ml was necessary to kill both cell lines (not shown). These results are similar to those reported previously on hamster cells (15Breen G.A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cybrid cell lines JCP213 (0% mutant), JCP239 (84% mutant), and JCP261 (100% mutant) were grown in galactose medium containing oligomycin for 5 days, followed by recovery for periods of up to 5 days in glucose medium. All cell lines showed a clear decrease in growth rate during the selection period. In 0.1 ng/ml oligomycin, cybrid JCP213 (100% wild-type mtDNA) divided at a rate slower than in glucose medium for the first two days, and cell division stopped entirely thereafter. In the same medium, cybrids JCP239 (84% mutant) and JCP261 (100% mutant) stopped dividing immediately (Fig.3 A). The number of cells attached to the plate plus those floating in the medium (i.e. dead cells) were approximately equal to the number of cells originally plated (not shown), indicating that little or no cell division had occurred during the selection period. Whereas the wild-type JCP213 cells resumed growing in log phase immediately after shifting to glucose medium, cybrid JCP239 took about 3–4 days to resume a normal rate of division, and cybrid JCP261 did not recover at all (Fig. 3 A). The activities of succinate cytochrome c reductase, NADH cytochrome creductase, NADH dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase have been described previously (6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and were normal in the patient's fibroblasts as compared with controls. ATP synthesis activity was markedly decreased in the patient's fibroblasts as compared with control fibroblasts with all substrates tested, but oligomycin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis was only mildly decreased, as reported by Vazquez-Memije et al. (6Vazquez-Memije M.E. Shanske S. Santorelli F.M. Kranz-Eble P. Davidson E. De Vivo D.C. DiMauro S. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATP synthesis in cybrid clones JCP261 (100% mutant) and JCP239 (84% mutant), as measured by our luciferin/luciferase assay on four replicate samples from each line, was reduced to 20 ± 3% (S.E.) and 24 ± 3%, respectively, of that in clone JCP213 (100% wild-type) (Fig. 3 B). After selection in galactose-oligomycin, residual ATP synthesis in clone JCP239 (now 72% mutant; see below), was increased from 24 ± 3% to 36 ± 1%. This increase in ATP synthesis was statistically significant (p < 0.025). Patient and control fibroblasts were mixed in different proportions, cultured in galactose medium plus oligomycin (0, 0.05, or 0.1 ng/ml) for 6 days, and subsequently allowed to recover for 6 days in nonselective glucose medium. PCR/RFLP analysis with AvaI showed that in the presence of oligomycin, a rapid intercellular selection in favor of fibroblasts containing wild-type mtDNA occurred (Fig.4). With 0.05 ng/ml oligomycin, the overall percentage of mutant mtDNA measured in a mixture of 80% mutant cells and 20% wild-type cells decreased from 80 to 20% at the end of the 6-day recovery period; when starting from an initial mixture of 95% mutant and 5% wild-type cells, the proportion decreased from 95 to 63%. In the presence of 0.1 ng/ml oligomycin and the same initial mixtures of mutant and wild-type cells, the percentages of mutant mtDNAs decreased from 80 to 10% and from 95 to 55%, respectively. We also asked if growth in galactose-oligomycin medium of cellular clones derived from single cybrid cells harboring a heteroplasmic population of T8993G mutated mtDNAs could affect the proportion of mutated mtDNAs over time. Cybrid cell lines JCP213, JCP239, and JCP261 were grown in galactose medium containing 0.1 ng/ml oligomycin (Fig. 3 A). As expected, no change in the proportion of mutant mtDNA was observed in the homoplasmic clones JCP261 (100% mutant) and JCP213 (100% wild type) in either concentration of oligomycin, nor did growth of JCP239 (84% mutant) in medium containing glucose and oligomycin (at 0.1 and 0.2 ng/ml) have any effect on the heteroplasmy (data not shown). However, after 5 days of selection in galactose-oligomycin medium plus one day of recovery in glucose medium, we observed a significant reduction in the content of mutant mtDNA in clone JCP239 (Fig.3 A), from 84% to approximately 72%. As shown in Fig.5, PCR/RFLP analysis withHpaII (the PCR fragment contains a naturally occurringHpaII site at nt-9293, which was used as an internal control for completeness of digestion) showed that the heteroplasmy was reduced from the original value of 84% (lane 2) to 74% after 5 days of selection in 0.1 ng/ml oligomycin (lane 3). The proportion of mutant mtDNA remained stable at 72 ± 1% in the 5 days of recovery (lanes 4–7). This result was reproduced in three independent experiments. Importantly, no further change in mutant mtDNA content was observed up to three months after the selection. Significantly, the substitution of oligomycin with rotenone, an inhibitor of respiratory chain complex I, at 0.6 nm (a concentration that kills 143B parental osteosarcoma cells in galactose medium in 7–8 days, 3A. Barrientos, personal communication.inhibited the growth rates of all three cell lines in an identical manner but did not change the proportion of mutant mtDNA in any of them after 6 days of selection followed by up to 10 days of recovery in glucose medium. Cells from clone JCP239, which after selection in galactose-oligomycin medium contained 72% mutant mtDNA, were again grown in the selective medium for 5 days followed by 5 further days of recovery. This time the growth rate during selection and following recovery was identical to that of wild-type cells (not shown), and there was no change in the content of mutant mtDNA (i.e. it was still 72%). To better understand the intracellular distribution of the mtDNAs in a heteroplasmic cell line, we performed single cell PCR/RFLP on cybrid JCP239 cells before and after selection. Before selection, the distribution of the mtDNA followed a normal distribution with an average of 84 ± 7% mutant mtDNAs (n = 46), in agreement with the data obtained on the mass culture, which was also 84% mutant mtDNA (Fig.6 A). After 5 days of selection plus 3 days of recovery in glucose medium, the distribution was similar but was shifted to the left. The average amount of mutant mtDNA had decreased to 71 ± 11% (n = 29), also in agreement with the mass culture value of 72% mutant mtDNA (Fig.6 B). This reduction was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001). Two of the 29 cells analyzed after selection had unusually low amounts of mutant. The lack of an observable phenotype in cultured cells harboring the T8993G mtDNA mutation makes it impossible to select for “less affected” cells (i.e. those containing a lower amount of mutant mtDNA), despite the fact that cells harboring this mutation are deficient in oxidative phosphorylation (5Tatuch Y.

We reasoned that a mitochondrial inhibitor such as oligomycin might be such a selective agent, because of its known interaction with the ATPase 6 subunit of complex V (8John U.P. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Breen G.A.M. Miller D.L. Holmans P.L. Welch G. J. Biol.

Oligomycin belongs to a family of antibiotics produced by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes and is toxic to both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms. It has been suggested that high concentrations of oligomycin cause apoptotic death of mammalian cultured cells (17Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Krauer K. Ralph S. Linnane A.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that amino acid substitutions conferring oligomycin resistance in yeast (8John U.P. Nagley P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Breen G.A.M. Miller D.L. Holmans P.L. Welch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11680-11685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NARP/MILS (2Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K.H. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tatuch Y. Christodolou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 852-858PubMed Google Scholar), are all localized in the fourth transmembrane domain of ATPase 6 (Fig. 1), suggesting that this portion of the polypeptide is most directly involved in the interaction with the antibiotic. It is not clear why the mutant cells are selectively vulnerable to galactose/oligomycin treatment. According to secondary structure predictions (18Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), the T8993G mutation causes a structural change in the fourth transmembrane α-helix domain, which, besides causing a defect in the ATP synthetic function, might confer increased sensitivity to oligomycin, possibly by modifying (e.g. stabilizing) the binding of the drug, or by enhancing its inhibitory effect on the F0 portion of the ATPase. Alternatively, because the mutation probably inhibits proton flow, the enhanced toxicity of oligomycin in T8993G cells may be due to nothing more than the combined effects of the drug and the mutation on proton translocation. Moreover, in galactose medium, the T8993G mutant cells are probably already on the threshold of a metabolic crisis because of decreased ATP production. Galactose can enter glycolysis via three consecutive reactions that convert galactose to glucose-6-phosphate. In cultured cells this reaction is much slower than the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase. Thus, the amount of ATP produced from galactose is sufficient for cell viability only if other sources of ATP, specifically ATP derived from mitochondria, are also available. In cells harboring respiratory chain mutations, the reduction in ATP synthesis places a stress on the cells that is exacerbated when galactose becomes the major (or sole) source of cytosol-derived ATP (see Ref. 19Robinson B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 454-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for a more detailed discussion). Under these “stressed” conditions, the addition of a specific inhibitor of ATP synthase, such as oligomycin, probably precipitates a metabolic crisis more rapidly in the mutant cells than in wild-type cells. Our T8993G mutant fibroblasts were strongly inhibited by oligomycin concentrations as low as 0.05 ng/ml (in galactose medium). In agreement with a high selection efficiency of these culture conditions, we observed that after only 6 days of growth, a mixed population of mutant and wild-type fibroblasts shifted rapidly toward a predominantly wild-type genotype. However, in this case the competition was between two populations of cells, one homoplasmic wild-type and the other homoplasmic mutant. Thus, the selection was at the intercellular level. A more interesting question, of greater relevance to the clinical situation, is whether selection can also occur at the intracellular level. To study the effect of the galactose-oligomycin selection on a heteroplasmic population of cells (i.e. containing both mutant and wild-type genomes within the same cell, and potentially within the same organelle) and which more closely resembles the situation in patient tissues, we generated clones of cybrids with different proportions of the T8993G mutation. The effect on cell growth of galactose/oligomycin medium on the cybrids was comparable with that observed with fibroblasts (compare Fig. 2 C with Fig. 3, thedays 0–5 portion). Upon removal of the selection, the recovery of the homoplasmic wild-type and the heteroplasmic cells was much faster than that of the homoplasmic mutant cells (Fig. 3, day 5–8). Strikingly, we observed a reproducible decrease in the proportion of mutant mtDNA in the heteroplasmic cells after selection (and which was stable over a period of several months even in the absence of a selective pressure), and a concomitant increase in the rate of ATP synthesis. Importantly, the substitution of oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) with rotenone (a complex I inhibitor) did not cause a shift in heteroplasmy, suggesting that the effect of oligomycin is specific for the mutation (i.e. affecting its own target respiratory chain complex), rather than being a selection at the level of the entire respiratory chain. We measured the fraction of mutant mtDNA in single cells before and after selection. The amount of mutant mtDNA in the population of cells followed a normal distribution, both before selection (average content of 84% mutant) and after selection (average content of 71% mutant). This difference was statistically highly significant (p< 0.001) and was in agreement with the values obtained from analysis of the mass culture. Because the heteroplasmic cybrid cells did not appear to undergo any significant degree of cell division during the 5-day selection period, these results imply that, besides some degree of intercellular selection, an intracellular selection between mtDNAs had also occurred. We note that the percentage of heteroplasmy in two of the 29 cells analyzed after selection was well below the average value (Fig. 6). A likely explanation for this finding is that during the recovery phase, when the cells were dividing rapidly, there was mitotic segregation of mtDNAs such that a few cells segregated stochastically to heteroplasmies much lower (and sometimes higher) than the average. The mechanism by which intracellular selection occurs is poorly understood. Perhaps the organelles containing a lower proportion of mutant molecules divide more rapidly or replicate their genomes more efficiently than do those containing virtually homoplasmic mutant mtDNA, resulting in an overall reduction of the mutation load in the cell. A second possibility is that selection at the level of the organelle may be enhanced when energy deprivation promotes the formation and subsequent elimination of organellar elements containing a disportionately high level of mutated mtDNAs. The hypothesis that the observed shift in heteroplasmy was intracellular is also consistent with the findings of Tonsgard et al. (20Tonsgard J.H. Tung B. Kornafel K.S. Getz G.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), who showed that resistance to rutamycin, another ATPase inhibitor, could be selected within heteroplasmic cybrids far more rapidly than could be accounted for merely by cellular growth rate or by organellar segregation alone. It is also consistent with the results of King and Attardi (21King M.P. Attardi G. Cell. 1988; 52: 811-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), who were able to select for chloramphenicol resistance soon after the introduction of only a few chloramphenicol-resistant mitochondria into chloramphenicol-sensitive cells. Spelbrink and colleagues (22Spelbrink J.N. Zwart R. Van Galen M.J.M. Van den Bogert C. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were also able to induce an intracellular selection in favor of wild-type mitochondrial genomes in lymphoblast cell lines containing a heteroplasmic mtDNA deletion, by treating them for a prolonged period of time with doxycycline, a mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibitor. However, there are several differences between our results and Spelbrink and colleagues (22Spelbrink J.N. Zwart R. Van Galen M.J.M. Van den Bogert C. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). First, the mtDNA abnormality was a large scale deletion in their cells and a point mutation in ours, which have vastly different effects on respiratory chain function (23Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Second, the heteroplasmic shift in their system took months, not days, to occur. Finally, the heteroplasmic shift of the deleted molecules was inherently unstable and reverted to increased levels of deletion after removal of the selection, as opposed to our observations with a point mutation, in which the shift remained stable. We do not know the reason for these differences. The fact that a treatment with lower levels of oligomycin did not cause a shift in the percentage of mutant mtDNA and that the cells which had been selected behaved like the homoplasmic wild-type ones when grown in galactose-oligomycin for a second time, suggest that at least in our tissue culture system, 72% mutation and 38% residual ATP synthesis are approximately the functional threshold values. We note that heteroplasmic values below 70% are generally associated with asymptomatic members of T8993G pedigrees (2Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Petty R.K.H. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tatuch Y. Christodolou J. Feigenbaum A. Clarke J.T.R. Wherret J. Smith C. Rudd N. Petrova-Benedict R. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Hum.

In conclusion, the combination of galactose and oligomycin creates selective culture conditions that elicit an abnormal growth phenotype in cells containing the T8993G mutation. These conditions can also induce a shift in heteroplasmy within cells, presumably via interorganellar selection. This finding could form the basis for pharmacological approaches for the therapy of mitochondrial disorders that target directly the underlying genetic defect. We thank E. A.

CD1d has been previously shown to be expressed on the cell surface of human intestinal epithelial cell lines in vivo and a transfected cell line in vitro independently of β2-microglobulin (β2m). To define the relationship between CD1d and β2m and characterize the biochemical structure of CD1d in the absence of β2m, we have used a newly generated series of CD1d transfectants and CD1d-specific antibodies. These studies show that in the absence of β2m, CD1d is expressed on the cell surface as a 45-kDa glycoprotein that is sensitive to endoglycosidase-H and is reduced to 37-kDa after N-glycanase digestion. In contrast, in the presence of β2m, CD1d is expressed on the cell surface as a 48-kDa endoglycosidase-H-resistant glycoprotein. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling studies demonstrate that acquisition of endoglycosidase-H resistance of CD1d is observed in the presence of β2m but not in the absence of β2m even after a 24-h chase period. Thus, CD1d is able to be transported to the cell surface independently of β2m; however, in the absence of β2m, the glycosylation pattern of CD1d is altered and consistent with an immature glycoprotein.

Gerdes D. Chott A. Porcelli S. Balk S.P. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 147: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CD1 is a system of proteins encoded by five genes, CD1A–E, which, although homologous to classic MHC molecules, are likely distinct in their structure and function. The human CD1 gene family falls into two groups based on sequence homology: CD1A–C and CD1D. In mice, two CD1D homologues, MCD1.1 and MCD1.2, have been identified (2Balk S.P. Bleicher P. Terhorst C. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar, 3Calabi R. Bradbury A. Tissue Antigens. 1991; 37: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is increasing recognition that the CD1 molecules may serve a unique role in antigen presentation distinct from both MHC class I and class II by presenting nonpeptide antigens to a discrete subset of T cells. CD1b and CD1c, for example, have been shown to mediate CD4−CD8− double negative T cell recognition of bacterial lipid and glycolipid antigens (4Beckman E. Porcelli S. Morita C. Behar S. Furlong S.

Similar functions are predicted for the CD1d subtype based on the recent crystallographic structural characterization of mouse CD1d (7Zeng Z.H. Castano A.R. Segelke B.W. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A.

In addition, unlike MHC class I, which presents peptide antigens in transporter in antigen processing proteindependent manner, CD1d has been shown by several investigators to be transporter in antigen processing-independent with respect to CD1d surface expression and antigen presentation (10Teitell M. Holcombe H.R. Brossay L. Hagenbaugh A. Jackson M.J. Pond L. Balk S.P. Terhorst C. Peterson P.A. Kronenberg M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2143-2149PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sydora B.C. Brossay L.

In rodents, a subset of CD4+ T cells exist that express the natural killer cell (NK) marker 1.1, called NK1.1+CD4+ T cells, and carry an invariant T cell receptor-α chain in co-association with a limited range of T cell receptor-β chain variable regions (13Lantz O. Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). These T cells directly recognize β2-microglobulin (β2m)-associated mouse CD1 in the absence of an exogenous antigen (14Bendelac A. Lantz O. Quimby M. Yewdell J. Bennink J. Brutkiewicz R.R. Science. 1995; 268: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). CD1d mediated activation of these Vα14+ NK1.1+ T cells by glycosylceramides has also been demonstrated (9Kawano T. Cui J.

Highly enriched in the liver, these mouse CD1d reactive NK1.1+CD4+ T cells have a high likelihood of playing a central role in immunoregulation of cytokine responses through production of interleukin-4 and/or interferon γ and in anti-tumor immunity (14Bendelac A.

Recently, double negative T cells with similar use of a highly homologous T cell receptor-α chain and recognition of CD1d has been identified in humans (18Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19Brossay B.L. Chioda M. Burdin N. Koezuka Y. Casorati G. Dellabona P. Kronenberg M. J. Exp.

These studies suggest, therefore, that CD1d in association with β2m represents the cognate ligand for a distinct subset of T cells. Previous studies have shown that CD1d is also expressed on intestinal epithelial cells of human (21Canchis P.W. Bhan A.K. Landau S.B. Yang L. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. Immunology. 1993; 80: 561-565PubMed Google Scholar, 22Blumberg R.S. Terhorst C. Bleicher P. McDermott F. Allan C. Landau S. Trier S. Balk S.P. J.

Science. 1990; 250: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and rat (24Ichimiya S. Kikuchi K. Matsuura A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1112-1120PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kasai K. Matsuura A. Kikuchi K. Hashimoto Y. Ichimiya S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, in this location, the major form of CD1d identifiable on the cell surface of human intestinal epithelial cells has been defined as a 37-kDa, nonglycosylated, β2m-independent molecule (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although, it has been recently shown that intestinal epithelial cells also express a β2m-associated, fully glycosylated form of CD1d (27Somnay-Wadgaonkar K. Nusrat A. Kim H.S. Canchis W.P. Balk S.P. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Int. Immunol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the fact that a β2m-unassociated form of CD1d could be identified on the cell surface of a native cell type raises the possibility that post-translational modifications of CD1d, and the interactions between CD1d and β2m are likely to be key factors in determining and/or modifying the function of CD1d as a ligand for T cells. For example, in addition to NK1.1+ T cells, which appear to recognize β2m-associated CD1d, T cell clones have been identified that may be capable of recognizing CD1d on the cell surface of β2m-deficient antigen presenting cells (28Cardell S. Tangri S. Chan S. Kronenberg M. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 29Murakami M. Paul W.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). Given these previous observations on the biochemical characterization of CD1d in intestinal epithelium and the recognition that T cell clones can be identified that appear to be capable of recognizing β2m-independent forms of CD1d, we have investigated the relationship between cell surface expression of CD1d and β2m. To examine this interaction, we have established a transfected model system using stably transfected cell lines that express CD1d and/or β2m. FO-1 is a CD1d and β2m-negative cell line derived from human melanoma cells, which we have stably transfected with either CD1d alone or CD1d plus β2m. These studies clearly show that CD1d is capable of being expressed on the cell surface independently of β2m. In addition, we have shown that, although the absence of β2m does not prevent CD1d glycosylation, the glycosylation pattern is altered such that CD1d is expressed on the cell surface with an immature glycosylation pattern. The β2m-deficient human melanoma cell line, FO-1 (30D'Urso C.M. Wang Z.G. Cao Y. Tatake R. Zeff R.A. Ferrone S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Soldano Ferrone, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY), and CD1d transfectant of this cell line have been described previously (26Balk S.

FO-1 clones expressing CD1d and β2m were generated similarly by co-transfection of the CD1d cDNA in the pSRα-neo vector (31Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N.

Ginjaar I. Hochstenbach F. Seemann G. Kottman A. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3132-3138PubMed Google Scholar). C1R, a human HLA A- and B-deficient lymphoblastoid cell line (33Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with CD1d cDNA in the pSRα-neo vector by electroporation as described previously (18Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing CD1d were generated by calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (18Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). A series of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were generated against CD1d-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. CD1d-GST fusion proteins containing the α1 domain alone, the α1 and α2 domains, or the α1–α3 domains were constructed using convenient restriction sites in the CD1d cDNA (34Balk S.P. Bleicher P.A. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) or sites were introduced by polymerase chain reaction. These proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified on glutathione agarose beads (Sigma) (35Kaelin W.G. Pallas D.C. De Caprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were eluted sequentially with glutathione and SDS, and the pooled proteins were used to immunize rabbits and mice. Rabbit antiserum was affinity purified by multiple passes through a GST column followed by absorption to a column of agarose beads (Affi-Gel, Bio-Rad) covalently conjugated with a mixture of the three CD1d-GST fusion proteins. Bound Abs were acid eluted by a pH step gradient from pH 4.2 to 2.6, followed by alkaline elution from pH 9.5 to 11.5, and pooled as described previously (36Colgan S.P. Morales V.M. Madara J.L. Polischuk J.E. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C276-C283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal Ab (mAb) against the pooled CD1d-GST fusion proteins was generated by fusing hyperimmune BALB/c spleen cells to murine myeloma (NS-1) cells. Wells were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the pooled fusion proteins, and positives were subsequently screened against GST to eliminate GST-reactive clones. One Ab from this screen, D5 (IgG2b isotype) reacts in immunoblots to an epitope in the CD1d α1 domain, 2S. P. Balk, unpublished observation. and it immunoprecipitates native CD1d solubilized in ionic or nonionic detergents. 3S. P. Balk and R. S. Blumberg, unpublished observation. CD1d-Ig fusion protein was produced by generating a BamHI site in the 3′ end of the CD1d α3 domain by polymerase chain reaction. This BamHI site was then used to fuse the CD1d leader sequence through the α3 domain to the Fc portion of murine IgG2b, using an Ig Fc expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. Terry Strom, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) (37Zheng X.X. Steele A.W. Nickerson P.W. Steurer W. Steiger J. Strom T.B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5590-5600PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein was secreted as a β2m-associated disulfide-linked dimer when expressed in hamster (CHO), murine (NSO), or human (C1R) cells.2 Mice were immunized with the fusion protein produced in murine NSO cells, and hybridomas were subsequently screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the protein. The anti-CD1d mAbs raised against the CD1d-Ig fusion protein, 55.1, 42.1, and 51.1, were of the IgG1 isotype as described previously (18Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). BBM.1 is a mouse anti-human β2m mAb of the IgG1 isotype (38Parham P. Androlewicz M.J. Holmes N.J. Rothenberg B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6179-6186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses were carried out using approximately 1 × 106 cells in 50–100 μl of PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide and 1% fetal calf serum. The primary Abs were each used at 10–20 μg/ml for 20–30 min at 4 °C. The secondary Abs were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Flow cytometry analyses were performed using a Becton Dickinson immunocytometry system (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Using 1–2 × 107 cells, surface proteins were radiolabeled with 1–2 mCi of 125I using the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed method, as described previously (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After washing, labeled cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm iodoacetamide) containing protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.17 mg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), chymostatin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), antipain (2 μg/ml), and diisopropryl fluorophosphate (1 μl/ml)) and 1% Nonidet-P40 as detergent, as described previously (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Lysis was performed at 4 °C for 30 min and sequentially centrifuged at 14,000 × g and 100,000 × g for 15 and 30 min, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed using Abs coupled to protein G (IgG1 mAb) or protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce). To minimize background from eluted IgG, the Ab in some cases was covalently coupled to the beads using dimethylpimelimidate. Lysates were cleared by 2–3 incubations with nonimmune serum bound to protein A and/or G-Sepharose beads. Lysates were then incubated with specific antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads, washed 10 times with immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in Laemmeli buffer in the absence or presence of reducing agents and analyzed by autoradiography after resolution of proteins by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Nonlabeled CD1d was detected by Western blotting as described previously using the affinity purified rabbit anti-CD1d antibody, followed by an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate and ECL. β2m was detected by Western blotting of proteins resolved under nonreducing conditions with the BBM.1 mAb. N-linked carbohydrates were removed by digestion with N-glycanase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), as described previously (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase-H (New England Biolabs) digestion was carried out by denaturing glycoproteins in 0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, boiling at 100 °C for 5 min, and incubating with 1 μl of endoglycosidase-H overnight at 37 °C in reaction buffer as defined by the manufacturer containing 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. Semi-confluent 1–2 × 107 FO-1 CD1d and FO-1 CD1d/β2m-transfected cells grown in 60- × 15-mm tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson; Falcon 3002) were used for metabolic labelings. After washing cells three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing divalent cations, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine, and methionine supplemented with 0.15% dialyzed fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Tran35S-labeled cysteine/methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) 0.75–1 mCi was added for 10 min at 37 °C to label the cells. After discarding the radioactive medium, cold RPMI supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum was added, and cells were lysed at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h of the chase period with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations of the lysates with the D5 and the 51.1.3 mAb were performed followed by the N-glycanase and endoglycosidase-H digestion protocols as mentioned above. Cell surface expression of CD1d by transfected, β2m-deficient FO-1 human melanoma cells has been shown previously using flow cytometry with a cross-reactive rat anti-mouse CD1d mAb (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Expression of human CD1d by these cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using a polyclonal affinity purified rabbit anti-human CD1d antibody and two murine anti-human CD1d mAbs, 42.1 and 51.1 (Fig.1; wild type versus CD1d). As expected, there was no binding by the anti-β2m mAb, BBM.1, and wild type FO-1 cells did not react with any of the CD1d-specific antibodies. FO-1 cells co-transfected with CD1d and human β2m were also examined (Fig. 1; CD1d/β2m). These cells stained with each of the anti-CD1d antibodies and with the BBM.1 mAb. It should be noted that staining of each transfected line with the murine mAbs suggested two populations of cells, although this was not apparent with the rabbit antibody. A previous report showed that CD1d expressed on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells lacked β2m andN-linked carbohydrates (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To assess the structure of CD1d expressed by FO-1 cells in the absence of β2m, a series of immunoprecipitations were carried out. FO-1 wild type and CD1d-transfected cells were surface iodinated and immunoprecipitated with the affinity purified rabbit anti-CD1d antibody (Fig.2 A) or the mouse anti-human CD1d mAb, D5 (Fig. 2 B). Both antibodies immunoprecipitated heavy chains of approximately 45 kDa from the CD1d-transfected cells but not the wild type cells (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes −). There were no bands detected at 37 kDa, indicating that most or all of the CD1d expressed by these cells was glycosylated. To confirm that the CD1d transfected FO-1 cells were expressing glycosylated CD1d, the CD1d immunoprecipitates were treated with N-glycanase to remove N-linked carbohydrates. Subsequent analysis of these proteins showed that they were reduced to about 37 kDa, consistent with the CD1d polypeptide backbone (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes +). These results demonstrated that CD1d expressed by FO-1 cells in the absence of β2m contained N-linked carbohydrate, in contrast to the CD1d protein expressed by intestinal epithelial cells (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The double transfected, CD1d plus β2m FO-1 cells were examined similarly by immunoprecipitation. The rabbit polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3 A) immunoprecipitated from these cells a heavy chain of about 48 kDa (lane −, thick arrow), which was associated with a 12-kDa protein (lane −, open arrow), consistent with β2m. The D5 mAb (Fig.3B) immunoprecipitated the 48-kDa CD1d heavy chain (lane −, thick arrow). Note the absence of the 12-kDa band in the D5 immunoprecipitate of the FO-1d/β2m transfectant (Fig. 3 B, lane −, open arrow). The lack of β2m in the D5 mAb immunoprecipitates was similarly observed in cells that expressed endogenous β2m and appeared to reflect disruption of β2m binding by this mAb (see below). The size of the CD1d heavy chain expressed by the FO-1d/β2m transfectant appeared to be about 3-kDa larger than the FO-1d transfectant expressing only CD1d. This difference could be clearly appreciated when either rabbit polyclonal anti-CD1d Ab (Fig.3 A) or D5 mAb (Fig. 3B) immunoprecipitates were prepared from both cell types and analyzed on the same gel (Fig. 3, A and B,respectively, lanes −, thin arrow). In contrast, the CD1d bands immunoprecipitated from both cell types of transfectants migrated similarly at 37 kDa after N-glycanase digestion (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes +,arrowhead), indicating that differences inN-linked carbohydrate accounted for the smaller apparent size of CD1d expressed in the absence of β2m. Additional CD1d-transfected cell lines that expressed endogenous β2m were analyzed similarly by iodination and immunoprecipitation. Both C1R cells, a human B cell line, and CHO cells yielded CD1d heavy chains of approximately 48 kDa that migrated identically to the CD1d heavy chain identified from the FO-1 CD1d/β2m double transfectant (Fig.4). The rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitates from these cells again demonstrated an associated 12-kDa protein consistent with β2m. This 12-kDa protein was not detected in the D5 precipitates, again indicating that D5 may disrupt CD1d-β2m binding. Immunoblotting with an anti-β2m mAb, BBM.1, was used to confirm the identity of the 12-kDa protein as β2m. CD1d-transfected C1R cells were immunoprecipitated with a series of CD1d mAbs and immunoblotted with the β2m-specific mAb, BBM.1. Immunoblotting confirmed a CD1d association with β2m when lysates were precipitated with the 42.1, 51.1, or 55.3 anti-CD1d mAbs (Fig. 5,top), but not with the D5 mAb. The precipitation of CD1d by each of the anti-CD1d mAbs was confirmed by subsequent immunoblotting with the rabbit anti-CD1d antibody (Fig. 5, bottom). Interestingly, the BBM.1 mAb in these experiments did not co-precipitate CD1d (Fig. 5, bottom), a result which indicates that β2m interacts differently with CD1dversus HLA class I proteins, which are co-precipitated by this mAb (data not shown). However, we have observed BBM.1 co-precipitation of CD1d when cells were iodinated (data not shown), indicating that the association may be stabilized by oxidation. This is consistent with a previous report showing BBM.1 precipitation of CD1d from iodinated tumor cells (39Bilsland C.A. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The previous studies described above showed that CD1d is glycosylated differently in the absence of β2m. One possible explanation is that in the absence of β2m, the CD1d on the cell surface represented an immature form of CD1d that was not processed to maturity after initial modification by N-glycosyltransferase. This was raised as a possibility because preliminary partial N-glycanase experiments suggested that all four potential sites forN-linked carbohydrate side chains were modified, yet the protein migrated faster in SDS-PAGE (data not shown). To test for this possibility, the sensitivity of CD1d to endoglycosidase-H (Endo-H) on the cell surface of the FO-1d single transfectant in the absence of β2m was evaluated. Radiolabeled cell surface proteins of the FO-1d transfectant were immunoprecipitated with either the D5 or 51.1 anti-CD1d mAbs, and the immunoprecipitates subjected to either digestion with N-glycanase (+N) to remove allN-linked modifications or endoglycosidase-H (+H) to remove immature N-linked carbohydrate side-chain modifications that had not been further modified beyond the initial glycosyltransferase transfer. As can be seen in Fig.6, the CD1d protein on the cell surface of the FO-1d single transfectant migrated as a 45-kDa endoglycosidase-H-sensitive protein (arrowhead), whereas the CD1d protein on the cell surface of the FO-1d/β2m double transfectant migrated as a 48-kDa endoglycosidase-H-resistant protein (arrow). This indicates that, in the absence of β2m, transport of an immature CD1d glycoprotein had occurred to the cell surface. To confirm these observations on cell surface expression of CD1d in the absence and presence of β2m, metabolic labeling studies were performed. Semi-confluent FO-1 CD1d and FO-1 CD1d/β2m cells were labeled with 35S for 10 min and subsequently chased for 0, 2, 4, and 24 h. The pulse-chase studies of the FO-1 cells transfected with CD1d alone are shown in Fig.7 after immunoprecipitation with the D5 and 51.1.3 mAbs. Throughout the 24-h chase, CD1d in the β2m negative FO-1 cells remained completely sensitive to Endo-H, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the polypeptide backbone, resolving as 37 kDa after this type of digestion (open arrow; lanes +H). At 0 h, the glycosylated 45-kDa CD1d (open arrowhead;lanes −N) was observed to be sensitive to Endo-H (lanes +H) and N-glycanase (lanes +N). At 2, 4, and 24 h, the 45-kDa form of CD1d (open arrowhead) chased into a 48-kDa form of CD1d (closed arrowhead). Although the nature of the carbohydrate side-chain modification of this 48 kDa form is presently unknown, these post-translational changes exhibited a complete sensitivity to Endo-H. Interestingly, because only the 45-kDa glycoprotein was identifiable on the cell surface (see Fig. 6) it is likely that this 48-kDa glycoprotein was retained intracellularly. Of additional note, the D5 mAb, which was raised against a GST-CD1d fusion protein, but not the 51.1.3 mAb, which was raised against a β2m-associated Fc-fusion protein of CD1d, readily detected the β2m-independent form of CD1d. Although the 51.1.3 mAb was able to immunoprecipitate the 48-kDa form of CD1d in the absence of β2m, it did so very late in the chase and with significantly less avidity than the D5 mAb. The examination of CD1d biosynthesis in the FO-1 CD1d/β2m double transfectants is shown in Fig. 8. In this cell line, at 0 h of the chase, a 45-kDa band (open arrowhead) was identifiable that was completely sensitive to Endo-H digestion (open arrow) but not recognized by the 51.1.3 mAb. In contrast to the single transfectant (see Fig. 7), this 45-kDa band, rapidly chased into a 48-kDa band (closed arrowhead) that was recognized by the 51.1.3 mAb and was resistant to digestion with Endo-H. A slight reduction of the molecular weight of the 51.1.3 immunoprecipitable material was observed, which we speculate is related to either contamination of the endoglycosidase-H enzyme with neuraminidase or incomplete maturation of one of the four carbohydrate side-chain modifications on CD1d. This observation needs clarification in future studies. By 4 h, the majority of CD1d had reached maturity based on Endo-H sensitivity, which was complete at 24 h in contrast to the single transfectant. The 51.1.3 mAb also notably preserved the interaction of CD1d with β2m (closed arrow), which, taken together with the other observations described above, suggest that the 51.1.3 mAb recognizes a conformational epitope associated with CD1d maturity. These metabolic-labeling studies of CD1d in the FO-1 CD1d and FO-1 CD1d/β2m transfectants thus confirm the cell surface radiolabeling studies. Several studies have demonstrated expression of human CD1d and its murine homologue in association with β2m (22Blumberg R.S. Terhorst C. Bleicher P. McDermott F. Allan C. Landau S. Trier S. Balk S.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2518-2524PubMed Google Scholar) and some have suggested that β2m may be required for murine CD1d expression (40Bendelac A. Hunziker R.D. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, we reported previously that endogenous CD1d could be detected on the cell surface of human intestinal epithelial cells in the absence of β2m and that transfected human and mouse CD1d could be expressed at the cell surface in a β2m-deficient cell line as defined by cell surface staining with a cross-reactive rat anti-mouse CD1d mAb (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, this initial report could not be corroborated by a second group working with mouse CD1d (40Bendelac A. Hunziker R.D. Lantz O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), perhaps because of the use of a transient transfection system. Using the original human CD1d transfectant of FO-1 plus a variety of other newly generated transfectants and newly generated CD1d-specific antibodies, we now provide definitive data that prove the ability of CD1d to be displayed on the cell surface in the absence of β2m. Cell surface expression of transfected human CD1d by the β2m deficient FO-1 human melanoma cell line was confirmed by flow cytometry with several CD1d-specific antibodies. Moreover, confirmation of this staining data was provided by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography of cell surface labeled proteins. The immunoprecipitations also showed that CD1d expressed by β2m-deficient FO-1 cells contained N-linked carbohydrate. This is in contrast to the non-β2m-associated form of CD1d expressed by intestinal epithelial cells, which does not carry N-linked carbohydrate (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results confirm that CD1d expression is not strictly β2m-dependent and is distinct from human CD1a, -b, and -c (41Bauer A. Huttinger R. Staffler G. Hansmann C. Schmidt W. Majdic O. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1366-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, these studies also indicate that the absence of β2m binding is probably not the primary event directing the expression of CD1d without N-linked carbohydrate in intestinal epithelial cells as previously reported (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,27Somnay-Wadgaonkar K. Nusrat A. Kim H.S. Canchis W.P. Balk S.P. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Int. Immunol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although CD1d expressed by the β2m-deficient FO-1 cells was glycosylated, it was not identical to CD1d expressed by FO-1 cells transfected with both CD1d and β2m. CD1d expressed by this double transfectant was β2m associated and migrated at about 48 kDa, similar to CD1d in other cells, which express β2m endogenously such as C1R and CHO. In contrast, cell surface CD1d expressed by the β2m deficient FO-1 cells migrated at about 45 kDa. This difference in mobility was due toN-linked carbohydrate as CD1d from both the β2m-deficient and β2m-transfected FO-1 cells migrated to 37 kDa after N-glycanase digestion. However, interestingly, the N-linked carbohydrate associated with CD1d on the cell surface of the β2m-negative transfectant exhibited complete sensitivity to Endo-H. This indicates that all of the CD1d expressed on the cell surface in the absence of β2m was immature and thus not subjected to further processing beyond that which occurred in the endoplasmic reticulum. Whether this altered form of CD1d is able to present processed antigen or form multimers with similarly processed CD1d or other molecules is not known. However, preliminary data suggest that the abnormally glycosylated CD1d expressed by the β2m-deficient FO-1 cells may be biologically relevant. Co-cultivation of the FO-1d cell line, but not the untransfected FO-1 cell line, leads to the phosphorylation of the T cell receptor-associated kinase p59fyn. 4N. A. Campbell, H. S. Kim, K. N. Evans, R. S. Blumberg, L. Mayer, submitted for publication. In addition, a recent study of CD1d expression on β2m−/−mice splenic B cells indicate that CD1 is expressed at low levels independently of β2m and this form of CD1 is capable of inducing T cell proliferation, which can be blocked by a rat anti-mouse CD1d mAb, 3C11 (42Amano M. Baumgarth N. Dick M.D. Brossay L. Kronenberg M. Herzenber L.A. Strober S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1710-1717PubMed Google Scholar). These observations by others provide strong support to our previous report of β2m independence of CD1d expression on human intestinal epithelial cell surface (26Balk S. Burke S. Polischuk J. Frantz M. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The importance of β2m association with CD1d with respect to the CD1d biosynthetic pathway has not been adequately explored. As demonstrated by surface labeling and pulse-chase metabolic labeling of CD1d, the association of β2m with CD1d appears to have an important role in regulating the extent of CD1d glycosylation and the maturity of the attached carbohydrate side chains. It is possible that in the presence of β2m, CD1d may be associating with chaperoning protein(s) in the endoplasmic reticulum that recognize both CD1d and β2m as a heterodimer and which function to delay the biosynthetic process until CD1d becomes fully glycosylated and reaches its maturity. Given the differences in the glycosylation pattern and Endo-H sensitivity in the presence and the absence of β2m in FO-1 CD1d cells, it is likely that CD1d synthesized in these two cell lines may have different chaperoning proteins involved in its assembly/biosynthesis. In summary, using cell lines that expressed either endogenous (C1R and CHO) or exogenous (FO-1) β2m, human CD1d was displayed on the cell surface as a β2m-associated heavy chain that was modified with N-linked carbohydrates that were processed to maturity. In contrast, in the absence of β2m, although CD1d transport to the cell surface was not significantly disrupted, CD1d associated N-linked carbohydrate modifications remained immature. These data provide another example of how CD1d biosynthesis is distinct from classical MHC class I (43Yewdell J.W. Resnick J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1992; 52: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) and suggest that β2m may regulate the expression of structurally distinct forms of CD1d that may deliver unique signals to CD1d reactive lymphocytes as may occur in intestinal neoplasia wherein β2m expression is often disrupted (44Bicknell D.C. Rowan A. Bodmer W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4751-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We are thankful for expert technical support from John Polischuk."

Mitotically active cells in log growth respond to TNF by rapidly undergoing apoptosis whereas TNF exposure stimulates cellular proliferation in mitotically quiescent cells. The concentration-dependent TNF-induced apoptosis was monitored by cellular metabolic activity and confirmed by both DNA epifluorescence and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, these responses could be detected by measuring extracellular acidification activity, enabling rapid prediction (within ∼ 1.5 h of TNF treatment) of the fate of the cell in response to TNF. Growth factor resupplementation of quiescent cells, resulting in reactivation of cell cycling, altered TNF action from a proliferative stimulus to an apoptotic signal. Expression levels of the type II TNF receptor subtype (p75TNFR) were found to correlate with sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of log growth TF-1 cells with a neutralizing anti-p75TNFR monoclonal antibody inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis by greater than 80%. Studies utilizing TNF receptor subtype-specific TNF mutants and neutralizing antisera implicated p75TNFR in TNF-dependent apoptotic signaling.

Growth factor resupplementation of quiescent cells, resulting in reactivation of cell cycling, altered TNF action from a proliferative stimulus to an apoptotic signal. Expression levels of the type II TNF receptor subtype (p75TNFR) were found to correlate with sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of log growth TF-1 cells with a neutralizing anti-p75TNFR monoclonal antibody inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis by greater than 80%. Studies utilizing TNF receptor subtype-specific TNF mutants and neutralizing antisera implicated p75TNFR in TNF-dependent apoptotic signaling. These data show a bifunctional physiological role for TNF in TF-1 cells that is dependent on mitotic activity and controlled by the p75TNFR. tumor necrosis factor-α TNF receptor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide phosphate-buffered saline type I 55-kDa TNF receptor subtype type II 75-kDa TNF receptor subtype R32W/S86T human TNF mutant protein D143N/A145R human TNF mutant protein sodium 3′-(1-phenyl-amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate Cells have the capability of responding to a multitude of signals that it encounters in its extracellular environment. One such signal with widespread pleiotropic actions is the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)1 (1Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). TNF has been shown to modulate proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic or necrotic cell death in a number of different cell types (2Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 3Heller R.A. Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 4Fiers W.

Vancriekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenberghe W. Vandecraen M. Vandevoorde V. Vercammen D. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 67-75Google Scholar). These disparate responses to TNF are mediated by TNF binding to specific cell surface receptors. Two distinct TNF receptors, type I (p55TNFR) and type II (p75TNFR) (M r55,000–60,000 and 70,000–80,000 in human cells, respectively), have been identified (5Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A.

Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), although it remains unclear which of the many responses reported for TNF can be attributed to a specific receptor subtype (4Fiers W. Beyaert R. Boone E. Cornelis S. Declercq W. Decoster E. Denecker G. Depuydt B. Devalck D. Dewilde G. Goossens V. Grooten J. Haegeman G. Heyninck K. Penning L. Plaisance S. Vancompernolle K. Vancriekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenberghe W. Vandecraen M. Vandevoorde V. Vercammen D. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 67-75Google Scholar). Moreover, the precise signal transduction pathways for each of these receptor subtypes have yet to be fully delineated. One action of TNF, the induction of apoptosis, is characterized by a discrete set of cellular events regulated by gene expression (7Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar, 8Wyllie A.H. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The physiological events accompanying apoptosis include condensation of the chromatin, degradation of DNA through the activation of endogenous nucleases, and dissolution of the cell into small membrane-bound apoptotic vesicles (9Cohen J.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 10Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In vivo, these vesicles are phagocytosed by macrophages or other phagocytic cells. Cell death by apoptosis is essential in many physiological processes, including embryonic development of the nervous system (11Raff M.C. Barres B.A. Burne J.F. Coles H.S. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), oncogenic pathology (12Fisher D.E. Cell. 1994; 78: 539-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), and clonal selection of hematopoietic cells (13Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Depatin K.-M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Conversely, TNF has also been shown to stimulate cellular proliferation in a variety of systems (14Palombella V.J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18128-18136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Reynolds C. Figari I.S. Weber R.F. Fendly B.M. Palladino M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4637-4641PubMed Google Scholar). Although apoptosis as a physiological phenomenon has only recently received widespread attention, it is apparent that proper development, organismal homeostasis, and oncogenic transformation are all thought to be contingent on a delicate balance between these opposing processes. The importance of both can be seen in a number of pathological diseases that are a consequence of either uncontrolled proliferation or apoptosis. Whereas proliferation is clearly linked to cell cycle progression, the role of the cell cycle and cell cycle-related proteins, such as cyclins, in apoptosis is less clear. Whether TNF-induced cell proliferation or apoptosis demonstrated in different model systems is also connected to the cell cycle apparatus has yet to be determined. We have used the human erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 as a model system to study TNF actions in early hematopoietic progenitor cells. TF-1 cells are a CD34+ myeloid progenitor stem cell line originally isolated from a human erythroleukemia patient (16Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These cells are factor-dependent and thus require a cytokine such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 for survival and proliferation. In this study, we demonstrate that the TF-1 cell line displays differential sensitivity toward TNF depending on the growth state of the cell. We show that mitotic activity is required for TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas conversely, mitotically quiescent cells respond to TNF by cellular proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate an important role for the p75TNFR in addition to the p55TNFR in mediating apoptosis. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human TNF was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human GM-CSF was procured from Boehringer Mannheim. Sea Kem GTG agarose was purchased from FMC Corp. (Rockland, ME). TF-1 cells were cultured as described previously in the presence of 1.0 ng/ml GM-CSF unless otherwise indicated (17Baxter G.T. Miller D.L. Kuo R.C. Wada H.G. Owicki J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10950-10954Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Log growth or stationary cultures were grown from a starting cell density of 2.0 × 104 cells/ml. Cell counts were performed daily over a period of 8 days to generate the TF-1 cell growth curves seen in Fig. 1, A and B (insets). Description and operation of the Cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) have been detailed elsewhere (18Parce J. Owicki J. Kercso K. Sigal G. Wada H. Muir V. Bousse L. Ross K. Sikic B. McConnell H. Science. 1989; 246: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 19Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1992; 7: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, TF-1 cells were collected from cultures of either 5.0 × 103 to 1.0 × 104 cells/ml (log growth) or 1.0–1.2 × 106 cells/ml (stationary). Approximately 2.5 × 105 cells were confined between two microporous polycarbonate membranes separated by a 50-μm-thick annular spacer immobilized within a fibrin clot described previously (20Kuo R.C. Baxter G.T. Alajoki L. Miller D.L. Libby J.M. Owicki J.C. Cryobiology. 1993; 30: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The microporous membranes and annular spacer form a disk-shaped chamber of 6 mm diameter and 50 μm height (volume, ∼2 μl) that, together with the fibrin immobilizing reagent, traps cells during the fluid perfusion of microphysiometer experiments. This cell capsule was placed in a flow- and temperature (37 °C)-regulated sensing chamber of the microphysiometer so that the lower membrane was in diffusive contact with the surface of the light-addressable potentiometric sensor chip, and pH changes were monitored at the sensor surface in an area of 2.5 mm (2Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) in the center of the chamber. Cells were perfused with low phosphate-buffered RPMI medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) in a cyclic manner automatically controlled by a peristaltic pump. The pump cycle was 150 s long, comprising a flow-on period (100 μl/min for 110 s) followed by a flow-off period (40 s). The 110 s duration of the flow-on period was necessary to allow for complete renewal of the medium in the sensing chamber. Extracellular acidification rate was determined from the slope of a linear least-squares fit to the relation of sensor output voltageversus time during the central 30 s of each flow-off period. The light-addressable potentiometric sensor used was Nernstian (61 mV ∼ 1 pH unit at 37 °C), so a rate of change of sensor output voltage of 1 μV/sec corresponds closely to an extracellular acidification rate of 1 × 10−3 pH unit/min. Acidification rate data were mathematically normalized to 100% at the data point just prior to TNF treatment (basal acidification rate). Normalization of acidification rates allows for direct comparison of rate data collected from separate chambers with different initial rates and takes into account the variation in the number of cells deposited above the active sensing region of the light-addressable potentiometric sensor chip. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was performed as described (21Dicker P. Rozengurt E. Nature. 1980; 287: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal numbers of TF-1 cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected onto glass fiber filters under vacuum and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. Filters were then washed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by a wash with 10 ml of ice-cold absolute ethanol. Dry filters were placed in scintillation vials, and radioactivity was determined by counting in a Beckman LS1801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). In order to assess proliferation or cell death from within the same assay, measurement of cell activity (and thus proportionately cell number) was determined by using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) or 3′-(1-phenyl-amino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) (Boehringer Mannheim) colorimetric assays. Basically, TF-1 cells (100 μl of growth medium/well) were seeded into a round-bottomed 96-well plate at the indicated density. After 18–24 h of recovery, cells were treated with an additional 100 μl/well of growth medium containing drug and/or TNF and incubated for 24 h more. Each well then received a further 20 μl of growth medium with 5 mg/ml of MTT or XTT. The cells were then allowed to incubate for 3–4 h to allow the metabolism of substrate to form the colored metabolic product. Cells in the 96-well plates were pelleted by centrifuging for 5 min at 1500 rpm (800 RCF). The supernatant medium was carefully aspirated off with a bent 24 gauge needle under low vacuum. To each well was added 100 μl of DMSO, and after 15–30 min, the absorbance for the MTT-formazan product was read at 540 nm (450 nm for XTT) with background subtraction at 690 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). The results are expressed in arbitrary absorbance units or as a percentage of the absorbance in control-treated cells. TF-1 cells had various agents added directly to the culture medium for the indicated time. Cells were then washed once by resuspension-centrifugation in culture medium (4 °C), and DNA was stained by inclusion of 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 stain as described (22MacEwan D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot of the stained cell sample was examined by epifluorescence using a Leitz Aristoplan microscope equipped with an A cube, and photographed at a magnification of × 320. Fields with large numbers of cells (>150) were used to ascertain the percentage of cells that were intensely fluorescing under ultraviolet excitation (characteristic of nuclear condensation due to the chromosomal compaction and nuclear karyorrhexis seen in apoptosis). The existence of nonfluorescent cells was confirmed by visible light microscopy. Poorly fluorescing cells that had passed through the greatest nuclear condensation were not included in calculations. TF-1 cultures at either 8.0 × 104 to 1.0 × 105 cells/ml (log growth) or 1.0–1.2 × 106 cells/ml (stationary) were collected and treated with or without 30 ng/ml TNF for 3 and 18 h. Cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Total DNA was extracted using the G NOME DNA kit from Bio 101 (La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentrations were calculated using 260 nm absorbance with a Hewlett-Packard 8451 spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Equal amounts of DNA (10 μg) were loaded per well on a 1.2% agarose gel and run at 7 V/cm for 1 h. DNA bands were visualized and photographed under UV illumination using a PhotoPrep system from Fotodyne (Hartland, WI). Extent of DNA fragmentation was quantitated using the cellular DNA fragmentation enzyme linked-immunoassay kit by Boehringer Mannheim. Briefly, TF-1 cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine for 24 h prior to treatment with TNF at the indicated concentrations for 3 h. Cells were lysed, and fragmented DNA was separated from genomic DNA by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min. The lysate was removed and tested by the enzyme-linked immunoassay as described previously (23Perros P. Weightman D.E. Cell Proliferation. 1991; 24: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of human TNF revealed that certain mutations of the wild-type sequence could enable the mutated protein to selectively bind to either of the TNF receptor subtypes. The specific double mutation of R32W/S86T (termed R1-TNF) allows selective activation by this mutant protein (“mutein”) of the p55TNFR only, whereas the D143N/A145R (termed R2-TNF) double mutation allows selective activation of the p75TNFR subtype only (24Loetscher H. Stueber D. Banner D. Mackay F. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25VanOstade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The TNF receptor-subtype-selective muteins were125I-radiolabeled essentially as described (26Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2904-2913PubMed Google Scholar) for use in radioligand binding studies to determine the TNF receptor subtype composition of TF-1 cells under varying conditions. Essentially, 5 μg of mutein was dissolved in 10 μl of 20 mm phosphate buffer in a siliconized tube. To the protein solution was added 1 μl (100 μCi) of 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) plus 10 μl of chloramine T (freshly dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer), which was then mixed and incubated for 30 s at room temperature before the addition of 10 μl of sodium metabisulfite (freshly dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer) and 100 μl of 1% albumin in PBS. The mixture was then loaded onto a G25 Sephadex column (equilibrated in 1% albumin in PBS). Radiolabeled protein was eluted with 1% albumin in PBS, collecting 1-ml fractions, which were tested for incorporation. Specific radioactivity of the muteins was 1–5 μCi/μg. TNF binding occurred in 200 μl of culture medium (4 °C) for 4 h before separation of unbound label in a Brandel filtration system (Semat, St. Albyns, United Kingdom) by washing in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (4 °C). Nonspecific binding accounting for up to 80% of the total binding as determined in the presence of 200 nm (4 μg/ml) excess unlabeled wild-type human TNF. Saturation (0.01–30 nm label) binding measurements were performed to allow Scatchard analysis of the TNF receptor subtypes on whole TF-1 cells (3 × 106 cells/tube). To investigate the functional responses of TF-1 cells to TNF, we monitored changes in metabolic activity during continuous TNF exposure with a Cytosensor microphysiometer. Based on a pH-sensitive, light-addressable potentiometric sensor (18Parce J. Owicki J. Kercso K. Sigal G. Wada H. Muir V. Bousse L. Ross K. Sikic B. McConnell H. Science. 1989; 246: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), the Cytosensor renders a general representation of ligand induced receptor activation by monitoring the rate of extracellular acidification (27McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Basal extracellular acidification rates depend on the energy-producing metabolic pathways, glycolysis, and aerobic respiration. Both metabolic pathways produce protons through formation of the acidic byproducts lactic acid and CO2, respectively. Thus, to a first approximation, extracellular acidification rate represents the sum of cellular glycolytic and respiratory activity and is therefore a measure of cellular metabolic activity. Stimulation by TNF or any growth factor, if sufficiently coupled to energy dependent cellular processes, perturbs extracellular acidification rates and is thus is detected by the Cytosensor (27McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated a differential sensitivity of TF-1 cells to TNF depending on culture condition. Therefore, we investigated TNF effects on cells at the extremes of both log growth and stationary phase. As seen in Fig. 1 A,TF-1 cells obtained from a culture undergoing log growth (8 × 104 to 1.0 × 105 cells/ml, see Fig.1 A, inset) responded to TNF with a concentration-dependent decrease in metabolic activity over a period of 3 h. At 30 ng/ml TNF, an initial transient increase in metabolic activity (∼ 5%) was followed by a decrease of greater than 30% when compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 1 A,Table I). Continuous exposure to 30 ng/ml TNF for 18 h decreased metabolic activity by approximately 90% of the initial basal activity (data not shown).Table IMetabolic effects of TNF on TF-1 cellsTNFChange of control acidification rateLog growth cellsStationary cells0.5 h3 h0.5 h3 hng/ml%0.030.3 ± 0.6−8.0 ± 3.88.3 ± 2.912.7 ± 3.20.31.3 ± 1.5−14.6 ± 4.541.0 ± 9.019.0 ± 11.032.7 ± 0.6−23.0 ± 1.261.3 ± 14.514.0 ± 7.8303.7 ± 2.1−30.3 ± 1.078.2 ± 7.414.2 ± 8.2Maximal microphysiometry responses during the initial 30-min time period or after 3 h of TNF exposure are shown for both log growth and stationary cultures of TF-1 cells.

Results are expressed as the percentage of change (percent change in acidification rate of treated cells − percent acidification rate of control cells). Data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least five independent experiments. In contrast, TF-1 cells obtained from the same culture, but in the stationary phase of their growth curve (1.0–1.2 × 106 cells/ml; see Fig. 1 B, inset) responded to TNF with a stimulation of metabolic activity (Fig. 1 B, TableI). At high concentrations (>3 ng/ml), the response was biphasic: a dramatic initial burst followed by a secondary sustained elevation of metabolic activity (Fig. 1 B, Table I). This response was reminiscent of the metabolic response seen with GM-CSF (28Barry M.A. Eastman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), a cytokine required for TF-1 cell proliferation, suggesting that TNF may induce cellular proliferation under these conditions. Maximal effects of TNF were seen at 30 ng/ml TNF (data not shown) consistent with other known responses (22MacEwan D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We hypothesized three possible mechanisms of decreased metabolic activity resulting from TNF exposure. These included (i) a general suppression of cellular metabolism; (ii) a conversion from glycolytic to aerobic metabolism, resulting in reduced proton production per ATP turned over (19Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Biosensors Bioelectronics. 1992; 7: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); and (iii) a cytotoxic mode of action. We observed that TNF exhibited dramatically different effects on cell viability as a function of the growth state. Log growth cells responded to a 48-h treatment with TNF by a concentration-dependent decrease in viable cell number as compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 A). Alternatively, cells initially in a stationary growth state showed a concentration-dependent increase in viable cell number following a 48-h TNF treatment when compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2 B). Increased cell number in response to TNF could either be due to rescue from cell death as a result of growth factor depletion or actual induction of cellular proliferation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured cell growth over a period of 3 days in the presence and absence of TNF. The data indicate that the number of viable TF-1 cells derived from a stationary culture decreased slightly over time in the absence of TNF (Fig. 3), but with 1 ng/ml TNF treatment, the number of viable cells increased over the course of the experiment (Fig. 3). This appeared to represent a TNF stimulation of cellular proliferation with TF-1 cells collected from a stationary culture. In addition, the ability of TNF to induce proliferation in quiescent TF-1 cells is due to its actions directly on the cells and not through its induction of other secondary mitogenic factors. This was confirmed in conditioned medium experiments in which the medium from 24 h, 50 ng/ml TNF-treated cells in the extra presence of 0.1 mg/ml of a neutralizing anti-TNF polyclonal antibody was unable to elicit proliferation of quiescent TF-1 cells as measured by MTT assay (104 ± 5% of control cell number). Medium with neutralizing antibody alone resulted in 97 ± 8% of control, whereas medium conditioned for 24 h with TNF alone (no neutralizing antibody included) still partly retained its ability to induce proliferation (122 ± 6% of control cell levels (mean ± S.D. from representative experiments repeated three other times with similar findings)). Thus, the proliferative effect of TNF is directly on quiescent TF-1 cells and not via induction of some other TNF-induced mitogenic factor. TF-1 cells in log growth responded to TNF by both a decrease in metabolic activity (Fig. 1 A) and a decrease in viable cell number (Fig. 2 A). These findings suggested a cytotoxic mode of action for TNF, which we further examined by using inhibitors of protein synthesis and gene transcription. Treatment with 2 μg/ml cycloheximide or actinomycin D completely eliminated the decrease in metabolic activity seen with TNF (data not shown), implying that the cytotoxic action of TNF required active macromolecular synthesis consistent with an apoptotic mechanism. Also intriguing was the transient increase in metabolic activity during the first 30 min of treatment with high concentrations of TNF (Fig. 1 A). This was indicative of an energy-requiring process consistent with other work showing that the progression of apoptosis requires cellular energy (30Carson D.A. Ribeiro J.M. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1251-1254Abstract PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Taken together with previous reports of TNF action, this suggests that in mitotically active cells, TNF may be inducing apoptosis. To more directly evaluate the possibility of TNF-induced apoptosis, we employed two independent assays. Chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation, two physiological stages in the progression of apoptosis (8Wyllie A.H. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), were assessed by analysis of Hoechst 33342 staining and gel electrophoresis, respectively. As seen in Fig.4 A, a concentration-dependent increase in the percentage of highly fluorescent (“epifluorescent”) Hoechst-stained apoptotic cells occurred following TNF stimulation. The time course of TNF-mediated apoptosis is shown in Fig. 4 B. These results indicated that 40% of the cell population was apoptotic after only 3 h of treatment with 50 ng/ml TNF as measured by Hoechst stain. Decreases in the percentage of apoptotic cells seen at later time points were due to advancement beyond the state of chromatin condensation, and cells beyond this stage of apoptosis are not scored by the Hoechst stain assay (see under “Experimental Procedures”). As an independent assay of apoptosis, we also determined the extent of DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis after TNF treatment. As seen in Fig. 4 C, cells treated with 30 ng/ml TNF exhibited significant DNA fragmentation after 3 and 18 h of treatment when compared with untreated controls. Both the time course and concentration dependence of DNA fragmentation and Hoechst stain were consistent with measurements of cell viability (Fig.2 A) and changes in metabolic activity (Fig.1 A). The previous data demonstrate that TF-1 cells in a state of log growth respond to TNF by induction of apoptosis, whereas induction of proliferation occurs with the same cell population when allowed to grow to a stationary phase. This suggested that only a mitotically active cell, i.e. one undergoing active DNA synthesis, was sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. Similarly, a quiescent cell not actively undergoing DNA synthesis should not be sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. To test these predictions we induced mitogenesis in a stationary culture by GM-CSF supplementation and then compared the extent of TNF-induced apoptosis in the proliferating culture relative to a non-GM-CSF stimulated stationary culture. Mitotic activity was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. TF-1 cells initially obtained from a stationary culture, when supplemented with 1 ng/ml GM-CS"
https://openalex.org/W1982063629,"Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Free radical generation by Aβ peptides was suggested to be a key mechanism of their neurotoxicity. Reports that neurotoxic free radicals derived from Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(25–35) peptides react with the spin trap<i>N</i>-<i>tert</i>-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) to form a PBN/<sup>⋅</sup>Aβ peptide radical adduct with a specific triplet ESR signal assert that the peptide itself was the source of free radicals. We now report that three Aβ peptides, Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(25–35), and Aβ-(40–1), do not yield radical adducts with PBN from the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF). In contrast to OMRF PBN, incubation of Sigma PBN in phosphate buffer without Aβ peptides produced a three-line ESR spectrum. It was shown that this nitroxide is di-<i>tert</i>-butylnitroxide and is formed in the Sigma PBN solution as a result of transition metal-catalyzed auto-oxidation of the respective hydroxylamine present as an impurity in the Sigma PBN. Under some conditions, incubation of PBN from Sigma with Aβ-(1–40) or Aβ-(25–35) can stimulate the formation of di-<i>tert</i>-butylnitroxide. It was shown that Aβ peptides enhanced oxidation of cyclic hydroxylamine 1-hydroxy-4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMPONE-H), which was strongly inhibited by the treatment of phosphate buffer with Chelex-100. It was shown that ferric and cupric ions are effective oxidants of TEMPONE-H. The data obtained allow us to conclude that under some conditions toxic Aβ peptides Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(25–35) enhance metal-catalyzed oxidation of hydroxylamine derivatives, but do not spontaneously form peptide-derived free radicals."
https://openalex.org/W2027447954,"The Prp19p protein of the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential splicing factor and is associated with the spliceosome during the splicing reaction. We have previously shown that Prp19p is not tightly associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles but is associated with a protein complex consisting of at least eight protein components. By sequencing components of the affinity-purified complex, we have identified Cef1p as a component of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc85p. Cef1p could directly interact with Prp19p and was required for pre-mRNA splicing both in vivo and in vitro. The c-Myb DNA binding motif at the amino terminus of Cef1p was required for cellular growth but not for interaction of Cef1p with Prp19p or Cef1p self-interaction. We have identified a small region of 30 amino acid residues near the carboxyl terminus required for both cell viability and protein-protein interactions. Cef1p was associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p, i.e. concomitant with or immediately after dissociation of U4. The anti-Cef1p antibody inhibited binding to the spliceosome of Cef1p, Prp19p, and at least three other components of the Prp19p-associated complex, suggesting that the Prp19p-associated complex is likely associated with the spliceosome and functions as an integral complex.

During spliceosome assembly, U1 first binds to the 5′ splice site followed by binding of U2 to the branch site through base pair interactions between the small nuclear RNAs and the intron sequences. U4/U6 and U5 are then added to the spliceosome as a preformed three-small nuclear RNP particle. This triggers a conformational rearrangement of the spliceosome in which base pairing of U1 with the 5′ splice site is replaced by U6, and base paired U4/U6 unwinds to form new base pairings between U6 and U2 (14Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Cell. 1992; 71: 803-818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 15Sawa H. Shimura Y.

U1 and U4 thus become only loosely associated with the spliceosome, which is now activated and ready for catalytic reactions. It is believed that such structural rearrangements of the spliceosome are mediated by protein factors. Although several proteins containing the DEX(D/H) box motif have been shown RNA unwindase activity (6Staley J.P. Guthrie C.

It remains a question what dictates the substrate specificity and mediates conformational rearrangement of the spliceosome during spliceosome assembly. We have previously shown that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp19p protein is essential for pre-mRNA splicing and is required before the first step of the splicing reaction. Prp19p is not tightly associated with small nuclear RNAs but is associated with the spliceosome immediately after or concomitant with dissociation of U4 from the spliceosome, suggesting a possible role in mediating structural rearrangement of the spliceosome during U4 dissociation (22Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In splicing extracts, a protein complex consisting of at least eight polypeptides was found associated with Prp19p, and at least one of these proteins is also essential for the in vitrosplicing reaction (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Genetic screening of synthetic lethal mutants to prp19mutations has identified a novel splicing factor Snt309p as a component of the Prp19p-associated complex, Ntc25p (Ntc stands for PRP nineteen complex). Snt309p is encoded by a nonessential gene and also has no functional motif in its protein sequence. Snt309p is associated with the spliceosome in the same manner as Prp19p, suggesting a coordinate action of these two proteins (24Chen H.-R. Jan S.-P. Tsao T.Y. Sheu Y.-J. Banroques J. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By sequencing components of the purified Prp19p-associated complex, we show here that the CEF1 gene encodes another component, Ntc85p, of the Prp19p-associated complex. Cef1p belongs to a family of Myb-related proteins, which contain two copies of the c-Myb DNA binding motif at their amino termini and are highly homologous to the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cdc5p protein (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A. McCann S. Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We show that Cef1p is required for splicing both in vivo andin vitro. The c-Myb DNA binding motif was required for cellular growth but not for interaction of Cef1p with Prp19p or for Cef1p self-interaction. We have also identified a small region of the protein near the carboxyl terminus of Cef1p required both for cellular growth and for protein-protein interactions. Like Snt309p, Cef1p is also associated with the spliceosome in the same fashion as Prp19p. Moreover, anti-Cef1p antibody inhibited binding of all identified components of the Prp19p-associated complex to the spliceosome, which further suggests that the Prp19p-associated complex likely functions as an integral complex. The strains used were as follows: YSCC1, Mata prc1 prb1 pep4 leu2 trp1 ura3 PRP19-HA; SEY6210.5,Mata/Matαleu2/leu2 ura3/ura3 his3/his3 trp1/trp1 suc2/suc2 lys2/LYS2 ADE2/ade2; EGY48, Matαura3 his3 trp1 LexAop-leu2 ade2; WT85141, Mataura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ΔCEF1::LEU2[pRS414.CEF1]; WT85161, Mataura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ΔCEF1::LEU2[pRS416.CEF1]; WT8541, Mataura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ΔCEF1::LEU2[pRS416.GPD::CEF1]; WT8501, Mataura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ΔCEF1::LEU2[pRS414.GAL1::CEF1]. The oligonucleotides used were as follows: 85-1, GGCCGGATCCATTTCAAGATGCCCC; 85-2, GGCCGGATCCAAACTGGTCATAAA. The construction of plasmids was as follows: pWT8, the DNA fragment retrieved from the yeast genome by PCR with oligonucleotides 85-1 and 85-2 was ligated into the BamHI site of plasmid pGEM-1; pWT821, the BamHI fragment from pWT8 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pET15b; pWT81 the 1-kb1 StyI fragment within the ORF of CEF1 in pWT8 was replaced with a 2-kb LEU2 fragment; pWT83, the BamHI fragment from pWT8 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pRS416.GPD; pWT84, the BamHI fragment from pWT8 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid vector pRS414.GAL; pWT85, theBamHI fragment from pWT8 was inserted into theBamHI site of plasmid vector pEG202; pWT86, theBamHI fragment from pWT8 was inserted into theBamHI site of plasmid vector pACT2; pWT91, a 5.3-kb yeast DNA fragment containing the ORF of CEF1 and 2.7-kb sequence upstream and 0.8-kb downstream of the ORF in the SmaI site of pRS414; pWTN1, deletion of amino acid residues 7–94 of CEF1 in pWT91; pWTN2, deletion of amino acid residues 94–163 of CEF1 in pWT91; pWTN3, deletion of amino acid residues 163–281 of CEF1 in pWT91; pWTC3, deletion of amino acid residues 281–459 of CEF1 in pWT91; pWTC2, deletion of amino acid residues 459–570 of CEF1 in pWT91; pWTC1, deletion of amino acid residues 490–570 of CEF1 in pWT91; pBDN2, deletion of amino acid residues 94–163 of CEF1 in pWT85; pBDN3, deletion of amino acid residues 163–281 of CEF1 in pWT85; pBDC3, deletion of amino acid residues 281–459 of CEF1 in pWT85; pBDC2, deletion of amino acid residues 459–570 of CEF1 in pWT85; pBDC1, deletion of amino acid residues 490–570 of CEF1 in pWT85; pADN1, deletion of amino acid residues 1–94 of CEF1 in pWT86; pADN2, deletion of amino acid residues 94–163 of CEF1 in pWT86; pADN3, deletion of amino acid residues 163–281 of CEF1 in pWT86; pADC3, deletion of amino acid residues 281–459 of CEF1 in pWT86; pADC12, deletion of amino acid residues 459–570 of CEF1 in pWT86; pADC1, deletion of amino acid residues 490–570 of CEF1 in pWT86. The Prp19p-associated complex was purified according to the procedure described by Tarn et al. (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with some modifications for large scale preparations. 50 liters of yeast culture of strain YSCC1 were grown in a 75-liter fermenter until A 600 = 6–8 before harvesting. Spheroplast extracts were prepared followed by precipitation with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate according to Chenget al. (26Cheng S.-C. Newman A. Lin R.-J. McFarland G.D. Abelson J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The pellet fraction (40P) was chromatographed on a 2-ml anti-HA antibody column in buffer DK (20 mmHepes-K+, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 60 mm KPO4, pH 7.0). After recycling four times, the column was washed at 4 °C with 160 ml of buffer DK containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and then with 20 ml of buffer DK at room temperature. The Prp19p-associated complex was then eluted with 0.6 mm of HA peptide in buffer DK at room temperature. Pooled fractions were concentrated in Centriplus-10 (Amicon). Yeast manipulation was according to standard methods as described by Guthrie and Fink (27Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar). The ORF of CEF1 gene was cloned by PCR amplification of yeast genomic DNA using primers 85-1 and 85-2 into plasmid pGEM-1. The null cef1::LEU2 allele was created by replacing a 1-kb StyI fragment within the ORF ofCEF1 with a 2-kb fragment containing the LEU2gene in a diploid strain SEY6210.5. Haploid strains harboring disruptedCEF1 genes were isolated by sporulation and tetrad dissection of the heterozygous diploid strain containing plasmid pWT83 followed by selection of spores of leucine and uracil prototrophy. A large genomic fragment of CEF1 containing the promoter region was isolated by screening a yeast genomic library using the PCR fragment as a probe. A 5.3-kb fragment, containing the ORF ofCEF1 and 2.7 kb of sequence upstream and 0.8 kb downstream of the ORF, was subcloned into plasmid pRS414, and the resulting plasmid pWT91 was used for deletion analysis. Deletion clones were constructed by deleting the following restriction fragments from pWT91: pWTN1, deletion of BsaAI to StuI; pWTN2, deletion of StuI to StyI(1); pWTN3, deletion ofStyI(1) to DraIII; pWTC3, deletion ofDraIII to NruI; pWTC2, deletion ofNruI to PvuI; pWTC1, deletion ofStyI(2) to PvuI. The PRP19, CEF1, and CEF1 deletion genes were fused to the LexA DNA binding domain in plasmid pEG202 and the GAL4 activation domain in plasmid pACT2, and each pair of plasmids was transformed into yeast strain EGY48 together with the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid pSH18-34. Two-hybrid assays were carried out according to procedures described in the manual for the Matchmaker system by CLONTECH. At least three transformants from each pair of plasmid were assayed for β-galactosidase activity in liquid culture. Strain WT8501 was obtained by plasmid shuffling to replace plasmid pWT83 in strain WT8541 with plasmid pWT84. WT8501 cells were grown in galactose medium until mid-log phase and diluted to glucose or galactose media toA 600 = 0.1. Cells were measured forA 600 at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 h and were diluted to A 600 = 0.1 again at each time point. The relative A value was plotted as a function of time. Isolation of total yeast RNA and Northern blot analysis were performed as described by Vijayraghavan et al. (28Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A 0.6-kbEcoRI–BamHI fragment from plasmid pActSP6–88 was used to prepare the actin probe. Plasmid pWT8 was linearized at the EcoRI site and used for in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase. In vitro transcription and translation reactions were carried out as described by Tarn et al. (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Far Western blot analysis was modified from the procedure in Tarn et al. (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After transblotting, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was rinsed with distilled H2O and then incubated with a buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 4 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 5 min and repeated once. The blot was then sequentially incubated at 4 °C for 5 min with the same buffer but containing 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.187 m and then no guanidine hydrochloride, respectively, followed by incubation with TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% low fat milk and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 1–2 h and then TBST containing 1% milk and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation with 2–4 × 105 cpm/ml of the 35S-labeled Prp19p or Cef1p protein in TBST containing 1% milk and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight, the blot was washed twice with TBST containing 1% milk at 4 °C for 10 min and then once with TBST at room temperature for 10 min and then subjected to autoradiography. Splicing assays were performed according to Lin et al. (29Lin R.-J. Lustig A.J. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using uncapped actin pre-mRNA as the substrate. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described by Tarn et al. (30Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Biotinylated pre-mRNA was synthesized the same way as regular pre-mRNA substrates, except 25 μm of bio-UTP was included in the presence of 0.5 mm of UTP in the transcription reaction. For precipitation of the spliceosome, each 100 μl of the splicing reaction mixture, containing 4 nm of biotinylated pre-mRNA and 50 μl of the splicing extract, was incubated with 30–40 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1–2 h. The precipitates were washed with 0.4 ml of a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 three times and analyzed for proteins by Western blotting. The Cef1p protein was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the T7 promoter. Total lysates prepared from induced cells were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the Cef1p protein was eluted from the gel for immunization of rabbits. To purify the antibody, the recombinant protein eluted from gel was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each 20 ml of the anti-Cef1p antiserum was purified through a 3-ml Cef1p column to yield a total of 0.6 mg of the antibody at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. To identify the components of the Prp19p-associated complex, a yeast strain in which the Prp19p protein was tagged with the HA-epitope at its carboxyl terminus was cultured in large scales for preparation of splicing extracts. The Prp19p-associated complex was purified from these extracts by affinity chromatography on an anti-HA antibody column (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The components of the complex were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for microsequencing. Sequences obtained were compared with the yeast genome data base. One peptide sequence PVPIYVKGEVWTNV obtained from Ntc85p was identified to be encoded within the CEF1 gene (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A. McCann S. Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Prp19p interacts with Ntc85p on Far Western blots when Prp19p was used as a probe (23Tarn W.-Y. Hsu C.-H. Huang K.-T. Chen H.-R. Kao H.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether CEF1 indeed encodes Ntc85p, the interaction between Prp19p and Cef1p was examined by Far Western blotting using Cef1p as a probe. A DNA fragment containing CEF1 and 460 base pairs of its downstream sequence was retrieved by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 85-1 and 85-2 and cloned into plasmid pGEM-1 forin vitro transcription and translation. Components of the Prp19p-associated complex were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Far Western blot analysis using in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled Cef1p or Prp19p as probes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, when Cef1p was used as a probe, interaction of Cef1p with Prp19p was detected. While Prp19p could interact with five proteins, Ntc85p, Ntc40p, Ntc25p, Ntc20p, and itself, in the Prp19p-associated complex, Cef1p could only interact with Prp19p. No interaction with other components of the complex was detected in this analysis. The fact that Cef1p interacted with Prp19p and the in vitro translated Cef1p migrated as 85 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown) strongly suggested that Cef1p is Ntc85p of the Prp19p-associated complex. To verify that Cef1p is Ntc85p of the Prp19p-associated complex, antibodies were raised against recombinant Cef1p for Western blot analysis of the Prp19p-associated complex. As shown in Fig.1 B, while preimmune serum did not react with any protein, the anti-Cef1p antibody indeed reacted with Ntc85p of the complex. Preincubation of the antibody with the recombinant Cef1p protein blocked its reaction with Ntc85p. This confirms that CEF1indeed encodes Ntc85p of the Prp19p-associated complex. Cef1p is a protein of 590 amino acids and belongs to a family of Myb-related proteins identified in yeast, Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, and humans (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A.

Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cef1p is 48% identical to the fission yeast S. pombe Cdc5p protein over a region of 267 amino acid residues in its amino terminus (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A. McCann S. Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal halves of these proteins are less alike. The CEF1 gene is essential for vegetative yeast growth. It has been shown that multiple point mutations of tryptophan residues located within the c-Myb DNA binding motif impair cellular growth, indicating that the c-Myb DNA binding domain is required for Cef1p function (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A. McCann S. Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of other regions of the protein, we performed deletion analysis for the in vivofunction of Cef1p. The CEF1 gene under the control of its own promoter in pRS414 was deleted in different regions and transformed into strain WT85161, which contained a null allele of theCEF1 gene on the chromosome and a wild-type copy of theCEF1 gene under the control of its own promoter in plasmid pRS416. These transformants were plated on 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates for selection of loss of the wild-type CEF1-containing plasmid after growth in the absence of uracil selection. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of amino acid residues 8–93 (N1) within the c-Myb DNA binding motif failed to rescue lethality of CEF1 disruption, indicating that the Myb motif is essential for yeast growth. This is consistent with that reported by Ohi et al. (25Ohi R. Feoktistova A. McCann S. Valentine V. Look A.T. Lipsick J. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4097-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deletion of other regions of the NH2-terminal half conserved sequence of the protein (N2 and N3) also resulted in cell lethality. The COOH-terminal half of Cef1p, being less conserved among the proteins of this family, appeared to be less important, since deletion of most of the sequence (C1 or C3) did not affect growth. However, a small region, C2, at amino acid residues 460–490, is absolutely essential, since deletion of both C1 and C2 resulted in lethality. Thus, the NH2-terminal half of the conserved region and approximately 30 amino acids in the COOH-terminal half of the protein are important for the function of Cef1p in vivo. Since Cef1p is a component of the Prp19p-associated complex and can directly interact with Prp19p, we asked whether its interaction with Prp19p correlated with its function. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to examine the requirement of various regions of Cef1p for interaction between Cef1p and Prp19p. Prp19p and Cef1p, including its truncated versions, were fused to both LexA DNA binding domain (BD) and GAL4 activation domain (AD) individually. Interactions between Cef1p and Prp19p were assayed by measuring the β-galactosidase activity. Fig.3 A shows that interaction between Prp19p and Cef1p could be detected by the two-hybrid assay when Prp19p was fused to the binding domain and Cef1p was fused to the activation domain and vice versa. Combination of Cef1p-BD and Prp19p-AD seemed to give higher β-galactosidase activity than that of Cef1p-AD and Prp19p-BD. Furthermore, most Cef1p deletions fused to the activation domain affected interactions more than when fused to the LexA DNA binding domain. The cause of such differences is not clear. Therefore, evaluation of the effect of deletion was mostly based on deletions in Cef1p-BD except for dN1, whose fusion to the binding domain was not available. Deletion analysis revealed that at least one region of the Cef1p protein is essential for interaction. In the NH2-terminal conserved half of the protein, deletion of the c-Myb DNA binding domain (N1) or deletion of N3 did not strongly affect the level of β-galactosidase expression. Thus, the c-Myb DNA binding domain is not required for interaction of Cef1p with Prp19p. In contrast, deletion of approximately 70 amino acids behind the Myb domain (N2) drastically decreased the β-galactosidase activity. In the carboxyl half of the protein, while deletion of C1 alone only had a moderate effect, deletion of both C1 and C2 resulted in no β-galactosidase activity. Deletion of C3 also only partially affected the β-galactosidase expression. Failure in detecting the β-galactosidase activity in dN2 and dC1,2 may be attributed to loss of its ability to interact with Prp19p or instability of the fusion proteins. The possibility of protein instability for dC1,2 was ruled out by immunoblot analysis, which detected the fusion protein of dC1,2 in cell lysates at levels comparable with others (data not shown). Therefore, it is suggested that the C2 region is essential for Cef1p-Prp19p interaction. The dN2 fusion protein, however, was not present at detectable level in total yeast lysates (data not shown). Although this does not disprove the essential role of N2 in Cef1p-Prp19p interaction in vivo, the requirement of N2 for such interaction cannot be concluded. In Fig. 1, Cef1p was detected to interact only with Prp19p by Far Western blotting. By two-hybrid assays, self-interaction of Cef1p was observed as shown in Fig. 3 B. Interestingly, deletion of either N2 or C2 also abolished self-interaction of Cef1p. This indicates that the C2 region is responsible for both Cef1p-Prp19p interaction and Cef1p self-interaction. The requirement for N2 remains undetermined for the same reason of protein instability. Deletion of N3, however, seemed to weaken self-interaction of Cef1p considerably despite slight enhancement upon interaction between Prp19p and Cef1p. In contrast, C1 and C3 deletions, when fused to the DNA binding domain, enhanced self-interaction of Cef1p but weakened its interaction with Prp19p. This may indicate a competition between Cef1p-Prp19p interaction and Cef1p self-interaction, since both interactions involved the same region(s) of the Cef1p protein. Since Cef1p is a component of the Prp19p-associated complex, it is likely that Cef1p is also a splicing factor. To examine whether Cef1p is required for pre-mRNA splicing, yeast strain WT8501, which contained a null allele of the CEF1 gene on the chromosome and a wild-type copy of the CEF1 gene under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter on plasmid pRS414, was grown in galactose medium to mid-log phase and then either continuously grown in galactose or shifted to glucose medium to repress the CEF1 gene. RNA was isolated at different times after the shift and analyzed for accumulation of pre-mRNA by Northern blot analysis using actin as a probe. Growth curves in Fig.4 A show that cell growth was arrested approximately 8 h after shifting to glucose medium. Accumulation of pre-mRNA was accordingly observed as shown in Fig.4 B.

The predicted amino acid sequence (765 amino acids) is likely to be the homologue of the human placental amine oxidase and of the partially known sequence of the rat adipocyte membrane amine oxidase. SSAO mRNAs are present in several tissues, but strikingly, the highest levels of gene expression are found in adipose tissue and aorta. Enzyme transcript levels are barely detectable in preadipocytes but are induced several hundred-fold during the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A cells and of rat precursor primary cultures. These changes in transcript levels parallel a sharp increase in SSAO enzyme activity. The biochemical properties of the SSAO present in 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A adipocytes closely resemble the features of the SSAO activity previously described in white and brown adipose tissues. Interestingly, SSAO mRNA levels and enzyme activity drop in response to effectors of the cAMP pathway and to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α, indicating that two major signaling molecules of adipose tissue development and metabolism can control SSAO function. Moreover, the expression of SSAO transcripts and activity are clearly down-regulated in white adipose tissue from obese Zücker rats. Because of its known stimulatory effect on glucose transport, its biochemical properties and its pattern of expression and regulation, SSAO could play an important role in the regulation of adipocyte homeostasis.

To perform these essential functions, adipocytes express a large pattern of enzymes and accessory proteins that concur in lipogenesis or lipolysis. Moreover, these metabolic pathways are under the tight control of a variety of hormones. Several major discoveries have supported the idea that, besides its classical energetic functions, the adipocyte is also able to exert regulatory functions through the secretion of paracrine or endocrine factors. In vivo a process of recruitment and conversion of mesenchymal cells into adipocytes can occur throughout life. Studies on adipogenesis have been greatly facilitated by the availability of established preadipose cell lines (1Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 3Négrel R. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6054-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). When cultured under appropriate conditions, committed preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes mimicking the white phenotype. The highly specialized functions of the mature adipocyte are acquired during the course of adipose differentiation. The emergence of the adipocyte phenotype is linked to the coordinated expression of a large number of genes and proteins. So far, a great number of genes have been identified and related to the molecular mechanisms of fat cell differentiation. They include genes coding for enzymes and structural proteins, transcription factors, hormone receptors, and secreted proteins (4Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Négrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 5Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The scope of this study was to identify novel genes that are differentially expressed during the adipose conversion process. For this purpose, we used an mRNA differential display technique (6Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) adapted according to the simple protocol of Sokolov and Prockop (7Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The key element of this technique is to generate cDNA fragments by reverse transcription with random hexanucleotides and then to perform a polymerase chain reaction in the presence of primers arbitrary in sequence. This approach allowed us to clone the cDNA of the murine semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO),1 an amine oxidase related to the copper-containing amine oxidase family. This cDNA is the murine homolog of the recently described human placental amine oxidase (8Zhang X. MacIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and of the partially identified cDNA of the rat adipocyte plasma membrane amine oxidase (9Morris N.J. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Ross S.A. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These enzymes are known to oxidize primary amines by molecular oxygen to generate the corresponding aldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. During differentiation of 3T3-F442A or 3T3-L1 preadipose cells, there was a dramatic increase in SSAO mRNA levels correlated with a striking induction in enzyme activity. The same pattern of expression was observed during adipose conversion of mesenchymal adipocyte precursors. This profile of SSAO expression was quite different from those of two well known copper-containing amine oxidases, diamine oxidase and polyamine oxidase. Interestingly, SSAO expression appeared to be highly modulated by environmental conditions. Tissue distribution of SSAO mRNA indicated a preferential expression in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and aorta. Given the peculiar tissue expression profile, its functional properties (10Enrique-Tarancon G. Marti L. Morin N. Lizcano J.M. Unzeta M. Sevilla L. Camps M. Palacin M. Testar X. Carpene C. Zorzano A.

Stocks of murine 3T3-C2 fibroblasts (11Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar), and of 3T3-L1 (1Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (739) Google Scholar) or 3T3-F442A (2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM containing 25 mmd-glucose and supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. For experiments, cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells was initiated by the addition of 1 μg/ml insulin at confluence. For 3T3-L1 cells, induction of differentiation was achieved by a treatment with dexamethasone (0.25 μm), insulin (1 μg/ml), and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.1 mm) for the 48-h period following confluence (12Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of induction mixture, cells were refed in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml insulin. At day 7 after confluence, more than 90% of 3T3-L1 or 3T3-F442A cells had the morphology of mature adipocytes. 3T3-C2 cells kept a fibroblastic shape at all of the culture stages. Primary cultures of rat preadipose cells were seeded from the stroma vascular fraction derived from the isolation of rat adipocytes according to the procedure of Rodbell (13Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained and allowed to differentiate as described previously (14Deslex S. Négrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell. Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA was first isolated using the general procedure of mRNA differential display described by Liang and Pardee (6Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) and modified according to Sokolov and Prockop (7Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared (15Cathala C. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) from 3T3-C2 cells and 3T3-F442A cells harboring different phenotypes. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl volume, consisting of 400 μm of each dNTP, 10 μm of random hexanucleotides, 3 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor/μg of RNA. After a 1-h incubation at 42 °C, Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase was heat-inactivated. One μl of the cDNA sample was amplified by PCR in a DNA thermal cycler 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). PCR was performed in a 25-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.55, 16 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, a 125 μm concentration of each dNTP, 12.5 pmol of each of the two oligonucleotide primers, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies). A set of 10–23-mer primers with an arbitrary but defined sequence was used. The sequences of the 20-mer oligonucleotides that allowed us to identify an 840-bp cDNA (see “Results”) were 5′-CACTGGCCTCGATCTACTCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGAAGGTCGTCCTCGTC-3′. cDNAs were denatured for 5 min at 94 °C and submitted to 40 cycles of amplification (one cycle: 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and stained by ethidium bromide. cDNA fragments were then isolated from the gel using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). The purified DNA was reamplified by using the same primer pair, subsequently cloned into the T/A cloning pGEMT vector (Promega), and submitted to sequencing (see below). To isolate the full-length SSAO cDNA, 3′- and 5′-RACE-PCR strategies were employed (16Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar, 17Frohman M.A. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar). The 3′-end of the SSAO cDNA was obtained using the 3′-RACE-PCR. Two μg of total cellular RNA were reverse transcribed in the presence of an oligo(dT)15adaptor primer (17Frohman M.A. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar). The first PCR assay was performed with a first adaptor primer and a primer A specific for SSAO. A second round of amplification was carried out using a second adaptor primer and the same specific primer A. The 5′-end of the cDNA was identified by 5′-RACE-PCR. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in the presence of a primer B specific for the 5′-end of the 840-bp fragment. A homopolymeric A tail was then appended to the 5′-end of the first strand cDNA using recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies). The second strand of the tailed cDNA was obtained using the oligo(dT)15 adaptor primer. The PCR amplification was then performed with the first adaptor (as in 3′-RACE above) and the specific primer B. A second round of amplification was carried out with the second adaptor primer and the primer B. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: 5′-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCT15-3′ for the oligo(dT)15 adaptor primer; 5′-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACG-3′ and 5′-GAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGC-3′ for the first and second adaptor primers, respectively (17Frohman M.A. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar); 5′-TCCCCAACACGGTGACTGTG-3′ for the specific primer A defined on the 3′-end of the 840-bp cDNA derived from the differential display; 5′-TCAAACTGGTCCTCCAGCTG-3′ for the specific primer B defined on the 5′-end of the 840-bp fragment. Products from 3′- and 5′-RACE-PCR were then analyzed on a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA bands of interest were identified by Southern blot. These bands were purified by Geneclean II kit and subloned in a pGEMT easy vector. Sequences of the cDNAs derived from differential display or from 5′-RACE- and 3′-RACE-PCR were determined by dideoxysequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Final sequencing was achieved by Genome Express (Montreuil, France). GenBankTMdata base searches were performed using the Blastn procedure provided by the Infobiogen Service Center (Villejuif, France). RNA was extracted from cultured cells as described by Cathala et al. (15Cathala C. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar) and from tissues by the acid phenol-chloroform procedure (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63046) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA from cultured cells and 20 μg of total RNA from tissues were electrophoresed through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Nylon-plus; Schleicher & Schuell). Methylene blue staining of blots was carried out to ensure the similarity in RNA loading. Hybridization to probes labeled by random priming (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16623) Google Scholar) was carried out as described by Church and Gilbert (20Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7260) Google Scholar). Final washing was performed in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 60 °C. The 840-bp SSAO DNA fragment, initially PCR-amplified by differential display, was used as a probe. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and adipocyte lipid-binding protein cDNAs were a generous gift of Dr. H. Green (21Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A, and 3T3-C2 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested and homogenized in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, pestle B). White adipocytes from 1-month-old lean (Fa/fa) or obese (fa/fa) male Zücker rats were isolated from inguinal fat pads by collagenase digestion (13Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. After homogenization in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the fat cake was removed by a brief centrifugation, and homogenates were kept at −80 °C until use. Protein content was assayed according to Lowry et al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SSAO activity was tested by H2O2 production on cell homogenates by the fluorimetric method of Matsumoto et al. (23Matsumoto T. Furuta T. Nimura Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 2207-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in a final volume of 100 μl consisting of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm homovanillic acid, 1 mm sodium azide, 5 μg/ml peroxidase (Sigma), and 10–50 μg of cell homogenate. Except otherwise mentioned, SSAO activity was measured under conditions of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and -B inhibition by pargyline (1 mm). When indicated, a SSAO inhibitor was preincubated with cell extract for 20 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the substrate. Incubation was initiated by the addition of the substrate and carried out in triplicate for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm semicarbazide. After cooling, 1.2 ml of 0.1 n NaOH was added, and the fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 323 nm and emission at 426 nm. As blank tests, assay mixtures without substrate were incubated. Preliminary experiments were performed to ensure that SSAO activity was tested at the initial rates of the reaction. Proportionality between enzyme activity and amounts of homogenate was also established. Apparent kinetic constants for SSAO substrates were determined within the following concentration ranges: 10–500 μm for benzylamine, 100 μm to 5 mm for methylamine, 1–30 mm for N 1-acetylputrescine, 300 μm to 10 mm for histamine, 100 μm to 10 mm for tyramine, and 30 μm to 3 mm for β-phenylethylamine. To determine IC50 and K i values for amine oxidase inhibitors, SSAO activity was determined in the presence of 50 μm benzylamine as a substrate. The concentration ranges of inhibitors used were as follows: 300 nm to 1 mm for semicarbazide and aminoguanidine, 0.1 nmto 1 μm for phenelzine, 0.3 nm to 3 μm for hydrazine, 1 nm to 100 μm for hydralazine, 3 nm to 300 μm for phenylhydrazine, 100 nm to 1 mm for iproniazide, 300 nm to 1 mmfor β-aminopropionitrile, 10 nm to 100 μm for benserazide, and 0.1 nm to 1 mm for pargyline and clorgyline. Kinetic parameters were determined using the nonlinear regression analysis curve-fitting procedure of the ENZFITTER program (Biosoft-Elsevier, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Polyamine oxidase was measured under conditions identical to those for SSAO, except that N 1-acetylspermidine was used as a substrate. Diamine oxidase was tested radiochemically by the conversion of [1,4-14C]putrescine dihydrochloride in14C-labeled Δ1-pyrroline (24Okuyama T. Kobayashi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 96: 242-250Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). mRNA differential display has a potential power for identifying genes that are differentially expressed in a variety ofin vivo and in vitro systems (6Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar). In this context, the simplified mRNA differential display procedure of Sokolov and Prockop (7Sokolov B.P. Prockop D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) seemed particularly convenient for the isolation of novel genes expressed during the course of adipose conversion of 3T3 preadipose cell lines. For this purpose, total RNA was prepared from undifferentiated or fully differentiated 3T3-F442A cells and from growing or resting 3T3-C2 cells that do not differentiate and keep a fibroblastic shape. cDNAs derived from these RNAs were then used in the differential display PCR assay in the presence of different sets of primers arbitrary in sequence and of various lengths. Among several PCR products detected on agarose gels, a fragment of 840 bp (Fig. 1 A), particularly abundant in adipocytes but absent in nonadipose cells, was therefore explored further. Indeed, using this 840-bp DNA fragment as a probe in Northern analysis, we confirmed that the related mRNA species, with an apparent size of 4.2 kilobases, was highly expressed in mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes but remained virtually undetectable in the 3T3-F442A preadipocytes and 3T3-C2 fibroblastic cell line, even in the resting state (Fig. 1 B). This profile indicated that expression of this mRNA species was differentiation-dependent but was not related to withdrawal from the cell cycle. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA fragment was determined and analysis from the Blastn GenBankTM sequence data bank revealed high identities between the sequence of the 840-bp DNA fragment and those of several members of the copper-containing amine oxidase family such as the human placental amine oxidase (8Zhang X. MacIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the bovine serum amine oxidase (25Mu D. Medzihradszky K.F. Adams G.W. Mayer P. Hines W.M. Burlingame A.M. Smith A.J. Cai D. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9926-9932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the human kidney diamine oxidase (26Barbry P. Champe M. Chassande O. Munemitsu S. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. Maes P. Frelin C. Tartar A. Ullrich A. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using 5′- and 3′-RACE-PCR strategies (see “Experimental Procedures”), we identified a full-length cDNA clone of 4210 bp. Both strands were entirely sequenced. Sequence analysis and overlapping, open reading frame identification and translation, and sequence alignments were performed using the BISANCE program of Infobiogen (Villejuif, France). The first in frame ATG codon is found at position 166 from the 5′-end of the cDNA. The ATG initiate a long open reading frame extending up to position 2460. The sequence of the resulting 765-amino acid protein was compared with those of several other related amine oxidases (Fig.2). This protein displays the typical features of the copper-containing amine oxidase family. Thus, the pre-TPQ-Tyr is located at position 471 in the protein sequence. This important tyrosine residue is found within the NYDY consensus sequence present in all amine oxidases shown in Fig. 2. The TPQ-amine oxidases have been shown to contain three histidine residues involved in copper binding. On the alignment presented, we identified these residues at positions 520, 522, and 684. The predicted amino acid sequence shows a high identity with the partially cloned rat (vp97) (95% identity) (9Morris N.J. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Ross S.A. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9388-9392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and with the human placental amine oxidase (83% identity) (8Zhang X. MacIntire W.S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the extensive enzyme characterization, which was further documented in 3T3 adipocytes (see below), indicated that we have cloned the murine SSAO. Murine SSAO shares with rat membrane-bound amine oxidase vp97 and human placental amine oxidase a short 5-amino acid intracellular segment (positions 1–5) and a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (positions 6–26) that probably ensures anchoring in the plasma membrane. The level of identity is lower between murine SSAO and bovine serum amine oxidase (79% identity) and human kidney diamine oxidase (35% identity), especially in the N-terminal portion. This difference is the consequence of the fact that bovine serum amine oxidase and diamine oxidase are secreted enzymes, while SSAO is membrane-associated. During the preparation of this manuscript, a new search of the GenBankTM sequence data base revealed the identity of murine SSAO with vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), whose mRNA and gene have been cloned from nonadipose tissues from mouse and human (27Bono P.

Science. 1992; 257: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). So far, tissue distribution of SSAO has been documented only on the basis of its enzyme activity. Thus, it was important to verify whether the distribution of the SSAO mRNA was identical to that of the enzyme activity referred as SSAO. The level of SSAO expression was examined in a variety of rat tissues by Northern analysis. Results are shown in Fig. 3. As assessed by methylene blue staining of ribosomal mRNAs, equivalent amounts of total RNA were present in each lane. SSAO mRNA was mainly found in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and aorta and found at lower levels in lung and skeletal muscle. A long exposure of the same blot also revealed limited amounts of SSAO mRNA in brain, heart, intestine, and kidney. The preferential expression of SSAO transcripts in adipose tissue and aorta, and at a lesser extent in lung and skeletal muscle is in good agreement with the previously described tissue distribution of SSAO activity in different species (10Enrique-Tarancon G.

Due to the very high SSAO mRNA levels in white adipocyte tissue, we investigated the temporal pattern of SSAO gene expression and enzyme activity in several types of preadipose cells. We first examined SSAO gene expression during adipose conversion of 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cell lines. Total RNA was harvested from cells at various intervals before and after cell confluence (day 0). As shown in Fig. 4, A andB, SSAO mRNA was virtually absent in preadipocytes, and its level dramatically increased during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-F442A or 3T3-L1 cells. In the two cell lines, SSAO transcripts were clearly induced between days 3 and 5 and rose almost to a plateau level 8 days after confluence. Various times of autoradiographic exposure led us to estimate an approximately 100–500-fold induction during the adipose conversion process. When compared with the emergence of adipocyte lipid-binding protein and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs, two well characterized markers of the adipose conversion process (21Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bernlohr D.A. Angus C.W. Lane M.D. Bolanowski M.A. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5468-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), SSAO mRNA induction occurred after adipocyte lipid-binding protein transcript emergence and was concomitant with that of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript. Thus, SSAO transcript expression appeared to represent a late event of adipogenesis. The high abundance of SSAO mRNA in adipose tissue described above prompted us to determine whether emergence of SSAO mRNA was also differentiation-specific in primary culture of rat adipocytes. Fig. 4 C shows that SSAO mRNA levels were also strongly induced during differentiation of these rat precursor cells. We then examined whether changes in mRNA levels of SSAO were reflected by changes in the corresponding enzyme activity. Cell homogenates were prepared from 3T3-L1 cells at various times before and"

In order to understand the misfolding process, it is necessary to examine the folding of α1-antitrypsin through the different structures involved in this process. In this study we have used a novel technique in which unique cysteine residues were introduced at various positions into α1-antitrypsin and fluorescently labeled withN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine. The fluorescence properties of each protein were studied in the native state and as a function of guanidine hydrochloride-mediated unfolding. The studies found that α1-antitrypsin unfolded through a series of intermediate structures. From the position of the fluorescence probes, the fluorescence quenching data, and the molecular modeling, we show that unfolding of α1-antitrypsin occurs via disruption of the A and C β-sheets followed by the B β-sheet. The implications of these data on both α1-antitrypsin function and polymerization are discussed.

Modification of this sequence viain vivo mutation or in vitro mutagenesis often alters the ability of the protein to fold correctly. Misfolding of proteins during their synthesis within the cell can lead to loss of protein function (1Thomas P.J. Qu B.H. Pedersen P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), an example being α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT)1deficiency (2Sifer R.N. Nat. Struct.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Many well characterized α1-AT variants are associated with an α1-AT plasma deficiency; in these cases, the variants aggregate at their site of synthesis within the liver cell (5Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 6Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Sidhar S. Foreman R. Chest. 1996; 110 Suppl. 6: 243S-247SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This aggregation is via an ordered polymerization process that is initiated by protein misfolding. In the case of the α1-AT Z mutation (Glu-342 → Lys), the rate of protein folding is much slower than in the native state, leading to the accumulation of an intermediate, which then polymerizes (4Yu M.H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the heat-induced polymerization of α1-AT also involves the formation of an unfolding intermediate (7James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The actual process of polymerization has been well studied, and two mechanisms have been proposed: the loop-A-sheet and loop-C-sheet mechanisms (8Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both processes involve the insertion of the reactive center loop residues of the donating α1-AT molecule into either the A β-sheet (loop-A-sheet) or the C β-sheet (loop-C-sheet) of the acceptor molecule (11Chang W.S.W. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C.R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). There is evidence for the occurrence of both of these mechanisms; indeed,in vitro α1-AT has been shown to undergo both depending upon the buffer used (12Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Koloczek H. Guz A. Kaszycki P. J.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2226-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). α1-AT is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily and is composed of 394 amino acid residues arranged into three β-sheets (A, B, and C) and nine α-helices (A–I). X-ray crystallographic and biochemical data have shown that α1-AT can adopt a number of different structures (15Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Hopkins P.C. Stone S.R.

Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that areas such as the reactive center loop and the A β-sheet of α1-AT are extremely mobile, which is an essential requirement for inhibitory activity. Mutations that affect the mobility of α1-AT cause it to become either a proteinase substrate or to undergo polymerization (16Hopkins P.C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15872-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,18Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol.

Although many studies have examined the structural changes of a serpin in relation to inhibitory mechanism, the conformational changes, which occur during folding and misfolding, have not yet been characterized. The unfolding pathway of α1-AT has been investigated using size exclusion chromatography, intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and urea gradient gel electrophoresis (21Herve M. Ghelis C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Kim J. Lee K.N. Yi G.S. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8597-8601Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These studies revealed the presence of multiple intermediates, the conformations of which have never been examined. A number of methods have been employed for other proteins to study the conformational changes during folding. The formation of disulfide bonds has been widely used to trap folding intermediates (24Creighton T.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1978; 33: 231-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), but α1-AT contains only a single cysteine residue. NMR methodology has been used to examine the rate of exchange between backbone amide protons of the folding protein and the solvent (25Udgaonkar J.B. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar); however, due to the large size of α1-AT, this method is not applicable. Another commonly adopted technique involves the insertion of unique tryptophan residues (26Smith C.J. Clarke A.R. Chia W.N. Irons L.I. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Bottomley S.P. Popplewell A.G. Scawen M. Wan T. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The changes in tryptophan residue fluorescence upon folding are then followed spectrophotometrically, yielding information about the events occurring at specific locations within the protein structure. α1-AT possesses two tryptophan residues, one of which (Trp-194) is highly conserved and essential for activity (3Kim D. Yu M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the insertion of additional tryptophan residues would lead to a mixed population. In order to study the folding of α1-AT, we propose a novel approach in which we have fluorescently labeled unique cysteine residues that have been inserted at positions throughout the tertiary structure of the molecule. The fluorescence properties of these unique groups were then examined as a function of denaturant concentration. The results demonstrate that the equilibrium unfolding pathway of α1-AT consists of at least one stable intermediate structure, which we have begun to characterize. 1,1′-Bis-4-anilino-5-napthalinsulfonic acid (dipotassium salt) and N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD) were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ultrapure grade guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn HCl) was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. The recombinant α1-AT proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as described previously (28Hopkins P.C. Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3905-3909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified from cell inclusion bodies using Gdn HCl denaturation and a continual dilution procedure as recently described (29Bottomley S.P. Stone S.R. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study recombinant α1-AT(P1=Arg) was used as the control and the construction of α1-AT(S313C) and α1-AT(P3′Cys) have been described (12Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay against a standard of purified recombinant α1-AT, the concentration of which had been determined by amino acid analysis. The association rate constant (k ass) and stoichiometry of inhibition were measured using thrombin for both the unlabeled and labeled α1-AT forms, as described previously (30Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12241-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of the proteins with IANBD was performed as described previously (12Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The extent of labeling was determined using the extinction coefficient of IANBD (ε = 25,000m−1 cm−1). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer, using a thermostatted cuvette holder at 25 °C in a 1-cm path length quartz cell. Excitation and emission slits were set at 2.5 nm for all spectra, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min was used. The absorbance at the excitation wavelengths was monitored in all experiments and remained below 0.05. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jasco 720s spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Far UV spectra from 190 to 250 nm were collected with 5 s/point signal averaging; θ222measurements were made with the signal averaged over 60 s. The concentration of α1-AT used was 0.1 mg/ml with a 0.1-cm path length cell. Unfolding curves were determined by either measuring the fluorescence emission spectra of a 200 nm protein solution as a function of denaturant concentration or the change in signal at 222 nm in the far UV as a function of denaturant concentration. Attempts at measuring the near UV CD unfolding curve proved impractical due to protein precipitation at the concentrations required. Previous studies (31Kang H.A. Lee K.N. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 510-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and our own preliminary data have shown that unfolding in Gdn HCl reaches equilibrium within a matter of minutes at all concentrations of Gdn HCl used. Therefore, the samples were allowed to equilibrate at 25 °C for 2 h before measurement. For both the labeled and unlabeled proteins, the reversibility of the unfolding process was established by adding buffer to samples of unfolded protein, allowing each to re-equilibrate at a lower Gdn HCl concentration. The fluorescence emission spectra acquired for these samples, when corrected for dilution, were identical with corresponding samples that had reached equilibrium from the folded state, thus confirming the reversibility of the systems. The inhibitory activity of these refolded proteins was also analyzed, and they were found to be fully active. The Gdn HCl denaturation curves were fitted to either a two-state or three-state unfolding model, using a nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm. Raw equilibrium data were fitted directly to a two-state model of denaturation in which the baselines are fitted simultaneously with the unfolding transition (32Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). A three-state model was also employed for analysis of the denaturation curves based upon the mechanism F ↔ I ↔ U, where F and U are the fully folded and unfolded forms of the protein, respectively, and I is an intermediate that is populated at equilibrium (33Nath U. Udgaonkar J.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 0 and 1 m Gdn HCl. Aliquots of KI (2 m stock) containing 1 mm Na2S2O3were added to protein solutions (200 nm), and the change in fluorescence emission intensity of the tryptophan residues (λex = 290 nm) and covalently bound IANBD (λex = 480 nm) were measured. Measurements in the presence of 1 m Gdn HCl were made on individual samples, so there was no dilution of the Gdn HCl. The data were analyzed as described previously by Lehrer (34Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). All data were corrected for inner filter effects where necessary. The aim of this study was to monitor the structural changes of α1-AT as it unfolds. To achieve this, we generated α1-AT variants, which were fluorescently labeled at specific sites on the protein. The structural changes occurring in the unfolding process were then characterized using the site-specific fluorescence changes. α1-AT possesses a unique cysteine residue (Cys-232), which is situated on strand s2B (Fig. 1). Two further cysteine residues were introduced into α1-AT at positions P3′ 2The nomenclature for residues within the reactive center loop is based on that described by Schechter and Berger (46Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) for the substrates of proteases. and Ser-313 (Fig. 1). The substitutions were made using an α1-AT variant, in which Cys-232 had been replaced by a serine residue. This variant has previously been shown to have the same activity as the native protein (12Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Hopkins P.C. Chang W.S. Wardell M.R. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3905-3909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The native and mutant constructs were efficiently expressed as inclusion bodies and purified as described previously (16Hopkins P.C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15872-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The two mutations (P3′Cys and S313C) had no effect upon the inhibitory properties of the proteins (Table I). These cysteine residues were then selectively labeled with the fluorescent probe IANBD. The extent of modification was measured using the extinction coefficient of the probe and was found to be 1:1 in all cases; this also confirmed the insertion of one unique cysteine residue per monomer. The presence of the fluorescent label had no effect upon the inhibitory properties of the protein (Table I). The addition of the IANBD label affords the protein new fluorescence properties. The fluorescence emission spectra of the three labeled proteins show distinct differences depending upon the location of the probe within the α1-AT structure (Fig.2). The fluorescently labeled wild type protein (α1-ATCys-232-IANBD)) had an emission maximum at 531 nm, whereas the two other proteins exhibited emission maxima at 527 nm (α1-AT(S313C-IANBD)) and 532 nm (α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD)) (Fig. 2). These spectra indicate that the environment of the fluorescence probes at Cys-232 and P3′Cys are more solvent-exposed than the probe at Cys-313. Although the labeled proteins were fully active (Table I), there was the possibility that the presence of the IANBD altered the structure of the native state. To examine this, we carefully measured the tryptophan emission spectra and far UV CD spectra for all labeled and unlabeled proteins. Both the tryptophan emission spectra and far UV CD spectra for the three labeled proteins were identical to the unlabeled fluorescence and CD spectra (data not shown). These data, in conjunction with the full inhibitory activity of the proteins, demonstrate that the mutations and the covalent modification had no significant effect upon the native structure of the proteins. The fluorescence characteristic of these novel α1-AT variants allows the solvent induced denaturation of α1-AT to be followed spectrofluorometrically. The fluorescence properties of both the tryptophan residues and the covalently attached probe were monitored following treatment with various concentrations of Gdn HCl. Incubation of the proteins in 6 m Gdn HCl resulted in the emission maximum of the tryptophan residues (for all three proteins) becoming red shifted from 337 to 352 nm, concomitant with an increase in fluorescence emission intensity (Fig.3 A). This demonstrates that the tryptophan residue fluorescence is heavily quenched in the native structure. The emission spectra of the probes under the same conditions showed a red shift to 538 nm and a decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 4 shows the normalized changes in λmax as a function of denaturant concentration for both the tryptophan residues and the probes. There was little change in the λmax from the tryptophan residues below 1 mGdn HCl for all the variants. Between 1 and 3.5 m Gdn HCl, λmax increased (Fig. 4 A), indicating an increase in solvent exposure of the tryptophan residues as the protein unfolds. The spectral changes associated with denaturation of the modified proteins were unique to the probe position (Fig.4 B). α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD) showed no change in emission maximum (λmax = 531 nm) until the concentration of Gdn HCl reached 2 m. This is a 2-fold increase in Gdn HCl concentration compared with the concentration required to initiate changes in the tryptophan residue fluorescence. The fluorescence changes of α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD) and α1-AT(S313C-IANBD) occurred at much lower Gdn HCl concentrations (< 0.5 m). The labeled variants and unlabeled α1-AT exhibited the same tryptophan fluorescence change as a function of Gdn HCl concentration, with a midpoint of 2.5 m Gdn HCl (Fig.4 A, Table II). Analysis of these data using a two-state folding model allows calculation of ΔGF→U, (the free energy of unfolding in water) andm (a constant that is proportional to the increase in degree of exposure of the protein on denaturation) (Table II). It can be seen that ΔGF→U is the same for both the unlabeled and labeled proteins, with an average value of 2.22 ± 0.03 kcal/mol. In addition, there is no significant difference in m with an average value of 0.885 ± 0.02 kcal/mol/m. The coincidence of these labeled and unlabeled data suggests that the fluorescent probes do not perturb the equilibrium-unfolding pathway.Table IIParameters for the two- and three-state fits to the denaturation transition curvesProteinTwo-state analysisThree-state analysisΔGF→Um F→UD 50%F→UΔGF→Im F→ID 50%F→IΔGI→Um I→UD 50%I→Ukcal/molkcal/mol/mm−1kcal/molkcal/mol/mm−1kcal/molkcal/mol/mm−1Fluorescence probeα1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD)1.393.440.433.121.262.45α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD)3.341.192.84α1-AT(Cys-313-IANBD)1.270.761.72Tryptophan fluorescence and far-UVα1AT(P1 = Arg)2.220.882.504.125.540.746.322.342.70α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD)2.270.912.494.415.760.766.602.642.5α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD)2.200.862.564.635.840.796.402.402.66α1-AT(Cys-313-IANBD)2.180.892.454.145.160.806.202.502.48Results from Figs. 4 and 5 were fit to either a two-state or three-state unfolding analysis as described in the materials and methods.

The K SVdetermined for α1-AT(P1=Arg) was for the exposure of the tryptophan residues and for the exposure of the fluorescence probe in all the other cases. The probe fluorescence changes are nonsuperimposable (Fig.4 B), implying that the probes are reporting site specific conformational changes. The data in Fig. 4 B were analyzed by either a two-state or three-state mechanism as described previously (25Udgaonkar J.B. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 35Bolen D.W. Santoro M.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8069-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It was found that the data for α1-AT(S313C-IANBD) and α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD) could be adequately described by the two-state analysis, whereas α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD) could only be described using a three-state analysis. The data in Table II and Fig.4 B show that α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD)has the highest denaturation midpoint (2.8 m Gdn HCl), compared with the tryptophan observed transition (2.5 m Gdn HCl). This indicates that the regions around the tryptophan residues and Cys-232 are significantly more resistant to denaturation than the regions around P3′Cys and Cys-313. The denaturation midpoint for α1-AT(Cys-313-IANBD) is 1.7 m, over 1 m lower than the value obtained for α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD). The midpoint for the first transition of α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD) is 0.4 m Gdn HCl, whereas the midpoint of the second transition is 2.5 m Gdn HCl. This is similar to the values obtained from the tryptophan residue and α1-AT(Cys-232-IANBD) analysis, suggesting that they may be monitoring the same transition. These data also imply that the regions around both P3′Cys and Cys-313 are relatively unstable. In contrast, the region around Cys-232 and the tryptophan residues unfold at higher Gdn HCl concentrations, demonstrating an increased stability compared with the other regions. The sequential spectral changes demonstrate that α1-AT unfolding is not a simple two-state process, in which only the fully folded and unfolded states exist. In this case, there appears to be at least one intermediate state, and the protein only becomes fully unfolded at concentrations above 5 m Gdn HCl. It is possible that the differences in probe monitored unfolding profiles are due to local destabilizing effects of the probe. To assess this, the unfolding curves for the labeled protein were measured using far UV CD (Fig. 5). Far UV CD measures secondary structure; therefore, deviation in the unfolding profile from native will indicate that the probes are affecting the unfolding process. However, it can be seen in Fig. 5 that the unfolding profiles for all the labeled proteins are essentially the same as the unlabeled native structure. The far UV CD data show two transitions, with average midpoints of 0.77 and 2.6 m Gdn HCl (Table II). This is similar to the fluorescence changes observed for α1-AT(P3′Cys-IANBD); however, the midpoints of the transitions were approximately 0.2 m higher when measured by far UV CD. We cannot discount the possibility that minor local perturbations of the α1-AT structure due to labeling may have occurred. However, the coincidence of 1) tryptophan unfolding data (Fig. 4 A), 2) far UV CD unfolding data (Fig.5), 3) tryptophan emission spectra (data not shown), and 4) far UV CD spectra (data not shown) of the labeled proteins compared with native α1-AT strongly suggests that the probes do not interfere with the equilibrium unfolding process. The nonsuperimposable transitions observed with different spectroscopic probes and the biphasic nature of the CD unfolding denaturation curve are consistent with the existence of a stable intermediate at 1m Gdn HCl. The intermediate in 1 m Gdn HCl possesses approximately 20% of the native CD spectral amplitude at 222 nm (Fig. 5), and the fluorescence data suggest that the environment around P3′Cys, S313C, and the two tryptophan residues has been altered (Fig. 4). The structure of this equilibrium intermediate state was further chara"

We used baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, which have very low soluble guanylate cyclase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase) activity, and CS-54 arterial smooth muscle cells, which express these two enzymes, to study NO regulation of the human fos promoter. The NO-releasing agent Deta-NONOate (ethanamine-2,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazone)bis-) had no effect on a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene under control of the fos promoter in BHK cells transfected with an empty vector or in cells transfected with a G-kinase Iβ expression vector. In BHK cells transfected with expression vectors for guanylate cyclase, Deta-NONOate markedly increased the intracellular cGMP concentration and caused a small (2-fold) increase in CAT activity; the increased CAT activity appeared to be from cGMP activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In BHK cells co-transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors, CAT activity was increased 5-fold in the absence of Deta-NONOate and 7-fold in the presence of Deta-NONOate. Stimulation of CAT activity in the absence of Deta-NONOate appeared to be largely from endogenous NO since we found that: (i) BHK cells produced high amounts of NO; (ii) CAT activity was partially inhibited by a NO synthase inhibitor; and (iii) the inhibition by the NO synthase inhibitor was reversed by exogenous NO. In CS-54 cells, we found that NO increased fos promoter activity and that the increase was prevented by a guanylate cyclase inhibitor.

One of its major intracellular targets is the heme group of soluble guanylate cyclase with NO markedly stimulating enzymatic activity and thereby increasing the intracellular cGMP concentration (2Ignarro L.J.

Other NO targets are thiol-containing proteins, iron sulfur proteins and non-heme iron; in addition, NO can react with oxygen to produce peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical, both of which can have physiological effects (4Stamler J.S.

In regulation of VCAM-1, NO appears to act independently of cGMP because it's effect is not mimicked by cGMP analogs, while in regulation of c-fos and junB, NO and cGMP analogs induce similar changes (5Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Haby C. Lisovoski F. Aunis D. Zwiller J. J.

In cases where NO and cGMP analogs function similarly, it is likely that NO works through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, but this has not been shown definitively. Moreover, it is not clear which of several cGMP target proteins,e.g. cGMP-dependent protein kinases (G-kinase), cGMP-gated ion channels, cGMP-activated phosphodiesterases, or cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases, mediates the effects of NO on gene expression (11Schmidt H.H.H.W. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In this study we used baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, which have very low soluble guanylate cyclase and G-kinase activity, to determine whether NO regulates the fos promoter via a cGMP/G-kinase signal transduction pathway. We found that maximal stimulation of thefos promoter by NO in BHK cells required expression of both guanylate cyclase and G-kinase. In cells transfected with guanylate cyclase alone, NO caused a small activation of the fospromoter, apparently by cGMP activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), either directly by cross-activation or indirectly by inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity (12Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells containing endogenous guanylate cyclase and G-kinase, NO stimulation of the fos promoter was inhibited by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ. This, to our knowledge, is the first demonstration that NO regulates gene expression via cGMP activation of G-kinase. BHK cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (13Gudi T.

All cells received 50 ng of pFos-CAT, which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under control of the human fospromoter, and 50 ng of the luciferase expression vector pRSV luciferase to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency (5Pilz R.B.

Where indicated, N G-monoethyl-l-arginine monoacetate (NMEA, Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) was added 16 h prior to cell harvest and 8-Br-cGMP (Biolog Life Sciences, Bremen, Federal Republic of Germany), Deta-NONOate (ethanamine-2,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazone)bis-, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), and Deta, the parent compound of Deta-NONOate that does not release NO, were added 8 h prior to cell harvest. CS-54 cells are rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells that maintain differentiated properties through multiple subcultures (16Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith W.J.

Rothman, University of California, San Diego, and were transfected with pFOS-CAT and pRSV luciferase but not with guanylate cyclase or G-kinase expression vectors. Where indicated, ODQ (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and/or Deta-NONOate were added 16 h prior to cell harvest. Guanylate cyclase activity was measured as described previously in the absence and presence of the NO donorS-nitrosylpenicillamine (SNAP) using [α-32P]GTP as substrate and separating substrate and product by thin layer chromatography (17Idriss S.D.

The activities of G-kinase, protein kinase A holoenzyme, and the free catalytic subunit of protein kinase A were measured as described previously following [γ-32P]ATP phosphorylation of Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) (13Gudi T.

The activity of the free catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was measured as PKI-inhibitable phosphorylation in the absence of cAMP. All enzyme assays were linear with time and protein concentration. CAT activity and luciferase activity were measured as described previously using [14C]chloramphenicol/butyryl-coenzyme A and luciferin/ATP, respectively (5Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S.

The intracellular cGMP concentration was measured as described previously by radioimmunoassay (5Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). After culturing cells for 24 h in low serum medium, nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the medium were measured according to the Griess reaction (20Schmidt H.H.H.W. Warner T.D. Nakane M. Foersternmann U. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of data groups was done by the two-tailed Student t test, with a p value of <0.05 considered significant. We found very low soluble guanylate cyclase activity in extracts of BHK cells transfected with empty vector with about a 6-fold increase in enzyme activity on treating the extracts with 50 μm SNAP (Table I; difference between minus and plus SNAP was significant atp < 0.05). When the cells were transfected with guanylate cyclase expression vectors, we found a large increase in enzyme activity, which again was stimulated >6-fold by SNAP (Table I); these latter experiments demonstrate that the transfected enzyme contained a functional heme moiety. G-kinase activity was also very low in extracts of BHK cells transfected with empty vector and enzyme activity increased substantially when the cells were transfected with a G-kinase expression vector (Table I). The guanylate cyclase and G-kinase activities found in the transfected cells are comparable with amounts of these enzymes expressed endogenously in several cell types,e.g. smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, and platelets (3Arnold W.P.

The data are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. GC, soluble guanylate cyclase; GK, G-kinase; ND, not determined. In cells transfected with both guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors, intracellular cGMP increased ∼60-fold and Deta-NONOate increased cGMP >600-fold (Table II). The higher cGMP in cells co-transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase compared with cells transfected with guanylate cyclase alone is probably because the cGMP assay measures total intracellular cGMP, including that which is protein-bound: the intracellular G-kinase concentration in cells transfected with this enzyme is 3–6 pmol/mg of protein corresponding to a cGMP binding capacity of 12–24 pmol/mg of protein (13Gudi T.

In addition, as shown below, BHK cells produce relatively high amounts of NO. Thus, high cGMP in the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-transfected cells in the absence of Deta-NONOate probably represents the combination of high endogenous NO stimulating the transfected guanylate cyclase with the cGMP produced binding to the transfected G-kinase. These results suggest that in cells co-transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase, G-kinase is likely to be activated, even in the absence of exogenous NO. We showed previously that NO-releasing agents activate synthetic TRE-containing promoters in REF52 fibroblasts and rat thyroid cells, and we and others (5Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L.

Biol. 1994; 11: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that NO increases c-fos mRNA in many cell types. We have also shown that cGMP regulates the fos promoter in BHK cells via G-kinase activation and nuclear translocation (13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To test whether NO's effect on the fos promoter in BHK cells was mediated by cGMP activation of G-kinase, we transfected cells with pFos-CAT in the absence or presence of guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors. We found that the NO-generating agent Deta-NONOate had no effect on CAT expression in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1). When the cells were transfected singly with guanylate cyclase or G-kinase expression vectors, CAT activity increased a minimal 1.3-fold in the absence of drug treatment which was not statistically significant (Fig. 1). Deta-NONOate increased CAT activity a small, but statistically significant, 2.1-fold in the guanylate cyclase-transfected cells but had no effect in the G-kinase-transfected cells (Fig. 1). The small increase in CAT activity by Deta-NONOate in guanylate cyclase-expressing cells points to a cGMP-mediated mechanism, and as described above, we found that under these conditions Deta-NONOate increased the intracellular cGMP concentration by ∼250-fold (TableII). This large increase in cGMP could activate the cells low endogenous G-kinase or, as shown later, cross-activate protein kinase A. Deta-NONOate increased CAT activity more than 8-Br-cGMP in the guanylate cyclase-transfected cells (Fig. 1); as discussed later, this difference could be because endogenously produced cGMP is more available than exogenously provided 8-Br-cGMP. As we showed previously (13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), 8-Br-cGMP stimulated CAT expression about 4-fold in cells transfected with the G-kinase expression vector and was without effect in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1), indicating that at the concentration used, 8-Br-cGMP did not cross-activate protein kinase A (Fig. 1). When the cells were co-transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors, CAT expression increased 5.5-fold in the absence of drug treatment (Fig. 1). This substantial increase in CAT activity can be attributed to the large increase in intracellular cGMP under these conditions (Table II) activating the transfected G-kinase (discussed above). Deta-NONOate further increased CAT activity to about 7-fold in cells co-transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors (Fig. 1) and, as shown, further increased intracellular cGMP (Table II). The increase in CAT activity by Deta-NONOate in the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-transfected cells was similar to that observed when these cells were treated with 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 1; the further increase in CAT activity by Deta-NONOate and 8-Br-cGMP was not statistically significant compared with the untreated cells). Deta, the parent compound of Deta-NONOate, which does not release NO, had no effect on CAT expression in guanylate cyclase- and/or G-kinase-expressing cells. To examine whether high endogenous NO production in the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-expressing cells could be the cause of increased CAT expression in the absence of Deta-NONOate or 8-Br-cGMP, we treated cells with the competitive NO synthase inhibitor NMEA. We found that NMEA reduced CAT expression by >40% in cells transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors (Fig. 1). To eliminate possible effects of altered culture conditions, all cells were grown in medium containing 400 μm arginine; this relatively high arginine concentration may have prevented more complete inhibition of CAT expression by NMEA and other workers have also found that NO synthase inhibitors are only partially effective at high micromolar arginine concentrations (28El-Dada M.D. Quik M. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 1463-1470PubMed Google Scholar). Corresponding to the 40% reduction in CAT expression, NMEA reduced intracellular cGMP by ∼50% in the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-transfected cells (Table II). When Deta-NONOate was added to the NMEA-treated cells, CAT expression returned to the levels observed in the absence of NMEA, providing evidence that NMEA was acting by inhibiting endogenous NO synthase (Fig. 1). Consistent with recovery of CAT activity, Deta-NONOate almost fully returned the intracellular cGMP concentration to the level observed in the absence of NMEA (Table II). NO produced under physiological conditions is converted stoichiometrically to nitrite and nitrate (29Archer S. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). We found the sum of nitrite and nitrate in the medium of serum-starved BHK cells to be >1 μm after 24 h of culture corresponding to an NO production rate of 40 pmol/h/106cells. This NO production rate is similar to what vascular endothelial cells and glioma cells, which have high NO synthase activity, produce under nonstimulated conditions (30Whorton A.R. Simonds D.B. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1161-L1166PubMed Google Scholar, 31Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Reis D.J. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At high intracellular concentrations, cGMP can cross-activate protein kinase A and protein kinase A activation can lead to transactivation of the fospromoter (12Forte L.R. Thorne P.K. Eber S.L. Krause W.J. Freeman R.H. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C607-C615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The small increase in CAT expression on treating guanylate cyclase-transfected cells with Deta-NONOate (Fig. 1) could, therefore, be secondary to protein kinase A activation by high intracellular cGMP concentrations (Table II). To address this question, we measured the activity of the free catalytic subunit of protein kinase A in Deta-NONOate-treated, guanylate cyclase-transfected cells and found a 2.7-fold increase in enzyme activity (TableIII). This increase in free catalytic subunit activity by Deta-NONOate was about half that observed in cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP (Table III; in control experiments we showed that free catalytic subunit release by 8-Br-cAMP was not secondary to drug carryover from the culture medium because adding 8-Br-cAMP immediately prior to cell washing had no effect on free catalytic subunit activity). In cells transfected with empty vector, Deta-NONOate had no effect, while 8-Br-cAMP yielded the same increase in enzyme activity as in cells transfected with guanylate cyclase expression vectors (Table III). Thus, in cells containing soluble guanylate cyclase, NO can increase the cGMP content sufficiently to cross-activate protein kinase A.Table IIIActivity of A-kinase free catalytic subunit or holoenzyme in guanylate cyclase-transfected BHK cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP or Deta-NONOateProtein kinase A speciesGuanylate cyclase vectorsEmpty vectorNo drug8-Br-cAMPDeta-NONo drug8-Br-cAMPDeta-NOnmol/min/mg proteinnmol/min/mg proteinCatalytic subunit0.15 ± 0.020.81 ± 0.070.40 ± 0.030.16 ± 0.030.71 ± 0.050.17 ± 0.03Holoenzyme1.7 ± 0.30.95 ± 0.081.5 ± 0.161.8 ± 0.30.95 ± 0.091.7 ± 0.25BHK cells were transfected as described in the legend to Table I with pCB6 (empty vector) or with expression vectors for soluble guanylate cyclase.

The activities of the protein kinase A free catalytic subunit and holoenzyme were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Open table in a new tab BHK cells were transfected as described in the legend to Table I with pCB6 (empty vector) or with expression vectors for soluble guanylate cyclase. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were either left untreated (no drug) or were treated for 1 h with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP or 250 μm Deta-NONOate (Deta-NO). The activities of the protein kinase A free catalytic subunit and holoenzyme were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Having shown that NO activation of the fospromoter in BHK cells required expression of both soluble guanylate cyclase and G-kinase, we assessed NO's effect on the fospromoter in cells expressing both of these enzymes endogenously. We chose CS-54 cells, derived from the smooth muscle of rat pulmonary arteries (16Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith W.J. Nadal-Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because primary vascular smooth muscle cells contain both soluble guanylate cyclase and G-kinase (11Schmidt H.H.H.W. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We found that CS-54 cells contained 21 ± 3.4 and 335 ± 39 pmol/min/mg of protein of guanylate cyclase and G-kinase activity, respectively (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate; guanylate cyclase activity was simulated 7-fold byS-nitrosylpenicillamine). The activities of both of these enzymes are considerably more than found in untransfected BHK cells, and although less than in BHK cells transfected with guanylate cyclase or G-kinase expression vectors (Table I), they are within the range reported in primary smooth muscle cells and other mammalian cells (3Arnold W.P. Mittal C.K. Katsuki S. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar,21Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In CS-54 cells transfected with pFos-CAT, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ reduced CAT activity by >60% compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2). This suggests that CAT expression in untreated cells was determined in large part by endogenously produced cGMP stimulating cellular G-kinase; ODQ was clearly acting via guanylate cyclase inhibition because the membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP reversed ODQ's inhibitory effect (data not shown). When the cells were treated with Deta-NONOate, CAT expression increased more than 2-fold compared with untreated cells and more than 5-fold compared with cells treated with ODQ (Fig. 2). Deta-NONOate added to ODQ-treated cells was without effect indicating that Deta-NONOate was acting via a cGMP-dependent mechanism (Fig. 2). We have shown that NO activation of the fos promoter is dependent on both guanylate cyclase and G-kinase activity and have, therefore, defined a specific signal transduction pathway which mediates NO's effect on c-fos expression. We showed previously that G-kinase Iβ, the G-kinase isoform used in the present studies, activates the fos promoter via translocation to the nucleus and that this effect of G-kinase is mediated by several sequence elements, including the serum response element, the AP-1 binding site, and the cAMP response element (13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the absence of drugs, fos promoter activity was not significantly affected when BHK cells were transfected singly with either guanylate cyclase or G-kinase expression vectors. However, we found a substantial increase in fos promoter activity when the cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for both enzymes, even in the absence of drug treatment. These data suggest that the transfected guanylate cyclase generated sufficient cGMP to activate the transfected G-kinase, and indeed, we found a 60-fold increase in the intracellular cGMP concentration compared with untransfected cells. For guanylate cyclase to produce such high amounts of cGMP, it seemed likely that the enzyme was stimulated by NO and we found high constitutive NO production by BHK cells. Moreover, NMEA, a NO synthase inhibitor, decreased CAT expression in the guanylate cyclase and G-kinase transfected cells significantly and adding Deta-NONOate to the NMEA-treated cells caused full recovery of CAT expression to maximal levels. Although CAT activity was high in the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-transfected cells in the absence of drugs, both Deta-NONOate and 8-Br-cGMP further increased CAT activity, suggesting that the amount of endogenously produced cGMP was not quite sufficient to maximally stimulate G-kinase. Together, these data provide evidence that NO activates the fos promoter through a guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-dependent mechanism. In BHK cells transfected with guanylate cyclase, Deta-NONOate increased the activity of the free catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, although less effectively than 8-Br-cAMP. In vascular smooth muscle cells, Cornwell et al. (32Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; : C1405-C1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also found that NO donors activate protein kinase A, although they did not compare the effect of the drugs to that of cAMP analogs. Protein kinase A activation by 8-Br-cAMP stimulates fos promoter activity about 6-fold in BHK cells (13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, protein kinase A activation by Deta-NONOate in the guanylate cyclase-transfected cells likely caused the small increase in fos promoter activity under these conditions; the high amounts of cGMP produced by the cells could also have activated the low endogenous G-kinase present in BHK cells. The increase in CAT activity in cells transfected with guanylate cyclase and G-kinase expression vectors was significantly more than the increase in CAT activity in cells transfected with the G-kinase expression vector only and treated with 8-Br-cGMP. This may be because 8-Br-cGMP, although more membrane-permeable than cGMP, still does not diffuse readily across cell membranes and intracellular concentrations achieved by the drug are relatively low. 2G. R. Boss and R. B. Pilz, unpublished observations., 3M. Bartsch, J. Kruppa, C. Schultz, and B. Jastorff, 11th Protein Kinase Seminar: Cyclic Nucleotide-dependent Signaling Mechanisms, June 4–7, 1998, Bergen, Norway.In addition, it may be that cGMP produced endogenously from guanylate cyclase is a more effective G-kinase activator than exogenous 8-Br-cGMP because of the intracellular localization of the cyclase and kinase. We found similar results in our previous work with REF52 and rat thyroid cells where NO-releasing agents were more potent activators of TRE-containing reporter genes than was 8-Br-cGMP (5Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the guanylate cyclase- and G-kinase-transfected cells there is also likely some degree of protein kinase A activation that we showed previously does not occur in G-kinase-transfected cells treated with 8-Br-cGMP (13Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NO plays an important role in regulating pulmonary vascular resistance and growth of pulmonary arterial cells via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and G-kinase (33Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In CS-54 cells, CAT expression from the fos promoter was markedly reduced when the cells were treated with the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, suggesting that endogenously produced cGMP is sufficient to stimulate promoter activity in these cells and that CAT activity observed in the presence of ODQ may be the more correct “basal” level than that observed in untreated cells. Although we did not define the type of G-kinase expressed in CS-54 cells, vascular smooth muscle cells express predominantly G-kinase Iα, suggesting that the observed results are applicable to cells expressing either G-kinase Iα or Iβ (34Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tamura N. Itoh H. Ogawa Y. Nakagawa O. Harada M. Chun T.-H. Suga S.-i. Yoshimasa T.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The findings in these studies are likely of physiological significance for the following reasons. First, the amounts of guanylate cyclase and G-kinase in the transfected BHK cells are comparable with the amounts of these enzymes expressed endogenously in several cell types (3Arnold W.P. Mittal C.K. Katsuki S. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 21Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, fos promoter activity was markedly stimulated by endogenously produced NO in BHK cells expressing both guanylate cyclase and G-kinase, and third, NO increased fos promoter activity in CS-54 cells. Thus, we conclude that one mechanism whereby NO regulates gene expression in vivo is via a guanylate cyclase/cGMP/G-kinase transduction pathway. We thank S. Lohmann for the G-kinase cDNA, F. Murad and M. Nakane for the guanylate cyclase cDNAs, and S. Taylor for providing purified recombinant PKI."

This conclusion was strengthened by the observation that H2O2, heat shock, or ionizing irradiation did not induce the soxRS regulon (1Walkup L.K.B. Kogoma T. J.

Moreover FumC was induced by paraquat more strongly in a sodA sodB strain than in its SOD-replete parent (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and its induction in the parental strain was eliminated by mutational deletion of thesoxRS response (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), thus indicating that O·̄2 could cause induction of soxRS. However it was also noted (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that marked overproduction of SodA did not diminish induction of members of this regulon such as fumarase C and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an indication that O·̄2-independent induction was also a reality. In accord with this view was the finding that NADPH could diminish in vitro transcription/translation of thesodA gene (7Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

For example either by oxidation of reduced SoxR or by reduction of oxidized soxR. O·̄2 could accelerate the former process and, by inhibition of the oxidized SoxR reducing systems, the latter. Yet there seems to be disagreement about whether O·̄2 is one of the factors that influences the redox status of SoxR. Thus, Nunoshiba et al. (4Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Amábile-Cuevas C.F. Demple B.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6054-6060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) used an operon fusion, of the soxS promoter to the lacZ gene, to show that redox cycling agents induced this system in an O·̄2-dependent manner and that dioxygen itself was a stronger inducer in a SOD-deficient (sodA sodB) strain than in a SOD-replete strain. Thus supporting the view that O·̄2 could, directly or indirectly, induce soxRS. Wu and Weiss (10Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also presented evidence supporting this view. Gort and Imlay (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a soxS::lacZ fusion strain, reported that lack of SOD did not cause induction ofsoxS under aerobic conditions. Thus we have several groups reporting that elevating O·̄2 by elimination or diminution of SOD was sufficient to cause this induction, and another group (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reporting that this was not the case. Fumarase C is a member of the soxRS regulon (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and we have previously noted that it was induced under aerobic conditions by mutational deletion of SodA + SodB (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore the induction of FumC by paraquat was greater in the sodA sodB than in the SOD-replete parental strain. These results support the view that O·̄2 can induce the soxRS regulon or alternately that the induction of FumC by O·̄2 was mediated by some other regulon. We explore this further by investigating the effect of deleting soxRS upon the induction of FumC. Our finding is that FumC induction by O·̄2 is ablated by mutational elimination of the soxRS response. It follows that O·̄2 can induce the soxRS regulon and that the soxRS regulon is the sole mediator of the induction of FumC by O·̄2. Paraquat was obtained from Sigma and malate from ICN. Bactotryptone, casamino acids, and yeast extract were from Difco. The strains of E. coli used were as follows: GC4468 = parent (16Touati D. Tacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar); DJ 901 = GC4468 Δ (soxR-Zjc2204) Zjc2205::Tn10 K m (provided by B. Demple) (2Greenberg J.T. Monach P. Chou J.H. Josephy P.O. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar); QC1799 = GC4468 Δ sodA3, Δ sodB-kan (16Touati D. Tacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar); and QC1817 = GC4468 Δ sodA3, ΔsodB-kan, Δ sox8::cat (obtained by transduction of the Δ sox 8::cat mutation into QC1799). (ThesoxRS deletion was provided by B. Weiss (3Tsaneva I.R. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 171: 4197-4205Crossref Google Scholar).) Strains were grown overnight at 37 °C, with shaking in air, in LB, or in M9CA media containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and/or 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol where required. These cultures were diluted as described in the figure legends into media not containing antibiotics, and paraquat was added after 1 h, and incubation was continued for 75 min. Cells were then harvested, washed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA at pH 7.8, and then resuspended in this buffer and lysed in a French press. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fumarase C (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were assayed. One unit of fumarase was taken to be the activity that converted 1 μmol/min ofl-malate to fumarate using ΔE 250 nm = 1.62 mm−1cm−1. The initial concentration of l-malate was 50 mm, and the assay buffer was 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3, at 25 °C. Paraquat can be univalently reduced, at the expense of NADPH, by a number of diaphorases present in E. coli (18Liochev S.I. Hausladen A. Beyer W.F. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the paraquat monocation radical rapidly autoxidizes producing O·̄2 (19Farrington J.A. Ebert M. Land E.J. anf Fletcher K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and regenerating the paraquat dication. The rate of production of O·̄2 is thus increased within aerobic E. coli by paraquat. The net effect of paraquat on the steady state concentration of O·̄2 and on the redox status of the cell will be greater in an sodA sodB mutant than in its SOD-replete parent. Therefore, we should expect that paraquat should induce a member of the soxRS regulon such as FumC more strongly in ansodA sodB strain than in the parental strain.Bars 1, 2, and 3 in Fig.1 show that 10 and 25 μmparaquat caused a dose-dependent induction of FumC in the parental strain, whereas bars 4-6 show the greater response to paraquat exhibited by an sodAsodB strain. It is also noted that the lack of SOD, in the absence of paraquat, caused a 3-fold induction of FumC (comparebars 1 and 4). It follows that raising the steady state concentration of O·̄2, whether by introducing paraquat or by removing SOD, was sufficient to cause induction of FumC. Bars 7 and 8 show that the sodA sodBsoxRS triple mutant was unresponsive to O·̄2 in that it could not elevate FumC in response to aerobic paraquat. This establishes that O·̄2 induced FumC and did so via thesoxRS regulon. Hence the soxRS regulon is responsive to O·̄2. No induction by paraquat was seen in thesoxRS-deficient but otherwise SOD-proficient strain DJ901 (results not shown). This confirms our previous conclusion (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) that the induction of FumC in wild type strains of E. coli is entirely soxRS dependent. The induction of FumC caused by deletion of SodA and SodB was greater in cells that had been grown in M9CA rather than in the richer LB medium. This is made apparent by comparison of bars 1 and2 in Fig. 2 with bars 1 and 4 in Fig. 1. Thus there was a ∼3-fold induction, caused by the deletion of SOD activity, in the LB-grown cells and a 7-fold induction in the M9CA-grown cells. Bar 3in Fig. 2 shows that soxRS was as essential for the induction of FumC in the M9CA-grown cells as it was in the LB-grown cells. The experiment shown in Fig. 2 was repeated under dioxygen-depleted conditions. This was done by placing 0.2% inocula, in fresh M9CA medium in a BBL gas pack jar, which was then incubated for 5.5 h before the cells were harvested and extracts prepared for FumC assay. The gas pack jars were not evacuated before incubation so hypoxic, rather than anoxic, conditions prevailed. ThesodA sodB extracts were found to have 0.026 units/mg protein of FumC activity, whereas the parental extracts had 0.014 units/mg. Thus dioxygen depletion diminished the ratio of FumC in the sodA sodB extracts from ∼7-fold to ∼2-fold, as compared with the parental extracts. Because the induction of FumC, whether by addition of paraquat or by deletion of SodA and SodB, was dependent on soxRS and dioxygen, it follows that O·̄2 can induce soxRS. The induction of the soxRS regulon depends upon the oxidation of the reduced form of SoxR, because the oxidized SoxR is the transcriptional activator of soxS. There must be a pathway for the reduction of oxidized SoxR, and the steady state will depend on the balance between the rates of oxidation of reduced SoxR and of reduction of the oxidized SoxR. O·̄2, or some product thereof, might effect this steady state by directly oxidizing reduced SoxR and/or inhibiting the reduction of oxidized SoxR. Although the mechanism remains unknown, it is clear that the soxRS regulon can be induced by O·̄2. Although we are in agreement with Gort and Imlay (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concerning the importance of SOD as a defense against O·̄2, some exception must be taken to their conclusion that induction of FumC by O·̄2 is not adequate to compensate for the inactivation of FumA by O·̄2. They used an sodA sodB Ptac-sodA strain which could not induce Mn-SOD in response to increased [O·̄2]. In an SOD-competent wild type strain, in contrast, the inactivation of FumA would be lessened by the induction of Mn-SOD, which combined with the induction of FumC, should then be adequate to balance the decrease in FumA. Inductions caused by O·̄2-generating compounds such as paraquat cannot be unequivocally attributed to O·̄2, because redox cycling agents deplete cellular reductants while producing O·̄2and that depletion will interfere with the reduction of oxidized SoxR. An indication that depletion of cellular reductants can inducesoxRS, independent of O·̄2, was the anaerobic induction seen with paraquat plus the electron sink nitrate (20Privalle C.T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4274-4279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Privalle C.T. Beyer Jr., W.F. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No such ambiguity is encountered when O·̄2 is raised by deletion of SOD. In that case, if cellular reductants are also diminished, O·̄2 is the cause of that diminution. Thus O·̄2 can induce the soxRS regulon whose members provide manifold defenses against the oxidative damage imposed by O·̄2 and its progeny. An estimation of the O·̄2-dependent and O·̄2-independent routes of induction of soxRS can be attempted. Thus the level of [O·̄2] in the sodAsodB strain is ∼20-fold higher than in the parental strain (22Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and this caused an ∼3-fold induction of FumC. Gort and Imlay (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by using a strain in which the level of SOD could be modulated, reported that a 10-fold diminution of [SOD] was a threshold for induction of FumC and resulted in modest induction. A 10-fold decrease in [SOD] would correlate with a more than 5-fold increase in [O·̄2] as discussed below, because SOD is the major sink for O·̄2 in the parental strain. In the sodAsodB strain paraquat can cause much more than a 20-fold increase in [O·̄2] as compared with [O·̄2] in the wild type and this allows dramatic induction of FumC, as shown in Fig.1. In the SOD-replete parental strain, in contrast, the increase in [O·̄2] because of paraquat is strongly limited by the action of SOD and by the further induction of SodA elicited by paraquat. Thus the induction of the soxRS regulon by paraquat in the parental strain must largely be because of the depletion of cellular reductants by paraquat rather than to O·̄2. Of course, this is even more emphatically the case in strains overproducing SOD and explains why overproduction of SOD does not prevent induction of thesoxRS regulon by paraquat (6Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The induction of SodA is finely tuned so as to minimize both the toxic effects of O·̄2and the induction of the soxRS regulon by O·̄2. The degree of protection provided by the wild type level of SOD to all O·̄2-sensitive targets in E. coli has been estimated (22Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and that leads to a number of interesting deductions. Thus the rate of formation of O·̄2 (V f) must be equal to the sum of its rates of consumption by SOD (V SOD) and by all other targets (V T) i.e.Vf=VSOD+VTEquation 1 andVSOD=kSOD[SOD][O·̄2]Equation 2 andVT=kT[T][O·̄2]Equation 3 therefore[O·̄2]=VfkSOD[SOD]+kT[T]Equation 4 Application of Eq. 4 would require several difficult measurements and/or estimations so another approach is useful, from Eq. 1, as follows.VfVT=VSODVT+1Equation 5 andVT=VfVSODVT+1Equation 6 When V SOD = V T, one-half of all the O·̄2 flux is being scavenged by SOD and in analogy to the classical assay for SOD activity (23McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which SOD competes with cytochrome cfor the flux of O·̄2, we can define this amount of SOD activity as 1 biological unit. We have previously found that wild type E. coli contains 19 biological units of SOD on the basis of its inhibition of lucigenin luminescence (22Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Hence in these cells V T = 0.05 V f, whereas in sodA sodB cells V T =V f. Fig. 3 presents (100)V T/V f as a function of the number of biological units, which is the ratioV SOD/V T. This plot ignores changes in biological units because of enzyme inductions and changes inV T because of consumption of targets. A 10-fold decrease in [SOD] leaves 1.9 biological units and thenV T is increased 7-fold and, because [O·̄2] is directly proportional to V T (Eq. 3), so is [O·̄2]. Thus we see that [O·̄2] is less than inversely proportional to [SOD] because of the effect of the multiple targets for O·̄2 in the E. coli. It also follows that O·̄2 is both more deleterious and a better inducer of thesoxRS response than would be concluded on the basis of a simple inverse relationship between [O·̄2] and [SOD]. Moreover the wild type level of [SOD] is seen as providing 95% protection rather than the 99% protection deduced by Gort and Imlay (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 5-fold difference in amount of O·̄2 damage to targets is certainly explicable on the basis of the existence of targets in addition to the [4Fe-4S] containing dehydratases considered by Gort and Imlay (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [O·̄2] in wild type E. coli has been estimated to be ∼1 × 10−10m (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOD-nullE. coli will contain 20 times more, or ∼2 × 10−9m O·̄2 and the threshold for induction of FumC via the soxRS regulon by O·̄2 will be at ∼7 × 10−10m. Variation of these numbers will, of course, occur as growth conditions change. Thus the ratio of V SOD/V Tappeared to be approximately 40/1 when the cells were suspended in 0.25% glucose but was much less when they were suspended in LB or in succinate (22Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2891-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); we therefore used 19/1 as an average approximation. Several papers (15Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allow estimation thatV SOD/V T lies in the range 10–20, in agreement with our present estimate."

Culetto E. Combes D. Fedon Y. Toutant J.-P. Arpagaus M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to possessing cholinergic motor neurons, many parasitic nematodes secrete AChE into the culture medium when maintained in vitro (12Sanderson B.E. Z. Parasit. 1972; 40: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Ogilvie B.M. Rothwell T.L.W. Bremner K.C. Schitzerling H.J. Nolan J. Keith R.K. Int. J.

A nonneuronal origin for these enzymes has been confirmed by enzyme- and immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated that they are synthesized by and secreted from specialized amphidial and secretory glands (13Ogilvie B.M.

This remarkable phenomenon is exhibited predominantly by nematodes which inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of their vertebrate hosts and has provoked much discussion on the putative physiological role of these enzymes (18Rhoads M.L.

Analysis of the AChE secreted by the human hookworm Necator americanus indicated that the enzyme existed as a nonamphiphilic dimer (G2na form) (20Pritchard D.I. Brown A. Toutant J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas both G1na and G2na forms were identified in secreted products of Trichostrongylus colubriformis, a nematode parasite of sheep (21Griffiths G. Pritchard D.I. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We are utilizingNippostrongylus brasiliensis, the adult stages of which colonize the jejunum of rats, as a model system in which to study AChE secretion and have recently purified and characterized three variants of secreted AChE (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These variants (designated A, B, and C) are all G1na forms, with apparent masses of 74, 69, and 71 kDa, respectively, when resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Substrate and inhibitor specificities defined them as true AChEs rather than pseudocholinesterases. Although they show broadly similar enzymatic properties, they can be distinguished by subtle differences in molecular mass, inhibitor profiles, and excess substrate inhibition and display distinct and characteristic mobilities on nondenaturating PAGE (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These forms are differentially expressed by N. brasiliensisduring residence in the small intestine of the rat. Thus, parasites which have entered the duodenum from the stomach by three days postinfection exclusively secrete isoform A. Following moulting to the adult stage and migration to a more distal position in the jejunum however, a switch to expression of forms B and C occurs, with form B progressively becoming the most abundant secreted enzyme (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Edwards A.J. Burt J.S. Ogilvie B.M.

We utilized a 5′ primer tailored to the 6 amino-terminal amino acids of AChE B (DDGPTV) and containing aNotI restriction site (5′-atgcggccgcGA(T/C)GA(T/C)GGNCCNACNGT-3′), and a 3′ primer based on the conserved sequence flanking the active site serine residue (FGESAG) linked to a XhoI restriction site (5′-atctcgagCCNGCN(C/G)(A/T)(C/T)TC(T/G/A)CC(A/G)AA-3′) to amplify a fragment by RT-PCR which would putatively encode the amino-terminal region of AChE B (lowercase indicates nucleotides added for cloning purposes). A standard 100-μl PCR reaction was utilized, using 30 ng of cDNA, 500 ng of each primer, and 30 cycles of: 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min. This procedure yielded a product of 580 bp, which was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm that it encoded a cDNA fragment which was homologous to AChEs. We then utilized this fragment to screen a cDNA library constructed in λZAP (Stratagene) and isolated several clones, which were sequenced on both strands by dideoxy chain termination following subcloning into pBluescript. N. brasiliensis-secreted AChE B was expressed in P. pastoris via the expression plasmid pPICZα (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence encoding the mature enzyme was amplified from cDNA clone C43 using the sense primer 5′-tatactgcagATGATGGTCCGACGGTGGTG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-attatctagaTTGCCTTTAGCTTCATCAAT-3′. The fragment was cloned into pPICZαB cut with PstI and Xbal, and the reading frame was verified by partial sequencing of the recombinant plasmid, which was then linearized with SacI. The construct was integrated into competent P. pastoris X-33 via homologous recombination according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen), and transformants were confirmed by PCR with oligonucleotide primers homologous to pPICZαB sequences flanking the insertion site. The construct thus encoded the mature AChE B protein with an amino-terminal signal peptide provided by the pre-pro sequence of the α-mating factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and with a carboxyl-terminal polyhistidine tag. Recombinant yeast were grown in BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 400 ng ml−1 biotin, 1% glycerol) to saturation (2 days), and expression was induced in BMMY medium (same as BMGY, but with glycerol replaced by 1% methanol) at 30 °C. Culture supernatants were harvested at different times postmethanol induction and analyzed for AChE activity. The native enzymes were purified from ES products of worms isolated 8 days postinfection by affinity chromatography on 1-methyl-9-[Nβ-(ε-aminocaproyl)-β-aminopropylamino]-acridinium bromide hydrobromide-Sepharose 4B (a kind gift of Prof. I. Silman) as described previously (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the major AChE isoform (form B) was obtained following resolution by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and was performed by Severn Biotech (Kidderminster, UK). The recombinant AChE was purified from culture supernatants of transformedP. pastoris by nickel-charged chelating Sepharose chromatography. Chelating Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was charged with 1% NiSO4, washed with distilled water and equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm sodium chloride (buffer A). The yeast culture supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, concentrated on an Amicon cell, and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 40 ml h−1, which was subsequently extensively washed with buffer A and then buffer A plus 10 mm imidazole. The enzyme was then eluted from the column with buffer A plus 200 mm imidazole, and the purity of the enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Purified recombinant AChE and ES products were resolved under nondenaturing conditions by electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, pH 8.0, and enzyme activity was assayed by the method of Karnovsky and Roots (25Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar). Sedimentation analysis was performed in 2–20% sucrose gradients (11 ml, with a 0.5-ml cushion of 50% sucrose) in phosphate-buffered saline in the presence or absence of 1.0% Triton X-100. The purified enzyme was applied to the gradient and centrifuged for 16 h at 36,000 rpm at 4 °C in an SW41 rotor (170,000 × g). Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected and assayed for AChE activity. Bovine liver catalase (11.3 S) andEscherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (6.1 S) were included as internal standards. Total RNA was isolated from parasites as described previously (26Tweedie S. Grigg M.E. Ingram L. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, RNA was denatured in glyoxal, 10 μg per track separated on 1.2% agarose gels and transferred to nylon filters. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of gels prior to blotting and methylene blue staining of filters following transfer. Filters were hybridized with the full-length C43 cDNA probe labeled by random priming in 5× SSC, 0.25 mg ml−1 salmon sperm DNA, 0.25% SDS, 0.25% dried milk powder at 65 °C with 106 cpm ml−1 of probe, and blots were washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.25% SDS at 65 °C. AChE activity was determined by the method of Ellman (57Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21719) Google Scholar) with 1 mm acetylthiocholine (ASCh) iodide as substrate in the presence of 1 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm, and hydrolysis of ASCh was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (27Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of AChE is defined as 1 μmol of substrate hydrolyzed per min at 20 °C. The K m value for ASCh was determined by linear regression from plots of 1/V against 1/S, utilizing substrate at a range of concentrations between 25 and 200 μm (i.e. below substrate inhibition). Inhibition constants (K i) for eserine, BW284C51, propidium iodide, and gallamine were determined using two fixed inhibitor and six ASCh concentrations (0.05–0.20 mm). Assays were carried out in triplicate in the presence or absence of inhibitor. Kinetic constants were determined using Graphpad Prism 2.0 (San Diego, CA). We purified native AChEs (forms B and C) from ES products of worms isolated 8 days postinfection by affinity chromatography on 1-methyl-9-[Nβ-(e-aminocaproyl)-β-aminopropylamino]-acridinium bromide hydrobromide-Sepharose 4B, resolved the enzymes by SDS-PAGE, and blotted them onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. This procedure resulted in the determination of just six amino acids of amino-terminal sequence of the major isoform (form B) as DDGPTV. This information allowed us to design a primer that was utilized in combination with another to the conserved sequence flanking the active site serine residue of AChEs (FGESAG) to amplify a cDNA fragment of approximately 580 bp by RT-PCR, using RNA from parasites isolated 5 days postinfection. This cDNA fragment was sequenced and showed significant homology to cholinesterases from diverse sources and was, therefore, used to screen a cDNA library constructed in λZAP. Several clones were isolated by this procedure and sequenced. The sequence of the longest clone (C43, 1799 bp) is shown is Fig.1. It contains a short (12 bp) 5′-untranslated region, a single open reading frame of 1680 nucleotides, and a 3′-untranslated region of 107 bp, containing a consensus polyadenylation site (AATAAA, underlined) and a poly(A) tail. Analysis of the amino acid sequence encoded by C43 predicts a signal peptide of 19 residues, defined by the amino-terminal sequence of the native protein (underlined). The primary structure of the mature protein exhibits clear similarities to cholinesterases from numerous species, including 30% identity to ACE-1 of C. elegans (28Arpagaus M. Fedon Y. Cousin X. Chatonnet A. Bergé J.-B. Fournier D. Toutant J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9957-9965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 35% identity to Torpedo californica AChE (29Schumacher M. Camp S. Maulet Y. Newton M. MacPhee-Quigley K. Taylor S.S. Friedmann T. Taylor P. Nature. 1986; 319: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The most pertinent features of AChE B defined by the primary structure are illustrated in Fig. 2 in which it is aligned with that of C. elegans ACE-1 (28Arpagaus M. Fedon Y. Cousin X. Chatonnet A. Bergé J.-B. Fournier D. Toutant J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9957-9965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the T subunit of T. californica AChE (29Schumacher M. Camp S. Maulet Y. Newton M. MacPhee-Quigley K. Taylor S.S. Friedmann T. Taylor P. Nature. 1986; 319: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The residues in the catalytic triad, Ser-193, Glu-342, and His-466 (Ser-200, Glu-327, and His-440 inTorpedo), are conserved. Six cysteine residues are present (62–89, 247–276, and 428–543) that define the position of the three intramolecular disulfide bonds conserved in cholinesterases (67–94, 254–265, and 402–521; Refs. 30MacPhee-Quigley K. Vedvick T.S. Taylor P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13565-13570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lockridge O. Adkins S. La Du B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12945-12952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an additional two cysteine residues are present in positions 232 and 263 in the N. brasiliensis sequence. The protein is truncated at the carboxyl terminus by 45 residues relative to C. elegans ACE-1 or by 37 residues relative to the T subunit of the Torpedo enzyme. There are three consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation, at positions 124, 377, and 480. Eleven of the fourteen aromatic residues which line the wall of the active site gorge in the Torpedo enzyme (32Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman C. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) are either conserved or show conservative substitutions in the nematode sequence, including Trp-79 (Trp-84) which binds the quaternary ammonium group of acetylcholine in the active site (33Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Raba R. Pedak A. Aaviksaar A. Hucho F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Ordentlich A. Barak D. Kronman C. Flashner Y. Leitner M. Segall Y. Ariel N. Cohen S. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17083-17095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three residues which show nonconservative substitutions are Thr-65 (Tyr-70), Asn-290 (Trp-279), and Met-301 (Phe-288). Expression of AChE B during residence of N. brasiliensis in the intestinal tract of the mammalian host was determined by Northern blotting, utilizing RNA from parasites recovered at different time points postinfection and the C43 cDNA as a probe. Fig. 3demonstrates that the levels of mRNA for the secreted AChE remained relatively constant in parasites isolated between days 3 and 6 postinfection but, thereafter, rose progressively when assayed 8 and 10 days postinfection. We next expressed N. brasiliensis AChE B in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris, utilizing the yeast α-mating factor signal peptide to direct secretion of the enzyme, and colonies were selected that expressed high levels of AChE. In a representative example, AChE activity was detected in the culture medium assayed just 30 min after methanol induction. The concentration of total protein secreted by this recombinant yeast clone rose from approximately 6 μg ml−1 at 24 h to 27 μg ml−1 at 5 days postinduction (Fig. 4 A), although in practice we changed the culture medium daily. Fig.4 B, lane 2 shows that AChE B constituted approximately 90% of the total secreted protein. After 2 days postinduction, the medium was collected and the recombinant enzyme purified by nickel-chelating chromatography. The purified enzyme had a high specific activity when assayed against ASCh of 2,080 units mg−1. It displayed an apparent mass of 69 kDa when resolved by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and one of 72 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), indicative of a monomeric protein with intramolecular disulfide bonds. Recombinant AChE B was resolved by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in a single peak at 4.5 S. There was no shift in sedimentation in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, indicative of a monomeric nonamphiphilic (G1na) enzyme (data not shown). The purified enzyme was next subjected to nondenaturing PAGE and stained for AChE activity, and Fig.5 demonstrates that it resolved as a fast-migrating single band that co-migrated with form B of the native secreted parasite AChEs. The specificity of AChE B for a range of substrates was assayed, and the results are shown in Fig. 6, demonstrating that ASCh was the preferred substrate. Thus, at a substrate concentration of 1 mm, the rate of hydrolysis of A[βM]SCh, PSCh, and BuSCh relative to ASCh were 61, 15, and 5%, respectively. Excess substrate inhibition was observed for the former substrates at concentrations exceeding 2.5 mm, and the K m value for the enzyme was calculated at 0.23 ± 0.10 mm(n = 8). We next assessed the susceptibility of the recombinant enzyme to cholinesterase inhibitors. Activity was unaffected by the butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor iso-OMPA at concentrations up to 10 mm (data not shown), but it was highly sensitive to eserine and BW284c51, the latter a specific inhibitor of AChEs (35Austin L. Berry W.K. Biochem. J. 1953; 54: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Both eserine and BW284c51 inhibited in a competitive manner, and theK i values were calculated at 3.6 ± 1.2 and 6.4 ± 1.9 nm (n = 4), respectively. The “peripheral” site ligands, propidium iodide and gallamine, also inhibited AChE activity but in a noncompetitive manner, withK i values of 0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.80 ± 0.07 μm (n = 3), respectively (Fig.7). The phenomenon of cholinesterase secretion by parasitic nematodes was first reported almost 30 years ago (12Sanderson B.E. Z. Parasit. 1972; 40: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Ogilvie B.M. Rothwell T.L.W. Bremner K.C. Schitzerling H.J. Nolan J. Keith R.K. Int. J. Parasitol. 1973; 3: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Lee D.L. Tissue Cell. 1970; 2: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and yet still presents a conundrum which awaits a satisfactory explanation. We are attempting to address the physiological significance of this process and present here a molecular characterization of one of the enzymes secreted by N. brasiliensis. As would be expected for a secreted protein, it is hydrophilic, and the properties of the recombinant AChE B are essentially the same as those of the native enzyme (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the native enzymes purified by acridinium affinity chromatography (685 units mg−1) was considerably lower than that of the recombinant enzyme purified by nickel-chelating chromatography (2,080 units mg−1) however, and this is consistent with previous data (22Grigg M.E. Tang L. Hussein A.S. Selkirk M.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We attribute this to residual binding of decamethonium to the native enzymes, which can only be purified in low microgram quantities. Partial purification of native AChE B without the use of an affinity ligand gave a value of 1,450 units mg−1, 2Grigg, M. E., unpublished observations.suggesting that the estimation of specific activity for the recombinant enzyme is close to that of the native enzyme. Derivation of the primary structure of the protein from the cDNA sequence provides an explanation for its monomeric nature, as the carboxyl-terminal cysteine implicated in dimer formation is missing. In fact, the carboxyl terminus is severely truncated in comparison with vertebrate AChEs and therefore bears no resemblance to the peptides that define hydrophobic (H) or tailed (T) subunits (36Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Fig. 2illustrates that the carboxyl terminus of the parasite enzyme aligns at a position approximating to the end of the catalytic domain ofTorpedo AChE. In this respect, the parasite enzyme is similar to AChE from Bungarus fasciatus venom, which is also unusual in that it is a hydrophilic monomeric enzyme with a truncated carboxyl terminus, although the carboxyl-terminus of ACE B is 12 residues shorter than that of the Bungarus AChE and thus lacks the basic residues associated with the latter enzyme which are cleaved on secretion (37Cousin X.

Bon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15099-15108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In many other respects, the sequence of the N. brasiliensisAChE B shows features consistent with AChEs from diverse species. The residues which constitute the catalytic triad are conserved, as are the six cysteine residues implicated in disulfide bond formation. An additional two cysteine residues are present in the N. brasiliensis sequence, however, at positions 232 and 263. The latter lies in an insertion of 17 amino acids (relative toTorpedo), which by analogy with the structure of theT. californica AChE (32Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman C. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) most probably forms part of a loop of 30 residues at the molecular surface stabilized by the second disulfide bond. One of the most striking features of the structure of theTorpedo enzyme is the active site gorge, about 20-Å long, which penetrates halfway into the enzyme (32Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman C. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Fourteen aromatic residues line a substantial part of the surface of the gorge. These residues and flanking sequences are highly conserved in AChEs from different species and are thought to delineate a substrate guidance mechanism. Eleven of these residues are either conserved or show conservative substitutions in the N. brasiliensis AChE. Two of the aromatic residues (Tyr-70 and Phe-288 in Torpedo) that are substituted in the nematode sequence by Thr-65 and Met-301 are also substituted by nonaromatic residues in mammalian butyrylcholinesterases (39Lockridge O. Bartels C.F. Vaughan T.A. Wong C.K. Norton S.E. Johnson L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 549-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and C. elegans ACE-1 (28Arpagaus M. Fedon Y. Cousin X.

P3-(1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl)ester adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate Eukaryotic chromosome segregation is mediated by the mitotic spindle, a microtubule-based motile structure that undergoes a distinct program of morphological changes. It is now clear that many spindle movements are accomplished by microtubule-based motor proteins. Perhaps the best characterized type of spindle motor is that of the BimC subfamily of kinesin-related proteins. Members of the BimC family, first discovered in Aspergillus nidulans (1Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), have been found in numerous eukaryotic species (2Hagan I. Yanagida M.

These proteins are conserved in amino acid sequence of the motor (force-producing) domain and apparently perform similar roles in many different cell types (8Hoyt M.A. Geiser J.R. Annu. Rev.

BimC motors are required for bipolar spindle assembly; elimination of their function blocked this essential early mitotic step in fungal, insect, and mammalian cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses two BimC-related motors that overlap in function, Cin8p and Kip1p. Although neither is individually essential, one of the pair is required for viability (3Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 11Saunders W.S. Hoyt M.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 451-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Loss ofKIP1 causes less severe phenotypes than loss ofCIN8, suggesting that Cin8p is more important for successful yeast spindle function (3Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Besides essential roles in spindle assembly, Cin8p and Kip1p are also required for the maintenance of spindle bipolarity following assembly and are responsible for producing most of the spindle-elongating force during anaphase (11Saunders W.S. Hoyt M.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 451-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Saunders W.S. Koshland D. Eshel D. Gibbons I.R. Hoyt M.A. J.

In addition to genetic experiments, several lines of evidence suggest that BimC motors act by cross-linking and sliding antiparallel microtubules found in the spindle midzone. BimC motors have been localized exclusively to the microtubules that lie between the spindle poles (3Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J.

In vitro, BimC motors fromDrosophila melanogaster and Xenopus laevis have been found to move exclusively toward microtubule plus ends, albeit at a rate much slower than that achieved by kinesin (∼2 μm/minversus 20–40 μm/min for kinesin) (16Bloom G.S. Endow S.A. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1105-1171PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the “bipolar” molecular structure determined for theDrosophila BimC motor Klp61F suggested a mechanism by which these motors may contribute to spindle structure and elongation. Klp61F is an elongated bipolar homotetramer, with two motor domains positioned at each end of a rodlike structure (17Kashina A.S. Baskin R.J. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Saxton W.M. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Such a bipolar molecule would have the ability to cross-link and slide antiparallel microtubules (10Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite these suggestive observations, the actual molecular role of BimC motors during spindle dynamics has yet to be established. In this study, we developed in vitro assays for the analysis of the S. cerevisiae Cin8p motor. Our purpose was 2-fold. First, the in vitro properties of Cin8p have not been described. Mere analogies to other BimC members are clearly indirect and unsatisfactory. Second, the ease of genetic and cell cycle manipulations in yeast demands a similarly direct method to examine and dissect Cin8p functions in vitro. Although exogenous expression of motors allows initial reconstituted studies, only endogenous expression in yeast allows direct study of Cin8p cell cycle regulation and different mitotic roles. With these goals in mind, we developed a rapid assay for the activity of Cin8p expressed in yeast cells. For a one-step purification and adsorption to avidin-coated surface, the Cin8 protein was fused to a peptide (biotin carrier peptide or BCP) that is endogenously biotinated in yeast. Subsequent analysis could distinguish microtubule binding from translocation activities, and photoactivation of caged-ATP further increased the sensitivity of our assays. Using these assays, the study of two Cin8p mutants revealed the relative importance of binding and motility for Cin8p in vivo functions. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in these experiments are derivatives of S288C and are listed in Table I. Thecin8::HIS3 and kip1::HIS3alleles were described previously (12Saunders W.S. Koshland D. Eshel D. Gibbons I.R. Hoyt M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were as described by Sherman et al. (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 61-62Google Scholar). To derepress galactose-inducible genes, cells were grown in 2% raffinose minimal media at 26 °C for 24 h prior to induction by the addition of galactose to 2%. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. All media for expression of biotinated Cin8p were supplemented with 24 mg/liter biotin (Sigma) (19Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were synchronized in G1 phase by the addition of 4–6 μg/ml of α-factor (Bachem) to liquid media (pH 4), for about 4 h until >85% were unbudded.Table IYeast strains and plasmidsYeast strains and plasmidsGenotypeMAY591MATαlys2 his3 leu2 ura3MAY2063MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cin8::URA3MAY2180MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cyh2 can1 kip1::HIS3MAY2330MATa lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 kip1::HIS3 cin8–3MAY3789MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cin8::HIS3 kip1::HIS3 cyh2 (pMA1208)MAY4816MATa ade2 his3 leu2 ura3 (pFC56)MAY6013MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cin8::HIS3 kip1::HIS3 cyh2 (pLG3)MAY6014MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cin8::HIS3 kip1::HIS3 cyh2(pMA1260)MAY6015MAY591 (pLG8)MAY6016MAY591 (pTK18)MAY6017MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cyh2 can1 kip1::HIS3 cin8-F467AMAY6018MATa ade2 lys2 his3 leu2 ura3 cin8::HIS3 kip1::HIS3 cyh2(pLG20)MAY6019MAY2063 (pLG8)MAY6020MAY2063 (pLG15)MAY6021MAY2063 (pLG36)MAY6022MAY591 (pFC54)MAY6023MAY591 (pLG34)MAY6024MAY591 (pLG16)pFC54PGAL > KIP3 HIS3 CENpFC56PGAL > KIP2 LEU2 CENpLG3CIN8-BCP LYS2 CENpLG8PGAL >CIN8-BCP LYS2 CENpLG15PGAL >cin8-F467A-BCP LYS2 CENpLG16PGAL >cin8-R394,H396A-BCP LYS2 CENpLG20CIN8-BCP URA3 2μpLG24PGAL > cin8–871-BCP LYS2 CENpLG36PGAL > cin8–3-BCP LYS2 CENpMA1208CIN8 LEU2 CYH2 CENpMA1260CIN8 LYS2 CENpTK18PGAL > CIN8 LYS2 CEN Open table in a new tab To create a biotinated version of Cin8p, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the sequence of yeastPYC1, encoding the last 90 amino acids of pyruvate carboxylase (20Lim F.

Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), creating pLG3. Standard DNA manipulations were used to place CIN8-BCP under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter on a CEN vector (pLG8). The cin8–3 (cin8-R196K) mutation was introduced into CIN8-BCPconstructs using an MscI to PstI fragment containing the mutant allele. The presence of cin8–3 was confirmed by sequencing. The cin8-F467A mutation was created by the unique site elimination method (23Nicolas G. Pedroni S. Fournier C. Gautero H. Lecomte M.C. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The primer for mutagenesis was GTCAATTTCGATTCACGGGCAGGTATATGGCCGCTTTTATC, which also introduced a BspMI site with the amino acid change. The presence of the cin8-F467A mutation was confirmed by digestion with BspMI. Yeast protein extracts for SDS gel electrophoresis were prepared by vortexing cells with glass beads (diameter of 425–600 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were vortexed eight times at the maximum speed for 15 s, with 15 s on ice in between. Lysates was separated from cell debris and glass beads via centrifugation for 5 min in the cold. An aliquot was reserved for protein concentration determination using the BCA assay (Pierce) to ensure equal protein loading in gel lanes. Samples were run on 7% acrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) membranes using standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reagents for immunoblot analysis, including streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase, were obtained from Tropix. Band intensities were quantified by scanning film images of blots and analyzing with commercial software, IDL (Research Systems). For the in vitro assays, 20–50-ml cultures were grown to midlog phase. Cells were pelleted, washed, and ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen in 1 ml of motility buffer 1 (MB1): 30 mm Tris, 35 mm PIPES, final pH 7.2, 175 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Protein concentration in these extracts was typically 1–3 mg/ml. To assay Cin8p-BCP-induced microtubule gliding and binding on avidin- or streptavidin-coated surfaces, we modified the protocol of Berlineret al. (25Berliner E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acid-treated number 1 borosilicate glass coverslips were prepared by overnight incubation in Chromerge (Thomas Scientific), followed by washing under running filtered deionized water for 20–30 min and spin-dried on a custom coverslip spinner. Flow chambers (∼10 μl) were formed between microscope slide and the coverslip mounted with double stick tape. For side-by-side comparison of different conditions, up to four chambers separated by silicone grease lines were prepared on a single slide and coverslip. All incubations below were for 10 min at room temperature. Biotinamidocaproyl bovine albumin (Sigma), 10 μl of a 1.7 mg/ml solution in H2O, was introduced to the chambers, incubated, and washed twice with H2O. The chambers were treated with 10 μl of 5 mg/ml UltraAvidinTM (deglycosylated and charge-neutralized avidin; from Leinco Technologies) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, incubated, and rinsed twice with H2O, incubated with casein (up to 5 mg/ml) in H2O, rinsed twice with H2O, and then rinsed twice with MB1. Crude yeast extracts, 10 μl of 0.2–1 mg/ml total protein, were introduced, incubated for 4–6 min, and washed twice with MB1. In experiments in which the ability of biotin to block binding was assessed, the H2O rinse after UltraAvidin incubation was replaced with biotin-saturated H2O, and the consecutive rinses and incubations contained a 1% dilution of biotin-saturated H2O. The final rinse in MB1 and motility and binding assays were performed without the addition of biotin. For motility, taxol (40 μm)-stabilized microtubules (0.05 mg/ml) in MB1 were added to the flow chamber along with 1–5 mm ATP. Average microtubule length was 5 μm. When tested, other nucleotides were added to a final concentration of 1 mm. For motility assays, MB1 was supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4. To visualize microtubules, video-enhanced DIC microscopy was used as described previously (26Kuo S.C. Gelles J. Steuer E. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1991; 14: 135-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 100TV, 100× Plan Neofluar 1.3 NA objective) was modified by installing high transmission polarizers to project images onto a Newvicon camera (Dage VE1000), and images were enhanced using an image processor (Hamamatsu Argus 100). Video sequences were recorded on sVHS tape (Panasonic AG7650 recorder), and microtubule gliding velocities were measured using custom software (Imaging Technologies AFG image processor) from these videos. ATP uncaging experiments were done in the presence of 1 mmof NPE-ATP2 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a “caged” nucleotide from which ATP is liberated by exposure to UV irradiation. The assay was performed similarly to experiments with myosin (27Goldman Y.E. Hibberd M.G. Trentham D.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 354: 577-604Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 28Hibberd M.G. Goldman Y.E. Trentham D.R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1984; 24: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Photoactivation of caged ATP required a custom dichroic (400DCLPL from Chroma Technology Corp.) to reflect light from a 75-watt xenon arc lamp. To prevent uncaging during video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy, the mercury arc illumination passed through an OG515 Schott Glass optical filter as well as through a 546-nm interference filter. UV illumination of the sample was between 1 and 2 min, followed by observation of the sample for an additional minute. Under these conditions, no effect on the length of microtubules was observed. Polarity-marked microtubules were prepared according to Refs. 29Koshland D.E. Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1988; 331: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar and 30Hyman A.

Sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) axonemes (a gift from Herb Miller and Jennifer Gregory) were used as seeds and were prepared by the method of Bell et al. (31Bell C.W. Fraser C. Sale W.S. Tang W.J. Gibbons I.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 373-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as modified by Walkeret al. (32Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A.

The correct orientation of microtubules labeling was confirmed by a motility assay using bovine brain kinesin (Cytoskeleton). The microtubule bundling assay was performed using flow chambers constructed as described above. Yeast cell extracts (4 μl of 2 mg/ml) were mixed with taxol-stabilized microtubules in MB1 (16 μl of 3.3 μg/ml). Bundling was observed in solution and on the glass surface by video-enhanced differential interference contrast optics. For this study, we developed an in vitro assay to examine the microtubule binding and motile properties of the Cin8p kinesin-related motor from S. cerevisiae. We constructed a version ofCIN8 that encodes a fusion between Cin8p and a peptide fromS. cerevisiae pyruvate carboxylase (product ofPYC1; Refs. 20Lim F. Morris C.P. Occhiodoro F. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11493-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 21Walker M.E. Val D.L. Rohde M. Devenish R.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) attached to the Cin8p carboxyl terminus. This region of pyruvate carboxylase, derived from its carboxyl terminus, acts as a covalent acceptor of biotin from a specific ligase (20Lim F. Morris C.P. Occhiodoro F. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11493-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berliner E. Mahtani H.K. Karki S. Chu L.F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelles J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8610-8615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to this region of pyruvate carboxylase as BCP for biotin-carrying polypeptide. Fusion proteins that contained the homologous region of E. coli pyruvate carboxylase become endogenously biotinated both in E. coliand S. cerevisiae (19Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CIN8-BCP fusion gene was cloned into low copy centromere-containing (CEN) and high copy (2-μm origin) vectors and was expressed from either the endogenousCIN8 promoter or a high level galactose-inducible promoter. Relative to the level of expression provided by the endogenous promoter/CEN plasmid construct, the endogenous promoter/2-μm version and the galactose promoter/CEN version (induced for 4 h) produced approximately 35- and 500-fold more Cin8p-BCP, respectively. On account of overlapping functions (3Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the ability ofCIN8-BCP to complement a CIN8 deletion allele was tested in a strain that was deleted for both CIN8 andKIP1. Since cin8Δ kip1Δ double mutants are not viable, the viability of the tester strain was maintained by aCIN8 plasmid that also carried CYH2. Despite the presence of a recessive cyh2 cycloheximide resistance allele in the genome, this strain is sensitive to cycloheximide due to the dominant CYH2 allele carried on the plasmid (Fig.1 A). Transformation with a second plasmid carrying CIN8-BCP, however, allowed cells to live without the CIN8-CYH2 plasmid and therefore to grow on cycloheximide-containing media. This indicated that CIN8-BCPprovides CIN8 activity. The cin8Δ kip1Δ(CIN8-BCP plasmid) cells were indistinguishable fromcin8Δ kip1Δ (CIN8 plasmid) cells for growth rate and temperature resistance. In addition, we found that Cin8p-BCP localized to spindle microtubules in a manner indistinguishable from Cin8p (data not shown). We conclude that Cin8p-BCP acts similarly to Cin8p in vivo. The Cin8p-BCP fusion protein was endogenously biotinated in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1 B). Biotination was detected by gel electrophoresis of total cell protein extract followed by blotting and probing with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. In cells expressing CIN8-BCP from the galactose-inducible promoter (on a CEN plasmid), the addition of galactose resulted in the appearance of an ∼128-kDa protein, consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). This protein band increased in intensity with the time of galactose induction and was absent from cells that are deleted forCIN8 (Fig. 1 B). In cells expressingCIN8-BCP from its native promoter, either on low copy (CEN) or high copy (2-μm) plasmids, the amount of Cin8p-BCP produced was correspondingly lower (Fig. 1 B). The 2-μm expression level was intermediate between that of CEN and PGAL expression levels (Fig. 1 B). The noninducible biotinated protein band of ∼120 kDa is probably S. cerevisiae pyruvate carboxylase, one of the five endogenously biotinated proteins in this organism (33Lim F. Rohde M. Morris C.P. Wallace J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We observed that extracts from yeast cells overproducing Cin8p exhibited a microtubule bundling activity (Fig.2 and TableII). This activity may be related to the ability of BimC motors to cross-link spindle microtubules (10Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). When extracts from cells overproducing Cin8p or Cin8p-BCP under the control of the galactose promoter were mixed with taxol-stabilized microtubule, bundles were observed. In the presence of 1 mm AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, 90% of the observable microtubule structures were bundles. Bundles were found in 70–80% of scored microscope fields (n = 100 fields of 400 μm (2Hagan I. Yanagida M. Nature. 1990; 347: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Without the addition of AMP-PNP, the degree of bundling was slightly reduced. At lower overexpression levels (Cin8p-BCP from its normal promoter but on a high copy 2-μm plasmid) bundling was observed, but at a reduced level (Table II). No bundling was observed using extracts from yeast producing wild-type levels of Cin8p or deleted forCIN8 (n > 100 fields for each). We found that the addition of avidin, which interacts with the biotin moiety of BCP, did not alter the extent of Cin8p-BCP-specific bundling. This indicates that the ability of Cin8p-BCP to interact with microtubules is independent of its interaction with avidin. When 1 mmATP was added to bundles formed in the absence of added nucleotides, dissolution of bundles occurred within 5–10 min. In some cases, we were able to observe the sliding apart of bundles following the addition of ATP. The relative polarity of the sliding microtubules (parallel versus antiparallel) was not determined, however.Table IIBundling of microtubules by Cin8pProtein expressed (expression method)aThe indicated protein was expressed from its endogenous promoter on a low copy centromere plasmid (CEN), its endogenous promoter on a high copy 2-μm plasmid, or the galactose promoter (PGAL) on a low copy centromere plasmid.

Open table in a new tab The bundling in crude cell extracts was specific for overproduced Cin8p. Under the conditions described above, extracts from cells that overproduced either a Cin8p motor domain mutant (Cin8p-R394A, H396A) or kinesin-related Kip2p or Kip3p never bundled microtubules. Interestingly, Cin8p-871, a tail deletion mutant that forms a dimer instead of the wild-type tetramer, 3E. Hildebrandt, L. Gheber, and M. A. Hoyt, unpublished observation. was unable to form bundles. This suggests that bundling reflects the ability of BimC motors to cross-link microtubules via their bipolar arrangement of motor domains. Avidin-coated glass coverslips were used to specifically bind Cin8p-BCP from crude protein extracts. Two criteria were used to establish that any observed microtubule binding to these surfaces was specific for Cin8p: 1) extracts that lack biotinated Cin8p should exhibit no microtubule binding, and 2) added biotin should block microtubule binding. Fig. 3 summarizes six experiments in which microtubule binding was assessed in the absence of added nucleotide. The microtubule binding activity was high from extracts in which Cin8p-BCP was overproduced but was greatly reduced by the addition of biotin or from extracts ofcin8Δ cells or cells overexpressing Cin8p (without the BCP tag). The main factors that influenced the specificity of this assay were ionic strength and the concentration of casein, which was used to block nonspecific interactions. We found that different extracts from the same yeast strain sometimes required different casein concentrations to block nonspecific microtubule binding. Therefore, for every extract preparation we determined the casein concentration that, in the absence of added nucleotide, would allow high microtubule binding in the absence of a biotin block and very low binding in the presence of a biotin block. Reducing NaCl concentrations below 150 mm also increased the nonspecific binding of microtubules. However, NaCl concentration above 200 mm interfered with binding of microtubules to Cin8p. The optimal conditions were achieved with 175 mm NaCl in the buffers for both extract preparation and assays. The number of specifically bound microtubules was higher on modified avidin (UltraAvidinTM; see “Materials and Methods”) surfaces than on other avidin- and streptavidin-coated surfaces. The spindle pole-separating activity of Cin8p is most easily explained by a plus end-directed motile activity (3Hoyt M.A. He L. Loo K.K. Saunders W.S"
https://openalex.org/W2084041265,"Myeloperoxidase is the most abundant protein in neutrophils and catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid. This potent oxidant plays a central role in microbial killing and inflammatory tissue damage. 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) is a mechanism-based inhibitor of myeloperoxidase that is oxidized to radical intermediates that cause enzyme inactivation. We have investigated the mechanism by which benzoic acid hydrazides (BAH) are oxidized by myeloperoxidase, and we have determined the features that enable them to inactivate the enzyme. BAHs readily reduced compound I of myeloperoxidase. The rate constants for these reactions ranged from 1 to 3 × 106m−1s−1 (15 °C, pH 7.0) and were relatively insensitive to the substituents on the aromatic ring. Rate constants for reduction of compound II varied between 6.5 × 105m−1 s−1 for ABAH and 1.3 × 103m−1 s−1 for 4-nitrobenzoic acid hydrazide (15 °C, pH 7.0). Reduction of both compound I and compound II by BAHs adhered to the Hammett rule, and there were significant correlations with Brown-Okamoto substituent constants. This indicates that the rates of these reactions were simply determined by the ease of oxidation of the substrates and that the incipient free radical carried a positive charge. ABAH was oxidized by myeloperoxidase without added hydrogen peroxide because it underwent auto-oxidation. Although BAHs generally reacted rapidly with compound II, they should be poor peroxidase substrates because the free radicals formed during peroxidation converted myeloperoxidase to compound III. We found that the reduction of ferric myeloperoxidase by BAH radicals was strongly influenced by Hansch's hydrophobicity constants. BAHs containing more hydrophilic substituents were more effective at converting the enzyme to compound III. This implies that BAH radicals must hydrogen bond to residues in the distal heme pocket before they can reduce the ferric enzyme. Inactivation of myeloperoxidase by BAHs was related to how readily they were oxidized, but there was no correlation with their rate constants for reduction of compounds I or II. We propose that BAHs destroy the heme prosthetic groups of the enzyme by reducing a ferrous myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide complex.

We found that the reduction of ferric myeloperoxidase by BAH radicals was strongly influenced by Hansch's hydrophobicity constants. BAHs containing more hydrophilic substituents were more effective at converting the enzyme to compound III. This implies that BAH radicals must hydrogen bond to residues in the distal heme pocket before they can reduce the ferric enzyme. Inactivation of myeloperoxidase by BAHs was related to how readily they were oxidized, but there was no correlation with their rate constants for reduction of compounds I or II. We propose that BAHs destroy the heme prosthetic groups of the enzyme by reducing a ferrous myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide complex. 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide benzoic acid hydrazide 3,3′5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid high performance liquid chromatography Myeloperoxidase is the most abundant protein of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) (1Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 391-443Google Scholar). It is stored in their azurophilic or primary granules, and they use it to kill invading pathogens (2Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3512-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These granulocytic cells ingest micro-organisms into phagosomes where they kill them by generating an array of reactive oxidants including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. It is assumed that myeloperoxidase acts by producing hypochlorous acid. The potent cytotoxic action of hypochlorous acid (3Klebanoff S.J. Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1978Google Scholar, 4Hurst J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the demonstration that it is produced inside phagosomes (5Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1238-1289Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Jiang Q. Hurst J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32767-32772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reinforces this assumption. Hypochlorous acid is also likely to contribute to the tissue damage caused by neutrophils at sites of inflammation by inactivating enzymes, cross-linking proteins, oxidizing susceptible amino acids, and chlorinating lipids and tyrosyl residues (7Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase is a member of the homologous mammalian peroxidase family that also includes lactoperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, and thyroid peroxidase. It is a tetrameric heme enzyme composed of two identical dimers and has a molecular mass of approximately 145 kDa (8Hurst J.K. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 37-62Google Scholar). It is unique among the mammalian peroxidases in its ability to utilize hydrogen peroxide in the oxidation of chloride to hypochlorous acid. However, it also catalyzes the formation of hypothiocyanite at physiological concentrations of thiocyanate and chloride (9van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and readily oxidizes numerous phenols, anilines, and β-diketones to free radicals (7Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In addition, it is capable of hydroxylating aromatic compounds (10Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17146-17151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase undergoes a series of redox transformations during its production of reactive oxidants (7Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Redox Rep. 1997; 3: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Initially, hydrogen peroxide reacts with the ferric enzyme (MP3+) to convert it to compound I (Reaction 1). This redox intermediate oxidizes chloride and thiocyanate via a single two-electron reaction to produce the respective hypohalous acids and regenerate the native enzyme (Reaction 2). Alternatively, it removes a single electron from a variety of organic substrates (AH2) to produce free radicals and the redox intermediate compound II (Reaction 3). The classical peroxidation cycle is complete when compound II is reduced back to ferric myeloperoxidase by the organic substrate (Reaction 4).MP3++H2O2→compound I+H2OREACTION1compound I+Cl−+H+→MP3++HOClREACTION2compound I+AH2→compound II+·AHREACTION3compound II+AH2+H+→MP3++·AH+H2OREACTION4MP3++·AH→MP2++A+H+REACTION5MP2++O2→MP2+O2(compound III)REACTION6As yet there is no specific and potent inhibitor of myeloperoxidase that can be used to unambiguously identify the role of the enzyme in microbial killing and inflammation. Such an inhibitor would also be useful in attenuating myeloperoxidase-dependent inflammatory tissue damage. A number of strategies have been used to inhibit the enzyme. Its activity has been blocked by trapping it as inactive compound II (11Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), preventing the binding of chloride and hydrogen peroxide (12Ikeda-Saito M. Shelley D.A. Lu L. Booth K.S. Caughey W.S. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3611-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Davies B. Edwards S.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and destroying its heme prosthetic groups (14van Zyl J.M. Basson K. Uebel R.A. van der Walt B.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Kettle A.J. Gedye C.A. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The most promising inhibitors identified to date are substituted benzoic acid hydrazides, which inhibited the peroxidation activity by 50% at concentrations less than 10 μm (16Kettle A.J. Gedye C.A. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH)1 was the best inhibitor of both peroxidation and production of hypochlorous acid. It had no effect on other neutrophil enzymes or on their production of superoxide (16Kettle A.J. Gedye C.A. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, ABAH has considerable potential for identifying reactions of neutrophils that are dependent on myeloperoxidase. ABAH was shown to be a suicide substrate of myeloperoxidase (15Kettle A.J. Gedye C.A. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The enzyme oxidizes it to free radical intermediates that reduce ferric myeloperoxidase to the ferrous enzyme (MP2+; Reaction 5). In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and ABAH, the heme groups of myeloperoxidase are destroyed. Oxygen protects the enzyme by converting ferrous myeloperoxidase to oxymyeloperoxidase or compound III (Reaction 6). To appreciate fully how benzoic acid hydrazides inactivate myeloperoxidase, it will be necessary to understand how these substrates are oxidized by the enzyme. In this investigation we have carried out kinetic studies to determine what features of benzoic acid hydrazides make them good substrates for compound I and compound II of myeloperoxidase. We have also investigated the mechanism by which myeloperoxidase oxidizes ABAH, and we have assessed the structural aspects of benzoic acid hydrazides that enable them to act as suicide substrates. 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide, homovanillic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, and bovine liver catalase were purchased from the Sigma. Fluka Chemicals supplied benzoic acid hydrazide, 3-nitrobenzoic acid hydrazide, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid hydrazide, and Aldrich supplied 3-methoxybenzoic acid hydrazide and 4-nitrobenzoic acid hydrazide. 4-Methoxybenzoic acid hydrazide was obtained from Cambrian Chemicals (Croydon, Surrey, UK). Stock solutions of these hydrazides were prepared daily in distilled water. Hydrogen peroxide solutions were prepared by dilution of a 30% stock solution (Merck), and their concentrations were determined by measuring their absorbance at 240 nm (ε240 39.4m−1 cm−1) (17Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). CM-Sepharose Cl-6B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Myeloperoxidase was purified from human neutrophils to a purity index (A 430/A 280) of at least 0.80 as described previously (18Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Its concentration was calculated by measuring its absorbance at 430 nm (ε430 91000m−1 cm−1 per heme) (19Odajima T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 206: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Sequential stopped-flow measurements were performed with an Applied Photophysics (UK) instrument (model SX-18MV). When 100 μl was shot into a flow cell having a 1-cm light path, the fastest time for mixing two solutions and recording the first data point was approximately 1.5 ms. Reactions were carried out in 100 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer. Sequential stopped-flow (multi-mixing) analysis was used for kinetics measurements of the conversion of compound I to compound II because compound I is inherently unstable (20Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With 0.5 μmmyeloperoxidase, 5 μm was the minimum hydrogen peroxide concentration required for complete formation of compound I (characterized by a 50% hypochromicity in the Soret band). Under these conditions, compound I was completely formed within 40 ms and was stable for at least a further 10 ms. For reduction of compound I by the hydrazides, 2 μm ferric myeloperoxidase was premixed in the aging loop with 20 μm hydrogen peroxide for 40 ms. The compound I was then allowed to react with varying concentrations of hydrazides. To ensure first order kinetics, their final concentrations were at least five times that of the enzyme. Formation of compound II was monitored at 456 nm, which is the wavelength where compound II absorbs maximally and the isosbestic point for the ferric enzyme and compound I (21Marquez L.A. Huang J.T. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At least three determinations (1000–4000 data points) of k obs, the pseudo-first order rate constant, were performed for each substrate concentration. Second order rate constants were calculated from the slope of the plot of the meank obs values versus substrate concentration. Two methods were evaluated for measuring the rate of reduction of compound II by the hydrazides. In one method a large excess of hydrogen peroxide over the enzyme was used to generate compound II (21Marquez L.A. Huang J.T. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In the other method, compound II was formed by using a 10-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a sub-stoichiometric concentration of homovanillic acid. We found that homovanillic acid readily reduces compound I (k 3 = 1.7 ± 0.15 × 105m−1 s−1) but reacts slowly with compound II (k 4 = 230 ± 1.9 m−1 s−1, data not shown). Both methods gave identical k obs values for reaction of compound II with electron donors. However, we chose to use the latter method because a greater change in absorbance was achieved when compound II was reduced, and the lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in the incubation mixture guaranteed pre-steady-state conditions. For reduction of compound II, 2 μm ferric myeloperoxidase was premixed with 20 μm hydrogen peroxide and 1.8 μm homovanillic acid in the aging loop. Under these conditions, compound II was stable for at least 40 s. Twenty seconds after the initial mixing, compound II was allowed to react with a substrate. To ensure first order kinetics, the final concentrations of the hydrazides was at least five times that of the enzyme (2.5–50 μm). Reduction of compound II was monitored by recording the loss in absorbance at 456 nm (2000–4000 data points). At least three determinations of the pseudo-first order rate constants,k obs, were performed for each substrate concentration, and the mean value was used to calculatek 4 as described above. Formation of compound III during oxidation of the benzoic acid hydrazides was recorded using conventional stopped-flow. The native enzyme (2 μm) was mixed with 20 μm hydrogen peroxide in the presence of either 20 or 100 μmhydrazide, and the kinetics of compound III formation were followed at 625 nm. Compound III and compound II were distinguished by the ratios of their absorbances at 625 and 456 nm, which are 0.52 and 0.2, respectively (20Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The oxidation of ABAH and the spectral changes of myeloperoxidase at steady state were recorded using either a Zeiss Specord S-10 or a Beckman DU 7500 diode array spectrophotometer. Oxidation of ABAH was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 325 nm (15Kettle A.J. Gedye C.A. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It was also measured by using HPLC with electrochemical detection. An aliquot of the reaction system (10 μl) was injected into a Waters 600E HPLC equipped with a Phenomenex Lunar C18 column (250 × 1.4 mm). ABAH was eluted at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, containing 11% methanol and detected with an ESA Coulachem detector (E 1 100 mV andE 2 500 mV). The activity of myeloperoxidase was determined by measuring the rate at which it oxidized 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) at 25 °C over the 1st min of the reaction (22Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9349-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 100 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.4, containing 8% dimethylformamide and started by adding 300 μm hydrogen peroxide. The concentration of hydrazide that inhibited myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidation of TMB by 50% (IC50) was determined by fitting a rectangular hyperbola to the dose-response curve using nonlinear regression. To measure residual activity of myeloperoxidase, the enzyme was extracted from reaction systems under conditions that would ensure that any compound III present would decay back to the active enzyme (23Winterbourn C.C. Garcia R.C. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After incubating the hydrazides with myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide, reactions were stopped with 20 μg/ml catalase, and the peroxidase was extracted with 100 μl of CM-Sepharose. This anionic resin was used to separate myeloperoxidase from catalase and other components of the assay. The solution was mixed for 15 min to allow for complete binding of myeloperoxidase to the resin. The samples were spun for 3 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 msodium sulfate was added. Samples were mixed for a further 15 min to wash the resin of unbound protein, centrifuged, and the supernatant removed. Finally, 1 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sodium sulfate was added, and the samples were mixed for 15 min to elute myeloperoxidase. The samples were spun at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and myeloperoxidase activity in the supernatants was measured using the 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine assay. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to test the strength of association between two variables. The strength of the association is given by the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (r), and it was considered significant when p < 0.05. The instability of the redox intermediates of myeloperoxidase made it necessary to use the sequential mixing stopped-flow technique to determine the rate constants for their reactions with reducing substrates. Premixing of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide led to compound I formation within several milliseconds (not shown) and allowed the measurement of the rate of its subsequent reaction with an electron donor after a defined delay time (40 ms). The reaction of ferric myeloperoxidase with hydrogen peroxide to form compound I was measured at 426 nm and its bimolecular rate constant (k 1) was derived from a plot ofk obs versus varied peroxide concentrations (not shown). It was calculated to be (1.4 ± 0.2) × 107m−1 s−1 at 15 °C (the temperature used in the presteady-state experiments), which is in accordance with previously published values (20Bolscher B.G.J.M. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Marquez L.A. Huang J.T. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the reduction of compound I were followed at 456 nm, which is the isosbestic point between the ferric enzyme and compound I and the absorbance maximum for compound II formation (21Marquez L.A. Huang J.T. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1447-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Kinetic traces for the reduction of compound I by substituted benzoic acid hydrazides displayed single exponential character. A typical trace for ABAH is shown in the inset of Fig.1 A. The pseudo-first order rate constants at pH 7.0 (k obs) were obtained from these traces and plotted against the concentration of the benzoic acid hydrazide (Fig. 1 A). Slopes of these secondary plots yielded the apparent second order rate constants (k 3) (see TableI). The magnitudes of these rate constants varied by less than a factor of 3 and are some of the largest ever measured for reduction of compound I by organic substrates.Table IRate constants for the reactions of substituted benzoic acid hydrazides with myeloperoxidase and their IC50 values for inhibition of peroxidase activitySubstituted BAHk 3k 4IC50× 106m−1 s−1× 103m−1 s−1μm4-Amino-BAH3.34 ± 0.06645.8 ± 22.524-Hydroxy-BAH3.34 ± 0.05149.35 ± 0.89184-Methoxy-BAH2.70 ± 0.1127.10 ± 0.5418BAH1.32 ± 0.0917.40 ± 1.50423-Methoxy-BAH1.68 ± 0.011.18 ± 0.71254-Chloro-BAH1.80 ± 0.069.51 ± 0.062503-Nitro-BAH1.51 ± 0.121.80 ± 0.61ND4-Nitro-BAH1.33 ± 0.031.27 ± 0.57NDThe rate constants for reduction of compound I (k 3) and compound II (k 4) by substituted benzoic acid hydrazides (BAH) were determined as outlined in Figs. 1 and 2. The concentration of BAH that gave 50% inhibition (IC50) of the oxidation of 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine by myeloperoxidase was determined as shown in Fig. 8 A. Open table in a new tab The rate constants for reduction of compound I (k 3) and compound II (k 4) by substituted benzoic acid hydrazides (BAH) were determined as outlined in Figs. 1 and 2. The concentration of BAH that gave 50% inhibition (IC50) of the oxidation of 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine by myeloperoxidase was determined as shown in Fig. 8 A. Reaction of compound I with the substituted benzoic acid hydrazides conformed to the Hammett equation (Equation 1), wherek 3,0 is the rate constant for the unsubstituted derivative; ρ is the constant for the reaction; and ς is a constant characteristic of each substituent (24March J. Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reaction Mechanisms and Structure. McGraw-Hill Inc., Tokyo1977: 273-286Google Scholar).log(k3/k3,0)=ςρEquation 1 A positive value for ς indicates an electron-withdrawing group, and a negative value indicates an electron-donating group. We have plotted Brown-Okamoto ς+ values, which were devised for electron-donating groups that can interact with a developing positive charge in the transition state. These constants gave a better correlation than the original ς values (Fig. 1 B). The correlation coefficient r was −0.92 (p = 0.001; n = 8) for ς+ and −0.84 (p = 0.009) for ς. The value of ρ, obtained from the slope of Fig. 1 B, was −0.21, which indicates that the electronic character of the substituents has only small effect on the oxidation of reducing substrates by compound I. There was a finite intercept for the plot ofk obs versus the concentration of ABAH (Fig. 1 A). This intercept was seen with all the hydrazides and was independent of the nature of the substrate (not shown). It indicates the rate of spontaneous reduction of compound I by excess hydrogen peroxide. The value we obtained (4.5 ± 1.7 s−1 (n = 8)) is in good agreement with that determined previously (2.2 ± 1.2 s−1) (25Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Determination of rate constants for the reduction of compound II by benzoic acid hydrazides is problematic. Previously, they have been measured using transient state conditions whereby compound II is formed by adding a 50-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide to myeloperoxidase (25Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, with excess hydrogen peroxide the enzyme is likely to cycle when the reducing substrate is added. Therefore, steady-state methods have been employed to measure the rate of reduction of compound II (22Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9349-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This latter approach is not possible with the benzoic acid hydrazides because they inactivate myeloperoxidase during their oxidation. Therefore, we compared two pre-steady-state strategies for investigating the reduction of compound II. Either a 50-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide was added to the native enzyme (25Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) or a 10-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide plus a sub-stoichiometric concentration of homovanillic acid was added. Both approaches gave approximately the same absorbance amplitudes at 456 nm for the formation of compound II within 20 s of mixing. Using the sequential mixing mode, similar bimolecular rate constants (k 4) were calculated using these two strategies. However, the amplitude of the decrease in absorbance at 456 nm was much smaller when a 50-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide was used. This demonstrates that a large excess of hydrogen peroxide was less useful in guaranteeing pre-steady-state conditions. Consequently, we premixed a 10-fold excess of hydrogen peroxide and sub-stoichiometric concentrations of homovanillic acid to generate compound II, and we then followed its reactions with the various hydrazides. In each case, the loss of absorbance at 456 nm displayed single exponential character. A typical time trace for the reaction of ABAH with compound II is shown in the inset of Fig.2 A. The apparent second order rate constants for the reduction of compound II (k 4) were obtained from secondary plots of thek obs values versus the concentration of the hydrazides (Table I). The secondary plot for ABAH is shown in Fig. 2 A. The magnitudes of the rate constants varied by as much as 600-fold. They differed from those obtained for compound I by as little as a factor of 5 for ABAH and as much as 1000-fold for 4-nitrobenzoic acid hydrazide. The Hammett plot, in which ς+ values were used, demonstrated that there is a larger substituent effect for reduction of compound II by the hydrazides than for compound I (Fig. 2 B). The value of ρ was −1.21 (r = −0.92; p = 0.001). With the exception of ABAH, the intercepts on the ordinate for the secondary plots were small (0.13 ± 0.09 s−1, not shown). However, k off for ABAH was 1.67 ± 0.67 s−1. This would normally suggest a reversible reaction (25Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30434-30440Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, it most probably reflects formation of compound III, which was demonstrated to occur during the same time scale as compound II reduction (see Fig. 9). Oxidation of ABAH by compound II displayed a broad pH optimum between 5 and 7 (Fig.3).Figure 3The pH profile for reduction of compound II by ABAH. Conditions were as described in Fig. 2 except that the concentration of compound II was 1 μm heme, and ABAH was present at 10 μm. The buffers used were sodium acetate (100 mm, pH 4, 5, and 6) and sodium/potassium phosphate (100 mm, pH 6–8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previously it was reported that myeloperoxidase requires hydrogen peroxide to catalyze oxidation of ABAH. We confirmed this result by showing that the initial rate of oxidation of 1 mm ABAH by 100 nmmyeloperoxidase in the absence of hydrogen peroxide was only 3% of that in the presence of 50 μm hydrogen peroxide (results not shown). Oxidation of ABAH was most favored at pH 4 but also had a broad pH optimum between 7 and 8.5 (Fig.4). In accordance with the earlier proposal that oxygen protects the enzyme from inactivation, we found that there was progressively more oxidation of ABAH and a longer time until the enzyme was inactivated when the atmosphere was changed from nitrogen to air to oxygen (not shown). In the absence of added hydrogen peroxide, ABAH was still oxidized by myeloperoxidase and, even though the reaction was slow, more ABAH was eventually oxidized than with hydrogen peroxide present (Fig.5). This situation arose because there was virtually no enzyme inactivation in the absence of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, with 100 μm hydrogen peroxide, the enzyme was inactivated within 5 min. The spectral changes of the oxidation products of ABAH that were observed in the absence of hydrogen peroxide were identical to those recorded in its presence (not shown). This result indicat"

Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1990: 15-30Crossref Google Scholar). Ganglioside synthesis is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases, and the combination of expression levels of various glycosyltransferase genes determines characteristic patterns of ganglioside expression (5Pohlentz G.

Among the gangliosides, GM3 is the simplest, having only three sugars, and is widely distributed in all over the body of vertebrates (1$$Google Scholar). Because GM3 is a precursor for all other ganglioside series gangliosides and hematosides (7Iber H. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), its biosynthesis strongly affects the levels of the more complex gangliosides.Recent progress in the molecular cloning of glycosyl-transferase genes responsible for the synthesis of gangliosides has enabled us and other investigators to analyze the regulatory mechanisms for the ganglioside expression and biological functions of them by manipulation of those genes to modify the ganglioside profiles in cultured cells and in experimental animals (9Lloyd K.O. Furukawa K. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, we have isolated genes encoding ganglioside GM2/GD21synthase (10Nagata Y. Yamashiro S.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have also established gene knock-out mice lines in which all complex ganglioside series gangliosides are genetically eliminated in the whole body (15Takamiya K. Yamamoto A. Furukawa K. Yamashiro S. Shin M. Okada M. Fukumoto S. Haraguchi M. Takeda N. Fujimura K. Sakae M. Kishikawa M. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10662-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The resulting phenotypic changes in those mutant mice pose new questions about the substitutive roles of simpler ganglioside structures (e.g. GM3 and GD3) for the eliminated complex gangliosides.In the present study, we isolated a mouse cDNA clone that determines expression of ganglioside GM3 and have analyzed its expression pattern in various tissues. This gene product corresponds to GM3-specific sialyltransferase (CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide α2,3-sialyltransferase, α2,3S-T) (EC 2.4.99.-). Because of the critical role that GM3 synthase plays in the biosynthesis of all gangliosides, this probe will be extremely useful for the analysis of the biological functions of acidic glycosphingolipids.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a cDNA that determines the expression of GM3 and induces α2,3S-T activity in transfected cells. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence indicated the presence of the sialyl motifs, which has been recognized among all mammalian and chicken sialyltransferases cloned so far (26Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this cDNA represents the GM3 synthase gene. Examination of the sequence showed features in common with other α2,3-sialyltransferases. As shown in Fig. 6, the derived GM3 synthase sequence contained a number of characteristic regions commonly detected only in the sequences of ST3Gal α2,3-sialyltransferases (see enclosed boxes in sialyl motif L and S). These regions may be involved in the recognition of acceptor structures. The conserved YPE sequence was also noted by Sasaki in a recent review (27Sasaki K. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 195-215Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the ST8Sia group showed a common sequence (NPS) in the carboxyl terminus region of the sialyl motif L. This sequence contrasted with the sequence YPE, which was commonly detected among ST3Gal group, supporting the idea that this region might be involved in the acceptor recognition.The properties of the GM3 synthase predicted from the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3, A and B) and demonstrated by the analysis with extracts from cDNA-transfected cells were not so different from those of previously purified GM3 synthases. For example,K m for lactosylceramide and CMP-NeuAc of the GM3 synthase expressed in the transfected cells of pM3T-7 were 270 μm and 313 μm, respectively (data not shown). These values were of similar magnitude to the results of Preusset al. (28Preuss U. Gu X. Gu T. Yu R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26273-26278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. 80 μm(K m for lactosylceramide) and 210 μm(K m for CMP-NeuAc), respectively. High specificity for lactosyl-ceramide was also similar, although a few acceptors besides lactosylceramide also showed low levels of activity in their results. On the other hand, the predicted molecular mass of the enzyme was 41,244 Da, whereas that in their paper was 76 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This discrepancy might be partially due to the glycosylation of the enzyme protein. Actually, the predicted amino acid sequence contained three possible sites ofN-glycosylation (Fig. 3 A). Otherwise, differences of the tissues and species used as sources of mRNA and enzymes need to be considered.Among gangliosides, GM3 has the simplest carbohydrate structure and is located at the starting point of the synthesis of all ganglioside series gangliosides. Almost all mammalian tissues and cells contain GM3 (1$$Google Scholar), suggesting its important biological role. Moreover, a number of studies have shown that GM3 functions in the regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (29Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor (30Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 1993; 100: 841-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and in the promotion of the differentiation of HL60 leukemia cells (37Nojiri H. Takaku F. Terui Y. Miura Y. Saito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recently, Yamamuraet al. (38Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that GM3 co-localized with various signaling molecules such as c-Src and a low molecular GTP-binding protein Rho on the cell surface of B16 forming a glycolipid-enriched microdomain. Therefore, GM3 itself might play important roles at diverse situations for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Following the isolation of the GM3 synthase gene, the effects of GM3 endogenously generated in the cells can be studied to confirm the possible functions described above. Moreover, human cDNA of GM3 synthase has recently been cloned by Ishii et al. (39Ishii A. Ohta M. Watanabe Y. Sakoe K. Nakamura M. Inokuchi J. Sanai Y. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31652-31655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), enabling us to analyze the regulatory mechanisms of leukocyte differentiation by gangliosides.Besides the importance of GM3 itself, α2,3S-T is also important, because it can regulate the amount of all gangliosides in particular tissues and cells. For example, although a majority of human melanoma cells characteristically express ganglioside GD3, they also express very high level of GM3. The high GD2 expression in neuroblastoma cells is also partly based on the high expression of GM3. Because GM3 expression is ubiquitous, its importance is often not appreciated. However, the quantity of GM3 is quite different among different normal tissues and various tumor cells. GM3 seems to control the expression levels of more specific and complex gangliosides by adjusting the amounts of precursor structures. Therefore, the mechanisms for the regulation of the gene expression of α2,3S-T are of great importance and interest.Mammalian brain tissues usually express low levels of GM3 compared with the level of complex gangliosides. However, the actual synthesis of GM3 should be much higher than expected from the amount of GM3, because all complex ganglioside series gangliosides are synthesized through GM3. Results of Northern blotting clearly indicated that GM3 synthesis takes place most actively in the brain among the normal tissues tested (Fig.5). During the study of substrate specificity of the cloned α2,3S-T, we found that GD1b specifically inhibited the synthesis of GM3 with endogenous acceptor lactosylceramide in membrane preparations (data not shown). This fact indicates that later members of the biosynthetic pathway (GD1b in this case) may regulate α2,3S-T activity by a feedback mechanism in the brain tissue. The regulatory mechanisms of GM3 expression at the levels of gene expression and post-translation are presently being investigated. Gangliosides are acidic, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids and are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells (1$$Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann B. Basu S. Roseman S. Anderson S.M. Volk B.W.

Among gangliosides, GM3 has the simplest carbohydrate structure and is located at the starting point of the synthesis of all ganglioside series gangliosides. Almost all mammalian tissues and cells contain GM3 (1$$Google Scholar), suggesting its important biological role. Moreover, a number of studies have shown that GM3 functions in the regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (29Bremer E.G. Hakomori S. Bowen-Pope D.F. Raines E. Ross R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6818-6825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor (30Bremer E.G. Schlessinger J. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 1993; 100: 841-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and in the promotion of the differentiation of HL60 leukemia cells (37Nojiri H. Takaku F. Terui Y. Miura Y. Saito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 782-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recently, Yamamuraet al. (38Yamamura S. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that GM3 co-localized with various signaling molecules such as c-Src and a low molecular GTP-binding protein Rho on the cell surface of B16 forming a glycolipid-enriched microdomain. Therefore, GM3 itself might play important roles at diverse situations for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Following the isolation of the GM3 synthase gene, the effects of GM3 endogenously generated in the cells can be studied to confirm the possible functions described above. Moreover, human cDNA of GM3 synthase has recently been cloned by Ishii et al. (39Ishii A. Ohta M. Watanabe Y. Sakoe K. Nakamura M. Inokuchi J. Sanai Y. Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31652-31655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), enabling us to analyze the regulatory mechanisms of leukocyte differentiation by gangliosides. Besides the importance of GM3 itself, α2,3S-T is also important, because it can regulate the amount of all gangliosides in particular tissues and cells. For example, although a majority of human melanoma cells characteristically express ganglioside GD3, they also express very high level of GM3. The high GD2 expression in neuroblastoma cells is also partly based on the high expression of GM3. Because GM3 expression is ubiquitous, its importance is often not appreciated. However, the quantity of GM3 is quite different among different normal tissues and various tumor cells. GM3 seems to control the expression levels of more specific and complex gangliosides by adjusting the amounts of precursor structures. Therefore, the mechanisms for the regulation of the gene expression of α2,3S-T are of great importance and interest. Mammalian brain tissues usually express low levels of GM3 compared with the level of complex gangliosides. However, the actual synthesis of GM3 should be much higher than expected from the amount of GM3, because all complex ganglioside series gangliosides are synthesized through GM3. Results of Northern blotting clearly indicated that GM3 synthesis takes place most actively in the brain among the normal tissues tested (Fig.5). During the study of substrate specificity of the cloned α2,3S-T, we found that GD1b specifically inhibited the synthesis of GM3 with endogenous acceptor lactosylceramide in membrane preparations (data not shown). This fact indicates that later members of the biosynthetic pathway (GD1b in this case) may regulate α2,3S-T activity by a feedback mechanism in the brain tissue. The regulatory mechanisms of GM3 expression at the levels of gene expression and post-translation are presently being investigated. We thank Dr. Y. Yoshikai in the Department of Bioprotection at Nagoya University for providing the opportunity to use the flow cytometry machine and Dr. K. O.

V-ATPase activity generates and maintains an acidic pH inside the organelles of the central vacuolar system, including lysosomes, endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, and clathrin-coated vesicles (4Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Its action is also responsible for Ca2+ and pH homeostasis of the cytosolic compartment (6Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is similar in structure and subunit composition to the well described F1F0-ATPase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (7Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). In yeast, the V-ATPase is composed of at least 10 subunits, which range in mass from 17 to 100 kDa (8Kane P.M. Stevens T.H. J.

The mutation affects growth, e.g.increased calcium sensitivity as well as the inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources or in medium buffered at neutral pH (6Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Isolated vacuolar membranes from Saccharomyces vma mutants lack ATPase activity, suggesting an essential role of vacuolar acidification in growth. In Neurospora crassa, attempts have been made to inactivate the VMA1 and VMA2 genes by repeat-induced point mutations (26Bowman B.J. Vazquez-Laslop N. Bowman E.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Ferea T.L. Bowman B.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 147-154PubMed Google Scholar). Strains lacking a functional copy of the VMA1 or VMA2 gene were not viable. Data on the phenotype of filamentous fungi lacking a functional V-ATPase are therefore missing. The filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii (28Guillermond P. Rev. Gen. Bot. 1928; 40 (397–414, 474–485, 555–574, 606–624, 690–704,): 328-342Google Scholar) is used for industrial riboflavin production. Biosynthesis (29Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 215-249Google Scholar), regulation, and production parameters (30Schmidt G. Stahmann K.P. Kaesler B. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 419-426Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have been studied, resulting in well established fermentation processes with a reported maximum yield of 15 g/liter (30Schmidt G. Stahmann K.P. Kaesler B. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 419-426Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Riboflavin production by A. gossypii starts in the late growth phase when septa are formed in the hyphae and vacuoles become visible. Concomitantly, vacuoles begin to accumulate large amounts of riboflavin. The vacuolar compartmentation of metabolites,e.g. amino acids, plays a major role in the regulation of metabolism in fungi in general (31Roos W. Schulze R. Steighardt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15849-15855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the retention of riboflavin in the vacuolar compartment is a crucial factor in riboflavin production by A. gossypii. The present work adresses the compartmentation of metabolites in A. gossypii VMA1disruptants and the resulting redirection of riboflavin fluxes. A. gossypii strain ATCC 10895 mycelium was grown overnight in liquid medium (MA2) consisting of 2 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, 0.6 g/litermyo-inositol (Sigma), and 10 g/liter glucose, pH 6.8, at 28 °C in shaking flasks on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. For compartmentation analysis under production conditions, the producing strain ItaGS01 (30Schmidt G. Stahmann K.P. Kaesler B. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 419-426Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was grown in 10 g/liter soybean oil, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 6 g/liter glycine under the same conditions. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow DNA polymerase I fragment, and other enzymes were purchased from either Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA preparation, restriction enzyme digestions, ligation of DNA fragments, Southern blots, etc., were carried out according to standard techniques (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radioactive labeling of DNA was performed with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow DNA polymerase I fragment (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of A. gossypii spores was done by electroporation (33.Carnicero, E. (1996) Masters Thesis, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.Google Scholar). For PCR,1 a mixture of oligonucleotide primers was used derived from conserved amino acid regions from different Vma1 proteins (see Fig. 1). Oligonucleotides CF1a (5′-ATYCARGTBTAYGARAC-3′) and CF1b (5′-ATVACRGTYTTRCCRCA-3′) were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg). PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 52 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C for 35 cycles) was carried out using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) buffer conditions as recommended by the manufacturer, 8 μm primer CF1a, 4 μm primer CF1b, and the Gene Amp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). Chromosomal A. gossypii DNA as template was prepared according to standard techniques (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The VMA1-PCR fragment amplified using the primers CF1a and CF1b was used to screen anA. gossypii cosmid library in the cosmid vector SuperCos1 (Stratagene). To identify cosmid clones containing homologous regions of DNA, we performed radioactive labeling of DNA with [α-32P]dCTP and the T7 DNA polymerase (34Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Cosmid DNA of the positive clones was cut with BamHI and again probed using the radiolabeled PCR fragment. To obtain smaller fragments of genomic DNA for sequencing, positive DNA fragments were subcloned into the plasmid vector Bluescript (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). DNA sequencing reactions were performed using the dideoxy chain reaction (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) in the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer sequencing system (Perkin-Elmer). Alignments of amino acid sequences were performed with computer programs including the CLUSTAL algorithm (37Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2871) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence is available under the EMBL Data Bank accession numberAJ009881. A VMA1deletion/substitution allele, designatedvma1::g418 was constructed by replacing the 0.25-kb BamHI-PstI fragment in theVMA1 PCR fragment with the geneticin resistance cassetteTEF-G418 (36Steiner S. Wendland J. Wright M.C. Philippsen P. Genetics. 1995; 140: 973-987PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of vacuolar membranes the procedure of Bowman and Bowman (38Bowman E.J. Bowman B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used with some modifications. Vacuoles prepared as described previously (39Förster C. Marienfeld S. Wilhelm R. Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were osmotically lysed by direct suspension into 30 volumes of 1 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris base, and gentle shaken for 10 min at 4 °C, 80 rpm. A vacuolar membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g. The membrane pellet was washed once and collected again by ultracentrifugation. The membrane pellets were suspended in 1 mm EGTA-Tris, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Enzymatic determinations of vacuolar membrane contents were carried out on aliquots subjected to a single freeze-thaw cycle. Vacuolar membrane ATPase was assayed colorimetrically by the release of Pi from ATP. The standard reaction mixture (1000 μl) consisted of 20–25 μg of membrane protein, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKN3, and 20 μm Na3VO4(to inhibit residual mitochondrial ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase, respectively), and 25 mm HEPES buffer adjusted to pH 7.5. The addition of 5 mm Na-ATP to the reaction mixture initiated the assay. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 3 m HClO4 and assayed for Pi by the method of Lanzetta et al. (40Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Acridine orange staining was performed as described (39Förster C. Marienfeld S. Wilhelm R. Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Compartmentation of A. gossypii hyphae was achieved using the permeabilizing agent digitonin as described (39Förster C. Marienfeld S. Wilhelm R. Krämer R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The riboflavin content of the vacuolar and cytosolic hyphal compartments was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Riboflavin was detected at 270 nm (Merck/Hitachil-4200 UV-VIS detector) using a RP 18 125/4 column (Merck), which was developed isocratically with 50 mmNaH2PO4/H3PO4 buffer, pH 3.0, containing 1 mm tetramethylammonium chloride and 12% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. To isolate the AgVMA1 gene, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were derived from two highly conserved regions of Vma1p encoding sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1775-1778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Candida tropicalis (41Gu H.H. Xu J. Gallagher M. Dean G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7372-7381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (42Ghislain M. Bowman E.J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), andN. crassa (43Bowman E.J. Tenney K. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13994-14001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Using these primers in a PCR reaction with chromosomal DNA from A. gossypii as template, a 585-bp DNA fragment was amplified, purified, and cloned into SmaI-digested pUC19 DNA for sequence determination. This fragment was found to contain sequences encoding a polypeptide that exhibited strong similarity to vacuolar ATPase A subunits from different organisms. To isolate a fragment encompassing the entire AgVMA1 gene, the radiolabeled 585-bp PCR fragment was used to probe an A. gossypii cosmid library. The PCR probe hybridized to four independent clones. Restriction analyses with BamHI and a second hybridization with the 585-bp PCR fragment revealed four different sets of overlapping inserts. Two hybridizing BamHI subfragments of approximately 1 and 7 kb were isolated from one of the positive cosmids and cloned into Bluescript SK+ to generate pJR1796 and pJR1797. Its nucleotide sequence was determined in both strands. The nucleotide sequence of a 3440-bpBamHI-SphI fragment contained part of an unidentified open reading frame, AgURF1 (600 bp) and a complete open reading frame (1854 bp), capable of encoding a protein of 617 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 1854-bp open reading frame showed 89% identity with the ScVma1p, 87% identity with the CtVma1p, and more than 60% identity with the SpVma1p and NcVma1p, suggesting that this open reading frame encodes subunit A. We thus designated the gene AgVMA1. Direct evidence for the expression of AgVMA1 came from Northern experiments. Total RNA from exponentially growing cells was fractionated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to the radioactively labeled 585-bp PCR fragment. A single transcript of approximately 2.1 kb, sufficient to accommodate the predicted 617-amino acid polypeptide, was detected (data not shown). Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the AgVMA1 gene for transcriptional signals showed that the 5′-flanking region does not contain the consensus TATAAA sequence, although one copy of the functional variant TATATA was identified beginning at position −237. Downstream of the open reading frame, there were several motifs commonly observed in the 3′ noncoding region of S. cerevisiae and thought to be necessary for transcription termination, processing of the 3′ end, or addition of poly(A) at the 3′ terminus. Thus, two copies of the hexanucleotide TACATA and one copy of the hexanucleotide TATATA that have been implicated in mRNA 3′ end formation in yeast can be recognized 6, 18, and 81 bp after the stop codon (44Russo P. Yeast. 1995; 11: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Translation of the AgVMA1 open reading frame reveals that it codes for an acidic protein (calculated pI, 5.21) of 429 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 67,806 daltons. The ATP-binding site motif A (P-loop) is well conserved in the catalytic subunits of vacuolar ATPases. This motif ((A/G)-X 4-G-K-(S/T)) appears at positions 257–264 in the predicted AgVma1 polypeptide. Genetic and biochemical studies using Vma1p from S. cerevisiae have identified several amino acid residues involved in either enzyme assembly or catalysis. Two cysteine residues (Cys284 and Cys539), one tyrosine residue (Tyr343), and one glycine residue (Gly250) that are conserved in all A subunits sequenced so far and have been shown to be important for the correct folding or stability of the A subunit are also present in theAshbya Vma1p protein (45Liu J.

Likewise, the essential aromatic residues located at the catalytic site Phe452, Tyr532, and Phe538, as well as the acidic Glu286 residue proposed to participate in the hydrolysis of ATP, are all conserved in AgVma1p (46Liu Q.

To study the properties of cells lacking the VMA1 gene product, the VMA1 gene was disrupted by replacing a 0.25-kb fragment with a geneticin resistance marker controlled by promoter and terminator sequences of the A. gossypii TEF gene (kan r cassetteG418) (36Steiner S. Wendland J. Wright M.C. Philippsen P. Genetics. 1995; 140: 973-987PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of only one copy of theVMA1 gene in A. gossypii was determined by restriction analysis with several restriction enzymes and subsequent Southern blotting under conditions of decreasing stringency, using the 585-kb PCR fragment as a probe (data not shown). For the disruption experiment, the NcoI-SpeI fragment of the amplified 585-bp PCR fragment was isolated from pJR1685 and cloned into the polylinker site of a modified pGEM®T vector lacking the PstI site. The gene was disrupted on the plasmid by replacement of the BamHI-PstI fragment (0.25 kb) with the 2-kb TEF-G418 fragment (36Steiner S. Wendland J. Wright M.C. Philippsen P. Genetics. 1995; 140: 973-987PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). Thevma1::G418 fragment was liberated from the plasmid by NcoI-SpeI digestion, and A. gossypii ATCC 10895 spores were transformed by electroporation (33.Carnicero, E. (1996) Masters Thesis, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.Google Scholar), thereby inducing DNA integration by homologous recombination. Homokaryotic G418 r transformants (vma1::G418) were obtained after sporulation and clonal selection of the primary heterokaryoticG418-resistant colonies and subjected to Southern analysis to confirm that the correct gene disruption occurred (Fig.2 B). For S. cerevisiae it has been shown that disruption of the VMA1 gene severely affects growth (20Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The resulting mutants only grow within a narrow pH range around 5.5. Furthermore, mutants did not grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, and sensitivity to high extracellular calcium concentrations has been detected (48Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In A. gossypii, the growth parameters and the final biomass obtained were compared for wild type and disruptant strain with respect to growth on different media (Table I). Generally, the mutant cells had a distinct phenotype. As observed for the parental strain, cells grew in pellets but more dense and less branched (data not shown). Disruption of the VMA1 gene caused an increase in the lag phase from 5 to 12 h, but growth, however, was still possible on MA2 complete medium, pH 6.8. The growth rate of VMA1disruptant cells was decreased by about 50% (Table I). Growth on the nonfermentable carbon source soybean oil was possible and did not exhibit distinct growth parameters (Table I). Because the V-ATPase has an established role in acidifying the vacuolar system, we studied the effect of external pH on growth of the A. gossypii VMA1mutants (Table I). Surprisingly, mutant cells grew better under neutral pH conditions than under acid conditions. Nevertheless, no particular pH value could be found that fully restored growth of the mutant cells. In contrast to the data reported for yeast (6Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), cells were only slightly sensitive to elevated Ca2+ concentrations (100 mm) (Table I). We did not observe formation of generative spores in the disruptant cells, irrespective of using widely ranging pH values and Ca2+ concentrations in the media used, of carbon source supplied, neither in liquid nor in solid media.Table IGrowth parameters of parental strain (VMA1) and disruptant (VMA1::G418) of the wild type on different mediaStrainMediumDry weight yield after 30 hLag phaseGrowth rate μg/literhh−1VMA1MA2, pH 7.55.8 ± 0.205.2 ± 0.50.47 ± 0.03MA2, pH 6.85.7 ± 0.205.0 ± 0.50.48 ± 0.04MA2, pH 5.35.3 ± 0.305.6 ± 1.00.42 ± 0.07MA2, 100 mm Ca2+6.1 ± 0.205.1 ± 0.60.48 ± 0.0410 g/liter soybean oil, 10 g/liter yeast extract6.5 ± 0.345.0 ± 0.50.50 ± 0.04VMA1::G418MA2, pH 7.56.2 ± 0.2512.5 ± 1.50.30 ± 0.06MA2, pH 6.85.7 ± 0.2712.5 ± 1.60.27 ± 0.05MA2, pH 6.25.4 ± 0.4010.0 ± 1.00.33 ± 0.03MA2, pH 5.95.8 ± 0.437.5 ± 0.70.37 ± 0.02MA2, pH 5.64.7 ± 0.4212.0 ± 1.20.16 ± 0.03MA2, pH 5.34.2 ± 0.6012.0 ± 2.10.12 ± 0.05MA2, 100 mm Ca2+4.6 ± 0.3012.5 ± 1.90.28 ± 0.0410 g/liter soybean oil, 10 g/liter yeast extract6.3 ± 0.3212.0 ± 1.50.30 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab A qualitative assay of vacuolar pH was employed to prove the acidification defect of the VMA1 disruptants. Cells were labeled with acridine orange, a fluorescent dye that is trapped within acid compartments (49Cononico P.G. Bird J.W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The failure to acidify vacuoles in the disruptant strains was indicated by the lack of acridine orange accumulation in vacuoles as detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.3). By phase contrast microscopy it could be shown that vacuoles of the VMA1 disruptants are of the same size und number as vacuoles of the wild type. To further confirm the loss of V-ATPase activity in vacuolar membranes of theVMA1 disruptants, we isolated a membrane fraction from highly purified vacuoles. Severe osmotic shock was employed to lyse the vacuoles and to release soluble contents. Vacuolar membrane preparations contained comparable amounts of protein (approximately 0.1 mg of protein/g of mycelium wet weight). Vacuolar membranes prepared from wild type vacuoles hydrolyzed ATP with specific activities of 1.1 μmol/min·mg protein at pH 7.5. In vacuolar membranes isolated from the vma1 mutant cells, however, no vacuolar membrane H+-ATPase activity was observed, which proved the dysfunctionality of the V-ATPase due to disruption of theVMA1 gene. Table IIsummarizes the intracellular compartmentation of the amino acids glycine, lysine, and arginine, which have been shown in S. cerevisiae to be predominantly located in the vacuole (50Messenguy F. Colin D. TenHave J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We compared the amino acid distribution of wild type cells in the absence and presence of 5 μm concanamycin A (51Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and in the disruptant strain. Our results confirm the findings on amino acid distribution in S. cerevisiae (50Messenguy F. Colin D. TenHave J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for A. gossypii. Inhibition of the vacuolar H+-ATPase with concanamycin A strongly diminished the vacuolar accumulation of these amino acids, leading to redirection of 80% of the vacuolar glycine pool, 94% of the vacuolar lysine pool, and all of the vacuolar arginine into the medium (Table II). In the disruptant strains, the redirection was found to be even more pronounced: 90% of the glycine, 96% of the lysine, and 100% of the vacuolar arginine were found in the medium, respectively. Our results thereby confirm an essential role of the V-ATPase in the vacuolar compartmentation of amino acids.Table IIRelative comparmentation of amino acids in dependence of V-ATPase activityCompartmentation of amino acidsCompartmentationaValues referred to dry weight.Wild typeWild type, 5 μm concanamycin AVMA1::G418% of total contentGlycineCytosol8.5 ± 2.520.0 ± 2.312 ± 1.7Vacuole47.9 ± 2.39.5 ± 1.25 ± 1.3Medium43.6 ± 2.870.5 ± 5.083 ± 4.8LysineCytosol9.1 ± 1.311.1 ± 1.614 ± 4.0Vacuole31.3 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.7Medium59.6 ± 0.887.6 ± 1.084 ± 0.4ArginineCytosolNDbND, below detection limit of 1 μm.NDNDVacuole37 ± 7.0NDNDMedium63 ± 13.0100 ± 10.0100 ± 8.0a Values referred to dry weight.b ND, below detection limit of 1 μm. Open table in a new tab During riboflavin production, effective accumulation of this vitamin into the vacuole, partly forming riboflavin crystals in this compartment, could be observed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). From a total production of 140 μmol/mg deionized water, 55 μmol/mg deionized water was retained in the vacuolar compartment in the parental strain ItaGS01 (Fig. 4). By inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase with concanamycin A, redirection of riboflavin fluxes could be detected, and the entire product was excreted into the medium (Fig. 4). To construct a production strain with a dysfunctional V-ATPase, the VMA1 gene of the riboflavin producer strain ItaGS01 (30Schmidt G. Stahmann K.P. Kaesler B. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 419-426Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was disrupted as described. Compartmentation analysis showed that, as described for amino acids, an effective redirection of riboflavin fluxes toward the medium took place (Fig. 4). The vacuolar system is a vital metabolic compartment in fungal cells. The physiological function of the H+-ATPase in the vacuolar membrane is not yet entirely understood. In yeast, its action gives rise to a low vacuolar pH value of 5.5–6.2 and an electrochemical proton potential of approximately 180 mV (19Preston R.A. Murphy R.F. Jones E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7027-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 52Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The energy of the proton potential is used for the vacuolar compartmentation of metabolites, e.g. basic amino acids (53Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as for other energy requiring processes, e.g.protein sorting (54Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Disruption of the genes encoding vacuolar membrane ATPase subunits has been shown to be lethal in N. crassa (24.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar, 25.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) and conditionally impaires cell growth in S. cerevisiae (15Nelson H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae vma mutants still grow in a medium of pH 5.5, which led to the suggestion that acidification of the vacuolar system by equilibration with the external medium occurs by fluid phase endocytosis (55Riezman H. Cell. 1985; 40: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Consequently, the phenotype of cells lacking a functional vacuolar ATPase has only been examined in S. cerevisiae. In the present work, with A. gossypii VMA1 disruptants we describe the first viable VMA disruptant in yeast and fungi that does not display the conditionally lethalvma − phenotype. Several results indicate that AgVMA1 encodes subunit A, namely (i) the similarity of the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene to other Vma1 proteins, (ii) the observation that disruption of the chromosomal VMA1 gene resulted in a dysfunctional vacuole, and (iii) the fact that no vacuolar H+-ATPase activity was determined in vacuolar membranes from vma − strains. The predicted amino acid sequence of subunit A was found to be highly similar to those of the catalytic subunits of other yeast and fungi. The construction of a dendrogram of vacuolar membrane ATPase subunit A proteins (Vma1p) shows that Vma1p from A. gossypii is the subunit A most closely related to Vma1p from S. cerevisiae. Lower but still significant similarity to β-subunits F0F1-ATPases is also observed. The molecular mass of subunit A was calculated to be about 68 kDa, which corresponds to the size of other Vma1 proteins (6Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Homologous regions in Vma1p from S. cerevisiae contain several residues that have been proven to be important for correct folding or stability of the A subunit and to participate in the hydrolysis of ATP in S. cerevisiae, respectively (56Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even with high identity to ScVma1p, the gene encoding A. gossypii subunit A does not comprise an intein sequence as observed in S. cerevisiae (57Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.-Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22159-22168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and C. tropicalis (58Gu H.H. Xu J. Gallagher M. Dean G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7372-7381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, the vacuolar ATPase proved not to be essential for viability in A. gossypii, i.e. cells could adapt to the loss of V-ATPase function. In disruptant strains the vacuolar accumulation of metabolites, e.g. amino acids, was bypassed by excretion into the growth medium. This might also be valid for the sequestration of toxic substances and for the accumulation of calcium. An important physiological role of the vacuole is protein turnover and targeting; consequently, the vacuole contains a large number of membrane-bound and soluble hydrolases (59Van Den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Proteins are delivered to the vacuole through an endosomal intermediate (54Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 60Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10185-10188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is known for a subset of proteins that transit to the vacuole via the secretory pathway that their secretion is achieved by an alternative pathway, bypassing the endosome (61Horazdovsky B.F. Cowles C.R. Mustol P. Holmes M. Emr S.D. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33607-33615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It may be thus concluded in view of the adaptation of A. gossypii to the loss of V-ATPase activity that an alternative pathway of proteins into the vacuole might be present, too. Although growth was possible, we never observed sporulation in the A. gossypiidisruptant strains. From studies with S. cerevisiae it is known that sporulation requires the formation of a prospore membrane (62Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The synthesis of this membrane takes place in a developmentally regulated branch of the secretory pathway in the vacuolar system in yeast (9Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 62Neiman A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), thus rendering VMA disruptants unable to sporulate. We further studied compartmentation of amino acids between the cytosol and the vacuolar space in A. gossypii wild type strain in the absence and presence of concanamycin A as well as inVMA1 disruptants. Similar to yeast (51Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), compartment analysis in A. gossypii cells showed significant vacuolar amino acid pools. In filamentous fungi, the confinement of amino acids into different orangelles might have an important regulatory role,e.g. to avoid catabolism of these compounds when biosynthetic need exists (63Weiss R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though excretion of amino acids in the disruptant strains deprives the cell of reusable storage of these compounds, it might be crucial for the ability of cells to adapt to the loss of V-ATPase function. As a biotechnologically important product, A. gossypiiexcretes riboflavin. At the same time, a significant part of the product is retained in the vacuolar compartment. Inhibition of the vacuolar ATPase with concanamycin A, as well as disruption of theVMA1 gene, prevented accumulation of riboflavin in the vacuoles of A. gossypii. Instead, the product was completely excreted into the medium. These results strongly indicate that the vacuolar accumulation of riboflavin depends on the action of the V-ATPase by using the electrochemical proton potential across the vacuolar membrane. With the disruptant cells from strain ItaGS01, a new production strain with an effective redirection of riboflavin flux into the medium has therefore been designed. We thank H. Sahm for continuous and generous support. We are grateful to O. Zelder (BASF AG), I. Maeting and K.-P. Stahmann (Forschungszentrum Jülich), and B. J. Bowman (University of California) for helpful discussions and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W1963817811,"We have recently shown by deletion mutation analysis that the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI) are essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding (Shi, J., Zhu, H., Arvidson, D. N., Cregg, J. M., and Woldegiorgis, G. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 11033–11038). To identify specific residue(s) involved in malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI, we constructed two more deletion mutants, Δ12 and Δ6, and three substitution mutations within the conserved first six amino acid residues. Mutant L-CPTI, lacking either the first six N-terminal amino acid residues or with a change of glutamic acid 3 to alanine, was expressed at steady-state levels similar to wild type and had near wild type catalytic activity. However, malonyl-CoA inhibition of these mutant enzymes was reduced 100-fold, and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding was lost. A mutant L-CPTI with a change of histidine 5 to alanine caused only partial loss of malonyl-CoA inhibition, whereas a mutant L-CPTI with a change of glutamine 6 to alanine had wild type properties. These results demonstrate that glutamic acid 3 and histidine 5 are necessary for malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI by malonyl-CoA but are not required for catalysis. We have recently shown by deletion mutation analysis that the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI) are essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding (Shi, J., Zhu, H., Arvidson, D.

As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation, CPTI is regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of the regulation of CPTI by malonyl-CoA is important in the design of drugs for control of excessive fatty acid oxidation in diabetes mellitus (10Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and in myocardial ischemia where accumulation of acylcarnitines has been associated with arrhythmias (11Corr P.B.

Using this system, we demonstrated conclusively that L-CPTI and M-CPTI are active, distinct, malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTIs that are reversibly inactivated by detergents. We recently showed that deletion of the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat L-CPTI abolishes malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed and characterized rat L-CPTI deletion mutants of the first 12 and 6 N-terminal amino acid residues. To identify specific residue(s) involved in malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI, we also constructed three substitution mutations within the conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acid residues (Glu3 → Ala, His5 → Ala, and Gln6 → Ala).DISCUSSIONTo determine the role of the first 130 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat L-CPTI in malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, we previously constructed a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that a mutant lacking the first conserved 18 N-terminal amino acid residues had activity and kinetic properties similar to those of wild type L-CPTI but had completely lost malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity binding (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on these previous studies (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we report here on deletion mutations of the conserved first 12 and 6 N-terminal residues of L-CPTI. Like Δ18, Δ12 and Δ6 had 60–70% of the wild type activity and showed loss of both malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding, indicating that residue(s) essential for malonyl-CoA binding and sensitivity reside within the conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids. Of these conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids, including the start codon Met, residues 2 and 4 are Ala, residue 3 is Glu, residue 5 is His, and residue 6 is Gln. Therefore, we constructed mutants with substitutions of Glu3 with Ala, His5 with Ala, and Gln6 with Ala of L-CPTI.The mutant L-CPTI with a replacement of Glu3 with Ala had a phenotype similar to that of the N-terminal deletion mutants. The mutation resulted in complete loss of malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding and a decrease in the low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. In contrast, substitution of Glu3 with Ala did not have a significant effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme, because there was no change in the K m value for palmitoyl-CoA and only a slight increase in theK m value for carnitine. The 29–40% loss in catalytic activity observed with the deletion and point mutants compared with the wild type could be due to a reduction in the expression level or lack of interaction of the N-terminal domain with the catalytic domain as a result of the N-terminal mutations. A protein of the expected size (88 kDa) was detected in the mitochondria of the Glu3 → Ala mutant strain on immunoblotting with L-CPTI specific antibodies. These results demonstrate clearly that Glu3 in the wild type L-CPTI is essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding but not for catalysis, because the kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme are virtually indistinguishable from those of the wild type. This is the first report to demonstrate the critical role of Glu3 residue of L-CPTI for malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding.The high affinity site (K D1,B max1) for binding of malonyl-CoA to L-CPTI was completely abolished in the Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18 mutants, suggesting that the >100-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in these mutants was due to the loss of the high affinity binding entity of the enzyme. Although low affinity malonyl-CoA binding was weakened, there was no change in theB max2 value between wild type L-CPTI and mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, suggesting that the residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in the mutants was due to the low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding entity of the enzyme. The results of this study provide strong evidence implicating Glu3 as one of the residues involved in high affinity malonyl-CoA binding. We hypothesize that the Glu3 → Ala substitution may disrupt a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to a residue near the active site of CPTI. As the high affinity site is abolished and binding to the low affinity site is weakened, the two sites may partially overlap. Alternatively, the possible loss of a salt bridge may weaken K D2 indirectly.Replacement of His5 with Ala had a much less drastic effect on the IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition of L-CPTI but severely diminished both high and low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. TheB max1 for this mutant showed a slight increase, but B max2 showed a significant decrease compared with the wild type value, suggesting that the 10-fold lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition observed with this mutant, compared with mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, may be due to a slight increase in abundance of the high affinity binding entity with a lowered (100-fold) affinity for malonyl-CoA. The decrease in low affinity malonyl-CoA binding observed for the His5→ Ala mutant (∼15-fold increase in K D2) may be due, in part, to the decreased abundance of the low affinity binding entity of the enzyme (∼3-fold decrease in B max2). Because mutation of His5 → Ala reduced the malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, L-CPTI may be affected by pH. A pH-induced shift in malonyl-CoA sensitivity has been reported for CPTI (25Stephens T.W. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Our data clearly demonstrate that there are two classes of malonyl-CoA-binding sites in L-CPTI, namely, a high affinity and a low affinity binding site, similar to earlier studies in isolated rat liver and heart mitochondria (26Mills S.E.

J. 1984; 222: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A previous attempt to express a mutant L-CPTI that lacked the first 82 N-terminal residues was described by Brown et al. (28Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but results were inconclusive due to extremely low expression levels (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity shown by the deletion mutants is similar to that observed with yeast-expressed CPTII (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that for these mutants malonyl-CoA may inhibit via direct interaction with the active site. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the active site acts as a low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding site, but our data suggest that there may be some overlap between the malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA binding sites. In the absence of malonyl-CoA, free CoA (50 μm) and acetyl-CoA (500 μm) inhibited the activities of both the wild type and the Glu3 → Ala mutant L-CPTI by 50%. 2J. Shi, H. Zhu, D. N. Arvidson, and G. Woldegiorgis, unpublished observation.Because a total loss of the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding site was observed in the Glu3 → Ala mutant, the results suggest that CoA and acetyl-CoA inhibit by binding to the active site or the low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding site. At high concentrations, both CoA and the substrate palmitoyl-CoA reduce the inhibition of L-CPTI by malonyl-CoA (18Bremer J. Woldegiorgis G. Schalinske K. Shrago E. Biochim. Biophys.

Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A more recent detailed deletion mutation analysis study of the 129 N-terminal amino acid residues of the yeast-expressed L-CPTI from our laboratory clearly demonstrated that residues critical for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding of L-CPTI are located within the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of the enzyme (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that glutamic acid residue 3 and histidine 5 are essential for malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition.Limited proteolysis of intact and outer membrane preparations of rat liver mitochondria result in a marked loss in L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Kashfi K. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), accompanied by the cleavage of the extreme N terminus (<1 kDa) of L-CPTI (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mitochondria isolated from fasted and diabetic rat livers, metabolic conditions with increased fatty acid oxidation, exhibit increased L-CPTI activity and decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin reverses the effects of diabetes on L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fasting and diabetes, metabolic conditions that enhance protein degradation, reduce the sensitivity of CPTI to malonyl-CoA inhibition (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kashfi K. Biochem.

The L-CPTI gene in INS-1 cells may be an early response gene like c-fos (35Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Roche E. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme may be subject to metabolic regulation by proteolysis (36Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), employing the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome system (36Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Diabetes is a pathophysiologic condition associated with increased protein degradation, fatty acid oxidation, CPTI activity, and decreased malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPTI (33Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kashfi K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus limited in vivo proteolysis of L-CPTI induced by diabetes, such as cleavage of the first 6 N-terminal residues, may decrease malonyl-CoA sensitivity and alter the normal control of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Insulin inhibits proteasome activity resulting in decreased cellular protein degradation and controlled fatty acid oxidation (8Hamel F.G. Bennett R.G. Harmon K.S. Duckworth W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We are currently conducting in vitro partial proteolysis studies with yeast-expressed L-CPTI to determine the role of protein degradation on malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI)1 catalyzes the conversion of long chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitines in the presence ofl-carnitine, the first reaction in the transport of long chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria, a rate-limiting step in β-oxidation (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Mammalian tissues express two isoforms of CPTI, a liver isoform (L-CPTI) and a heart/skeletal muscle isoform (M-CPTI), that are 62% identical in amino acid sequence (GenBankTM accession number U62317; Refs. 3Weis B.C.

Acta. 1996; 1307: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation, CPTI is regulated by its physiological inhibitor malonyl-CoA (1Bieber L.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, suggesting coordinated control of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the regulation of CPTI by malonyl-CoA is important in the design of drugs for control of excessive fatty acid oxidation in diabetes mellitus (10Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and in myocardial ischemia where accumulation of acylcarnitines has been associated with arrhythmias (11Corr P.B. Yamada K.A. Herz. 1995; 20: 156-168PubMed Google Scholar). We developed a novel high level expression system for rat L-CPTI and human heart M-CPTI in the yeast Pichia pastoris, an organism devoid of endogenous CPT activity (6Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

Commun. 1997; 239: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using this system, we demonstrated conclusively that L-CPTI and M-CPTI are active, distinct, malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTIs that are reversibly inactivated by detergents. We recently showed that deletion of the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat L-CPTI abolishes malonyl-CoA inhibition and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we have constructed and characterized rat L-CPTI deletion mutants of the first 12 and 6 N-terminal amino acid residues. To identify specific residue(s) involved in malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition of L-CPTI, we also constructed three substitution mutations within the conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acid residues (Glu3 → Ala, His5 → Ala, and Gln6 → Ala). DISCUSSIONTo determine the role of the first 130 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat L-CPTI in malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, we previously constructed a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that a mutant lacking the first conserved 18 N-terminal amino acid residues had activity and kinetic properties similar to those of wild type L-CPTI but had completely lost malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity binding (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on these previous studies (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we report here on deletion mutations of the conserved first 12 and 6 N-terminal residues of L-CPTI. Like Δ18, Δ12 and Δ6 had 60–70% of the wild type activity and showed loss of both malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding, indicating that residue(s) essential for malonyl-CoA binding and sensitivity reside within the conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids. Of these conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids, including the start codon Met, residues 2 and 4 are Ala, residue 3 is Glu, residue 5 is His, and residue 6 is Gln. Therefore, we constructed mutants with substitutions of Glu3 with Ala, His5 with Ala, and Gln6 with Ala of L-CPTI.The mutant L-CPTI with a replacement of Glu3 with Ala had a phenotype similar to that of the N-terminal deletion mutants. The mutation resulted in complete loss of malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding and a decrease in the low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. In contrast, substitution of Glu3 with Ala did not have a significant effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme, because there was no change in the K m value for palmitoyl-CoA and only a slight increase in theK m value for carnitine. The 29–40% loss in catalytic activity observed with the deletion and point mutants compared with the wild type could be due to a reduction in the expression level or lack of interaction of the N-terminal domain with the catalytic domain as a result of the N-terminal mutations. A protein of the expected size (88 kDa) was detected in the mitochondria of the Glu3 → Ala mutant strain on immunoblotting with L-CPTI specific antibodies. These results demonstrate clearly that Glu3 in the wild type L-CPTI is essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding but not for catalysis, because the kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme are virtually indistinguishable from those of the wild type. This is the first report to demonstrate the critical role of Glu3 residue of L-CPTI for malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding.The high affinity site (K D1,B max1) for binding of malonyl-CoA to L-CPTI was completely abolished in the Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18 mutants, suggesting that the >100-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in these mutants was due to the loss of the high affinity binding entity of the enzyme. Although low affinity malonyl-CoA binding was weakened, there was no change in theB max2 value between wild type L-CPTI and mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, suggesting that the residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in the mutants was due to the low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding entity of the enzyme. The results of this study provide strong evidence implicating Glu3 as one of the residues involved in high affinity malonyl-CoA binding. We hypothesize that the Glu3 → Ala substitution may disrupt a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to a residue near the active site of CPTI. As the high affinity site is abolished and binding to the low affinity site is weakened, the two sites may partially overlap. Alternatively, the possible loss of a salt bridge may weaken K D2 indirectly.Replacement of His5 with Ala had a much less drastic effect on the IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition of L-CPTI but severely diminished both high and low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. TheB max1 for this mutant showed a slight increase, but B max2 showed a significant decrease compared with the wild type value, suggesting that the 10-fold lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition observed with this mutant, compared with mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, may be due to a slight increase in abundance of the high affinity binding entity with a lowered (100-fold) affinity for malonyl-CoA. The decrease in low affinity malonyl-CoA binding observed for the His5→ Ala mutant (∼15-fold increase in K D2) may be due, in part, to the decreased abundance of the low affinity binding entity of the enzyme (∼3-fold decrease in B max2). Because mutation of His5 → Ala reduced the malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, L-CPTI may be affected by pH. A pH-induced shift in malonyl-CoA sensitivity has been reported for CPTI (25Stephens T.W. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem.

Thus, fasting and diabetes, metabolic conditions that enhance protein degradation, reduce the sensitivity of CPTI to malonyl-CoA inhibition (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol.

We are currently conducting in vitro partial proteolysis studies with yeast-expressed L-CPTI to determine the role of protein degradation on malonyl-CoA sensitivity. To determine the role of the first 130 N-terminal amino acid residues of rat L-CPTI in malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, we previously constructed a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that a mutant lacking the first conserved 18 N-terminal amino acid residues had activity and kinetic properties similar to those of wild type L-CPTI but had completely lost malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity binding (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on these previous studies (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we report here on deletion mutations of the conserved first 12 and 6 N-terminal residues of L-CPTI. Like Δ18, Δ12 and Δ6 had 60–70% of the wild type activity and showed loss of both malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding, indicating that residue(s) essential for malonyl-CoA binding and sensitivity reside within the conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids. Of these conserved first 6 N-terminal amino acids, including the start codon Met, residues 2 and 4 are Ala, residue 3 is Glu, residue 5 is His, and residue 6 is Gln. Therefore, we constructed mutants with substitutions of Glu3 with Ala, His5 with Ala, and Gln6 with Ala of L-CPTI. The mutant L-CPTI with a replacement of Glu3 with Ala had a phenotype similar to that of the N-terminal deletion mutants. The mutation resulted in complete loss of malonyl-CoA sensitivity and high affinity malonyl-CoA binding and a decrease in the low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. In contrast, substitution of Glu3 with Ala did not have a significant effect on the kinetic properties of the enzyme, because there was no change in the K m value for palmitoyl-CoA and only a slight increase in theK m value for carnitine. The 29–40% loss in catalytic activity observed with the deletion and point mutants compared with the wild type could be due to a reduction in the expression level or lack of interaction of the N-terminal domain with the catalytic domain as a result of the N-terminal mutations. A protein of the expected size (88 kDa) was detected in the mitochondria of the Glu3 → Ala mutant strain on immunoblotting with L-CPTI specific antibodies. These results demonstrate clearly that Glu3 in the wild type L-CPTI is essential for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding but not for catalysis, because the kinetic properties of the mutant enzyme are virtually indistinguishable from those of the wild type. This is the first report to demonstrate the critical role of Glu3 residue of L-CPTI for malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding. The high affinity site (K D1,B max1) for binding of malonyl-CoA to L-CPTI was completely abolished in the Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18 mutants, suggesting that the >100-fold decrease in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in these mutants was due to the loss of the high affinity binding entity of the enzyme. Although low affinity malonyl-CoA binding was weakened, there was no change in theB max2 value between wild type L-CPTI and mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, suggesting that the residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in the mutants was due to the low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding entity of the enzyme. The results of this study provide strong evidence implicating Glu3 as one of the residues involved in high affinity malonyl-CoA binding. We hypothesize that the Glu3 → Ala substitution may disrupt a hydrogen bonding network or a salt bridge, perhaps to a residue near the active site of CPTI. As the high affinity site is abolished and binding to the low affinity site is weakened, the two sites may partially overlap. Alternatively, the possible loss of a salt bridge may weaken K D2 indirectly. Replacement of His5 with Ala had a much less drastic effect on the IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition of L-CPTI but severely diminished both high and low affinity malonyl-CoA binding. TheB max1 for this mutant showed a slight increase, but B max2 showed a significant decrease compared with the wild type value, suggesting that the 10-fold lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition observed with this mutant, compared with mutants Glu3 → Ala, Δ6, and Δ18, may be due to a slight increase in abundance of the high affinity binding entity with a lowered (100-fold) affinity for malonyl-CoA. The decrease in low affinity malonyl-CoA binding observed for the His5→ Ala mutant (∼15-fold increase in K D2) may be due, in part, to the decreased abundance of the low affinity binding entity of the enzyme (∼3-fold decrease in B max2). Because mutation of His5 → Ala reduced the malonyl-CoA sensitivity and binding, L-CPTI may be affected by pH. A pH-induced shift in malonyl-CoA sensitivity has been reported for CPTI (25Stephens T.W. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data clearly demonstrate that there are two classes of malonyl-CoA-binding sites in L-CPTI, namely, a high affinity and a low affinity binding site, similar to earlier studies in isolated rat liver and heart mitochondria (26Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A previous attempt to express a mutant L-CPTI that lacked the first 82 N-terminal residues was described by Brown et al. (28Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but results were inconclusive due to extremely low expression levels (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The residual malonyl-CoA sensitivity shown by the deletion mutants is similar to that observed with yeast-expressed CPTII (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that for these mutants malonyl-CoA may inhibit via direct interaction with the active site. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the active site acts as a low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding site, but our data suggest that there may be some overlap between the malonyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA binding sites. In the absence of malonyl-CoA, free CoA (50 μm) and acetyl-CoA (500 μm) inhibited the activities of both the wild type and the Glu3 → Ala mutant L-CPTI by 50%. 2J. Shi, H. Zhu, D. N. Arvidson, and G. Woldegiorgis, unpublished observation.Because a total loss of the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding site was observed in the Glu3 → Ala mutant, the results suggest that CoA and acetyl-CoA inhibit by binding to the active site or the low affinity malonyl-CoA-binding site. At high concentrations, both CoA and the substrate palmitoyl-CoA reduce the inhibition of L-CPTI by malonyl-CoA (18Bremer J. Woldegiorgis G. Schalinske K. Shrago E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Cook G.A. Mynatt R.L. Kashfi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8803-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting partial overlap between the malonyl-CoA and the substrate binding sites. Based on limited proteolysis studies of intact and outer membrane rat liver mitochondria, a model for the membrane topology of L-CPTI has been proposed that predicts exposure of 90% of L-CPTI, including N and C termini domains crucial for activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme on the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A more recent detailed deletion mutation analysis study of the 129 N-terminal amino acid residues of the yeast-expressed L-CPTI from our laboratory clearly demonstrated that residues critical for malonyl-CoA inhibition and binding of L-CPTI are located within the conserved first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of the enzyme (14Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that glutamic acid residue 3 and histidine 5 are essential for malonyl-CoA binding and inhibition. Limited proteolysis of intact and outer membrane preparations of rat liver mitochondria result in a marked loss in L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Kashfi K. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), accompanied by the cleavage of the extreme N terminus (<1 kDa) of L-CPTI (30Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Mitochondria isolated from fasted and diabetic rat livers, metabolic conditions with increased fatty acid oxidation, exhibit increased L-CPTI activity and decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin reverses the effects of diabetes on L-CPTI activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fasting and diabetes, metabolic conditions that enhance protein degradation, reduce the sensitivity of CPTI to malonyl-CoA inhibition (32Cook G.A. Gamble M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2050-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kashfi K. Biochem.

The L-CPTI gene in INS-1 cells may be an early response gene like c-fos (35Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Thumelin S. Roche E. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1659-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme may be subject to metabolic regulation by proteolysis (36Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), employing the cytosolic ubiquitin-proteasome system (36Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Diabetes is a pathophysiologic condition associated with increased protein degradation, fatty acid oxidation, CPTI activity, and decreased malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPTI (33Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kashfi K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus limited in vivo proteolysis of L-CPTI induced by diabetes, such as cleavage of the first 6 N-terminal residues, may decrease malonyl-CoA sensitivity and alter the normal control of hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Insulin inhibits proteasome activity resulting in decreased cellular protein degradation and controlled fatty acid oxidation (8Hamel F.G. Bennett R.G. Harmon K.S. Duckworth W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We are currently conducting in vitro partial proteolysis studies with yeast-expressed L-CPTI to determine the role of protein degradation on malonyl-CoA sensitivity. We are grateful to Dr. James M. Cregg (Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology) for advice, helpful suggestions, and encouragement throughout these studies."

Lipopolysaccharide, cell-permeable ceramide analogs, and bacterial sphingomyelinase led to phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 kinase and induced AP-1 DNA binding in C3H/OuJ (Lps n) but not in C3H/HeJ (Lps d) macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide and ceramide mimetics showed distinct kinetics of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and AP-1 induction and activated AP-1 complexes with different subunit compositions. Lipopolysaccharide-activated AP-1 consisted of c-Fos, Jun-B, Jun-D, and c-Jun, while C2-ceramide induced Jun-D and c-Jun only. Lipopolysaccharide and, less potently, C2-ceramide or sphingomyelinase, stimulated AP-1-dependent reporter gene transcription in RAW 264.7 cells. Unlike lipopolysaccharide, C2-ceramide failed to activate NF-κB and did not induce production of tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-6. The lipopolysaccharide antagonist, Rhodobacter sphae-roides diphosphoryl lipid A, inhibited lipopolysaccharide activation of NF-κB and AP-1 but did not block C2-ceramide-induced AP-1. Pretreatment of C3H/OuJ macrophages with C2-ceramide greatly diminished AP-1 induction following subsequent C2-ceramide stimulation. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced transcription factor activation and cytokine release were not influenced. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide pretreatment inhibited both lipopolysaccharide- and C2-ceramide-mediated responses. Thus, ceramide partially mimics lipopolysaccharide in activating the mitogen-activated protein kinases and AP-1 but not in mediating NF-κB induction or cytokine production, suggesting a limited role in lipopolysaccharide signaling.

Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in excess, LPS is harmful because it causes increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-1β, and IL-6) that contribute to septic shock (2Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Several LPS-binding proteins have been identified, yet the true LPS signaling receptor(s) and the mechanism by which LPS transduces a signal across the cell membrane remain poorly understood.

However, CD14 lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, and, in addition, high LPS concentrations elicit cellular activation in CD14 knockout mice (7Haziot A. Ferrero E. Kontgen F. Hijiya N. Yamomoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 8Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. Detore G.R. Haziot A. Goyert S.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4422-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although CD14 is considered as a component of the LPS receptor complex, it does not seem to represent a true LPS signal transducing molecule. Among other LPS binding molecules, complement receptors type 3 and 4 (CR3 and CR4) have been suggested to mediate LPS signaling as their expression in CHO cells conferred upon them LPS sensitivity, as judged by NF-κB activation (10Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 11Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutant CR3 molecules that lack cytoplasmic regions also mediate NF-κB activation in response to endotoxin (11Ingalls R.R. Arnaout M.A. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 433-438PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, monocytes obtained from patients with a deficiency in expression of CD18, the common β-chain of the leukocyte integrins, show normal LPS binding and responsiveness (12Wright S.D. Detmers P.A. Aida Y. Adamowski R. Anderson D.C. Chad Z. Kabbash L.G. Pabst M.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2566-2671PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these findings, CD14 and complement receptors have been proposed to bind LPS and associate with other molecules that mediate signal transduction. Recently, Yang et al. (13Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) have reported that transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) imparts LPS responses that are dependent on LBP and enhanced by CD14. LPS-induced NF-κB activation has been demonstrated to require a region in the intracellular domain of TLR2 that is homologous to the intracellular region of the IL-1 receptor implicated in the activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (13Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a TLR2 deletion mutant with a truncation of a region in the intracellular domain appears to act as a dominant-negative receptor by inhibiting the “endogenous” LPS-mediated reporter gene activation in U373 astrocytoma cells (13Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), further suggesting LPS signaling functions for TLR2. In a related study, genetic and physical mapping of the mouseLps d mutation, which is responsible for LPS unresponsiveness of C3H/HeJ mice, has revealed a single intact gene within the entire Lps critical region on mouse chromosome 4 that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (14Poltorak A. Smirnova I. He X. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Du X. Thompson P. Chan E.K.L. Ledesma J. Roe B. Clifton S. Vogel S. Beutler B. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 340-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, TLR2 and TLR4, members of the IL-1 receptor family, are likely to represent LPS signal-transducing molecules in humans and in the mouse, respectively. However, further studies will be required to confirm LPS signaling functions for TLR2 and to demonstrate functional significance of TLR4 in monocytes and macrophages.Ceramide is an intracellular lipid derived by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with sphingomyelin-specific forms of phospholipase C, neutral and acidic sphingomyelinases (SMase), which is known to mediate cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to a number of cytokines and environmental stresses (15Kolesnick R.

Ceramide activates multiple intracellular targets, including a ceramide-activated protein kinase (18Mathias S. Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been suggested that LPS may activate cells via its direct stimulation of the sphingomyelin pathway (22Wright S.D. Kolesnick R.N. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 297-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) due to a close structural similarity of the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule and ceramide (23Joseph C.K.

Indeed, LPS activates the ceramide-activated protein kinase in myeloid cells directly, without stimulation of SMase (23Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J.

Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Consistent with this scenario, stimulation of the sphingomyelin pathway has been reported to induce ERK activation (26Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of C3H/OuJ (Lps n) peritoneal macrophages with exogenous SMase or cell-permeable ceramide analogs activates a subset of LPS-inducible genes, whereas C3H/HeJ (Lps d) macrophages fail to respond to either LPS or ceramide (39Barber S.A. Detore G. McNally R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Barber S.A. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2303-2305PubMed Google Scholar). C3H/HeJ (Lps d) macrophages also exhibit a defective intracellular transport of LPS and ceramides from the membrane into the perinuclear region (41Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2095-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggesting that this defect may account for their hyporesponsiveness to both LPS and ceramide (40Barber S.A. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2303-2305PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to LPS, however, cell-permeable ceramide analogs were poor inducers of interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 and interferon consensus sequence-binding protein gene expression and interferon secretion in C3H/OuJ (Lps n) macrophages (39Barber S.A. Detore G. McNally R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, preexposure of macrophages with LPS significantly decreases TNF release in response to their subsequent stimulation with LPS, whereas pretreatment of macrophages with SMase does not suppress LPS-induced TNF production (39Barber S.A. Detore G. McNally R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest the existence of LPS signal transduction mechanisms that are distinct from the sphingomyelin pathway.In the present study, we sought to evaluate further the involvement of ceramide in LPS-induced macrophage activation. To do so, LPS and ceramide were compared with respect to their capacities to elicit MAP kinase phosphorylation, NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factor activation, and TNF and IL-6 production. The data indicate that ceramide partially mimics LPS-mediated phosphorylation of the ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAP kinases, as well as AP-1 induction. In contrast to LPS, ceramide mimetics fail to elicit NF-κB translocation, NF-κB-controlled reporter gene expression, or production of TNF and IL-6. Strong inhibition of LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was observed by using the LPS structural antagonist, Rhodobacter sphaeroides diphosphoryl lipid A (RsDPLA), yet RsDPLA did not antagonize ceramide-induced AP-1 induction. Preexposure of macrophages with LPS renders them tolerant to subsequent stimulation with either LPS or C2-ceramide, whereas ceramide treatment does not induce LPS hyporesponsiveness. Taken together, these results indicate a limited role of ceramide in LPS-mediated MAP kinase activation, transcription factor induction, and cytokine production in mouse macrophages, implying that LPS utilizes both the sphingomyelin pathway and additional intracellular mechanisms for mediating optimal signal transduction.DISCUSSIONLPS has been proposed to signal cell activation by mimicking the intracellular second messenger ceramide (23Joseph C.K. Wright S.D. Bornmann W.G. Randolph J.T. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Liu J. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17606-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), due to a close structural similarity between the lipid A portion of LPS and the ceramide molecule (24Yao B. Zhang Y. Delicat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). One implication of this model is that similar intracellular pathways are engaged by LPS and ceramide that consequently lead to overlapping responses. This paper demonstrates the failure of LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ macrophages to exhibit NF-κB and AP-1 activation following stimulation with LPS, SMase, and C2-ceramide. Our results extend the correlation between LPS and ceramide hyporesponsiveness of C3H/HeJ macrophages found previously at the level of gene expression (40Barber S.A. Perera P.-Y. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2303-2305PubMed Google Scholar) and support involvement of the sphingomyelin pathway in LPS signaling. However, several observations shown in the present study strongly suggest that activation of the sphingomyelin pathway is one of multiple signals initiated by LPS in mouse macrophages. First, LPS and ceramide were found to exhibit qualitative differences in the elicitation of several cellular responses. Indeed, in contrast to LPS, cell-permeable ceramide analogs,dl-PPMP, and SMase did not stimulate NF-κB translocation in C3H/OuJ macrophages and failed to trigger NF-κB-dependent transcription of the Luc reporter gene in RAW 264.7 cells. These data support and extend earlier publications on the inability of ceramide to induce NF-κB found in other cell types (30Betts J.C. Agranoff A.B. Nabel G.J. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8455-8458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8307-8312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, conflicting reports exist that demonstrate the capacities of ceramide analogs to activate NF-κB in HL60 promyelocytic and EL4 lymphoma cells (27Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schutze S. Baeuerle P. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20520-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to potentiate TNF- or LPS-induced NF-κB responses in human vein endothelial cells and in primary rat astrocytes (55Masamune A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 56Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine unequivocally the role of ceramide in NF-κB activation in mouse macrophages, we analyzed how independent triggering and down-modulation of the sphingomyelin pathway affect LPS-initiated NF-κB translocation. Not only did C2-ceramide lack the ability to activate NF-κB by itself, but also it failed to influence LPS-initiated NF-κB responses when present in the cell cultures simultaneously with LPS. Furthermore, pretreatment of macrophages with C2-ceramide did not affect LPS-mediated NF-κB translocation, while it completely abolished subsequent induction of AP-1 by ceramide mimetics. In contrast, LPS pretreatment rendered macrophages hyporesponsive to subsequent challenge with either LPS or ceramide mimetics. These data demonstrate that ceramide-elicited refractoriness of macrophages to itself has no effect on the ability of LPS to activate NF-κB. Taken together, these results indicate that, in mouse macrophages, ceramide is not involved in LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. Similar to the NF-κB data, LPS, but not C2-ceramide, stimulated C3H/OuJ macrophages to secrete TNF and IL-6. Moreover, no modulatory effect of C2-ceramide on LPS-mediated cytokine release was observed when these reagents were added simultaneously or when cells were first pretreated with C2-ceramide. Thus, at least three LPS responses exist, i.e. NF-κB activation as well as TNF and IL-6 release, that could not be induced or modulated by ceramide mimetics.Second, to delineate whether LPS and ceramide involve similar mechanisms for transcription factor activation, we employed the LPS antagonist, RsDPLA (54Henricson B.E. Perera P.-Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4285-4290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Kirkland T.N. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 131-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, RsDPLA, as well as other LPS partial structures, e.g. deacylated LPS or lipid IVA, suppress LPS activities at concentrations that do not affect LPS binding to CD14 (58Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), suggesting that they compete with LPS for a putative signaling receptor distinct from CD14 (58Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis postulates that RsDPLA could trigger negative intracellular events that interfere with LPS signaling further downstream at the postreceptor level. Thus far, however, no evidence exists to support the latter model, since RsDPLA fails to induce transcription factor activation (Fig. 4), MAP kinase phosphorylation, or cytokine release (data not shown). Regardless of the exact mechanism of action of RsDPLA, we reasoned that if LPS-mediated macrophage activation occurs via the sphingomyelin pathway, then RsDPLA should inhibit both LPS- and ceramide-mediated effects. However, this is not the case, as treatment of C3H/OuJ macrophages with RsDPLA did not affect AP-1 activation in response to C2-ceramide, whereas this compound significantly inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB and AP-1. Thus, RsDPLA-inhibitable molecules engaged in LPS-mediated transcription factor activation do not represent ceramide-triggered signaling components.Third, this paper shows that even when overlapping responses are elicited, LPS and ceramide seem to involve divergent intracellular mechanisms. Both LPS and ceramide mediated AP-1 activation; however, different kinetics of AP-1 induction, subunit compositions of AP-1 complexes, and different potencies of AP-1 trans-activation were seen in response to LPS versus ceramide. Furthermore, an additive effect on AP-1 DNA-binding activity was observed when macrophages were stimulated with a combination of LPS and C2-ceramide. Finally, macrophages pretreated with LPS manifested a significantly lower AP-1 response upon subsequent stimulation with LPS, C2-ceramide, or SMase, whereas prior exposure to C2-ceramide conferred tolerance only to C2-ceramide. Our results extend earlier published observations on the ability of the sphingomyelin pathway to signal AP-1 activation in the human leukemia cell line HL-60 (59Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamomoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8307-8312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), studies where a comparative analysis of LPS versus ceramide responses was not undertaken. Furthermore, they suggest that quantitative differences between LPS and ceramide with respect to AP-1 trans-activation are likely to reflect their capacities to stimulate AP-1 complexes with different subunit compositions. Indeed, both Fos and Jun proteins comprised LPS-induced AP-1, which have been reported to form more stable complexes and activate transcription more efficiently than Jun subunits (60Karin M. Liu Z.-G. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 61Serkkola E. Hurme M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whose up-regulation was caused by C2-ceramide.Analysis of MAP kinase phosphorylation also underscored the kinetic differences between LPS and ceramide mimetics. To the best of our knowledge, this paper shows for the first time that ceramide is capable of mediating phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in mouse macrophages, extending a similar observation made recently in Jurkat cells (62Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that LPS, C2-ceramide, or SMase shared the ability to mediate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases, an observation for which conflicting data have been reported (26Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), C2-ceramide or SMase also mimicked LPS-induced phosphorylation of the JNK1 and two MAP kinases. However, despite the fact that both LPS, C2-ceramide, and SMase caused phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAP kinases, slower and less sustained responses were induced by ceramide mimetics compared with LPS. It is tempting to speculate that differential activation of protein phosphatases by LPSversus ceramide accounts for this phenomenon, limiting MAP kinase-mediated downstream signaling triggered by ceramide. Since different patterns of cellular responses could be induced depending on whether transient or sustained MAP kinase activation occurs (63Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), this could have functional consequences for differential effect of LPS and ceramide on both transcription factor activation and cytokine production. Experiments are in progress to examine this hypothesis.NF-κB is a prerequisite for the expression of many cytokine genes, including TN"

I-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine can carry bivalent functional oligosaccharides such as sialyl Lewisx, which provide much better carbohydrate ligands than monovalent functional oligosaccharides. In the present study, we first demonstrate that I-branching β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase cloned from human PA-1 embryonic carcinoma cells transfers β1,6-linked GlcNAc preferentially to galactosyl residues ofN-acetyllactosamine close to nonreducing terminals. We then demonstrate that among various β1,4-galactosyltransferases (β4Gal-Ts), β4Gal-TI is most efficient in adding a galactose to linear and branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines. When a β1,6-GlcNAc branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine was incubated with a mixture of β4Gal-TI and i-extension β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, the major product was the oligosaccharide with one N-acetyllactosamine extension on the linear Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3 side chain.

During inflammation, E- and P-selectin expressed on activated endothelial cells bind to sialyl Lex oligosaccharides present on granulocytes and such initial binding leads to the extravasation of granulocytes.

This L-selectin/counterreceptor interaction allows lymphocytes to migrate into lymphoid system, allowing lymphocytes to circulate fully in the body.

Majuri M.-L. Seppo A. Tiisala S. Paavonen T. Miyasaka M. Lemström K. Penttilä L. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Toppila S.

Similarly, blood group H antigens present at both termini in branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines were shown to have much better avidity to anti-ABO antibodies than linear poly-N-acetyllactosamines containing single antigenic structures (25Romans D.G. Tilley C.A. Dorrington K.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2807-2811PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that expression of i antigen in fetal erythrocytes minimizes a detrimental immune response when mother and fetus have incompatible blood group antigens (25Romans D.G. Tilley C.A. Dorrington K.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2807-2811PubMed Google Scholar). These results, as a whole, indicate the significance of understanding how linear and I-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines are synthesized. To this end, we have cloned cDNAs encoding β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (iGnT) that forms linear poly-N-acetyllactosamines (26Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT) that forms I-branches (27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The IGnT cloned was found to add β1,6-N-acetylglucosamine at the central galactose (underlined) of Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R, thus termed as centrally acting IGnT (cIGnT) (28Mattila P. Salminen H. Hirvas L. Niittymäki J. Salo H. Niemelä R. Fukuda M. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol.

In addition, another IGnT, distally acting IGnT (dIGnT), was found to add β1,6-N-acetylglucosamine to peridistal galactose (underlined) of GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAc→R (29Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J.

In the present study, we first describe how the IGnT cloned from PA-1 cells (27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) adds I-branches to linear poly-N-acetyllactosamines containing multiple acceptor sites. We then demonstrate that β4Gal-TI is responsible for galactosylation in the synthesis of both linear and branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines. Finally, we reconstituted the synthesis of I-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine, the structure of which resembles that present in human erythrocytes (5Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PA-1 human embryonic carcinoma cells (34Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 7648-7651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate an intricate interaction between acceptor substrates and these glycosyltransferases. cDNA encoding iGnT was cloned into pcDNA3.1, resulting in pcDNA3.1-iGnT, as described previously (26Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). pcDNAI-A, harboring cDNA encoding a signal sequence and an IgG binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A, was constructed as described before (35Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of iGnT was cloned into this vector, resulting in pcDNAI-A·iGnT. cDNA encoding IGnT was cloned from a cDNA library constructed from human PA-1 embryonic carcinoma cells, resulting in pcDNAI-IGnT, as described previously (27Bierhuizen M.F.A. Mattei M.-G. Fukuda M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A catalytic domain of IGnT was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using pcDNAI-IGnT as a template. 5′- and 3′-primers for this polymerase chain reaction were 5′-GCGGATCCAAGCTTCCAAAGGCTA-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGCTCAAAAATACCAGCTGGGT-3′ (BamHI and XhoI sites are underlined). The polymerase chain reaction product encoding amino acid residues 30–400 of the IGnT was digested with BamHI and XhoI and then cloned into the same sites of pcDNAI-A, resulting in pcDNAI-A·IGnT. pcDNAI-A, pcDNAI-A·iGnT, and pcDNAI-A·IGnT were separately transfected with Lipofectamine Plus (Life Technologies) into COS-1 cells as described previously (36Ujita M.

The chimeric enzyme released into serum-free Opti-MEM was used after adsorbing the protein A chimeric enzymes to IgG-Sepharose 6FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (37Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the culture medium was concentrated 100-fold by a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) and directly used as an enzyme source. In most of the studies, the concentrated culture medium was used for iGnT, since IgG-Sepharose-bound enzymes had a low activity as seen for other glycosyltransferases (38Bakker H. Van Tetering A.

Typically, the activities of iGnT and IGnT in the incubation mixture were 38.0 nmol/h/ml using 0.5 mm Galβ1→4Glcβ→p-nitrophenol (Toronto Research Chemicals) and 40.0 nmol/h/ml using 0.5 mmGalβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ→octyl (see below) as acceptors, respectively. The medium from mock-transfected COS-1 cells contained less than 15 of iGnT activity as described (26Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Nati.

The supernatant from the transfected COS-1 cells was concentrated 100-fold as described above and used as an enzyme source. For comparing the enzymatic activities of different β4Gal-T samples, the final concentration of β4Gal-TI, -TII, -TIII, -TIV, and -TV was adjusted to 38.0 nmol/h/ml as measured using 0.5 mmGlcNAcβ→p-nitrophenol (Sigma) as an acceptor.

Purification of the product was achieved by HPLC on a TSK gel ODS-80TS column (4.6 × 250 mm; TOSOH) equipped with a Gilson 306 HPLC apparatus. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fluorescence was detected with a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model RF-535) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The concentration of PA-oligosaccharides was estimated by comparing fluorescent intensity of synthesized PA-oligosaccharides and standard PA-glucose purchased from Takara Shuzo (PanVera, Madison, WI). Lacto-N-neo-tetraose, lacto-N-neo-hexaose, and lacto-N-hexaose (Galβ1→3GlcNAcβ1→3(Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6)Galβ1→4Glc) were purchased from Oxford GlycoSystems. To assay the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine residues by the iGnT, the reaction mixture was exactly the same as described previously (36Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As acceptors, lacto-N-neo-tetraose, lacto-N-neo-hexaose, lacto-N-hexaose, pyridylaminated lacto-N-neo-hexaose (PA-lacto-N-neo-hexaose), and lacto-N-neo-tetraose (PA-lacto-N-neo-tetraose) were used. The assay products derived from the above oligosaccharides were purified by QAE-Sephadex A-25 gel and subjected to Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration as described previously (36Ujita M. McAuliffe J.

The radioactivity of the aliquots was determined by a scintillation counter. The products derived from the PA-oligosaccharides were filtered through Ultrafree-MC (10-kDa cut; Millipore Corp.) and applied to the same ODS-80TS column and eluted as described above. Since PA-oligosaccharides can be detected by fluorescence, nonradioactive UDP-GlcNAc was used as a donor for the experiments using PA-oligosaccharides. To assay the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine residues by IGnT, the reaction mixture contained 5 mmUDP-[3H]GlcNAc (2 × 104 cpm/nmol; NEN Life Science Products), 10 mm EDTA, 20 μl of IGnT preparation as described above, 10 mm N-acetylglucosamino-1,5-lactone (Toronto Research Chemicals), 10 mm galactono-1,5-lactone, and various concentrations of an acceptor in 50 μl (final volume) of 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, modified from the previously described protocol (31Gu J.

The incubation mixture was applied to a C18 reverse phase Sep-Pak column (Waters), and the product was eluted as described previously (36Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O.

The product was then analyzed by HPLC using NH2-bonded silica column (Varian Micropak AX-5) as described previously (36Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M.

In all of the above reactions, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 h to analyze the products or for 1 h to obtain kinetic parameters. Assays of β4Gal-Ts were performed exactly as described previously (36Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)Galβ1→4Glc→PA was synthesized by incubating 5 mmGalβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc→PA with the recombinant IGnT and 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc for 10 h in 100 μl of the reaction mixture as described above. The product was purified by HPLC using the same ODS column as described above and used as an acceptor. To assay poly-N-acetyllactosamine formation, 0.5 mmGalβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)Galβ1→4Glc→PA was incubated with β4Gal-TI (152 nmol/h/ml), iGnT (38 nmol/h/ml), 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and 0.5 mm UDP-Gal in 50 μl of 100 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm MnCl2 and 10 mm each of GlcNAc-1,5-lactone and Gal-1,5-lactone. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the reaction mixture was filtered and subjected to HPLC as described above. In these experiments, the incubation condition was first determined using Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc, where only one N-acetyllactosamine unit can be added. In addition, β4Gal-TI was 4-fold in excess over iGnT, the same ratio as present in HL-60 cells (44Lee N. Wang W.-C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20476-20487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Products were digested with Escherichia freundii endo-β-galactosidase for 18 h at 37 °C (11Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestion condition used allowed the cleavage of galactose linkage, where no β-1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine is attached (11Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,45Fukuda M.N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. CRC Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 55-103Google Scholar). The digests were subjected to HPLC using AX-5 column or TSK gel ODS-80TS. Recently, it was reported that the IGnT cloned from PA-1 cells exclusively adds β1,6-linked N-acetylglucosamine to a galactose residue in a central position as seen in Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4Glc(NAc)→R (the underlined galactose is the accepting galactose (28Mattila P. Salminen H. Hirvas L. Niittymäki J. Salo H. Niemelä R. Fukuda M. Renkonen O. Renkonen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27633-27639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). To determine if the IGnT can add N-acetylglucosamine residues far from nonreducing terminals, acceptors with various numbers ofN-acetyllactosamine repeats were used. As shown in Fig.1, B and D, the oligosaccharide containing two potential acceptor sites, (Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3)2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Man→R, incorporated slightly more N-acetylglucosamine than that containing only one acceptor site. When the products obtained from (Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3)2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Man→R were analyzed by endo-β-galactosidase digestion, the majority of singly branched products contained β1,6-linked GlcNAc close to the nonreducing terminal (Fig. 1 F and Fig.2, compound e). These results indicate that the IGnT displays a preference for a galactose residue separated by one N-acetyllactosamine unit from the nonreducing terminal (Fig. 2, compounds b, e, and g). The results shown in Fig. 1, C and D, also indicate that the addition of two I-branches to neighboring galactose residues (compounds d and g in Fig. 2) occurs less efficiently than the addition of one branch.Figure 2Schematic representation of IGnT oligosaccharide products. Gal (○), GlcNAc (●), Man (■), and β1,6-linked GlcNAc in I-branch (◍) are denoted. Thenumbers indicate the relative molar ratio of the products. The vertical lines indicate the positions where endo-β-galactosidase cleaves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 1, A and C, illustrate that oligosaccharides containing N-acetylglucosamine at nonreducing terminals can also serve as acceptors. In particular, the results shown in Fig.1 A demonstrate that the IGnT can add β1,6-linked GlcNAc to a peridistal galactose (Fig. 2, compound a), thus containing dIGnT activity. This finding is consistent with the results reported in our recent study (29Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). When two galactoses are available in the oligosaccharide containing nonreducing terminalN-acetylglucosamine, all of the singly branched product(s) remained radioactive after endo-β-galactosidase digestion (Fig.1 E), indicating its structure as GlcNAcβ1→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3(GlcNAcβ1→6)Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Man→R (Fig. 2, compound c). Peridistal galactose was utilized only when the central galactose was utilized (Fig. 2,compound d). These results indicate that a peridistal galactose is the least favored by the cIGnT cloned from PA-1 cells. When the preferred galactose is missed by the IGnT, the enzyme can still add an I-branch to that galactose after oneN-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 2, compounds c and d) or N-acetyllactosamine is added (Fig. 2, compounds f and g). The above results were obtained using the recombinant IGnT bound to IgG-Sepharose, the activity of which was 3.6 nmol/h/ml. Almost identical results were obtained when a concentrated culture medium from IGnT-transfected cells, of which activity was 40.0 nmol/h/ml, was used. In our previous study, we demonstrated that β4Gal-TI is involved inN-acetyllactosamine formation in N-"
https://openalex.org/W2000333472,"Peptide toxins selective for particular subunit interfaces of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor have proven invaluable in assigning candidate residues located in the two binding sites and for determining probable orientations of the bound peptide. We report here on a short α-neurotoxin from Naja mossambica mossambica (NmmI) that, similar to other α-neurotoxins, binds with high affinity to αγ and αδ subunit interfaces (K D∼100 pm) but binds with markedly reduced affinity to the αε interface (K D∼100 nm). By constructing chimeras composed of portions of the γ and ε subunits and coexpressing them with wild type α, β, and δ subunits in HEK 293 cells, we identify a region of the subunit sequence responsible for the difference in affinity. Within this region, γPro-175 and γGlu-176 confer high affinity, whereas Thr and Ala, found at homologous positions in ε, confer low affinity. To identify an interaction between γGlu-176 and residues in NmmI, we have examined cationic residues in the central loop of the toxin and measured binding of mutant toxin-receptor combinations. The data show strong pairwise interactions or coupling between γGlu-176 and Lys-27 of NmmI and progressively weaker interactions with Arg-33 and Arg-36 in loop II of this three-loop toxin. Thus, loop II of NmmI, and in particular the face of this loop closest to loop III, appears to come into close apposition with Glu-176 of the γ subunit surface of the binding site interface.

Thus, loop II of NmmI, and in particular the face of this loop closest to loop III, appears to come into close apposition with Glu-176 of the γ subunit surface of the binding site interface. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Naja mossambica mossambica α-bungarotoxin wild type mutant The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)1 found in muscle is a pentamer composed of four homologous subunits present in the stoichiometry α2βγδ (fetal subtype) or α2βεδ (adult subtype). The subunits are arranged in a circular manner to surround a central channel in the order, αγαδβ or αεαδβ (1Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 2Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3Hucho F.

The two binding sites for agonists, competitive antagonists, and the slowly dissociating α-neurotoxins are formed at interfaces between the αδ and αγ(ε) subunit pairs. The extracellular domain in each subunit is formed principally from the amino-terminal 210 amino acids, which is followed by four membrane-spanning domains. Residues within the amino-terminal 210 amino acids have been shown to be the major contributors to the ligand binding sites and for dictating the order of assembly of subunits.Three segments of the α subunit, well separated along the linear sequence, harbor major determinants for ligand binding; these segments contain the key residues around Tyr-93, between Trp-149 and Asp-152, and spanning the region from Val-188 through Asp-200 (see Refs. 3Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar and 4Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholarfor reviews). Similarly, four discontinuous segments of the non-α subunits, appearing on the opposite face of the subunit, contain major determinants for ligand selectivity; in the γ subunit these segments contain the key residues Lys-34, between Trp-55 and Gln-59, between Ser-111 and Tyr-117, and between Phe-172 and Asp-174.Since the early demonstration of irreversible neuromuscular blockade by the peptide from snake venom, α-bungarotoxin (5Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar), and the use of labeled α-neurotoxins to identify the nAChR (6Changeux J.P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), these toxins have been the primary ligands employed for the identification and characterization of the muscle nAChR. Amino acid sequences are available for nearly 100 members of the α-neurotoxin family, which show a common basic structure consisting of three polypeptide loops emerging from a small globular core (7Endo T. Tamiya N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 403-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). α-Neurotoxins can be divided into the short (4 disulfide bonds and 60–62 residues) and long neurotoxins (5 disulfide bonds and 66–74 residues). Crystal and solution structure determinations reveal similar tertiary structures. Although these structurally well defined toxins are known to bind at the subunit interfaces (αε or αγ and αδ), typically with aK D ≤ 100 pm, little is known about their precise orientation with respect to the subunits that form the interfaces.Points of attachment of α-neurotoxin within the nAChR binding sites have been examined by cross-linking chemically modified (8Witzemann V.

FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These labeling studies have suggested contacts with both α and non-α subunits at the binding sites (see Refs. 2Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J.

Mutagenesis studies have also identified candidate residues in the principal loops of the α (16Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and non-α subunits (17Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23521-23527Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that contribute to α-toxin binding. Although most α-toxins do not distinguish between the two sites on the receptor, an α-toxin from the venom of Naja mossambica mossambica (NmmI) distinguishes between the two sites of the Torpedo receptor (18Marchot P. Frachon P. Bougis P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus NmmI emerges as a potentially valuable ligand for determining regions of close approach between α-toxins and the non-α subunits at the binding site. Previous work showed that the αγ and αδ binding sites of the fetal mouse receptor exhibit similar affinities for NmmI (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, certain mutations in the NmmI toxin structure, and surprisingly also in the nAChR α subunit common to both sites, resulted in nonequivalent reductions in affinity at the αγ and αδ binding sites (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we examine binding of recombinant NmmI α-toxin to fetal and adult mouse AChRs and find that the affinity of NmmI for the αε interface is 3 orders of magnitude lower than for the αγ and αδ interfaces. Using subunit chimeras and site-directed mutations in γ and ε subunits, we show that the enhanced affinity conferred by the γ over the ε subunit arises from Pro-175 and Glu-176 in the γ subunit. Mutant cycle analysis shows that Glu-176 interacts with cationic residues in loop II of the NmmI α-toxin.DISCUSSIONThe α-neurotoxins are a family of three-fingered peptide toxins found in venom of elapid snakes (7Endo T. Tamiya N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1987; 34: 403-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They have proven to be invaluable tools for the isolation and study of the nAChR because of their high affinities and slow rates of dissociation from the receptor (5Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar, 6Changeux J.P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although the isolated α-subunit of the receptor retains the capacity to bind α-BgTx, whereas isolated β, γ, or δ subunits do not, the α-toxins bind with far lower affinity to the α subunit than to the intact receptor. Moreover, small agonists and antagonists do not compete with α-toxin binding to the isolated α subunit at expected concentrations (23Gershoni J.M. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations point to a predominant, but not sole, contribution to the α-neurotoxin binding coming from the α subunit. Our previous work showed that Val-188, Tyr-190, Pro-197, and Asp-200 of α subunit contribute to NmmI binding (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also glycosylation at positions 189 and 187, yielding oligosaccharides uniquely found in cobra and mongoose nAChR, reduced α-BgTx binding substantially (16Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the α subunit appears to be the predominant site of α-toxin binding, chemical cross-linking and mutagenesis studies show that non-α subunits are close to the site of α-neurotoxin binding (Refs. 8Witzemann V. Muchmore D. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5511-5518Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Hamilton S.L. Pratt D.R. Eaton D.C.

The results described here further illustrate the role of neighboring non-α subunits in contributing to high affinity α-toxin binding, as NmmI binds to αε interfaces of the adult type of nAChR (α2βεδ) with 3 orders of magnitude lower affinity than to the αγ and αδ interfaces of the fetal receptor (α2βγδ). Binding studies, initially using chimeras and subsequently point mutants, show that εThr-176/εAla-177 (Pro/Glu in γ/δ) contribute entirely to insensitivity of the αε interface to NmmI. The observation that α-bungarotoxin association is only slightly affected by the γ and ε sequence differences suggests that this region of the γ, ε, and δ subunits is not used equivalently for stabilization of the entire family of bound α-neurotoxins. At the present time, it is unclear whether stabilization from this region is unique to some of the short α-neurotoxins, or the long α-neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin, acquire the bulk of their stabilization energy from other portions of the structure. Distinct differences in specificity between the short and long neurotoxins have been noted for the α7 subtype of nAChR (24Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Residues at the γ175/176 positions were previously unrecognized as determinants of ligand binding. However, they are immediately adjacent to γAsp-174, which was shown by cross-linking to be ∼9 Å away from Cys-192/193 in the α subunit (25Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and was shown to influence the affinity of quaternary agonists and antagonists (27Martin M.D. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10742-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Osaka H. Sugiyama N. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12758-12765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, the adjacent residues of γPhe-172 (δAsp-178, εIle-173) are known to confer site-selectivity to the smaller competitive peptide inhibitors such as α-conotoxin MI (29Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and waglerin (30Molles B.E. Kline E.F. Sine S.M. McArdle J.J. Taylor P. J. Physiol. (paris). 1998; 92 (abstr.): 470Crossref Google Scholar). The equivalent region of the α7 subunit (Asp-163, Ile-164, and Ser-165), which presumably forms a homomeric pentamer of subunits, constitutes part of a putative Ca2+ binding region that faces the ligand binding site (31Galzi J.L. Bertrand S. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5824-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the α subunit interface of the binding site, both aromatic (Tyr-190, Tyr-198) and anionic (Asp-200) residues were mapped to the α-toxin binding surface (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we identify another anionic residue in the γ subunit, Glu-176, perhaps restricted in its position by a neighboring secondary amino acid Pro-175, on the γ subunit, as a crucial residue for binding.The significant linkage between Glu-176 and cationic residues in loop II of the toxin suggests that an electrostatic interaction contributes to the tight binding of the NmmI/nAChR complex. Because the linkage obtained from charge reversal is greater for Lys-27 than for Arg-33 and Arg-36, one would predict that the portion of loop II proximal to loop III of the toxin, is closest to the γ subunit (cf. Fig.5). In this analysis, the loss of free energy (ΔΔG) associated with a single charge mutation results from all interactions between the charged residue and its multiple neighboring residues. The pairwise interactions (ΔΔG INT) resulting in charge reversal of specified residues in the interacting molecules should then highlight the strength of interaction coming from the paired charged residues. In the absence of significant changes in conformation or hydration, ΔΔG INT from Equation 2 should largely reflect the Coulombic interaction between the respective paired residues (32Faiman G.A. Horovitz A. Protein Science. 1996; 9: 315-316Google Scholar).Extensive studies on a related short neurotoxin, erabutoxin a, involving mutations at 36 toxin positions clearly revealed the importance of the tips of loops situated on the concave face of the toxin (33Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Trémeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These investigations showed that the K27E mutation of erabutoxin a decreases its affinity more than 100-fold forTorpedo nAChRs. Photo-activable p-azidobenzoyl and p-azidosalicyl groups attached to Lys-26 (analogous position at Lys-27 of NmmI) of neurotoxin II labeled γ and δ subunits of the receptor upon photolysis (11Kreienkamp H.J. Utkin Y.N. Weise C. Machold J. Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Machold J. Weise C. Utkin Y. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three different photoactivatable groups attached to the equivalent residue Lys-23 of a long neurotoxin, toxin 3, also labeled predominantly the γ and δ subunits in preference to the α subunit (13Utkin Y.N. Krivoshein A.V. Davydov V.L. Kasheverov I.E. Franke P. Maslennikov I.V. Arseniev A.S. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus mutagenesis and chemical labeling studies showed a crucial role of lysine at position 27 and its proximity to γ and δ subunits. Here, our mutant cycle studies delineate the interaction between Glu-176 of the γ subunit and Lys-27 of NmmI toxin. The largest linkage in loop II between K27E and γE176K (ΔΔG = −5.9kcal/mol) and smaller linkages (ΔΔG INT = −1.6 to −3.0 kcal/mol) found previously between K27E and α subunit residues of Val-188, Tyr-190, Pro-197, and Asp-200 (35Ackermann E.J.

A more complete elucidation of α-toxin-receptor interactions should enable us to orient a docked α-toxin with respect to the subunit interfaces, as well as refine existing models of the structure of the extracellular domain of the receptor (4Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

Mutagenesis studies have also identified candidate residues in the principal loops of the α (16Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol.

Although most α-toxins do not distinguish between the two sites on the receptor, an α-toxin from the venom of Naja mossambica mossambica (NmmI) distinguishes between the two sites of the Torpedo receptor (18Marchot P.

Thus NmmI emerges as a potentially valuable ligand for determining regions of close approach between α-toxins and the non-α subunits at the binding site. Previous work showed that the αγ and αδ binding sites of the fetal mouse receptor exhibit similar affinities for NmmI (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P.

Here we examine binding of recombinant NmmI α-toxin to fetal and adult mouse AChRs and find that the affinity of NmmI for the αε interface is 3 orders of magnitude lower than for the αγ and αδ interfaces. Using subunit chimeras and site-directed mutations in γ and ε subunits, we show that the enhanced affinity conferred by the γ over the ε subunit arises from Pro-175 and Glu-176 in the γ subunit. Mutant cycle analysis shows that Glu-176 interacts with cationic residues in loop II of the NmmI α-toxin.

They have proven to be invaluable tools for the isolation and study of the nAChR because of their high affinities and slow rates of dissociation from the receptor (5Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1963; 144: 241-257PubMed Google Scholar, 6Changeux J.P. Kasai M. Lee C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although the isolated α-subunit of the receptor retains the capacity to bind α-BgTx, whereas isolated β, γ, or δ subunits do not, the α-toxins bind with far lower affinity to the α subunit than to the intact receptor. Moreover, small agonists and antagonists do not compete with α-toxin binding to the isolated α subunit at expected concentrations (23Gershoni J.M. Hawrot E. Lentz T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4973-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations point to a predominant, but not sole, contribution to the α-neurotoxin binding coming from the α subunit. Our previous work showed that Val-188, Tyr-190, Pro-197, and Asp-200 of α subunit contribute to NmmI binding (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also glycosylation at positions 189 and 187, yielding oligosaccharides uniquely found in cobra and mongoose nAChR, reduced α-BgTx binding substantially (16Kreienkamp H.-J. Sine S.M. Maeda R.K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the α subunit appears to be the predominant site of α-toxin binding, chemical cross-linking and mutagenesis studies show that non-α subunits are close to the site of α-neurotoxin binding (Refs. 8Witzemann V.

The results described here further illustrate the role of neighboring non-α subunits in contributing to high affinity α-toxin binding, as NmmI binds to αε interfaces of the adult type of nAChR (α2βεδ) with 3 orders of magnitude lower affinity than to the αγ and αδ interfaces of the fetal receptor (α2βγδ). Binding studies, initially using chimeras and subsequently point mutants, show that εThr-176/εAla-177 (Pro/Glu in γ/δ) contribute entirely to insensitivity of the αε interface to NmmI. The observation that α-bungarotoxin association is only slightly affected by the γ and ε sequence differences suggests that this region of the γ, ε, and δ subunits is not used equivalently for stabilization of the entire family of bound α-neurotoxins. At the present time, it is unclear whether stabilization from this region is unique to some of the short α-neurotoxins, or the long α-neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin, acquire the bulk of their stabilization energy from other portions of the structure. Distinct differences in specificity between the short and long neurotoxins have been noted for the α7 subtype of nAChR (24Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Residues at the γ175/176 positions were previously unrecognized as determinants of ligand binding. However, they are immediately adjacent to γAsp-174, which was shown by cross-linking to be ∼9 Å away from Cys-192/193 in the α subunit (25Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and was shown to influence the affinity of quaternary agonists and antagonists (27Martin M.D. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10742-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Osaka H. Sugiyama N. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12758-12765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, the adjacent residues of γPhe-172 (δAsp-178, εIle-173) are known to confer site-selectivity to the smaller competitive peptide inhibitors such as α-conotoxin MI (29Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and waglerin (30Molles B.E. Kline E.F. Sine S.M. McArdle J.J. Taylor P. J. Physiol. (paris). 1998; 92 (abstr.): 470Crossref Google Scholar). The equivalent region of the α7 subunit (Asp-163, Ile-164, and Ser-165), which presumably forms a homomeric pentamer of subunits, constitutes part of a putative Ca2+ binding region that faces the ligand binding site (31Galzi J.L. Bertrand S. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5824-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the α subunit interface of the binding site, both aromatic (Tyr-190, Tyr-198) and anionic (Asp-200) residues were mapped to the α-toxin binding surface (19Ackermann E.J. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12836-12844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here, we identify another anionic residue in the γ subunit, Glu-176, perhaps restricted in its position by a neighboring secondary amino acid Pro-175, on the γ subunit, as a crucial residue for binding.The significant linkage between Glu-176 and cationic residues in loop II of the toxin suggests that an electrostatic interaction contributes to the tight binding of the NmmI/nAChR complex. Because the linkage obtained from charge reversal is greater for Lys-27 than for Arg-33 and Arg-36, one would predict that the portion of loop II proximal to loop III of the toxin, is closest to the γ subunit (cf. Fig.5). In this analysis, the loss of free energy (ΔΔG) associated with a single charge mutation results from all interactions between the charged residue and its multiple neighboring residues. The pairwise interactions (ΔΔG INT) resulting in charge reversal of specified residues in the interacting molecules should then highlight the strength of interaction coming from the paired charged residues. In the absence of significant changes in conformation or hydration, ΔΔG INT from Equation 2 should largely reflect the Coulombic interaction between the respective paired residues (32Faiman G.A. Horovitz A. Protein Science. 1996; 9: 315-316Google Scholar).Extensive studies on a related short neurotoxin, erabutoxin a, involving mutations at 36 toxin positions clearly revealed the importance of the tips of loops situated on the concave face of the toxin (33Pillet L.

Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These investigations showed that the K27E mutation of erabutoxin a decreases its affinity more than 100-fold forTorpedo nAChRs. Photo-activable p-azidobenzoyl and p-azidosalicyl groups attached to Lys-26 (analogous position at Lys-27 of NmmI) of neurotoxin II labeled γ and δ subunits of the receptor upon photolysis (11Kreienkamp H.J. Utkin Y.N. Weise C. Machold J. Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Machold J. Weise C. Utkin Y. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three different photoactivatable groups attached to the equivalent residue Lys-23 of a long neurotoxin, toxin 3, also labeled predominantly the γ and δ subunits in preference to the α subunit (13Utkin Y.N. Krivoshein A.V. Davydov V.L. Kasheverov I.E. Franke P. Maslennikov I.V. Arseniev A.S. Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus mutagenesis and chemical labeling studies showed a crucial role of lysine at position 27 and its proximity to γ and δ subunits. Here, our mutant cycle studies delineate the interaction between Glu-176 of the γ subunit and Lys-27 of NmmI toxin. The largest linkage in loop II between K27E and γE176K (ΔΔG = −5.9kcal/mol) and smaller linkages (ΔΔG INT = −1.6 to −3.0 kcal/mol) found previously between K27E and α subunit residues of Val-188, Tyr-190, Pro-197, and Asp-200 (35Ackermann E.J.

A more complete elucidation of α-toxin-receptor interactions should enable us to orient a docked α-toxin with respect to the subunit interfaces, as well as refine existing models of the structure of the extracellular domain of the receptor (4Tsigelny I.

This phosphorylation was accompanied by a stimulation in choline kinase activity. In vitro, protein kinase A phosphorylated choline kinase on a serine residue with a stoichiometry (0.44 mol of phosphate/mol of choline kinase) consistent with one phosphorylation site/choline kinase subunit. The major phosphopeptide derived from the enzyme phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A was common to one of the major phosphopeptides derived from the enzyme phosphorylated in vivo. Protein kinase A activity was dose- and time-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of ATP (Km 2.1 μm) and choline kinase (Km0.12 μm). Phosphorylation of choline kinase with protein kinase A resulted in a stimulation (1.9-fold) in choline kinase activity whereas alkaline phosphatase treatment of choline kinase resulted in a 60% decrease in choline kinase activity. The mechanism of the protein kinase A-mediated stimulation in choline kinase activity involved an increase in the apparent V max values with respect to ATP (2.6-fold) and choline (2.7-fold).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CDP-DAG pathway is used primarily by cells cultured in the absence of exogenous choline. The PC synthesized by this pathway is constantly metabolized to free choline and phosphatidate (PA) via the reaction catalyzed by phospholipase D (2Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The free choline is then incorporated back into PC by the CDP-choline pathway, and the PA is recycled back into PC and into other phospholipids (e.g.phosphatidylinositol (PI)) by the CDP-DAG pathway (2Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants defective in the reactions leading from phosphatidylserine (PS) to PC in the CDP-DAG pathway require choline for growth to synthesize PC by the CDP-choline pathway (2Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the CDP-choline pathway is important to overall lipid synthesis and to cell physiology. Activation of the CDP-choline pathway, brought about by the unregulated synthesis of CTP, causes significant increases in the synthesis of PC and PA and a decrease in the synthesis of PS (4Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This activation is accompanied by an increase in total neutral lipid content at the expense of total phospholipids (4Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These changes in lipid metabolism are characteristic of the stress-like condition of the stationary phase (5Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proper regulation of the CDP-choline pathway is further underscored by the fact that the synthesis of PC by this pathway is lethal in the absence of a functional PI/PC transfer protein (Sec14p) (6Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitkin J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 7McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sec14p, which plays an essential role in vesicle budding from the Golgi complex, functions to down-regulate the CDP-choline pathway (8Fang M. Rivas M.P. Bankaitis V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Apparently, too much PC synthesis by the CDP-choline pathway is detrimental to the secretory process. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the committed step in the CDP-choline pathway is choline kinase (ATP:choline phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.32) (9Wittenberg J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The regulation of this enzyme should play an important role in PC synthesis by the CDP-choline pathway. Choline kinase is encoded by the CKI1 gene (10Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is regulated by the growth phase of cells and by inositol and choline supplementation (11Hosaka K. Murakami T. Kodaki T. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2005-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic regulation of choline kinase by these factors occurs in coordination with the regulation of other enzymes in the CDP-choline and CDP-DAG pathways (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Henry S.A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 61: 133-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known about the biochemical regulation of choline kinase. The recent purification of the yeast CKI1-encoded choline kinase has facilitated defined studies on the regulation of its enzyme activity (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Data indicate that choline kinase is allosterically regulated by ATP and ADP and that this regulation may be physiologically relevant (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the regulation of choline kinase activity, we have examined the consequence of phosphorylation of the enzyme by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Protein kinase A is the principal mediator of signals transmitted through the RAS-cAMP pathway in S. cerevisiae(14Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that the activation of theRAS-cAMP pathway can mediate the phosphorylation and activation of choline kinase in vivo. In addition, pure choline kinase was a substrate for protein kinase A, and the phosphorylation of choline kinase resulted in the stimulation of choline kinase activity. All chemicals were reagent grade. Yeast growth medium supplies were from Difco Laboratories. Nucleotides, choline, phosphocholine, ammonium reinecke, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, benzamide, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, bovine serum albumin, phosphoamino acids, TPCK-trypsin, and nitrocellulose paper were from Sigma. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit (bovine heart) was from Promega. Phosphocellulose papers were from Pierce. Radiochemicals, RennesanceTM immunoblotting kit and EN(3)-HANCE spray were from NEN Life Science Products. The IMMUNOcatcherTM immunoprecipitation kit was from CytoSignal Presearch Products. Scintillation counting supplies were from National Diagnostics. Protein assay reagent, electrophoresis reagents, molecular mass standards, and immunochemical reagents were from Bio-Rad. Alkaline phosphatase was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Silica Gel G thin layer plates were from Analtech, and cellulose thin layer sheets were from EM Science. Choline kinase was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae strain W303-1A (MAT a ade2-1, his3-11, 15, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100) (16Thomas B. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) by transformation (17Ito H. Yasuki F. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the multicopy plasmid pCK1D (10Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid contains the CKI1gene and directs the overexpression of choline kinase (10Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete synthetic medium (18Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without leucine to the exponential phase of growth (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) at 30 °C. To examine the effect of the RAS-cAMP pathway on the phosphorylation of choline kinase in vivo, cells were grown in YEPA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% acetate). Cell numbers were detected by microscopic examination with a hemacytometer. Exponential phase cells grown in YEPA medium were labeled in low phosphate (19Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) YEPA medium with 32Pi (0.3 mCi/ml) andl-14C(U)-amino acids (5 μCi/ml) for 4 h. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 5% to activate theRAS-cAMP pathway (20Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar). At the indicated time intervals, labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted with glass beads in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Choline kinase was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with purified anti-choline kinase antibodies (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the IMMUNOcatcherTM immunoprecipitation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Choline kinase was dissociated from the enzyme-antibody complex (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and the amount of label incorporated into the enzyme was determined by scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitated enzyme was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads for seven 30-s bursts with a 1-min pause between bursts using a Mini-Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol (22Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell extract) was used for enzyme assays. CKI1-encoded choline kinase was expressed in Sf-9 insect cells and purified to homogeneity from the cytosolic fraction by chromatography with concanavalin A, Affi-Gel Blue, and Mono Q (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 128 μmol/min/mg. Purified choline kinase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A using the bovine heart catalytic subunit. This enzyme is structurally and functionally similar to the S. cerevisiae protein kinase A catalytic subunit (23Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The protein kinase A preparation used in our studies was judged to be electrophoretically pure and phosphorylated casein with the activity stated by the manufacturer under the assay conditions used here. Phosphorylation reactions were measured for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 40 μl. Choline kinase (12 μg/ml) was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μm[γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/nmol), 10 mmMgCl2, and the indicated concentrations of protein kinase A. At the end of the phosphorylation reactions, samples were treated with 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The incorporation of phosphate into choline kinase was determined by scintillation counting of phosphorylated enzyme excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices. Alternatively, the protein kinase A phosphorylation reactions were performed with unlabeled ATP. After incubation with protein kinase A, the reaction mixtures were diluted 2-fold, and choline kinase activity was measured as described below. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) was performed with 9% slab gels. Molecular mass standards were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Immunoblot assays were performed with affinity-purified anti-choline kinase antibodies as described previously (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The density of the choline kinase bands on immunoblots was quantified by scanning densitometry. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Choline kinase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel slices containing 32P-labeled choline kinase were treated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C for 30 h to elute the enzyme. Bovine serum albumin (50 μg) was added to the samples as carrier protein, and trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 20%. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Proteins were washed three times with cold acetone and dried in vacuo. Samples were then subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6 n HCl at 100 °C for 4 h. The hydrolysates were dried in vacuo and applied to 0.1-mm cellulose thin layer chromatography plates with 2.5 μg of phosphoserine, 2.5 μg of phosphothreonine, and 5 μg of phosphotyrosine as carrier phosphoamino acids in water. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (25Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the plates were dried, sprayed with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone to visualize carrier phosphoamino acids, and subjected to PhosphorImaging analysis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices containing32P-labeled choline kinase were subjected to proteolysis using TPCK-trypsin (0.15 mg/ml) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 16 h at 37 °C (26Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7282-7288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed and retained. Fresh TPCK-trypsin was added to the gel slices for an additional 11 h of proteolysis. The digest was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was again removed and retained. The gel slices were then incubated in water for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and added to the previously retained supernatants. The combined supernatants were driedin vacuo. Samples were resuspended in 1 ml of water and dried again. This process was repeated four times. The samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 1% ammonium carbonate, clarified by centrifugation, and spotted on cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (27Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of phosphopeptides was accomplished by electrophoresis in 1% ammonium bicarbonate at 1,000 volts for 35 min followed by ascending chromatography (n-butyl alcohol/glacial acetic acid/pyridine/water, 10:3:12:15) for 7 h (27Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21113-21117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried plates were then subjected to PhosphorImaging analysis. Alkaline phosphatase was used to dephosphorylate choline kinase. Dephosphorylation reactions performed for 20 min in a total volume of 20 μl. Choline kinase (12 μg/ml) was incubated with 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 100 μmol/min/mg alkaline phosphatase. The amount of alkaline phosphatase activity was based on the activity obtained using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The alkaline phosphatase reaction was terminated by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF and 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate). The dephosphorylated enzyme preparation was used for the measurement of choline kinase activity and for phosphorylation with protein kinase A. Choline kinase activity was measured for 10 min at 30 °C by following the formation of 3H-labeled phosphocholine from [methyl-3H]choline (500 cpm/nmol) as described previously (28Porter T.J. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 67 mm glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.5), 5 mm choline, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 60 μl. Radiolabeled phosphocholine was separated from the radiolabeled substrate by the precipitation of the substrate as choline reineckate (28Porter T.J. Kent C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The amount of labeled product in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. The product phosphocholine was identified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system of methanol, 0.5% sodium chloride, and ammonia hydroxide (50:50:1) (29Teegarden D. Taparowsky E.J. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6042-6047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the labeled phosphocholine on chromatograms was determined by fluorography using EN(3)-HANCE and compared with a standard. Protein kinase A activity was measured by following the phosphorylation of casein with 4 μCi/nmol [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 15 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml casein. Reactions were terminated by loading samples onto phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid and subjected to scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate with an average S.D. of ± 3%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT enzyme kinetic model fitting program (31Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We addressed the question of whether choline kinase was phosphorylated in vivo. Yeast cells were labeled with 32Pifollowed by the immunoprecipitation of choline kinase from cell extracts with anti-choline kinase antibodies. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitate and autoradiographic analysis revealed that choline kinase was in fact phosphorylated in vivo. The identity of choline kinase in the immunoprecipitate was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoprecipitated32P-labeled choline kinase was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Choline kinase was phosphorylated on a serine residue(s) (Fig. 2 A). TPCK-trypsin digestion of the enzyme phosphorylated in vivo yielded several phosphopeptides upon phosphopeptide mapping analysis (Fig.3 A).Figure 3Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of32P-labeled choline kinase phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro. Panel A, choline kinase was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts of yeast cells labeled with 32Pi and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Panel B, pure choline kinase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A using [γ-32P]ATP followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel slices containing32P-labeled choline kinase were digested with TPCK-trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated on cellulose thin layer sheets by electrophoresis (from left to right) in the first dimension and by chromatography (from bottom totop) in the second dimension. The phosphopeptide common to each map is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Phosphorylation by protein kinase A is a major mechanism of cellular regulation in S. cerevisiae (14Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 79-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To examine whether the phosphorylation of choline kinase was mediated by protein kinase A in vivo, the extent of enzyme phosphorylation was measured in cells that were activated in the RAS-cAMP pathway. The RAS-cAMP pathway is activated by the addition of glucose to nonfermenting cells (15Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose triggers a transient increase in cAMP levels, protein kinase A activity, and the phosphorylation of enzymes known to be substrates for protein kinase A (15Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing theCKI1 gene were grown in YEPA medium to attenuate theRAS-cAMP pathway (20Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar) and then incubated for 4 h with32Pi to detect phosphorylated choline kinase and l-14C(U)-amino acids to normalize for the amount of choline kinase isolated. The ratio of cpm of 32P incorporated into choline kinase to the counts of 14C incorporated into choline kinase was used to examine the extent of phosphorylation. Glucose (5%) was added to the growth medium to activate protein kinase A activity (20Thevelein J.M. Beullens M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar), choline kinase was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and the amount of each label incorporated into the enzyme was determined. The addition of glucose to the growth medium resulted in a time-dependent and transient increase in the phosphorylation of choline kinase (Fig.4). In a separate experiment, cell extracts were prepared from unlabeled cells activated in theRAS-cAMP pathway, and choline activity was measured. Activation of the pathway caused a transient increase in choline kinase activity which paralleled the increase in choline kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 4). The maximum increase in choline kinase phosphorylation (2.6-fold) and in choline kinase activity (3.2-fold) occurred 2 min after the addition of glucose to the medium. To determine whether choline kinase was a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase A in vitro, we determined if protein kinase A catalyzed the incorporation of the γ phosphate of32P-labeled ATP into purified choline kinase. After the phosphorylation reaction, samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that choline kinase was indeed a substrate for protein kinase A. Protein kinase A activity was dependent on the concentration of protein kinase A (Fig. 5 A) and the time of the reaction (Fig. 5 B) using choline kinase as substrate. The dependence of protein kinase A activity on the concentration of ATP and choline kinase was examined. Protein kinase A activity followed typical saturation kinetics with respect to ATP (Fig.6 A). The K mvalue for ATP was 2.1 μm. Protein kinase A activity did not follow saturation kinetics with respect to choline kinase (Fig.6 B). Instead, the enzyme followed positive cooperative kinetics (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar) as demonstrated by the double-reciprocal plot of the data, where the curve was not linear but concave upward. An analysis of the data according to the Hill equation yielded a Hill number and aK m value for choline kinase of 1.78 and 0.12 μm, respectively. The cooperative kinetic behavior of protein kinase A with respect to choline kinase may be a reflection of the fact that choline kinase exists in dimeric and other oligomeric forms (13Kim K.-H. Voelker D.R. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6844-6852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Figure 6Dependence of protein kinase A activity on the concentrations of ATP and choline kinase.

Panel B, protein kinase A (100 pmol/min/ml) and 15 μm[γ-32P]ATP were incubated with the indicated concentrations of choline kinase for 10 min.

Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 2Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7047-7050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the complexity of the mammalian genome, initiation of replication has been studied in greater detail in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. However, a number of techniques, including methods for the isolation of newly synthesized DNA in combination with competitive PCR techniques, have led to the identification of new mammalian replication initiation regions as well as characterization of additional initiation sites at established origins (3Giacca M.

The best example of such a region is the extensively studied initiation region mapped downstream of the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) (4Pelizon C. Diviacco S. Fallaschi A.

Metazoan chromosomal origins of replication comprise specific sequence motifs. Replication initiation elements can be moved to new chromosomal sites and still initiate replication (9Handeli S.

The ability of specific mammalian DNA sequences to support autonomous replication of plasmids into which they have been inserted has been used in the past as an assay for the presence of an origin of replication in that sequence (13Frappier L.

In several instances, the ability of certain specific sequences to support autonomous replication of plasmids has been directly validated by mapping of the same sequences as chromosomal initiation sites for replication in living cells (16Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T.O. Todd A. Price G.B. Gene. 1994; 151: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whereas only a few origins of replication have been identified in mammals, certain sequence motifs have been found to be common in most of these origins (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These motifs include A/T-rich regions, ATTA and ATTTA nuclear matrix attachment motifs, and yeast ARS consensus sequence elements (WTTTATRTTTW), identified in autonomously replicating sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Kipling D. Kearsey S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Palzkill T.G. Newlon C.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 441-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an origin binding activity (OBA)1 was recently purified from HeLa cells (23Ruiz M.T. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) through its ability to bind to the 186-bp minimal replication origin of ors 8 (13Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and a 36-bp sequence (A3/4) that is found in a number of mammalian replication origins. OBA sediments at approximately 150 kDa in a glycerol gradient, and it cofractionates with DNA polymerases α and δ, topoisomerase II, and replication protein A (23Ruiz M.T. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition to genetic elements, epigenetic components such as DNA modification by methylation and chromatin structure, have been proposed to be characteristic determinants of origins of replication (6Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,25Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that origins of replication like regulatory regions of genes are differentially methylated (26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that nonmethylated CpG islands are enriched in early replicating nascent DNA (6Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, because of the limited number of mammalian origins of replication that have been characterized thus far, it is still too early to draw general conclusions regarding the critical genetic and epigenetic determinants of origin function and its differential regulation. Additional origins have to be characterized to allow for understanding of the general rules governing origin function in mammals. DNA methylation is a post-replicative covalent modification of DNA that is catalyzed by the DNA-methyltransferase enzyme (DNMT1) (27Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 28Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance.

In vertebrates, 60–80% of cytosines in CpG sequences are methylated; the nonmethylated CpGs are distributed in a nonrandom manner, generating a pattern of methylation that is gene- and tissue-specific (28Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, New York1984Google Scholar). Recent breakthroughs have provided conclusive molecular evidence for the hypothesis that DNA methylation of a gene represses its expression (27Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar,30Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 157-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). DNA methylation can repress gene expression directly by inhibiting binding of transcription factors to regulatory sequences (30Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 157-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) or indirectly, by signaling the binding of factors specific for methylated DNA (31Becker P.B. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 51: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Razin A. Cedar H. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 451-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two methylated DNA-binding proteins, methyl-CpG-binding proteins MeCP2 and MeCP1 (30Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 157-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 33Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), that can repress transcription in a methylation-dependent manner, have been recently characterized. The carboxyl-terminal half of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 contains a repressor domain that associates with the transcription repressor mSin3A and histone deacetylase (34Nan X. Ng H.-H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar, 35Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J.C. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Because DNA replication and methylation are catalyzed by different enzymes, it is likely that vertebrates have developed multiple mechanisms to coordinate the replication of the genetic and epigenetic information (36Szyf M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that the expression of the dnmt1 gene encoding the maintenance DNMT1 enzyme is regulated with the growth state of cells (37Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that methylation of DNA occurs concurrently with replication (26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that coordinates methylation of nascent DNA with its replication is the binding of DNMT1 to proliferating cell nuclear antigen at the replication fork during the S-phase of the cycle (38Chuang L.S-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). P21, a cyclin kinase inhibitor that triggers cell arrest, competes with DNMT1 for proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding and could dislodge it from the replication fork (38Chuang L.S-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We have previously resolved the genomic structure of the gene encoding the human DNMT1 and showed that it is composed of at least 40 exons and 39 introns spanning a distance of 60 kb (29Ramchandani S. Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). While characterizing the 5′ regulatory regions of dnmt1, we identified an intronic sequence immediately upstream of exon 2 that comprised many of the sequence elements previously described for replication initiation regions (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that this region of the dnmt1 locus contains initiation sites for DNA replication, thus physically linking the regulatory region of the gene encoding the DNMT1 enzyme with an origin of replication in human cells. Using several lines of evidence based on autonomous replication assays, OBA binding assays and in vivo mapping by competitive PCR, we propose that the 5′ region of the dnmt1 gene comprises functional initiation sites for DNA replication. HeLa cells (monolayers) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The c1 construct (see Fig.1 A) was generated using genomic subclones of thednmt1 pFTR1 that were previously described (29Ramchandani S. Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). pFTR1 was digested with XbaI, and a 2.38-kb fragment-containing intronic sequence immediately upstream of exon 2 was isolated and inserted into a XbaI-digested pBluescript SK-plasmid. The 2.38-kb insert was fully sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using a T7 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following oligonucleotide duplexes containing putative OBA binding sites were used: A3/4 oligonucleotides, 5′-CCTCAAGTCTCCAATTTTCCTTTGGCAAATTCCl (sense), 5′-GGAATTTGCCAAAGGAAAATTGGAGACCATTTGAGG (antisense); A3/4 homologous (dnmt1) oligonucleotides, 5′-TGTTATGGGCTGTTGTCAGACCCAACTGG (sense), 5′-TCCAGTTGGGTCTGACAACAGCCCATAACAA (antisense). The sense oligonucleotides were radiolabeled in a mixture containing 5 μl of oligonucleotide, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) in a final volume of 50 μl and purified on a Sephadex G25 microcolumn (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antisense strand was then added (1 μg), and the duplex was annealed following 5 min of boiling and gradual cooling of the reaction mixture to room temperature. The DNA binding reaction contained 10 ng of labeled duplex DNA, 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/μl), 2 μl of 3A buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 40% glycerol), 2 μl of 40 nm ATP, and 200 ng of purified OBA in a 20-μl final volume. In the competition experiments, 10 μg of the respective cold oligonucleotide competitor were added. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min on ice and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel for 1 h and 30 min at 180 V. The gel was then dried and exposed for autoradiography. 5 μg of the c1 construct and pBluescript SK were each separately transfected into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, and the autonomous replication assay based on bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and density shift was performed as described previously (13Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Landry S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primers were used for the dnmt1 locus (bp 1 was assigned to the first 5′ bp of the c1 construct): c1 region, 5′-AGAGACATCCTGAAGAATGAGTT (p1, sense, starting at bp 240), 5′-AGTGAGCCGTGATTGCATCA (p2, antisense, starting at bp 643), 5′-GATTGCATCAGGGGCAGGTCATATAGTTGG (primer used to design competitor at c1); c2 region, 5′-AGACGTAGAGTTACATCCAG (p3, sense, ∼6.3 kb downstream of p2), 5′-GCTCTTTCAGGTTCTTCTGC (p4, antisense, ∼ 7 kb downstream of p2), 5′-TTACATCCAGAATCAGGAACGCGCACTGAA (primer used to design competitor at c2); c3 region, 5′-CTACAGGCTCAAGCCACCAT (p5, sense, starting at bp 2906), 5′-TTCCCAAGCTATTCACTAGT (p6, antisense, starting at bp 3300), 5′-ATTCACTAGTCAGGCAATGCTGTCTCAGTC (primer used to design competitor at c3); c4 region, 5′-CACTCTAGACTGCGGGG (p7, sense, starting at bp 1718), 5′-TCATGCCATTGCACTCTAGC (p8, antisense, starting at bp 2159), 5′-GCACTCTAGCACCACCCAACTATTAGCAGC (primer used to design competitor at c4); c5 region, 5′-CTCCCGAGTTCAAGCAATTC (p9, sense, ∼4 kb upstream of p1), 5′-GCTGTACAGGGGAAGAGCTG (p10, antisense, ∼ 3.5 kb upstream of p1), 5′-CAAGCAATTCGACTGGGTTTTGCCATGTTG (primer used to design competitor at c5). Approximate distances between some of thednmt1 primers were calculated from Southern blot analysis (28Yisraeli J. Szyf M. Razin A. Cedar H. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, New York1984Google Scholar). The following primers were used for the c-myc locus (GenBank™ accession number J00120): MO region, 5′-TGCCGTGGAATAACACAAAA (p11, sense, starting at bp 761), 5′-CTTTCCAGGTCCTCTTTCCC (p12, antisense, starting at bp 1134), 5′-TAACACAAAAGATCATTTCAGGGAGCAAAC (primer used to design competitor at MO); MF region, 5′-GGTTCTAAGATGCTTCCTGG (p13, sense, starting at bp 7848), 5′-ATGGGTCCAGATTGCTGCTT (p14, antisense, starting at bp 8299), 5′-TGCTTCCTGGGAGAAGGTGAGAGGTAGGCA (primer used to design competitor at MF). The PCR reactions for c1 and c2 regions were performed as follows: 3 min at 94 °C, then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR reactions for the remaining regions were performed as follows: 3 min at 94 °C, then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. Isolation of nascent DNA, c-myc PCR primer design, and competitor construction were done as described previously (5Tao L. Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell.

The following primers were used for the dnmt1 site (bp 1 was assigned to the first 5′ bp of the c1 construct): 5′-TTATGTTGTTTAGGGTTGGATT (Morif 1, sense, starting at bp 6); 5′-TTTATAAGTTATTTTTTTATTATAGTT (Morif 2, sense, starting at bp 38) 5′-AAAACAACCAACTAATATTCCT (Birom 1, antisense, starting at bp 415); 5′-TCAAAATAATAACCCAAAACCA (Birom 2, antisense, starting at bp 451). Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously (26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of a 2.38-kb construct (c1 construct) (Fig. 1, A andB)-containing intronic sequence immediately upstream of exon 2 revealed several sequence elements that are associated with characterized origins of replication (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These elements include a 536-bp stretch that is 77% A/T-rich, at least 19 ATTA and ATTTA nuclear matrix attachment motifs (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a perfect match of the 11-bp ARS consensus sequence (WTTTRTATTTW) of the yeast S. cerevisiae(22Palzkill T.G. Newlon C.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 441-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a methylated CpG cluster (25Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a region homologous to the binding site of OBA, a human origin binding activity (23Ruiz M.T. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the dnmt1 sequence indeed contained an origin of replication, we first tested the ability of the c1 construct to support autonomous replication using a density shift assay following bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into nascent DNA, as described previously (13Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Landry S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Pelletier R. Mah D. Landry S. Matheos D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results (Fig.2 A) demonstrate a density shift of the c1 construct corresponding to incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into one (heavy-light) or both of the nascent DNA strands (heavy-heavy), indicating one and two or more rounds of replication, respectively. The SK plasmid vector, on the other hand, did not exhibit a similar shift, and all plasmid DNA was recovered in the unreplicated (light-light) form of input DNA (Fig. 2 B). The linearity of each gradient was verified by measuring the refractive index of every other fraction. Sequence analysis revealed a 30-bp stretch that is 86% homologous to the 36 bp A3/4 sequence, identified as part of the binding site for OBA. 2M. Ruiz, D. Matheos, G. B. Price, and M. Zannis-Hadjopoulos, submitted for publication. An oligonucleotide of this 30-bp dnmt1 sequence was synthesized, and its binding activity to OBA was assayed by gel retardation in the presence of excess nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC). The results (Fig.3) show that the dnmt1oligonucleotide is able to bind to and form a complex with OBA (lane 3) of the same size as the complex formed when the 36 bp A3/4 oligonucleotide is used (lane 6). This binding is specific, because the dnmt1 oligonucleotide was able to compete for the OBA binding (lanes 4 and 8) as effectively as the 36-bp A3/4 oligonucleotide when it was used as competitor (lanes 5 and 7). To quantitatively analyze the replication origin activity of the c1 construct and map the initiation site(s) in it, a series of competitive PCR experiments were performed to measure and compare nascent DNA abundance of five different regions within thednmt1 locus (Fig. 4). The top gel (Fig. 4 AI) of each of the regions (c1-c5, MO, and MF) corresponds to the competitive PCR amplification of HeLa genomic DNA used to standardize the differences among primers and competitors with respect to their amplification efficiencies. The linearity of each of the competitive PCR analysis was verified by plotting the ratio of competitor DNA concentration over target DNA concentration (y axis) versus the concentration of competitor DNA (x axis) (Fig. 4 B). Small nascent DNA ranging in size between 800 bp to 1.3 kb was isolated by the nascent strand extrusion method (5Tao L. Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Mol.

Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The bottom gel (Fig. 4 AII) of each of the regions (c1-c5, MO, and MF) corresponds to the competitive PCR amplification of HeLa nascent DNA, and the bar graphs of the c-myclocus (Fig. 4 C) and the dnmt1 locus (Fig.4 D) represent the nascent DNA abundance obtained by the respective competitive PCR assays. Two regions, MO and MF, within the well characterized initiation region associated with thec-myc gene (39Vassilev L.T. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4899-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were used as control for the quality of the nascent DNA preparation (Fig. 4 C). The results (Fig.4 C) show that a previously characterized c-mycorigin of replication (MO) is present in the nascent DNA preparation at 6 × 10 3 copies of nascent DNA, whereas no signal is observed for a region located 7 kb downstream from the origin of replication (MF), indicating that the nascent DNA used did not contain degraded parental DNA (5Tao L. Nielsen T. Friedlander P. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The same preparation of nascent DNA was used to determine the relative abundance of five regions within thednmt1 locus. The results (Fig. 4 D) indicate that two regions of DNA located between the first intron and the seventh exon of dnmt1 (c1 and c3) are highly abundant in the nascent DNA fraction, containing approximately 3 × 10 4copies of nascent DNA each. In contrast, the relative abundance of regions of dnmt1 residing approximately 3 kb upstream of the c1 region (c5) or 5 kb downstream of the c3 region (c2) are far less abundant, containing 6 × 10 3 copies of nascent DNA (c5) and no nascent DNA (c2), respectively. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that at least two major initiation sites for DNA replication are localized between the first intron and exon 7 of thednmt1 gene. A number of origins of replication, among them ori β at the dhfr locus, have been previously shown to be associated with a methylated CpG cluster (25Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas other origins of replication have been shown to be unmethylated in the associated CpG sequences (6Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting differential methylation of replication origins. To determine whetherdnmt1 is associated with either a methylated or unmethylated CpG cluster, we performed a bisulfite methylation mapping analysis of a CpG cluster located within the c1 construct region (Fig.5 A). Twelve clones were selected, and the eight CpGs residing in this region were analyzed in each clone with respect to their methylation status. Six of them were methylated in all clones tested; 1 CpG was unmethylated, and interestingly, 1 CpG was methylated in 6 of the 12 clones tested (Fig.5, A and B). A sample result (Fig. 5 B) of the bisulfite analysis indicates the methylated CpGs and their respective positions. The results show that the dnmt1initiation region is associated with a methylated CpG cluster, as was previously demonstrated for the dhfr ori β (25Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This paper describes the identification of initiation sites for DNA replication located between the first intron and exon 7 of thednmt1 locus. This finding is supported by several lines of evidence. First, a plasmid containing the c1 region of dnmt1is able to replicate autonomously. Second, this region contains a binding recognition sequence and binds to OBA, a protein that binds to origins of replication. Third, this region of dnmt1 contains several sequence elements characteristic of known origins of DNA replication, such as, an A/T-rich region, matrix attachment motifs, a methylated CpG cluster, and a perfect match to the yeast ARS consensus sequence (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, this region is abundant in nascent DNA, as are other characterized origins of replication, as determined by competitive PCR. Two primary replication initiation sites were identified, one localized in the c1 region and another localized in the c3 region; these regions are approximately 2 kb apart from each other (Fig. 4 D). This finding is similar to recently described observations in the Chinese hamster ovary dhfr origin of replication, where initiation was shown to occur primarily from two sites, ori β and ori β′ (7Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper further support the previous observations that regions of initiation of DNA replication share common sequence features (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A 536-bp, 77% A/T-rich element is present in the c1 region of the dnmt1 locus, suggesting a possible function as a low melting region or as a DNA-unwinding element (21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This region also contains a perfect match for the yeast ARS consensus sequence, although previous reports have indicated that these sequences are not essential for mammalian origin function (18Todd A. Landry S. Khoury V. Pearson C.E. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 81-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nineteen ATTA and ATTTA matrix attachment motifs are present in the 2.4-kb c1 construct; these motifs constitute the core elements recognized by the homeobox domain from species as divergent as flies and humans and are frequently present in matrix attachment sites of several eukaryotic genes in addition to numerous eukaryotic and viral origins of DNA replication (41Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A methylated CpG cluster is associated with the dnmt1replication initiation region. DNA methylation is now recognized as a fundamental mechanism of epigenetic regulation of genomic processes such as transcription, recombination, imprinting, development, carcinogenesis, and replication timing (36Szyf M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Some origins of replication bear a cluster of heavily methylated CpG sites (25Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas other origins, such as c-myc, are associated with a nonmethylated CpG cluster (26Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taking these findings into account, it seems that origins of replication exhibit differential methylation patterns similar to those observed in promoter elements of several genes (36Szyf M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 219-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It remains unclear what role methylation plays in replication. It has been recently suggested that early activated origins are associated with nonmethylated CpG islands (6Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The identification of origins that are representative of either methylation profile will allow the testing of the hypothesis that methylation plays a role in differential activation of origins of replication. The c1 construct containing all the structural elements mentioned above is able to support episomal autonomous replication when transfected into HeLa cells. Results from utilization of in vivo assays of autonomous replication have been controversial, because some studies have demonstrated that only large fragments (>10 kb) could support autonomous replication (15Heinzel S.S. Krysan P.J. Tran C.T. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas several other studies showed that small specific sequences could successfully support autonomous replication (13Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14McWhinney C. Leffak M.

Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, plasmids carrying ori β of the dhfr locus replicated autonomously both in vivo and in vitro regardless of their size, whereas plasmids of equivalent size inserts, but with random sequence, did not (16Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T.O. Todd A. Price G.B. Gene. 1994; 151: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the capacity of several specific sequences to support autonomous replication of plasmids correlates directly with their chromosomal mapping sites (16Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Pearson C.E. Nielsen T.O. Todd A. Price G.B. Gene. 1994; 151: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Regarding the significance of the co-localization of initiation of replication with the regulatory region of the dnmt1 gene, an attractive possibility would be that the physical association of thednmt1 regulatory region with initiation sites for DNA replication plays a role in coordinating the replication of the genetic information with that of the epigenetic information. Future experiments should resolve this question. In summary, several lines of evidence, both structural and functional, demonstrate the presence of at least two major initiation sites for DNA replication residing in the region contained between the first intron and exon 7 of the dnmt1 locus."

When the YMAI region was mutated to the corresponding amino acids in the DHP-insensitive channel α1A, the resultant channel was still sensitive to PAAs and BZTs (20Cai D. Mulle J.G. Yue D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the high affinity binding site YMAI, however, is not the minimal requirement for drug binding. Less detailed structural information is known regarding the mechanism of use-dependent block, a feature that is critical to the therapeutically useful calcium antagonists. These drugs preferentially inhibit channels during high electric activity as observed in certain cardiac arrhythmias and diseases such as ischemic heart disease. During repetitive depolarizations, block by PAA and BZT accumulates in a frequency- and voltage-dependent manner as a result of additional drug binding during each depolarization that fails to dissociate at the resting potential between depolarizations. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of inactivation in the mechanism of use-dependent calcium block by phenylalkylamines (21Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukow S. Streissnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13323-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results have established that Phe1164 and Val1165 contribute to the BZT-binding site resulting in a decrease in block by diltiazem (22Kraus R.L. Hering S. Grabner M. Ostler D. Streissnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Ba2+ currents from these channels also exhibited a slowed inactivation rate when these residues were replaced by alanine (22Kraus R.L. Hering S. Grabner M. Ostler D. Streissnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, according to the guarded receptor hypothesis (23Starmer C.F. Grant A.O. Strauss H.C. Biophys. J. 1984; 46: 15-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the molecular elements responsible for this effect may be distinct from the structures that specify simple or tonic binding. In order to determine the structural features of the calcium channel responsible for use-dependent block, we introduced mutations in motif IVS5 of the human heart α1C calcium channel utilizing homologous regions of the rat brain sodium channel 2a. Two of these mutations lost the characteristic use-dependent block by PAA and BZT, whereas the use-dependent block by isradipine was fully retained. These results demonstrate a differential loss of use-dependent block with BZT and PAA but not for isradipine and implicate for the first time a role for motif IVS5 in this phenomenon. The wild type and mutant human α1Ccalcium channel cDNAs were first constructed in pBluescript for expression in Xenopus oocytes and then subsequently placed into pAGS-3 (24Miyazaki J.-I. Takaki S.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) either as the full-length channel or as a channel deleted at the carboxyl-terminal glycine 1633 (25Wei X. Neely A.

Biochem. 1998; 185: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This cellular strategy was designed to utilize the higher expression level of the carboxyl-terminal truncated form of the channel. Site-directed mutations were introduced by incorporating a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. Mutant oligonucleotides of IVS5 (except for HHT-5658) were synthesized in the sense direction as follows: HHT-5371, CTGTGACCTCACATGTCCTTGCCGGCCCTGTTCGATATGGGCCTCCTGAG; HHT-5411, GTGGCCCTGCTCTTCCTGGTGATGTTCATCTACGCG; and HHT-5432, TGTTCTTCACTACCGTCTTCGGGATGTCGAACTTTGCGTACATTGCCCTGAATG (the mutations are underlined). In the first reaction, mutant primers were amplified using an antisense oligonucleotide that harbors the BclI restriction site (GGTTGATGATCAGGAAGGCAC) and the wild type α1C as the template. The resultant 300-base pair PCR product was isolated and purified for use in the second round of PCR. In this second step, the antisense oligonucleotide carrying the mutant sequence (mega-primer) was extended using a forward primer harboring the AatII restriction site (GCATAATTGACGTCATTCTCA). Each PCR reaction proceeded for 20–30 cycles in which the primers were denatured at 94 °C for 1 min followed by annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The last cycle consisted of a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. After the second round of PCR, the newly synthesized 500-base pair oligonucleotide containing the mutant sequence and harboring both the AatII and BclI restriction sites was gel-purified and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript. In the construction of HHT-5658, the antisense oligonucleotide GATGATCAGGAAGAACTATGATGACTGACAAGAAGAAGATACCAACGCTGCTACCACGGTG that contains the BclI site was used with a sense oligonucleotide primer that harbors the BstbI restriction site (CCACCTTCGAAGGGTGGC) for the first step in the PCR reaction. The 1000 base pair product was then isolated and subcloned into pBluescript as described above. The restriction sites and mutations were sequence-verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The wild type human α1C channel was prepared by linearization with BclI followed by partial digestion withAatII in which the 8.5-kilobase fragment was isolated. The sequence-verified IVS5 mutants were digested first with BclI followed by AatII to completion. This mutant oligonucleotide was ligated into the partially digested wild type α1Cchannel. The full-length channel containing the mutant sequence was again sequence-verified. Both the mutant α1C channel and the full-length channel in pAGS-3 (24Miyazaki J.-I. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) were digested to completion with SalI andHindIII. A 4.8-kilobase band of pAGS-3 was ligated to the 6-kilobase band of the mutant α1C channel. We previously constructed a carboxyl-terminal deletion after glycine 1633 (27Mikala G. Klockner U. Varadi M. Eisfeld J. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 185: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In order to ligate the mutations into the truncated channel, the Δ1633 pAGS-3 was digested to completion using HindIII andSse8387I, and the 4.8-kilobase fragment was isolated. The mutant channels in pBluescript were also digested to completion usingHindIII and XbaI. The product from this digestion was partially digested using Sse8387I, and the resultant 4.8-kilobase band was isolated. The final step was the ligation of the two 4.8-kilobase bands to complete the Δ1633 pAGS-3 incorporating the IVS5 mutations. Expression of the wild type and mutant calcium channels was done as described previously (26Klockner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol.

Briefly, female Xenopus laevis(purchased from Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) frogs were anesthetized by exposing them for 15–20 min to 0.15% methanesulfonate salt of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MS-222; Sigma) solution before pieces of the ovary were removed. The follicular layers of the oocytes were digested with 2.0 mg/ml collagenase (Type IA; Sigma) dissolved in OR-2 medium (in mm): 82.5 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. Stage V–VI oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in P/S medium (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2.0 KCl, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, and 0.5 theophylline at pH 7.5. The P/S medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The wild type and mutant α1C messages were coinjected in a 50-nl solution composed of α2δ (28Ellis S.B.

Ca2+channel currents were recorded 2–4 days post-injection of the cRNAs at room temperature (20–21 °C). In order to minimize contamination with chloride, oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of a 40 mm potassium 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate solution, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, 60 min prior to current recording (29Neely A. Olcese R. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1895-1903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded using the standard two microelectrode voltage clamp technique. The recording medium was a Ca2+- and Cl−-free solution composed of the following (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 KOH, 5 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.5–1.5 megohms. Currents were recorded using an Axoclamp-2A (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) amplifier. Whole cell leakage and capacitive currents were subtracted on-line using the P/4 procedure. Currents were digitized at 1 kHz after being filtered at 1 kHz. The pClamp software (version 5.5 Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisition, and version 6.0.3 was used for analysis. Ba2+ currents were elicited by a 350-ms-long depolarizing pulse from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials between −30 mV and +40 mV in 10-mV increments in order to determine the peak potentials of the current voltage relationship of the Ca2+channel construct. Use-dependent block was determined as the inhibition of peak IBa during trains of 15 test pulses of 80-ms duration applied at 0.5 Hz from a holding potential of −60 mV to test potentials +10, +20, or/and +30 mV positive to the peak potential of the I-V curves. Identical pulse protocols were used in the presence of drugs. Drugs were perfused in the bath (for a 2.5-min period) at concentrations of 300 and 100 μm diltiazem (racemic) and verapamil, respectively. These concentrations were selected since they provided sufficient block for the use-dependent measurements in Xenopus oocytes. Tonic block is defined as the peak IBa inhibition during the first pulse after a 2.5-min equilibration in the drug containing solution at −60 mV. The drug block under these conditions (tonic block) reflects steady-state binding to the mixture of closed and closed/inactivated states present at −60 mV. A double-pulse protocol was used in those experiments measuring the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The protocol consisted of a 5-s prepulse that ranged from −80 to +50 mV at a holding potential of −80 mV followed by a 30-ms return pulse to −80 mV. Finally a 400-ms-long test pulse was applied to +10, +20, and/or +30 mV. The curves were fit to the Boltzmann equation y = A 1 −A 2/(1 + exp(x −x 0)/dx)·A 2. Recovery of IBa from inactivation was studied after depolarizing the calcium channels during a 3-s prepulse to +10, +20, and/or 30 mV. The time course of IBa recovery from inactivation was estimated at a holding potential of −80 mV by applying a 400-ms test pulse to +10, +20, and/or +30 mV at various times after the conditioning prepulse. Peak IBa values were normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse. After the double-pulse protocol, the membrane was hyperpolarized to −100 mV for 3 min to permit complete recovery from inactivation and block. Each large 15-cm plate of (90%) confluent HEK 293 cells was transfected with a total of 60 μg of cDNA. The α1C or Δ1633 (wild type or mutant) cDNA were coinjected with α2δ (27Mikala G. Klockner U.

Transfection was done according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method by Chen and Okayama (31Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 48–72 h post-transfection. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by a Polytron homogenizer in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 μg/ml aprotinin and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The membranes were pelleted in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 35 min and then resuspended in membrane storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.37 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2plus protease inhibitors). Protein was determined using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). Saturation binding assays of [3H]PN200-110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were done according to the protocols of Varadi et al. (32Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Nature. 1991; 352: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) using 50–100 μg of protein for each sample. Binding assays were performed at 25 or 37 °C in binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.4 mm CaCl2 and 1.4 mmMgCl2). The bound receptors were collected on glass fiber filters (FP-200 GF/C) and washed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Nonspecific and bound radioactivity was estimated in the presence of 10 μm non-labeled isradipine. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Positive allosteric binding assays between labeled DHP and BZTs were done at 37 °C for 1 h. In these experiments, varying concentrations of diltiazem hydrochloride and 0.8 nm[3H]PN200-110 were used. The allosteric effect was determined by dividing the specifically bound radioactivity in the presence of diltiazem by that specifically bound in the absence of diltiazem multiplied by 100 for each construct. [3H]PN200-110 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Diltiazem was a gift from Marion Merrell Dow (Hoechst-Marion-Roussell). All other chemicals were from Sigma. The results were analyzed by the KELL program version 4.0 (Biosoft, Cambridge) and Origin version 4.0 (Microcal) and presented as the means ± S.E. The statistical analysis was done using Student's t test (p< 0.05). The regions of the α1C calcium channel responsible for high affinity binding of PAA, DHP, and BZT include specific amino acids in IIIS5, IIIS6, and IVS6. However, segments and amino acids responsible for the use-dependent nature of these drugs are found dispersed around the presumed area of calcium blocker-binding sites (20Cai D. Mulle J.G. Yue D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 872-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Hering S. Aczel S. Kraus R.L. Berjukow S. Streissnig J. Timin E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1998; 19: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This provided the impetus to investigate other regions of the calcium channel that may play an important role in use-dependent block. We chose amino acid stretches of the rat brain sodium channel 2a (34Noda M. Ikeda T. Suzuki H. Yakeshima H. Takahashi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1986; 322: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) since these channels possess a low affinity pattern of inhibition by some calcium antagonists (35Yatani A. Kunze D.L. Brown A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H140-H147PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 756-765PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, very few amino acids are conserved in the membrane spanning regions between the two channels (Fig.1 A), and the majority of the published residues that have been shown to be critical for the action of calcium antagonists are absent in the rat brain sodium channel (Fig.1 A). We investigated motif IVS5 since this segment “opposes” IVS6 much like the faces of IIIS5 and IIIS6 are believed to be oriented for DHP binding in the calcium channel. Three separate mutant constructs, termed HHT-5371, HHT-5411, and HHT 5432, were engineered from the intracellular portion (amino acids 1326) of motif IVS5 to the extracellular loop (amino acids 1355) that show a loss of amino acid conservation. In the three mutations there are a total of nine, five and four amino acids that were changed in HHT-5371, -5411, and -5432, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The intervening residues between the three mutations in IVS5 are conserved in the two channels. In addition, in a motif IVS6 mutant (HHT-5658) 11 amino acids were changed to the corresponding sequence of the rat brain 2a sodium channel. In this construct, the first three of the four amino acids of the YMAI sequence that have been demonstrated to form the primary binding site for calcium antagonists have been changed. The relative location of these mutations within the transmembrane regions are shown in Fig.1 C. These mutations were then assayed for their influence on channel function by the different classes of calcium antagonists. In a previous report from this laboratory, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of the channel tail after glycine 1633 (Δ1633) was found to increase the B max of the α1C in transient expression systems without affecting the K D (27Mikala G. Klockner U. Varadi M. Eisfeld J. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 185: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we used this carboxyl-terminal deletion construct in all binding assays of HEK 293 cell membranes to enhance expression. Scatchard analysis showed no difference in affinity (0.1–0.2 nm) but an approximately 2-fold increase (140 versus 250 fmol/mg protein) in B max between the full-length wild type and the Δ1633 construct (data not shown, see Ref. 27Mikala G. Klockner U. Varadi M. Eisfeld J. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 185: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Some of the mutant constructs expressed poorly in HEK 293 cells (HHT-Δ5432) with minor effects on K D values. Interestingly, some of the mutations within the regions of motif IVS5 also demonstrated a lowered affinity (HHT-Δ5371, >1.2 nm and HHT-Δ5432 0.4 nm) to [3H]PN200-110 (Fig.2 A). The mutations in motif IVS5 encompass regions that do not overlap with the published binding sites for calcium channels. The construct HHT-Δ5658 completely lost high affinity binding to [3H]PN200-110. Thus, an estimate for DHP affinity could not be determined. These results are consistent with the published literature that motif IVS6 contains the high affinity binding site for DHP binding (7Schuster A. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Ito H. Birnbaumer L. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2365-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We then posed a question to test whether these sites may have any involvement in establishing the allosteric interaction among calcium channel blockers. The concentration-dependent enhancement of subsaturating (0.8 nm) concentrations of [3H]PN200-110 by increasing concentrations of diltiazem between the wild type and Δ1633 channel is depicted in Fig.2 B. The maximal allosteric effect of diltiazem between the full-length wild type channel, the Δ1633 wild type channel, and the Δ1633 mutants is shown in Fig. 2 C. The full-length wild type construct showed significantly lower (185%) allosteric stimulation by diltiazem compared with the Δ1633 (385%) construct. Maximal binding for the mutant constructs were not significantly different compared with the wild type channel producing a 300% increase in [3H]PN200-110 binding than in the absence of diltiazem. The exception was with HHT-Δ5432 in which there was a significant decrease (240%) in binding compared with the Δ1633 control. In all of the constructs the concentration-dependent peak occurred between 30 and 100 μm diltiazem and elicited similar curves as the wild type constructs (data not shown). There was no observable specific DHP binding for the HHT-Δ5658 construct even in the presence of diltiazem. These results are consistent with the loss of the high affinity binding site for DHP. In order to address whether the motif IVS5 mutant constructs maintained normal biophysical properties and pharmacology to calcium channel antagonists, we expressed cRNAs for the full-length channels inXenopus oocytes. All of the mutants produced voltage-dependent currents with Ba2+ serving as the charge carrier. HHT-5411 produced a substantial positive shift (29.3 ± 0.7 mV), whereas HHT-5658 produced a negative (11.2 ± 1.4 mV) shift in the volt"

However, it is not clear whether the phosphorylation status of one or more of these sites contributes to the determination of the various conformations and activity of pRb. Moreover, whether and how the conformation of pRb may regulate the phosphorylation of the cdk sites is also unclear. In the process of analyzing the function and regulation of pRb, we uncovered the existence of an unusual structural motif, m89 (amino acids 880–900), the mutation of which confers upon pRb a hypophosphorylated conformation. Mutation of this structural domain activates, rather than inactivates, the growth suppressor function of pRb. In order to understand the effect of the mutation of m89 on the phosphorylation of cdk sites, we identified all the cdk sites (Thr-356, Ser-807/Ser-811, and Thr821) the phosphorylation of which drastically modify the conformation of pRb. Mutation of each of these four sites alone or in combinations results in the different conformations of pRb, the migration pattern of which, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resembles various in vivo hypophosphorylated forms. Each of these hypophosphorylated forms of pRb has enhanced growth suppressing activity relative to the wild type. Our data revealed that the m89 structural motif controls the exposure of the cdk sites Ser-807/Ser-811in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the m89 mutant has enhanced growth suppressing activity, similar to a mutant with alanine substitutions at Ser-807/Ser-811. Our recent finding, that the m89 region is part of a structural domain, p5, conserved antigenically and functionally between pRb and p53, suggests that the evolutionarily conserved p5 domain may play a role in the coordinated regulation of the activity of these two tumor suppressors, under certain growth conditions.

The various forms of pRb, even after denaturation, maintain their conformational differences that are readily discerned by SDS-PAGE.1 The stability of particular localized conformation of certain polypeptides under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE has previously been described (1Tung J.S. Knight C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Ghabrial S.A. Lister R.M. Virology. 1973; 51: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is perhaps a result of hydrophobic intramolecular interaction. At least five different forms of pRb isolated from an asynchronous culture can be discerned by SDS-PAGE. While there is no doubt that these different conformations of pRb are a SDS-PAGE gel artifact, previous studies have clearly showed that they correspond to the phosphorylation status of the pRb. Multiple forms of heavily phosphorylated pRb appear in late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. In quiescent and differentiating cells, pRb is hypophosphorylated and migrates fastest in SDS-PAGE (3Mihara K. Cao X.-R. Yen A. Chandler S. Driscoll B. Murphree A.L. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T.

This form of pRb is also observed in cells at the M and early G1 phases, when pRb is dephosphorylated (6Ludlow J.W. Shon J. Pipas J.M. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). There are 16 Ser/Thr-Pro motifs on pRb that are potential cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) targets. Functional evidence that the phosphorylation of some or all of these cdk sites regulates the conformation and activity of pRb comes from the observation that ectopic expression of cyclins A, D, and E can overcome the growth suppression effect of pRb (7Hinds P.W.

Other in vitro andin vivo experiments have shown that various viral and cellular proteins bind preferentially to the hypophosphorylated forms of pRb (Refs. 10Mittnacht S. Weinberg R.A.

Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the binding of pRb to the SV40 large T antigen is specifically affected by the phosphorylation status of Thr-821/Thr-826, while the phosphorylation status of Ser-807/Ser-811 controls the assembly of the pRb:c-Abl complex (11Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8313-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by cdks, in turn, leads to the disruption of protein complexes formed between pRb and its targets. Together, these data suggest that the conformation and activity of pRb are regulated by the phosphorylation status of its cdk sites. While it is clear that the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of the 16 potential cdk sites regulates the conformation of pRb, there is surprisingly little information on the relationship between the phosphorylation status of a particular site and a particular conformation. To date, the only cdk sites that have been reported to have an effect on a particular conformation of pRb are those of the combined sites Ser-807/Ser-811 (11Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y.J. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701PubMed Google Scholar), although pRb clearly can exist in multiple conformations. It is not known how many of the cdk sites are phosphorylated in any given form of pRb and which of these sites contribute to the determination of a particular conformation. It is also unclear whether these cdk sites act independently or synergistically in determining the conformation of pRb, and whether the resulting conformational changes alter the growth suppressing activity of pRb. There are several lines of evidence which suggest that the phosphorylation of pRb occurs in a stepwise manner as cells progress through the cell cycle. As synchronized cell populations traverse the cell cycle, progressive changes in the phosphorylation of pRb can be discerned by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis (3Mihara K. Cao X.-R. Yen A.

How this stepwise phosphorylation of particular cdk sites is regulated is unknown at present, but it could be due to a change in the expression of cdk enzyme activities or the conformation of the pRb substrate which may control the exposure of the cdk sites, or both. The fluctuation in the level of cdk-regulating cyclins at different phases of the cell cycle is clearly one mechanism for the stepwise regulation of phosphorylation of particular cdk sites. On the other hand, previous data have shown that the phosphorylation of pRb is also dependent on the conformation of pRb itself. Many naturally occurring mutations within the N terminus, C terminus, and the A/B pocket domains of pRb have been reported to render pRb refractory to phosphorylation (18Kaye F.J. Kratzke R.A.

Naturally occurring point mutations at Ser-567 and Cys-706 have a drastic effect on the conformation of pRb, as shown by the loss of ability to bind various target proteins, or to be phosphorylated. Taken together, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of pRb is also regulated by its conformation. In our attempts to analyze the function and regulation of pRb, we performed a detailed analysis of the domains that are associated with a particular function and/or regulation by creating a panel of pRb mutants in which certain amino acid residues in a 20-amino acid stretch were mutated. The phosphorylation patterns of the resulting mutants and their ability to suppress cell growth were analyzed. Consistent with previous reports, most mutations in the A/B pocket region resulted in the inactivation of pRb, as measured by the inability of the ectopically expressed mutant to suppress cell growth. In addition to these inactivating mutations, most mutations in other regions have no apparent effect on the growth suppression function of pRb. However, in the course of these analyses, we uncovered the existence of an unusual structural motif, m89 (amino acid residues 880–900), the mutation of which confers upon pRb a hypophosphorylated conformation and an enhanced growth suppressor activity. To identify the cdk sites affected by m89, each of 15 cdk sites (Ser-567 excluded) was individually mutated and the effect on the phosphorylation status and conformation of pRb analyzed. Our results revealed that there are four cdk sites, Thr-356, Ser-807/Ser-811, and Thr-821, the phosphorylation status of which exerts a drastic change in the conformation of pRb independent of other sites. Moreover, all five different forms of pRb isolated from an asynchronous culture, resolvable by SDS-PAGE, can apparently be accounted for by the phosphorylation status of one or more of these four sites. Data presented below shows that the integrity of the m89 structural motif determines the exposure of two of these four cdk sites, namely Ser-807 and Ser-811 in vitro and in vivo. Bladder carcinoma 5637 cells expressing both a transfected cyclin A and m89 mutant pRb were blocked in cell cycle progression to a greater extent than with the wild type pRb. The m89 motif is therefore a structural domain, other than cdk sites, the mutation of which activates, rather than inactivates, the function of pRb. Phosphorylation site mutants in which serines and threonines were changed to alanine, were subcloned into pBluescriptSK+, to generate pBSpRbmS/TXXXA, where XXX is the amino acid residue number of the cdk sites. Double mutants were created at sites Ser-608/Ser-611 and Ser-807/Ser-811. A triple mutant was created at Thr-356/Ser-807/Ser-811, while a quadruple mutant was created by combining the triple mutant with the Thr-821 mutant to create Thr-356/Ser-807/Ser-811/Thr-821. The regulatory site mutant pBSpRbm89 was created by changing the amino acids 880–900 of the m89 region EGSDEADGSKHLPGESKFQQK to EASAEVDASIHLPGESKFQQK. The plasmids peGFP/CycA/pRb, peGFP/CycA/pRbm89, peGFP/CycA/pRbmS807S811, peGFP/CycA/pRbmT356/S807/S811, and peGFP/CycA/pRbmT356/S807/S811/T821 were constructed by subcloning the pRb cDNAs under the control of the immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus (pCMV) into peGFP/CycA containing a pCMV-cyclin A. The coding sequence for the enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was linked to pRb cDNA via an internal ribosomal entry site element (IRES, CLONTECH). Human bladder carcinoma 5637 cells were seeded into T25 flasks at 20% confluence. The following day, cells were transfected with 5 μg of the selected plasmid, together with LipofectAMINE, according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Control cells were mock-transfected with LipofectAMINE alone. After 6 h, leftover DNA and LipofectAMINE were removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or absence of serum for 56 h at 37 °C were harvested by trypsinization, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with propidium iodide. The cells were then FACS sorted into GFP-positive and -negative populations using a Becton Dickinson FACScan equipped with a 488-nm argon laser as light source and CellQuest software. For these experiments, 100,000 events were acquired and the non-clumped cells were gated for analysis on a second dual parameter display with DNA (linear red fluorescence) on the x axis and FITC-eGFP (log green fluorescence) on the y axis. Negative and positive parameters were set with cells transfected with eGFP plasmid or exposed to LipofectAMINE alone. For cells transfected with other plasmids, GFP-positive events were analyzed for DNA content and cell cycle positions using ModFit LT 2.0 DNA analysis software (Verity House Software, Topsham, ME). Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (3Mihara K. Cao X.-R. Yen A. Chandler S. Driscoll B. Murphree A.L. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled wild type and mutant pRb proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and coupled translation of the pBluescript/pRb plasmids using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), together with Expre35S35S (labeled at the methionine and cysteine residues). For immunoprecipitation, reticulocyte lysate was diluted in EBC buffer (125 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and β-glycerol phosphate, 20 mm NaF, and 0.1 mmNaVO4), antibody RB1-Ab 2–3 (3Mihara K.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE. For in vitro kinase reactions, a crude extract of pRb kinase was prepared and used as described previously (3Mihara K. Cao X.-R. Yen A. Chandler S. Driscoll B. Murphree A.L. T'Ang A. Fung Y.-K.T. Science. 1989; 246: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). 107 Sf9 cells co-infected with cyclin A and cdk2 baculoviruses were lysed in kinase reaction buffer (KRB: 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol plus proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Clarified extracts were used to phosphorylate wild type and mutant pRb proteins immunoprecipitated from the reticulocyte mixture. All reactions contained ATP at a final concentration of 100 mm. For two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis, pHuβAcprpRbPQ, pHuβAcprpRbm89, and pHuβAcprpRbmS807/S811 were separately transfected into Saos-2-AT (14Driscoll B. Zhang X.-X. T'Ang A. Hu Y.-H. Shi X.-H.

Neomycin-resistant clones were selected for in G418 and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C. pRb phosphorylatedin vivo was immunoprecipitated from Saos-2 transfectants metabolically labeled with [32P]H3PO4. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Chymotryptic digestion of pRb and analysis of phosphopeptides were performed as described previously (14Driscoll B. Zhang X.-X. T'Ang A. Hu Y.-H. Shi X.-H. Zhang F.-H. Wu K.-J. Murphree A.L. Fung Y.-K. Mol. Cell. Diff. 1995; 3: 361-375Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, which was exposed to x-ray film. Bands corresponding to pRb were excised, and the protein, extracted and immunoprecipitated from 5 × 106 cells, was digested with 20 μg of chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 200 μl of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.3, at 37 °C for 18 h. Chymotryptic peptides were dried, washed, and oxidized using performic acid. Following oxidation, peptides were washed extensively, first with water, then with thin layer electrophoresis buffer (TLE buffer: 2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid, pH 1.9). For an accurate comparison between samples, the same number of cpm of each sample was applied. Peptides were spotted onto a thin layer cellulose plate (Kodak) and electrophoresed in the first dimension in TLE buffer, for 1.5 h, using a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis apparatus (HTLE-7000, C.B.S. Scientific, San Diego, CA). Plates were dried, then chromatographed in the second dimension using phosphochromatography buffer (n-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water, 5:3:1:4 by volume). Dried plates were exposed to x-ray film. To understand the function and regulation of pRb, we performed in vitro mutagenesis throughout the RB-1 cDNA. Forty-seven different amino acid substitution mutants, each covering 20 amino acid residues, were created, and the effect of the mutation on the function and regulation of phosphorylation of pRb analyzed using different cell lines. As expected, mutations in the pocket region resulted in the inactivation of pRb function. In order to understand the effect of the mutations on the regulation of pRb phosphorylation, we made use of a Saos2 variant cell line (Saos-2AT), which is resistant to growth inhibition by ectopically expressed pRb (22Fung Y.-K.T. T'Ang A. Murphree A.L. Zhang F.H. Qiu W.-R. Wang S.-W. Shi X.-H. Lee L. Driscoll B. Wu K.-J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2659-2672PubMed Google Scholar, 23Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.G. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A.

Cell lines harboring the transfected mutants were isolated, and the in vivo phosphorylation status of the ectopically expressed pRb in each was analyzed. In the process, we encountered a mutant, pRbm89, which exhibited a different mobility by SDS-PAGE than wild type pRb. As is shown in Fig.1 A, wild type pRb isolated from an asynchronous cell population of Saos2pRbPQ (lane 1) multiple forms in a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. In contrast, the mutant pRb isolated from an asynchronous cell population of Saos2pRbm89 exhibited only hypophosphorylated forms (lane 2). Since pRbm89 protein was isolated from an asynchronous population, this observation suggests that the mutant form of pRb assume a hypophosphorylated conformation, even at the S phase of the cell cycle when wild type pRb is normally fully phosphorylated. Indeed, pRbm89 protein isolated from a cell population growth arrested at G1/S with alphidicolin remains in the same hypophosphorylated conformation (data not shown). To understand if the hypophosphorylated conformation of the pRbm89 mutant is due to mutation at the m89 region or due to a peculiar lack of a specific cdk activity in the Saos2pRbm89 cell line, we analyzed the protein in vitro phosphorylation pattern of the pRbm89.In vitro translated mutant and wild type pRb were kinased with either cyclin A/cdk2, cyclin D2/cdk4, or cyclin E/cdk2. As is shown in Fig. 1 B, under optimized kinasing conditions where unphosphorylated wild type pRb (lane 1) became fully phosphorylated (lane 3), the kinased pRbm89 still maintains the hypophosphorylated conformation (Fig.1 B, lane 2) with an apparent molecular mass midway between the unphosphorylated and the hyperphosphorylated forms. The fact that the hypophosphorylated conformation of pRbm89 is observed both in vivo in the S phase, and in vitro under optimized conditions when wild type pRb is fully phosphorylated, suggests that it is an intrinsic property of the m89 mutant and not the result of suboptimal cdk activity. There are several possible explanations for the observed conformation of pRbm89. One is that all sites on the protein are fully phosphorylated, but that mutation at m89 has somehow altered conformation of the phosphorylated form of pRb. Alternatively, it is possible that the mutation at m89 has caused a conformational change in pRb, such that particular phosphorylation sites, critical for the determination of the conformation of pRb, are not exposed to the kinase. To distinguish between these two possibilities, it is necessary to have an understanding of the relationship between the conformation of pRb and the phosphorylation status of the cdk sites. By identifying the cdk sites that control the migration pattern of the various forms of pRb (Fig. 2 A,lane 1), it should be possible to determine if the mutation at m89 has altered the exposure of the cdk sites that confer the particular conformation of pRbm89. A detailed analysis of the cdk sites and their contribution to the conformations of pRb was therefore performed. To understand the status of phosphorylation of each of the cdk sites in the various forms of pRb, we mutagenized the serine or threonine residues of individual cdk sites into alanine. In choosing the cdk sites for detailed analysis, Thr-5, Ser-230, and Ser-780, which have been shown not to be phosphorylated in vivo (25Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and Ser-567, the mutation of which reportedly inactivates pRb (19Templeton D.J. Park S.H. Lanier L. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3033-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), were excluded from analysis. The remaining 12 sites: Ser-249, Thr-252, Thr-356, Thr-373, Ser-608, Ser-612, Ser-788, Ser-795, Ser-807, Ser-811, Thr-821, and Thr-826, which have been demonstrated to be phosphorylatedin vivo (25Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Zarkowska T. U S. Harlow E. Mittnacht S.

Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), were analyzed. To show that mutations at these 12 cdk sites do not inactivate the function of pRb, corresponding mutants were subcloned into both the pHuβAcpr-1-neo and the pAcYM1 vectors for growth suppression and protein binding analysis. Ectopic expression of these mutants driven by the human β actin promoter resulted in suppression of the growth of Saos-2 cells (ATCC HTB 85) (data not shown). In addition, all of these mutants, expressed as recombinant baculoviruses in Sf9 cells, retain their ability to bind the SV40 large T antigen and the cellular proteins c-Abl and E2F-1 in vitro (data not shown). These results indicated that, unlike the mutation at Ser-567, none of these mutations were inactivating. To understand the effect of the mutation of the cdk sites on the conformation of pRb, we compared the migration pattern of in vitro translated pRb mutants to the various forms of pRb extracted from cell culture, on SDS-PAGE. As is shown in Fig. 2 A(lane 1), wild type pRb protein extracted from an asynchronous cell culture can be fractionated into five distinct forms. We designated these as forms 1–5, with form 1 being the most underphosphorylated, fastest migrating form and form 5 being the fully phosphorylated and slowest migrating form. As expected, form 1 pRb is the only form extracted from cells growth-arrested by serum starvation (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). For in vitro analysis, wild type and cdk site mutants of pRb, generated by in vitro translation, were kinased under optimized conditions and their migration analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. As expected, unphosphorylated wild type pRb migrates as form 1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 14) and is converted into the slowest migrating form 5 (lanes 2 and 13) by the kinasing reaction. Differences in the migration pattern of the optimally phosphorylated cdk site mutants were reproducibly observed (Fig. 2 B,lanes 3–12). Of these, mutations at Thr-356 (lane 5), Ser-807/Ser-811 (lane 10), and Thr-821 (lane 11) resulted in the most noticeable difference in the migration pattern. It should be noted that these pRb mutants were otherwise fully phosphorylated at all the other cdk sites, as determined by two-dimensional peptide analysis using the wild type pattern as a standard (Fig. 4 B). Thus, if either Thr-356 (lane 5) or Thr-821 (lane 11) is not phosphorylated, the otherwise fully phosphorylated pRb mutant migrates to a slightly faster position, corresponding to form 4 in Fig. 2 A. Mutation of Ser-807/Ser-811 causes a more drastic effect on pRb conformation (Fig.2 B, lane 10), resulting in a migration pattern similar to that of form 3. Thus, mutation at Thr-356, which is N-terminal to the pocket region, or Ser-807/Ser-811 or Thr-821, which are C-terminal to the pocket region, can individually cause conformational changes independent of all other sites. While Thr-356 was previously reported to play no role in the determination of pRb conformation (12Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701PubMed Google Scholar), the data provided here clearly show that Thr-356 has a drastic effect on the conformation of the N-terminal domains upstream of the pocket region. The slight but reproducible difference in the migration of these mutants is consistent with changes being individual and local. Mutation of serine/threonine to alanine at Ser-249 (lane 3), Thr-252 ("

To develop a tool for studying the role of the AR in normal development and disease, we constructed artificial coactivators consisting of the transcription activation domains of VP16 or p65/RelA and the AR hinge and ligand-binding domain (ARLBD), which has been shown to interact with the AR N-terminal domain. The artificial VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-p65 coactivators interacted with the AR N terminus and wild-type AR in an androgen-dependent and androgen-specific manner. VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-p65 enhanced the AR transactivity up to 4- and 13-fold, respectively, without affecting the expression of the AR protein. The coactivators did not enhance the transcription activity of the progesterone receptor (PR) or the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), showing their specificity for the AR. In addition, to construct PR- and GR-specific coactivators, the VP16 activation domain was fused to the PR and GR hinge/ligand-binding domain. Although VP16-PRLBD and VP16-GRLBDinteracted with the C-terminal portion of steroid receptor coactivator-1, they did not enhance the transcription activity of their receptor.

How these nuclear receptors activate or repress transcription of target genes has been the focus of much research in the past years. A major breakthrough in our understanding of these activities was the identification of so-called coactivators that bridge the receptors to the preinitiation complex (PIC) (1Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A.

In addition to this bridging function, some coactivators, including steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), p300, and ACTR, can also remodel chromatin by acetylating histones (5Ogryzko V.V.

The model that emerges from these data takes the two activities of coactivators into account; the liganded steroid receptor binds as a homodimer to the hormone response element and recruits coactivators and p300/CBP-associated factor. These cofactors loosen the nucleosomal structure by targeted histone acetylation. The coactivators can then initiate the stable assembly of the PIC by their bridging function, which results in enhanced rates of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (9Jenster G.

To perform their bridging function, coactivators need to harbor at least two domains: a receptor-interacting domain and a domain that contacts and stabilizes assembly of the PIC. This latter domain will almost certainly be a transcription activation domain that directly or indirectly binds proteins of the PIC. The receptor-interacting domain determines the binding specificity. Except for AR-associated protein 70 (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), none of the known coactivators is specific for a certain nuclear receptor (1Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K.

The objective of this study was to generate an AR-specific and very potent coactivator to manipulate AR function in vitro andin vivo. Such a coactivator could be used as a tool to study the role of the AR in normal development and disease. Moreover, this coactivator could form the blueprint for the construction of artificial corepressors that inhibit AR function in the presence of ligand, of cofactors that direct any other enzyme activity into the AR DNA-bound complex, and of coactivators that are specific for other nuclear receptors. To form a coactivator that is AR-specific and more potent than the known coactivators, a domain had to be found that interacts only with the AR and not with other nuclear receptors. The first evidence for the existence of such a domain came from the observation that the AR ligand-binding domain (ARLBD) binds to the AR N terminus in an androgen-dependent manner (16Langley E.

The activation domains are important determinants of coactivator potency and are responsible for the direct interaction with proteins of the PIC and/or recruitment of additional coactivators. There are a few obvious choices for strong activation domains, including the activation domain from viral protein 16 (VP16) (19Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M.

Casodex (bicalutamide, ICI-176, 334) was obtained from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (Newark, DE). The construction of pAR0 (encoding the wild-type AR of 910 amino acids), pAR3, pAR5, pAR65, pAR106, pAR126, and pAR104 has been described previously (31Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem.

The pcDNA-ARLBDwas constructed by inserting the partial EcoRI 1-kilobase pair ARLBD fragment (encoding amino acids 605–910) from pAR65 into the pcDNA3.1HisB vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) digested with EcoRI. A multiple cloning site (33Wagner L.A. Kiem H.P. McSweeney P. Schuening F.G. Storb R. Ostrander E.A.

The polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested withBspEI and Bsp120I and inserted into pcDNA3.1His- ARLBD digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid (pcDNA-ARLBDmcs) contains the uniqueSacII, XhoI, HpaI, andBsp120I sites into which fragments can be inserted in frame with the ARLBD. pcDNA-VP16 was constructed by inserting the VP16 EcoRI fragment (encoding amino acids 411–490) from pRSET-VP16 into pcDNA3.1HisC linearized with EcoRI. pcDNA-ARLBDVP16 was constructed by in frame insertion of VP16 from pcDNA-VP16 (BamHI filled in with Klenow andBsp120I-digested) into the pcDNA-ARLBD mcs vector (XhoI filled in with Klenow andBsp120I-digested). pcDNA-VP16ARLBD was generated by inserting the ARLBD (Asp718 filled in with Klenow and XbaI-digested) into the pcDNA-VP16 vector (NotI filled in with Klenow and XbaI-digested). pcDNA-VP16ARLBDVP16 was constructed by inserting theBsp120I/BspEI fragment from pcDNA-ARLBDVP16 into the pcDNA-VP16ARLBD vector digested with the same enzymes. pcDNA-ARLBDp65 was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kilobase pair Asp718-Klenow/SalI fragment of p65/RelA encoding amino acids 286–550 into theXhoI/HpaI-digested pcDNA-ARLBDmcs vector. pcDNA-VP16ARLBDp65 was constructed by inserting the HindIII/BspEI fragment from pcDNA-VP16ARLBD into the pcDNA-ARLBDp65HindIII/BspEI-digested vector. pcDNA-p65 was constructed by inserting the 1.3-kilobase pairBamHI-Klenow/EcoRI p65 fragment into theXbaI-Klenow/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3.1HisC. pcDNA-AR0mcs was generated by inserting theMluI-Klenow/EcoRI AR sequence from pAR3 intoKpnI-T4 DNA polymerase-blunted/EcoRI pcDNA-ARLBDmcs vector. pcDNA-AR0 was constructed by replacing the mcs sequence in pcDNA-AR0mcs (EcoRI/XhoI-digested) with the wild-type sequence from pAR0 (EcoRI/SalI fragment). pcDNA-VP16PRLBD was constructed by inserting theHincII-digested PRLBD fragment from pABGAL-PRLBD into the XhoI-digested, filled-in pcDNA-VP16 vector. pcDNA-p65GRLBD was generated by inserting the filled-in ClaI/DraI GRLBD fragment into the pcDNA-p65XhoI-digested, filled-in vector. pcDNA-p65PRLBD was constructed by inserting the 1-kilobase pair XhoI PRLBD fragment from pcDNA-VP16PRLBD into the XhoI-digested pcDNA-p65 vector. pcDNA-PRLBD and pcDNA-GRLBD were generated by releasing the p65 fragment from pcDNA-p65PRLBD and pcDNA-p65GRLBD, respectively. pcDNA-VP16GRLBD was constructed by inserting theHpaI/Bsp120I GRLBD fragment from pcDNA-p65GRLBD into theNotI/Klenow/Bsp120I-digested pcDNA-VP16 vector. pABGAL-SRC-1(0.9) was constructed by inserting theHindIII-Klenow/BglII SRC-1(0.9) fragment from pVLGST-SRC-1 (6Spencer T.E.

The reporter plasmid harboring two androgen/progesterone/glucocorticoid response elements and a TATA-box driving the luciferase gene ([ARE]2-E1b-luc) and the (UAS)4TATA-luciferase reporter have been described previously (9Jenster G.

The pcDNA3.1His-LacZ plasmid (Invitrogen) was used as an internal transfection efficiency control. Correct nucleotide sequence of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing, and correct protein expression in HeLa cells was determined by Western blotting analysis. HeLa cells (human epithelial cervix carcinoma (American Type Culture Collection)) were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. LNCaP cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 24 h before transfection, 105 cells were plated in each well of 12-well dishes in medium containing dextran-coated charcoal-stripped serum. Cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pcDNA-LacZ, 30 ng of receptor construct, and 0.1 μg of coactivator plasmid per well using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 24 h later, cells were washed and fed with medium containing stripped serum and the indicated hormones. Cells were harvested 14 h later, and cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase values were corrected for the β-galactosidase internal control. Experiments were performed in triplicate; data are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Transfected HeLa cells were lysed in 40 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 1 nm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors. Protein concentration of the samples were determined by Bradford assay using 10 μg of protein loaded in sample buffer on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described previously (36Jenster G. de Ruiter P.E. van der Korput H.A.

Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and the protein of interest was visualized with the AR-specific F39.4 antibody (37Zegers N.D. Claassen E. Neelen C. Mulder E. van Laar J.H. Voorhorst M.M.

The pcDNA3.1His vectors that were used for the construction of almost all plasmids described above harbor the Xpress epitope tag to which the Xpress antibody is directed. To investigate whether the ARLBD interacts with the wild-type AR, various fusion proteins were constructed containing the ARLBD and the activation domains from VP16 and p65. The various constructs that were used in this study are depicted in Fig.1. The wild-type AR (AR0) cotransfected with the (ARE)2E1b-luciferase reporter in HeLa cells was activated up to 50-fold by 1 nm synthetic androgen R1881 (Fig. 2 A). Cotransfection with empty pcDNA3.1His vector, ARLBD, VP16 activation domain, or p65 activation domain did not significantly change the capacity of AR to activate transcription. However, fusion proteins of the ARLBD with VP16 or p65 greatly enhanced AR transactivity. The location of the VP16 activation domain with respect to the ARLBD did not influence the coactivation potential of the VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-VP16 fusion proteins. We cotransfected all the different coactivators and their components with the reporter plasmid in the absence and presence of R1881 to test their potential effect on the transcription of the reporter in the absence of the AR. As expected, none of the coactivators or their components changed the basal transcription from the (ARE)2E1b-luciferase reporter (data not shown). To show that endogenous AR can also be superactivated by coactivators, VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-p65 were transiently transfected with the reporter plasmid into the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. LNCaP cells express the AR and are sensitive to androgens with respect to their growth. Transfection of the reporter alone showed that R1881 can activate the endogenous AR (Fig. 2 B). Cotransfection of the ARLBD or p65 activation domain did not significantly affect AR activity. However, as was observed in the HeLa cell transfections, the ARLBD-p65 coactivator strongly enhanced the AR up to 9-fold.Figure 2Superactivation of the AR by artificial coactivators. A, AR transcription activity was examined by cotransfection of the AR expression plasmid and the (ARE)2E1b-luciferase reporter in HeLa cells. In addition, empty vector, a coactivator fragment (ARLBD, VP16, and p65) or a coactivator (ARLBD-VP16, VP16-ARLBD, and ARLBD-p65) were cotransfected. B, LNCaP cells, which express endogenous AR, were cotransfected with (ARE)2E1b-luciferase reporter and empty vector, coactivator fragment (ARLBD and p65) or ARLBD-p65 coactivator. Luciferase activity was determined from cell lysates of transfected cells, which were cultured for 16 h in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 1 nm synthetic androgen R1881. Activities were corrected for a pcDNA3.1His-LacZ internal control and are presented as the percentage of luciferase activity ± S.E. relative to the AR activity in the presence of R1881 (second lane from the left in both panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure that cotransfection of the AR with the artificial coactivators did not increase AR expression and consequently transcription activity from the reporter, HeLa cells were cotransfected, and the AR protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. The AR expression was not affected by the coactivators or their components (Fig. 3). Because the artificial coactivators harbor the ARLBD, we tested whether the VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-p65 fusion proteins enhanced the AR in a hormone-dependent manner. The AR5 mutant lacks the AR ligand-binding domain and is constitutively active (32Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). As expected, the addition of R1881 to the HeLa cells cotransfected with AR5 and the (ARE)2E1b-luciferase reporter did not affect AR5 activity (Fig.4). The artificial ARLBD-p65 coactivator did not enhance AR5 transactivity in the absence of ligand but did superactivate transcription in the presence of 1 nmR1881. This result was repeated with the VP16-ARLBD fusion protein, showing that the coactivators containing the ARLBDdepend on ligand for function. To investigate to which part of the AR N-terminal domain the ARLBD binds, we tested two different AR mutants harboring different fragments of the N terminus for enhanced transcription activation by ARLBD-p65. Both AR126 (amino acids 1–370) and AR106 (amino acids 360–528) were only partially enhanced by the artificial coactivator as compared with AR5, indicating the necessity for both fragments for full ARLBD-p65 interaction. In addition, the binding of the artificial coactivator to the AR DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain was analyzed using AR104, which completely lacks the N-terminal domain. The transcription activity of this mutant is very low (32Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and in this study ARLBD-p65 did not enhance its transcription (Fig. 4). We used this same experimental approach to determine whether the fusion of the ARLBD to VP16 or p65 changed ligand specificity. Various agonists (R1881, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone), antagonists (Casodex, hydroxyflutamide, and cyproterone acetate), and other hormones (estradiol and the synthetic progestin R5020) were tested for their ability to induce ARLBD-p65 binding to AR5 (Fig. 5). Only the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and R1881 significantly induced AR5 superactivation, showing that the artificial coactivator did not change ligand specificity and remained androgen-specific. To determine whether the ARLBD would interact only with the AR and not with other steroid receptors, we analyzed the effect of the artificial coactivators on two of the most homologous nuclear receptors, the progesterone receptor (PR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cotransfection of the PR or GR with ARLBD-p65 in the presence of R1881 and R5020 or dexamethasone for activation of the PR and GR, respectively, showed no superactivation (Fig. 6), indicating that the ARLBD-p65 coactivator is AR-specific. Note that R1881 is a potent progestin and is able to activate the PR (Fig. 6). To determine whether the hinge/ligand-binding domains of the PR and GR can also interact with their receptors, the VP16 activation domain was fused to the PRLBD and GRLBD. Although their construction was almost identical to that of VP16-ARLBD, neither VP16-PRLBD nor VP16-GRLBD enhanced transactivation of its full-length receptor (Fig.7). For control purposes, we cotransfected the activation domain of VP16 by itself with the different receptors to analyze the effect of this potent activation domain on receptor transactivity. The activity of all receptors was reduced, probably because of sequestering of essential transcriptional cofactors. Interestingly, the GR activity was the most severely reduced (down to 25%). Cotransfection of the GR with VP16-ARLBD or VP16-PRLBD in the presence of the various ligands again showed the transcription-inhibiting effect of VP16 (Fig. 7). However, in the absence of the ligand that interacts with the VP16-ARLBD (R1881) or VP16-PRLBD (R5020), the GR activity was again higher. One explanation for this phenomenon is that in the unliganded VP16-ARLBD and VP16-PRLBD, the VP16 is shielded by the heat shock proteins that associate with the ligand-binding domain. In the presence of ligand, the heat shock proteins dissociate, and VP16 is able to squelch the GR transactivity. To check correct folding and the ability to bind hormone, we cotransfected VP16-PRLBD and VP16-GRLBD with the receptor interacting-part of the SRC-1 coactivator, which is fused to the GAL DNA-binding domain (DBD) (GAL-SRC-1[1139–1441]) (38Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of the VP16 fusion proteins interacted with the GAL DBD (Fig. 8). However, VP16-ARLBD, ARLBD-VP16, ARLBD-p65, VP16-PRLBD, and VP16-GRLBD bound the GAL-SRC-1(1139–1441) in a hormone-dependent manner, showing correct expression, nuclear import, folding, and hormone binding. Our results show for the first time that the ARLBD can interact with the full-length AR but not with the PR or GR. The binding of the artificial coactivators occurred in the AR N-terminal domain and was diminished when the first 360 amino acids or the last 158 residues of the N terminus were deleted, confirming the previous observation that two independent domains (the first 36 amino acids and residues 370–494) are necessary for full ARLBD binding (40Berrevoets C.A. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1172-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the hinge/LBD to the N terminus or full-length receptor has also been shown for the estrogen receptor α (41Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the PR (42Tetel M.J. Jung S. Carbajo P. Ladtkow T. Skafar D.F. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1114-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, VP16 fusion proteins with the PR and GR hinge/LBD did not enhance the transcription activity of their receptor, indicating that they did not bind the full-length receptor in our mammalian protein-protein interaction system. The folding, ligand binding, and nuclear import of VP16-PRLBD and VP16-GRLBDwere correct because they interacted with the receptor-interacting domain of SRC-1 in a ligand-dependent manner (38Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of VP16-ARLBD and ARLBD-p65 with SRC-1(1134–1441) was very weak compared with the binding of VP16-PRLBD and VP16-GRLBD, confirming previously published data showing that the AR binding to SRC-1 is the weakest of all steroid receptors (39Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the inability of VP16-PRLBD and VP16-GRLBD to bind to their cognate receptor is not clear. We speculate that the three-dimensional structure of the AR DNA-bound homodimer is different as compared with the PR and GR homodimers, allowing an additional ligand-binding domain to be recruited into the AR complex. Previously, Nyanguile et al. (43Nyanguile O. Uesugi M. Austin D.J. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13402-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) constructed a completely synthetic low-molecular-weight transcription activator by fusing FK506 to a short peptide with transactivating properties. FK506 interacts with the FK-binding protein FKBP12, which was fused to the GAL DNA-binding domain, thereby directing the transactivating peptide onto the reporter gene. As a complementary strategy, we show that the ARLBD, which binds the full-length AR also gives us the opportunity to direct proteins into the DNA-bound AR complex. In addition to the transcription activation domains described in this manuscript, the effects of transcription repression domains, DNA-modifying enzymes, and chromatin-remodeling proteins on AR function are currently being tested. These artificial cofactors provide a novel means of manipulating AR activity and AR target gene expression to investigate the role of AR function in normal and disease states. We thank Dr. J. Trapman for helpful discussions and careful reading of the manuscript, Drs. A. O. Brinkmann and J. Trapman for the F39.4 antibody, and Dr. B. W. O'Malley for the GAL-SRC-1 construct."

Microb. Rev. 1995; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ExoS is a 49-kDa protein (3Kulich S.M. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is secreted by the type III mechanism of P. aeruginosa (4Yahr T.L. Goranson J. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and ADP-ribosylates a number of target proteinsin vitro including apolipoprotein A1, IgG3 (5Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), vimentin (6Coburn J. Dillon S.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. Infect.

In vivo, ExoS is a cytotoxin (8Olson J.C. McGuffie E.M. Frank D.W. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 248-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that ADP-ribosylates Ras during the course of infection in cultured cells (9McGuffie E.M. Frank D.W. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), disrupting Ras-mediated signal transduction (10Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indirect methods were used to determine that Exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylates c-Ha-Ras at multiple sites (10Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases have been identified to date. The vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases possess specific properties that are distinct from the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. Several of the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases have the capacity to ADP-ribosylate multiple target proteins. For example, a murine lymphocyte transferase ADP-ribosylates a number of cell surface proteins (11Yu Y. Okamoto S. Nemoto E. Dennert G. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas rabbit skeletal muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase ADP-ribosylates several proteins in skeletal muscle T-tubules (12Klebl B.M. Gopel S.O. Pette D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, several vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases modify target proteins at multiple sites. Both turkey erythrocyte type A ADP-ribosyltransferase (13Just I. Sehr P. Jung M. van Damme J. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Moss J. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and chicken ADP-ribosyltransferase (14Terashima M. Yamamori C. Shimoyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) ADP-ribosylate actin at two arginine residues. These sites of ADP-ribosylation are located in different regions of actin, which suggests that each ADP-ribosylation event is independent. Although the role of endogenous ADP-ribosylation in the regulation of eukaryotic cell physiology has not been defined in detail, the RT6 transferase appears to be involved in the regulation of T-lymphocyte function (15Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots A.Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4048-4058PubMed Google Scholar), and endogenous ADP-ribosylation may contribute to hippocampal long-term potentiation (16Schuman E.M. Meffert M.K. Schulman H. Madison D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11958-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this study, the ADP-ribosylation of Ras by Exoenzyme S was characterized. Using both mass spectrometry and rpHPLC coupled with Edman degradation, it was determined that ExoS ADP-ribosylates Ras at arginines 41 and 128. These residues are located in a β-sheet and α-helix, respectively, which are spatially separated in Ras. Thus, ExoS has functional similarities to the eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases because ExoS ADP-ribosylates a number of target proteins in vitro and ADP-ribosylate Ras at two nonadjacent arginine residues. In addition, homology studies have identified more primary sequence homology between ExoS and the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases than the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. The following reagents were purchased: [adenylate phosphate-32P]NAD from NEN Life Science Products, Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, bovine serum albumin from Pierce Biochemicals, DNA oligonucleotides from Operon, and GTPγS from Sigma. Recombinant factor activating exoenzymes (FAS) and a c-Ha-Ras vector were gifts from H. Fu (Emory University). Recombinant His-tagged Ras proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliand purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography as described previously (10Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with several modifications. His-tagged Ras proteins were eluted from the Ni2+ affinity resin in elution buffer containing 3 μm GTP and 10 mmMgCl2. Eluted proteins were dialyzed into buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and stored at −70 °C. These conditions were optimal for exchange of bound nucleotide from Ras proteins. 20 μm Ras was incubated alone or with 1 mm of either GTPγS or GDP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 mm MgCl2. The stoichiometry of nucleotide loading of Ras was monitored radioanalytically, using [35S]GTPγS. Reaction mixtures contained (25 μl): 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 50 μm [adenylate phosphate-32P]NAD (specific activity 0.25 μCi per 1.25 nmol NAD), 5 μm Ras or RasΔCAAX, FAS, and ΔN222 (a catalytic, deletion peptide of ExoS). FAS and ΔN222 were added in equivalent amounts. Reactions were stopped at the indicated times by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mixture onto trichloroacetic acid-saturated Whatman 3-mm paper. The paper was washed three times for 10 min each in 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. Stoichiometry of ADP-ribosylation was determined as the moles of ADP-ribose incorporated/mole of Ras. Velocity of ADP-ribosylation was determined by linear regression analysis. RasΔCAAX is a deletion peptide of Ras where the four C-terminal amino acids have been deleted, which eliminates its capacity to be acylated, making it more amenable to biochemical manipulation. RasΔCAAX or RasΔCAAX-R41K,R128K (20 μm) was incubated with 0.4 μm ΔN222, 400 μm NAD, and 1.2 μm FAS for 2 h at room temperature. Stoichiometry of ADP-ribosylated Ras was determined by subjecting an aliquot of the reaction mixture to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjecting the protein band corresponding to Ras to scintillation counting. Following ADP-ribosylation, the reaction mixture was dialyzed overnight into 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), containing 20 mm NaCl, to remove unreacted NAD. Dialyzed samples were distributed into aliquots and lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 50 mmNH4Ac (pH 4.0), and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease was added at a w:w ratio of 1:10 (protease:Ras). Samples were digested overnight, lyophilized, and suspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The digested material was subjected to rpHPLC (C18), using a 5–40% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1-min fractions were collected. Absorbance of eluted material was measured at 215 nm. Fractions were subjected to scintillation counting to identify peptides that were radiolabeled. Peptides in fractions containing radioactivity were subjected N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Protease-digested samples of ADP-ribosylated Ras and non-ADP-ribosylated Ras were also subjected to mass spectrometry as described previously (13Just I. Sehr P. Jung M. van Damme J. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Moss J. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein sequences were aligned using the PILEUP program of GCG. Using an algorithm similar to that described in Ref. 17Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1989; 5: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar, this program creates a multiple sequence alignment. Previous studies indicated that ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras at multiple sites. Although indirect, these studies suggested that ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras at Arg41 and at a second site. However, no specific second site of ADP-ribosylation could be resolved (10Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present study, a direct approach was used to determine the sites of ADP-ribosylation within Ras by ExoS. Recombinant histidine-tagged RasΔCAAX was ADP-ribosylated by ExoS to a stoichiometry approaching 2 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras. ADP-ribosylated Ras was digested with S. aureus V8 protease, and peptides were fractionated by rpHPLC. The absorbance of eluted peptides was measured at 215 nm, and elution fractions were assayed for radioactivity (Fig.1 A). Analysis of the V8 peptides of ADP-ribosylated Ras revealed three radioactive fractions. The first radioactive fraction corresponded to the void volume of the column (6 min), where NAD and free ADP-ribose eluted (data not shown). The two additional fractions that contained radioactivity eluted at 24 and 48 min, within the resolving region of the chromatogram. The 24- and 48-min fractions were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The first ten amino acids of the 24-min fraction contained a peptide corresponding to amino acids 38–47 of Ras, which included Arg41 (Table I). Amino acid yields at each cycle were similar (within about 2-fold), with the exception of cycle 4 where there was a reduction in the yield of the predicted amino acid, Arg41. Others have demonstrated that ADP-ribosylarginine is hydrolyzed by treatment with strong base (5Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the coupling of the free N terminus with phenyl isothiocyanate, the peptide was subjected to pH 9.0. When the products of cycle 4 of the Edman degradation were analyzed, no aberrant peak corresponding to ADP-ribosylarginine or hydrolyzed ADP-ribosylarginine was detected, and only minute amounts of free arginine were detected. The absence of hydrolytic products of ADP-ribosylarginine indicated that the ADP-ribose−arginine bond was not cleaved during the Edman degradation procedure. Hydrophilic phenyl isothiocyanate-modified amino acids will not be extracted with butyl acetate from the glass fiber filter during Edman degradation as shown in the case of cysteine. 2L. Mende-Mueller, personal communication. The fact that radioactivity was recovered on the glass fiber filter but not in the eluate of the Edman degradation is consistent with the idea that ADP-ribosylated arginine was not extracted from the glass fiber filter during cycle 4, and Arg 41 is one site of ADP-ribosylation. The first ten amino acids of the 48-min fraction contained a peptide corresponding to amino acids 127–136 of Ras, which included Arg128 and Arg135 (Table I). Amino acid yields at each cycle were similar (within about 2-fold), with the exception of cycle 2 where there was a reduction in the yield of the predicted amino acid, Arg128. This was consistent with Arg128having been ADP-ribosylated. The high yield of Arg at cycle 9 indicated that Arg135 had not been ADP-ribosylated and indicated that the reduction in yield seen in cycle 2 of the 48-min fraction and cycle 4 of the 24-min fraction was not because of a generalized decrease in yield of arginine after Edman degradation.Table IN-terminal amino acid sequencing of Ras peptides that have been ADP-ribosylated by ExoSCycleWild type Ras (24-min peptide)Wild type Ras (48-min peptide)RasR41K,R128K (46-min peptide)Amino acidRecoveryAmino acidRecoveryAmino acidRecoverypmolpmolpmol1.Asp19.6Ser50.5Ser26.92.Ser6.9Arg6.5Lys46.63.Try11.7Gln93.3Gln36.94.Arg1.6Ala84.8Ala39.05.Lys14.4Gln80.2Gln28.96.Gln13.1Asp48.9Asp25.97.Ala11.2Leu83.1Leu24.68.Val11.2Ala76.3Ala22.49.Ile8.7Arg47.1Arg1.310.Asp7.5Ser21.4Ser6.011.Tyr15.7Peptide sequencing was performed with a ABI371 automated sequencer with the preparation of peptides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Peptide sequencing was performed with a ABI371 automated sequencer with the preparation of peptides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sites that ExoS ADP-ribosylated on wild-type Ras were also determined by mass spectrometry. Ras alone or following ADP-ribosylation by ExoS to a stoichiometry approaching 2 mol of ADP-ribose per mol of Ras was digested with trypsin and subjected to mass spectrometry. Mass spectra of peptides from ADP-ribosylated Ras possessed two unique peptides relative to peptides from non-ADP-ribosylated Ras. One peptide was identified which possessed a molecular mass of 3636 daltons, which corresponded to residues 17–42 of Ras plus 541 daltons, while a second peptide was identified which possessed a molecular mass of 1914 daltons, corresponding to residues 124–135 of Ras plus 541 daltons. Addition of 541 daltons to each peptide was consistent with the addition of 1 ADP-ribose moiety to the peptide. These data supported the determination that ExoS ADP-ribosylates Ras at Arg41 and Arg128. Earlier data indicated that ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras at multiple sites and that Ras possessed undefined alternative sites of ADP-ribosylation (10Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To identify a possible alternative site of ADP-ribosylation within Ras, a double Ras mutant, RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K, was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis. Under saturation conditions, ExoS ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K to a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of Ras (Table II). This was consistent with the presence of an alternative site of ADP-ribosylation within the double mutant. Under linear velocity conditions, ExoS ADP-ribosylated wild type RasΔCAAX at a 4-fold greater velocity than RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K (Fig. 2). These data suggested the alternative site of ADP-ribosylation was not accessible for ADP-ribosylation upon the ADP-ribosylation of Arg128, possibly because of steric limitations. The identity of the alternative site of ADP-ribosylation within RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K was determined as described for wild type RasΔCAAX. rpHPLC analysis of peptides from V8 protease-digested ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K showed the elution of two major fractions of radioactivity (Fig. 1 B). The first fraction containing radioactivity eluted with the void volume of the column (6 min), corresponding to NAD or hydrolyzed ADP-ribose, whereas the second fraction containing radioactivity eluted at 46 min. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the first eleven amino acids of the 46-min fraction identified a peptide which corresponded to amino acids 127 to 137 of Ras, which included Arg135 (note the presence of the R128K mutation at cycle 2) (Table I). Amino acid yields at each cycle were similar (within about 2-fold), with the exception of cycle 9 where there was a reduction of the yield of the predicted amino acid, Arg135. This was consistent with Arg135 having been ADP-ribosylated. It should be noted that Ser is often recovered at lower yield during automated Edman degradation of peptides.2 These data were consistent with Arg135 being the alternative site for ADP-ribosylation of Ras by ExoS.Table IIADP-ribosylation of Ras and Ras mutants by Exoenzyme SStoichiometry of ADP-ribosylationaRepresent the results of two experiments performed in duplicate.Velocity of ADP-ribosylationbRepresent the results of three experiments performed in duplicate.mol ADP-ribose/ mol Rasmol ADP-ribose/min/mol ΔN222Wild type Ras2.09 ± .21114 ± 6Wild type Ras loaded with GTP2.08 ± .33112 ± 18Wild type Ras loaded with GDP2.21 ± .16125 ± 16Wild type Ras loaded with Mg1.94 ± .10135 ± 25RasΔCAAX2.03 ± .1492 ± 16RasΔCAAX R41K,R128K1.33 ± .0422 ± 10Wild type Ras, RasΔCAAX, or RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For loading experiments, 20 μm Ras was incubated at 30 °C in 200 mmNa acetate, containing 1 μm GTPγS or GDP.

Open table in a new tab Wild type Ras, RasΔCAAX, or RasΔCAAXR41K,R128K were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For loading experiments, 20 μm Ras was incubated at 30 °C in 200 mmNa acetate, containing 1 μm GTPγS or GDP.

Stoichiometry of the ADP-ribosylation of RasΔCAAX (wild type or mutant) was determined in reaction mixtures containing 5 μm Ras and 4 nm ΔN222 ExoS. Exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylates Ras at two distinct locations within the Ras molecule. One site of ADP-ribosylation, Arg41, lies in a β-sheet which is adjacent to the switch 1 domain of Ras, whereas the second and alternative sites of ADP-ribosylation, Arg128 and Arg135, respectively, lie within an α-helix located toward the C terminus of Ras. The crystal structure of Ras (18Tong L.A. de Vos A.M. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) predicts that Arg128 and Arg135 lie on the external face of the α-helix and are located on a different surface of the Ras molecule, relative to Arg41 (Fig.3). Because both Arg41 and Arg128 are removed from the nucleotide binding site of Ras, nucleotide occupancy might not affect the ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras. This was tested by loading Ras with GTP or GDP and measuring the stoichiometry and velocity of ADP-ribosylation relative to nucleotide-free Ras. Neither the stoichiometry nor the velocity of ADP-ribosylation of Ras was affected by the nucleotide occupancy (TableII). ExoS ADP-ribosylated either GTP-loaded, GDP-loaded, or nucleotide-free Ras to approximately 2 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras. These results indicate that ExoS did not preferentially ADP-ribosylate either GTP- or GDP-bound Ras. Control experiments using [35S]GTPγS showed efficient nucleotide exchange conditions with the loading of nucleotide to a stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of nucleotide per mol of Ras (data not shown). It should also be noted that Ras and RasΔCAAX showed the same velocities and stoichiometry as targets for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS. Thus, the presence of an acylation site does not influence the ADP-ribosylation properties of Ras. To date, several vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases have been identified, including rabbit skeletal muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase (RNART) (19Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), rat RT6 (20Haag F. Koch F. Thiele H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a human ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferases (21Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and chicken ADP-ribosyltransferase types I and II (22Tsuchiya M. Hara N. Yamada K. Osago H. Shimoyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27451-27457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases have the capacity to ADP-ribosylate several eukaryotic target proteins (11Yu Y. Okamoto S. Nemoto E. Dennert G. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12Klebl B.M. Gopel S.O. Pette D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and to ADP-ribosylate at two independent sites (13Just I. Sehr P. Jung M. van Damme J. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Moss J. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Terashima M. Yamamori C. Shimoyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which identified functional relationships with ExoS. Using the tFASTA algorithm, the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases were observed to possess considerable primary amino acid homology with the catalytic portion of ExoS. ExoS possessed homologies of 26.6% with RNART, 28.3% with HNART, 31.9% with RT6, 35.4% with CHAT 2b, and 25.7% with CHAT 1a. This alignment included the Ser-Thr-Ser motif and extended through the catalytic glutamic acids. Fig. 4 shows a PILEUP of the catalytic portion of ExoS and the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases. These data suggest the possibility that the catalytic domain of ExoS shares both structural and functional properties with the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases. In contrast, the alignments of the catalytic domain of ExoS with prokaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases showed a similar degree of homology: 26.9% with cholera toxin, 28.9% with heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli, and 23.8% with pertussis toxin. However, the homology centered on the Ser-Thr-Ser motif, but did not extend to the catalytic glutamic acids (data not shown). Previous data indicated that exoenzyme S ADP-ribosylated Ras at multiple sites, including Arg41 and a second site which could not be localized. The current study utilized direct biochemical and biophysical approaches to analyze how ExoS modified Ras. ADP-ribosylated Ras was digested with S. aureus V8 protease, and radiolabeled peptides were subjected to Edman degradation. During the Edman degradation reaction, radiolabeled ADP-ribosylated arginine was not recovered although a decrease in the yield of arginine at residues corresponding to Arg41 and Arg128 of Ras was detected. Others have demonstrated that radiolabeled ADP-ribosylarginine was not recovered when peptides ADP-ribosylated at arginine are subjected to Edman degradation although the site of ADP-ribosylation can be identified indirectly by a decrease in amino acid yield at a candidate arginine residue (14Terashima M. Yamamori C. Shimoyama M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fact that arginines 41 and 128 were identified as the sites of ADP-ribosylation by two different methods, Edman degradation of ADP-ribosylated peptides and mass spectrometry, after digestion with two different proteases, V8 and trypsin, respectively, indicate that ExoS ADP-ribosylates Ras at arginines 41 and 128. Analysis of the double mutant, RasR41K,R128K, revealed an alternative site for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS, Arg135. Because ExoS did not ADP-ribosylate Arg135 in Ras, it appears that the ADP-ribosylation of Arg128 sterically blocks the ADP-ribosylation of Arg135. Consistent with a steric mechanism of blockage, rather than an affinity effect, was the determination that ExoS ADP-ribosylated RasR41K,R128K at a rate that was within 4-fold of Ras. This indicates that ExoS can bind Ras in several orientations to facilitate ADP-ribosylation along that α-helix containing Arg128 and Arg135 and that ExoS can ADP-ribosylate Ras at Args on two distinct surfaces of Ras, the β-sheet containing Arg41 and the α-helix containing Arg128 and Arg135. The plasticity of the ExoS-Ras interactions may explain the observed ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate numerous small molecular weight GTP binding proteinsin vitro (7Coburn J. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4259-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coburn et al. (7Coburn J. Gill D.M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4259-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ExoS ADP-ribosylates several members of the Ras superfamily in vitro. Only a limited subset of the family, Ras, Ral, and Rap, contained the Arg41 homologue. Alignment of the α-helix, which contains the second site ADP-ribosylated by ExoS, Arg128, identified numerous members of the Ras superfamily that contained an arginine residue as a potential site of ADP-ribosylation. However, no distinct recognition motif is apparent from examination of the primary amino acid sequences of members of the Ras superfamily (Fig.5). Consistent with this prediction, we have observed that ExoS ADP-ribosylates RhoA in vitro. 3A. K. Ganesan and J. T. Barbieri, unpublished data. RhoA does not contain an Arg41 homolog but does contain several Args within the secondary α-helix. The potential of ADP-ribosylating Ras superfamily members at their Arg41 or Arg128homologues may have different functional implications. Arginine 41 is a contact residue in the Ras-Rap co-crystal structure (23Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and is in a region of close contact in the Ras-SOS crystal structure (24Boriacksjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Barsagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Modification of Ras at Arg41 may inhibit Ras activation or Ras-Raf interactions. The secondary site helix has no ascribed function, although it is located adjacent to the Ras farnesylation site. Therefore, it is unclear how ADP-ribosylation of Ras at Arg128 or 135 would affect Ras function, or alternatively ADP-ribosylation could affect Ras posttranslational modification. While ExoS has been shown to ADP-ribosylate Ras in vivo (9McGuffie E.M. Frank D.W. Vincent T.S. Olson J.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2607-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a more detailed analysis of the in vivo targets of ExoS is needed. Neither nucleotide occupancy nor Mg2+ binding altered the ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras, as the velocity and stoichiometry of the ADP-ribosylation of GTP-loaded, GDP-loaded, and nucleotide-free Ras were essentially identical. This indicated that the sites of ADP-ribosylation were not involved in nucleotide binding or chelation of Mg2+ and was consistent with structural data which predicted that Arg41 and Arg128 were distant from these binding sites. In contrast to ExoS, several bacterial toxins that modify Ras superfamily members preferentially target GDP bound forms of those proteins; Clostridium sordellii LT preferentially glucosylates GDP bound Ras (25Herrmann C. Ahmadian M.R. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16134-16139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) andClostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase preferentially ADP-ribosylates GDP-bound Rho (26Fritz G. Just I. Wollenberg P. Aktories K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fact that ExoS modifies both the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ras whereas other toxins described to date modify only the GDP-bound form indicates that ExoS modifies Ras signal transduction by a mechanism that is distinct from the Clostridial toxins. The endogenous vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases share several properties with ExoS, including the ability to ADP-ribosylate multiple target proteins and the ability to ADP-ribosylate target proteins at multiple sites. Sequence alignment showed that the catalytic domain of ExoS aligns more extensively with the eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases than bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. The primary amino acid alignments of mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases predicts the conservation of a basic amino acid, a Ser-Thr-Ser sequence, and a catalytic glutamic acid (27Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Alignment between the catalytic domain of ExoS and the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases extended from the Ser-Thr-Ser sequence through the active site glutamic acid. In contrast, tFASTA alignment between the catalytic domain of ExoS and the bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases, CT, LT, and PT, identified alignments only within the Ser-Thr-Ser sequence. This suggests that with respect to both functional and sequence alignments, ExoS is more similar to the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases than the prokaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferases. Thus, ExoS may have an evolutionary link with the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases. A better understanding of the mechanism by which ExoS modifies eukaryotic physiology may provide insight into the mechanisms of action of the vertebrate ADP-ribosyltransferases.

https://openalex.org/W2006035084,"KefB and KefC are glutathione-gated K+ efflux systems in Escherichia coli, and the proteins exhibit strong similarity at the level of both primary sequence and domain organization. The proteins are maintained closed by glutathione and are activated by binding of adducts formed between glutathione and electrophiles. By construction of equivalent mutations in each protein, this study has analyzed the control over inactive state of the proteins. A UV-induced mutation in KefB, L75S, causes rapid spontaneous K+ efflux but has only a minor effect on K+ efflux via KefC. Similarly amino acid substitutions that cause increased spontaneous activity in KefC have only small effects in KefB. Exchange of an eight amino acid region from KefC (HALESDIE) with the equivalent sequence from KefB (HELETAID) has identified a role for a group of acidic residues in controlling KefC activity. The mutations HELETAID and L74S in KefC act synergistically, and the activity of the resultant protein resembles that of KefB. We conclude that, despite the high degree of sequence similarity, KefB and KefC exhibit different sensitivities to the same site-specific mutations."

Analysis of coding sequences revealed that human adipocyte and testis HSL (HSLtes) are 775 and 1076 amino acids long, respectively. HSLtes differs from the adipocyte form by a unique NH2-terminal region. Elucidation of the HSL gene organization showed that nine coding exons are common to both forms. The additional sequence in HSLtes is encoded by a 1.2-kb-long testis-specific exon (3Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C.

When a gene is expressed in somatic tissues and in germ cells, tissue-specific expression often results from alternate promoter use (10Howard T.E. Shai S.-Y. Landford K.G. Martin B.M. Bernstein K.E.

The promoter of the adipocyte form of HSL (9Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is located 13 kb downstream of the HSLtes 5′-flanking region suggesting that the expression of the different forms of HSL is controlled by several tissue-specific promoters. During spermatogenesis, specialized transcriptional mechanisms ensure stage-specific gene expression in the germ cells. The factors controlling gene expression in post-meiotic germ cells are beginning to be elucidated. Several germ cell-specific putative transcription factors have been cloned, but target genes have been identified only for a few of them. CREMτ is a product of the CREM gene that acts as a transcriptional activator responsive to the cAMP signaling pathway (12Foulkes N.S. Mellström B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Several target genes for CREMτ-mediated activation have been identified in haploid germ cells, most notably the gene encoding protamine 1, a nucleoprotein that replaces histones and promotes nuclear condensation (13Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellström B. Jégou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 14Foulkes N. Schlotter F. Pévet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 362: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, targeted disruption of the CREM gene results in a complete block of germ cell differentiation at the first steps of spermiogenesis (15Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schütz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 16Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquiller D. LeMeur M. Henriksén K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Thus, CREMτ may govern a coordinated regulation of gene expression in post-meiotic germ cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that control the testis-specific expression of HSLtes. During spermatogenesis, HSLtes mRNA was expressed in haploid germ cells concomitantly with protamine 1 mRNA. We show that 0.5 kb of the HSLtes promoter was sufficient to drive testis-specific expression in transgenic mice. In cell transfection experiments, transactivation of the HSLtes promoter was independent of the cAMP signaling pathway. Four regions bound nuclear proteins present in testis and not in liver. One of the region bound Sox proteins expressed in post-meiotic germ cells raising the possibility that Sox proteins are involved in the transactivation of the HSLtes promoter. A mouse HSL DNA probe (477 bp) was generated by PCR on mouse genomic DNA with primers located in the first adipocyte coding exon 5′-ATG GAT TTA CGC ACG ATG ACA CAG-3′ and 5′-TAG CGT GAC ATA CTC TTG CAG GAA-3′. Proenkephalin (227 bp) and protamine 1 (207 bp) cDNA probes were generated by reverse transcription-PCR on mouse testis total RNA using 5′-GAC AGC AGC AAA CAG GAT GA-3′ and 5′-TTC AGC AGA TCG GAG GAG TT-3′, and 5′-AGC AAA AGC AGG AGC AGA TG-3′ and 5′-AGA TGT GGC GAG ATG CTC TT-3′ primers, respectively. PCR reactions were performed using the proofreading pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) using the TA cloning procedure (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strühl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 15.7.1-15.7.3Google Scholar). Identity of the amplicon sequences to published sequences was checked by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Total testis RNA was prepared from prepuberal and sexually mature mice by a single-step guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform extraction (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA samples (25 μg) were separated on a 1% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gel, transferred, and UV cross-linked to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loading of the different lanes was checked by ethidium bromide staining of the gel and by hybridization with a rat β-actin probe. Membranes were pre-hybridized for 1 h in hybridization buffer (500 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin) and then hybridized overnight in 10 ml of the same buffer containing 1.5 106 cpm/ml HSL and proenkephalin cDNA probes and 106 cpm/ml protamine cDNA probe. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 0.3 mNaCl, 30 mm tri-sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS 20 min at room temperature and once with 30 mm NaCl, 3 mmtri-sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Membranes were subjected to digital imaging (Molecular Dynamics). A 1.6-kbHindIII/BglII human DNA genomic restriction fragment was isolated from a cosmid clone containing the entire human HSL gene (3Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fragment was subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript and sequenced by automatic DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems). It contained 1.4 kb of the 5′-flanking region upstream of the testis-specific exon. The construct was digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the 1.6-kb fragment was ligated upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into the promoterless pCAT-basic vector (Promega) (p1.4HSLtesCAT). The 1.6-kbHindIII/BglII DNA genomic restriction fragment was also cloned upstream of the luciferase gene into the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (Promega) (p1.4HSLtesLUC). About 900 bp of p1.4HSLtesLUC 5′-flanking sequence was deleted by digestion withSmaI to produce p0.5HSLtesLUC. The SmaI site used to generate p0.5HSLtesLUC and the AvaI site used to generate the microinjected fragment 0.5HSLtesCAT (see below) are overlapping. The complete 1-kb CREMτ cDNA (12Foulkes N.S. Mellström B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the expression vector pSVSport (Life Technologies, Inc.). The two transgenes were prepared by digesting p1.4HSLtesCAT with HindIII and BamHI or with AvaI and BamHI to give, respectively, 1.4HSLtesCAT and 0.5HSLtesCAT. These two fragments were isolated on agarose gel by electroelution and purified using an elutip-d column (Schleicher & Schuell). Transgenic mice were produced by microinjection of the transgenes into the pronuclei of fertilized B6D2/F1 mouse eggs (19Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 226-250Google Scholar). Microinjected embryos were transferred to pseudo-pregnant B6-CBA/F1 female mice and carried to term. Screening of the positive transgenic animals was performed with DNA prepared from tail samples using Southern blot or PCR using as sense primer an oligonucleotide located in the human HSLtes 5′-flanking sequence and as antisense primer an oligonucleotide located in the CAT gene. Subsequent generation of heterozygous mice were produced by mating transgenic mice with wild type B6-CBA/F1 mice. The transmission of the transgene was ∼50% in the progeny of all founders indicating Mendelian transmission. Protein extracts for CAT assays were prepared from hemizygous transgenic mice. Briefly, tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 0.5 ml of 250 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Homogenates were heated 7.5 min at 65 °C and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were kept for CAT and protein analyses (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D.

Ninety μg of RNA from transgenic sexually mature mouse testis or 1 μg of human testis poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of RNase H buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 5% sucrose) containing 10 pmol of the human-specific single strand antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GTA GAG TAA CTA AGG AGT TG-3′ (nt 197 to 179 downstream of the transcriptional start site). After 10 min at 70 °C, hybridization was performed for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, 40 μl of RNase H buffer containing 7 units of RNase H (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and digestion was carried out for 45 min (21Gautron S. Maire P. Hakim V. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The digestion products were separated on a polyacrylamide-urea gel after ethanol precipitation. The gel was washed twice in 7% formaldehyde, 9 mm Tris borate, 0.2 mm EDTA, and RNA was passively transferred onto a nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed as described above using a32P-labeled probe corresponding to the 197 bp located downstream of the transcription start site. JEG3 cells grown in 28-cm2 plates were transfected using Fugene-6 (Boehringer Mannheim) with 700 ng of p0.5HSLtesLUC or pCRE-LUC (Stratagene), 700 ng of CREMτ-pSVSport or pSVSport, 700 ng of pFC-PKA, an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Stratagene) or pFC-DBD, the negative control plasmid (Stratagene) and 50 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega). The pRL-CMV vector encoding Renila luciferase was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Cells were treated 44 h post-transfection with 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Sigma) when specified. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection for Firefly andRenilla luciferase activity determinations according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Total nuclei extracts were performed as described by Howard et al.(22Howard T. Balogh R. Overbeek P. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) with modifications. Four adult rat testis and 10–15 mg of adult rat liver (perfused with 0.9% NaCl to wash out blood) were washed in ice-cold saline containing 0.1 mm PMSF, decapsulated, and minced with scissors in 40 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmKCl, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and sucrose (1.85 m for testis, 2m for liver)). Tissues were then homogenized in a glass tissue grinder with a motor-driven Teflon pestle until cells were broken. The homogenate was then completed to 80 (testis) and 100 ml (liver) with homogenization buffer, and 28-ml aliquots were layered over 10-ml cushions of the same buffer in SW28 tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were carefully removed, and the tube walls were washed with water and dried. Nuclei pellets were resuspended in 3 (testis) or 5 ml (liver) of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm EDTA, 8.8 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.14 m NaCl) using an all-glass Dounce homogenizer (pestle B). An aliquot was diluted 100 times in 0.5% SDS, and the absorbance at 260 nm was measured. The nuclear suspension was diluted at 40A 260 units per ml. An equal volume of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 100 mm EDTA, 8.8 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.7 m NaCl) was added dropwise, and the extract was gently shaken for 45 min. The viscous lysate was then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 °C to pellet the chromatin. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was progressively added (0.4 g/ml) to the supernatant and dissolved by gentle mixing. After incubation 45 min on ice, the precipitated proteins were centrifuged in an SW60 rotor at 37,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 1.2 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) for 40A 260 units of nuclear lysate (see above). The protein extract was dialyzed twice for 2 h against 200 ml of the dialysis buffer without DTT and PMSF. The precipitate, formed during dialysis, was discarded by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. The protein extract was frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations ranged between 5 and 10 mg/ml. Single strand oligonucleotides (35 bp) covering 0.5 kb of the testis HSL promoter were gel-purified. Other oligonucleotides used were as follows: mSRY/Sox, 5′-GTA GGG CAC CCA TTG TTC TCT-3′ (23Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2350-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). 100 ng of single strand oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Eurogentec) and [γ-32P]ATP (>4000 Ci/mmol). After heat inactivation of the kinase, the labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to 300 ng of the complementary strand oligonucleotides. Labeled double strand oligonucleotides were purified with the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen).32P-Labeled DNA (1 ng at approximately 100,000 cpm/ng) was incubated on ice for 30 min with testis (10 μg) or liver (8 μg) nuclear extracts in a total reaction buffer volume of 25 μl containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm spermidine, 5 mm MgCl2, 12% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg of poly(dG-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 10 V/cm for 3 h in a 23 mm Tris borate, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA migration buffer. Polyacrylamide gels were dried under vacuum and subjected to digital imaging (Molecular Dynamics). Gel retardation assays were also performed with Sox proteins. A truncated form of the trout orthologue of Sox6 deleted of the leucine zipper region was produced in a reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) using the pCMV/Sox-LZ(D105–356) vector and the empty pRc/CMV vector (27Takamatsu N. Kanda H. Tsuchiya I. Yamada S. Ito M. Kabeno S. Shiba T. Yamashita S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Six μl of the reaction mixture were used in gel retardation assays. A peptide containing the high mobility group (HMG) box of mouse Sox5 (28Connor F. Cary P. Read C. Preston N. Driscoll P. Denny P. Crane-Robinson C. Ashworth A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3339-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was produced in Escherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads and bovine thrombin. The purity of the peptide was checked on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fifty ng of purified protein and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double strand oligonucleotide were used in gel retardation assays. Annealed synthetic oligonucleotides containing the TSBR4 region (Fig. 4) were cloned into the XbaI site of the circular permutation vector pBend2 (29Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S.

In rodents, the time at which a transcript appears during the first wave of spermatogenesis in prepuberal animal can be used to identify the spermatogenic cell type in which transcription initiates (31Bellve A. Finn C. Oxford Reviews of Reproductive Biology. 1. Oxford University Press, New York1979: 159-261Google Scholar). The levels of proenkephalin and protamine 1 mRNA were therefore determined. In rodents, somatic and spermatogenic cells expressed a 1.4- and a 1.7-kb proenkephalin mRNA, respectively. The testis-specific proenkephalin mRNA is expressed at high levels in late pachytene spermatocytes, and protamine 1 mRNA expression appears in round spermatids (32Kilpatrick D.L. Millette C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5015-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Kleene K. Distel R. Hecht N. Dev.

Densitometric analyses of the bands showed that the kinetics of HSLtes and protamine mRNA expression were very similar (data not shown), suggesting an expression of both genes in haploid round spermatids. To investigate whether the 5′-flanking region of the human HSLtes specific exon contained cis-acting sequences involved in tissue-specific expression, we generated transgenic mice with 1.4HSLtesCAT and 0.5HSLtesCAT constructs. Three (A, B, and C) and two (D and E) lines were generated from the large and small constructs, respectively. High levels of CAT activity were detected in testis and epididymis from sexually mature mice (between 60 and 90 days old) for the two transgenes (Table I). The activity in epididymis was ascribed to sperm since, when mature sperm is washed from the epididymis, CAT activity was between 200 and 800 cpm/min/mg protein in the collected fluid. HSL enzymatic activity and protein was also detected in the collected fraction indicating the expression of HSL in sperm after spermiation (data not shown). No apparent variation in CAT activity was observed in the offspring of the founders and subsequent generations (data not shown). These data provided evidence that 0.5 kb of the 5′-flanking region are sufficient to drive expression of the CAT gene in testis. Next, we sought to determine if the 5′-flanking regions conferred tissue-specific expression. In males, CAT activity levels were very low in all non-gonadal tissues. In females, the low level of CAT activity seen in all tissues was comparable to the level detected in tissues of non-transgenic male and female mice (data not shown). Therefore, the sequences present in the first 0.5 kb of the human HSLtespromoter are critical for specific expression in testis. CAT activity was also determined in testis of 25- and 60-day-old mice from lines A and D. Four animals were analyzed per line at both ages. In young mice, the levels of CAT activity were 21 ± 3 cpm/min/mg protein for line A and 18 ± 1 cpm/min/mg protein for line D. In older mice, CAT activity levels were 818 ± 36 and 862 ± 43 cpm/min/mg protein, respectively. The marked increase in CAT activity showed that the transgenes were expressed in post-meiotic germ cells.Table IChloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of 1.4HSLtesCAT and of 0.5HSLtesCAT in transgenic miceMalesLineBrainHeartLiverKidneyGutStomachSpleenLungSkel.Adi.TestisEpi.1.4HSLtesCATA7111225110121750450B125371045815830NDC14103638276200ND0.5HSLtesCATD24021564015800550E125381275614700NDFemalesLineBrainHeartLiverKidneyGutStomachSpleenLungSkel.Adi.UterusOvary1.4HSLtesCATA85612242347215B715740480115200.5HSLtesCATD9110106720626901.4HSLtesCAT and 0.5HSLtesCAT contain 1.4 and 0.5 kb of the testicular HSL 5′-flanking region upstream of the CAT gene, respectively.

When ligands such as CO, NO, and O2 bind to the heme iron of P450cam in the intermediate complex, the EPR spectrum of reduced putidaredoxin with a characteristic signal at 346 millitesla at 77 K changed into a spectrum having a new signal at 348 millitesla. The experiment with O2 was carried out by employing a mutant P450cam with Asp251 → Asn or Gly where the rate of electron transfer from putidaredoxin to oxyferrous P450cam is considerably reduced. Such a ligand-induced EPR spectral change of putidaredoxin was also shown in situ inPseudomonas putida. Mutations introduced into the neighborhood of the iron-sulfur cluster of putidaredoxin revealed that a Ser44 → Gly mutation mimicked the ligand-induced spectral change of putidaredoxin. Arg109 and Arg112, which are in the putative putidaredoxin binding site of P450cam, were essential for the spectral changes of putidaredoxin in the complex. These results indicate that a change in the P450cam active site that is the consequence of an altered spin state is transmitted to putidaredoxin within the ternary complex and produces a conformational change of the 2Fe–2S active center."
https://openalex.org/W2063489538,"Cellular retinol-binding proteins types I and II (CRBP-I and CRBP-II) are known to differentially facilitate retinoid metabolism by several membrane-associated enzymes. The mechanism of ligand transfer to phospholipid small unilamellar vesicles was compared in order to determine whether differences in ligand trafficking properties could underlie these functional differences. Unidirectional transfer of retinol from the CRBPs to membranes was monitored by following the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence that occurs upon ligand dissociation. The results showed that ligand transfer of retinol from CRBP-I was >5-fold faster than transfer from CRBP-II. For both proteins, transfer of the other naturally occurring retinoid, retinaldehyde, was 4–5-fold faster than transfer of retinol. Rates of ligand transfer from CRBP-I to small unilamellar vesicles increased with increasing concentration of acceptor membrane and with the incorporation of the anionic lipids cardiolipin or phosphatidylserine into membranes. In contrast, transfer from CRBP-II was unaffected by either membrane concentration or composition. Preincubation of anionic vesicles with CRBP-I was able to prevent cytochrome c, a peripheral membrane protein, from binding, whereas CRBP-II was ineffective. In addition, monolayer exclusion experiments demonstrated differences in the rate and magnitude of the CRBP interactions with phospholipid membranes. These results suggest that the mechanisms of ligand transfer from CRBP-I and CRBP-II to membranes are markedly different as follows: transfer from CRBP-I may involve and require effective collisional interactions with membranes, whereas a diffusional process primarily mediates transfer from CRBP-II.

The selective movement of retinoids throughout the body is a subject of intense interest due to these pleiotropic effects. Dietary vitamin A leaves the enterocyte on chylomicrons in the form of retinyl esters and is delivered to the liver in the chylomicron remnant. Hepatic processing results in either release of retinol bound to the extracellular retinol-binding protein (RBP)1 or storage in stellate cells as retinyl esters. The released retinol is transported to target tissues bound to RBP where it is internalized and converted to its active forms. Within cells, cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) are thought to facilitate retinoid metabolism by presenting ligand to specific metabolic enzymes. The precise roles of extracellular and intracellular retinoid-binding proteins in ligand transport and targeting are nevertheless not defined. It has been shown in vitro that retinoids are capable of partitioning into the hydrophobic phase of membranes and that transfer between lipid vesicles or to intracellular binding proteins can occur via diffusional processes (1Ho M.T.P. Pownall H.J. Hollyfield J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17759-17763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Noy N. Xu X.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3878-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The degree to which this spontaneous diffusional movement accounts for retinoid trafficking in a cellular context is controversial. An alternative theory suggests that the directed channeling of retinol to membrane lipid or protein compartments occurs via its specific binding proteins. For example, an early report that examined the kinetics of retinol transfer from RBP to liposomes suggested that retinol transfer occurred by collisional interactions between RBP and membranes (3Fex G. Johannesson G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 901: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, retinol entry into cells may involve uptake via a specific cell-surface RBP receptor. A recent study suggests that the RBP receptor and CRBP-I within cells are able to interact directly, resulting in a channeling of the hydrophobic ligand from the extracellular RBP to the intracellular CRBP-I (4Sundaram M. Sivaprasadarao A. DeSousa M.M. Findlay J.B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3336-3342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Extensive studies directed at the functional role of the CRBPs have shown that particular forms of these binding proteins are also able to interact with specific metabolic enzymes. This family of binding proteins includes cellular retinol-binding protein (type I), distributed widely throughout the body, and cellular retinol-binding protein type II, restricted to the enterocyte and the neonatal hepatocyte (reviewed in Refs. 5Ong D.E.

Nutr. 1996; 16: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These two binding proteins have 56% sequence identity, they both bind retinol and retinaldehyde with high affinity, and their crystallographic structures are virtually superimposable (5Ong D.E.

Nutr. 1996; 16: 205-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Holo-CRBP-I and -CRBP-II are both able to serve as substrate for the esterification of retinol by the microsomal enzyme lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). Despite these similarities, apoCRBP-I has been shown to inhibit LRAT, whereas apoCRBP-II does not (7Herr F.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 31: 6748-6755Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The ability of LRAT to differentiate between these structurally similar proteins and between the apo and holo forms implies that subtle conformational differences may dictate differential recognition of these binding proteins by enzymes and further suggests that functional differences between CRBP-I and CRBP-II may exist. Similar discrimination between apo and holo-CRBP-I has been observed with the microsomal NADP-dependent retinol dehydrogenase (8Napoli J.L. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants by which enzymes discriminate between binding proteins are as yet unknown. Several of the enzymes involved in cellular vitamin A metabolism are membrane-associated. It is therefore possible that in addition to interacting with the enzymes themselves, the binding proteins may also be interacting with a lipid component in the bilayer. However, only limited information on the role of these proteins in trafficking retinoids from and/or between membranes is available. Previous studies have demonstrated that partitioning of retinol from CRBP-I to model membranes can occur (9Noy N. Blaner W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Rong D. Lin C.-L.S. d'Avignon A. Lovey A.J. Rosenberger M. Li E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Transfer from CRBP-II to membranes has also been reported, but kinetic measurements were not made (10Rong D. Lin C.-L.S. d'Avignon A. Lovey A.J. Rosenberger M. Li E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, using changes in intrinsic protein tryptophan fluorescence, we are able to directly examine and compare the kinetics and mechanism of transfer of retinol from CRBP-I and CRBP-II to phospholipid membranes. We demonstrate that the two proteins transfer ligand to model membranes at significantly different rates and via distinctly different mechanisms. Transfer from CRBP-I may involve and require effective collisional interactions with membranes, whereas a diffusional process primarily mediates transfer from CRBP-II. In addition, two assays were employed to examine directly the interaction of CRBPs with model membranes. In both systems the two proteins interacted with membranes to markedly different degrees, and these differences substantiate the disparities observed in the retinoid transfer assays. The differences in membrane interaction may help account for the differential recognition of CRBP-I and CRBP-II by metabolic membrane-bound enzymes and may relate to differences in the selective trafficking of retinol in the cell. All-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinaldehyde, and cytochrome c (type VI, horse heart) were from Sigma. Egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), egg phosphatidylethanolamine (EPE),N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD) egg phosphatidylcholine, brain phospha- tidylserine (PS), bovine heart cardiolipin (CL), andN-(5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). All other reagents were of the highest grade available. Rat apoCRBP-I and CRBP-II were purified using a recombinant expression system as described previously (11Li E. Qian S. Winter N. d'Avignon A. Levin M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3622-3629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Holoprotein was prepared by addition of equimolar ligand (in ethanol, final ethanol <0.01% v/v), and saturation was monitored by following the increase in retinol fluorescence (λex 350 nm). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by sonication and ultracentrifugation as described (12Storch J. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The typical SUVs used in these studies were composed of 100% EPC. To examine the effect of membrane charge, 10 mol % of either PS or CL was incorporated in place of an equimolar amount of EPC. The SUVs were prepared in 40 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. For CL-containing SUVs the buffer included 1 mm EDTA and for the studies involving changes in ionic strength the vesicles were prepared in 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. For the cytochromec displacement studies, the vesicles were composed of 64 mol % EPC, 10 mol % EPE, 25 mol % CL, and 1 mol % DPE and were prepared in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The concentration of phospholipid was determined by quantitation of total inorganic phosphate (13Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar), and concentrations of vesicles containing CL were corrected for the two phosphate groups per CL molecule. The molar equilibrium distribution of retinol between CRBPs and EPC SUVs (K p) was estimated by quantifying the increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the proteins upon release of ligand to SUVs (14Cogan U. Kopleman M. Mokady S. Shinitsky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1.Kp=(Fi/[CRBP])/{(Fo−Fi)/[SUV]i}Equation 1 where F o and F i are relative fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of [SUV]i. Equation 1 can be rewritten as Equation 2.1/ΔF=(Kp)(1/ΔFmax)(mol EPC/mol CRBP)+1/ΔFmaxEquation 2 where ΔF is the relative difference in fluorescence at a given molar ratio of lipid to protein, ΔF max is the maximal fluorescence intensity change, and K p is the slope of the resultant line (15Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Holo-CRBP-I or -CRBP-II (1 μm in 40 mmTris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was titrated with increasing amounts of EPC SUV, and partitioning was monitored by measuring the increase in tryptophan fluorescence (λex 290 nm) using an SLM-8000 spectrofluorometer. Relative fluorescence emission intensities at 340 nm were used in Equation 2 to calculate K pvalues. The K p values for CRBP-I and CRBP-II, estimated as above, were necessary to determine the minimum amount of lipid necessary to ensure a ≥1:1 ratio of donor:acceptor binding capacity in the retinol transfer assays so that unidirectional transfer rates could be assessed (16Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Hsu K.-T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, transfer from CRBP-I was examined at a lipid:protein molar ratio of ≥500:1, and transfer from CRBP-II was examined at a lipid:protein molar ratio of ≥100:1. By surpassing the K p values, all transfer assays were done at lipid levels that ensured distribution of ligand to membranes, and therefore, rate comparisons between proteins are valid. Transfer of retinol or retinaldehyde from CRBPs to SUVs was monitored by two different transfer assays. First, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay was used to monitor the transfer of retinol from CRBP-II to EPC vesicles containing the fluorescent quencher NBD-PC (3.5 mol %). Briefly, 2 μm holo-CRBP-II was mixed with increasing concentrations of SUVs, and a time-dependent decrease in retinol fluorescence (excitation 350 nm, emission filter 450 ± 35 nm) was observed upon transfer of retinol to the NBD-containing SUVs (9Noy N. Blaner W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transfer from holo-CRBP-I to NBD-containing vesicles was not detectable using this method due to the large inner filter quenching of retinol fluorescence by NBD at the SUV levels required for unidirectional transfer. As a result, a second assay was developed to monitor changes in protein fluorescence upon transfer of the ligand from protein to membranes. The protein fluorescence assay makes use of the decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence of the CRBPs that occurs upon ligand binding (14Cogan U. Kopleman M. Mokady S. Shinitsky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This quenching of holoprotein fluorescence is relieved when ligand is released from the binding site (9Noy N. Blaner W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6380-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, upon mixing holoprotein (1 μm retinol-CRBP-I or 2 μm retinol-CRBP-II) with EPC SUVs, release of ligand from the protein is monitored via a time-dependent increase in protein fluorescence (excitation 287 nm, emission filter 355 ± 60 nm). For each condition used, a rate was obtained by averaging the values from ≥5 separate transfer data sets. An example of a single transfer data set is shown in Fig.1. The molar excess of acceptor lipid necessary to ensure unidirectional transfer was determined by the partition coefficients estimated as described above, and the final ratios used are indicated in each figure legend. For the transfer assays, proteins and lipids were typically in 40 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and transfer was monitored at 25 °C unless noted otherwise. For studies of the effects of ionic strength, NaCl was added to the SUV and protein samples prior to mixing. Both the retinol and tryptophan fluorescence assays utilized a Stopped-Flow Spectrofluorimeter DX 17MV (Applied Photophysics Limited, UK) to monitor the time-dependent changes in fluorescence, and the data were fit to the Marquant-Levenberg nonlinear regression algorithm using software provided with the instrument. All curves were well fit by a single exponential function. The binding of cytochrome c to acidic membranes can be monitored using the resonance energy transfer between a dansyl-labeled lipid and the heme moiety of cytochromec (18Faucon J.F. Dufourcq J. Lussan C. Bernon R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 435: 283-294Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Mustonen P. Vistanen J.A. Somerharju P.J. Kinnenun P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2991-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The dansyl fluorescence of DPE-SUV is quenched upon binding of cytochrome c. The ability of CRBPs to bind membranes was monitored by determining the degree to which these proteins inhibit this cytochrome c quenching, as described previously (20Corsico B. Cistola D.P. Frieden C. Storch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12174-12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In a final volume of 2 ml, 0–2 μmretinaldehyde-CRBP-I was added to 12.5 μm SUV (EPC:EPE:CL:DPE, 64:10:25:1) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (retinaldehyde was used as the ligand as it does not fluoresce and therefore does not interfere with the dansyl fluorescence spectrum). After a 5-min equilibration, cytochromec was added (0.75 μm final), and the mixture was equilibrated an additional 2 min prior to monitoring fluorescence emission at 520 nm (excitation, 335 nm; slit width set at 2 nm for excitation and 16 nm for emission). Lipids used in the monolayer experiments were prepared by dissolving a known quantity in chloroform and storing the lipid solution under argon at −20 °C. Interface experiments employed a KSV 5000 monolayer apparatus enclosed in a humidified cabinet and 7.2-cm circular Teflon adsorption wells equipped with injection ports and magnetic stirrers (21Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Jones J.B. Kussie P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29588-29591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wells were filled with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 0.05% EDTA, and the buffer surface was cleaned by vacuum aspiration. EPC monolayers were spread at the air/buffer interface to the desired pressure by dropwise addition of the chloroform/lipid solution from a Hamilton syringe and were left for 30 min to ensure complete evaporation of the organic solvent. Known amounts of apoCRBP-I or apoCRBP-II were then injected into the subphase to yield a final concentration of 6 × 10−3 g/liter (0.4 μm), and the change in pressure versus time was automatically recorded using a platinum Wilhelmy plate suspended from an electrobalance. The precision of pressure measurements was 0.01 mN/m. In order to examine the kinetics of unidirectional retinol transfer to phospholipid vesicles, we first determined the equilibrium partition coefficients for retinol between CRBP-I or CRBP-II relative to model phospholipid vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, for both CRBP-I and CRBP-II, fluorescence emission at 340 nm increased upon addition of SUV; a representative experiment is shown in Fig.2. Titrating in increasing concentrations of SUV and transforming the fluorescence data (inset, Fig.2) resulted in calculated K p values of 300 ± 50 for CRBP-I and 24 ± 9 for CRBP-II. These apparent partition coefficients suggest that CRBP-I has a higher retinol binding affinity than does CRBP-II. Previous analysis of the relative affinities of these two proteins for retinol have yielded conflicting results. Fluorometric titration studies indicated that CRBP-I and CRBP-II have similar K d values for retinol (≅10 nm) (22MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10550-10556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Levin M.S. Li E. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas NMR analyses have suggested that CRBP-I may have as much as 100-fold greater affinity for retinol than does CRBP-II (11Li E. Qian S. Winter N. d'Avignon A. Levin M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3622-3629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present partition data indicate that CRBP-I and CRBP-II differ in their affinity for retinol by approximately an order of magnitude, in that 12-fold more SUV is required to obtain equivalent ligand dissociation from CRBP-I relative to CRBP-II. Transfer of retinol from CRBP-I and CRBP-II to SUVs was examined using two different fluorometric assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the first method, transfer of ligand from the protein to the NBD-SUVs was monitored by the time-dependent decrease in retinol fluorescence caused by NBD quenching. As theK p for CRBP-I dictated a minimum of 300-fold molar excess lipid to ensure unidirectional transfer, inner filter quenching of retinol fluorescence by the NBD fluorophore precluded the use of this assay with holo-CRBP-I. However, holo-CRBP-II did not require such high lipid:protein ratios, and the NBD-based transfer assay yielded transfer rates of 0.08 ± 0.01 s−1 using a 100-fold excess of lipid relative to protein and 0.07 ± 0.01 s−1 using 200-fold excess lipid. In the second method, transfer of ligand to membranes was monitored by increases in binding protein tryptophan fluorescence, in the absence of any additional fluorophore. As the absolute amount of lipid did not interfere with tryptophan fluorescence measurements, mechanisms and rates of transfer of retinol from both CRBP-I and CRBP-II could be compared directly. The results showed that transfer rates for retinol from CRBP-I to SUVs were, at minimum, 6-fold faster than rates from CRBP-II (0.46 ± 0.07 s−1 versus 0.08 ± 0.005 s−1, Fig. 3). Importantly, the results for CRBP-II using this tryptophan fluorescence assay were virtually identical to those obtained with the retinol-NBD energy transfer method (at a 100-fold molar excess lipid,k = 0.08 ± 0.01 s−1, and at 200-fold molar excess lipid, k = 0.07 ± 0.004 s−1, Fig. 3). Thus, rates of retinol transfer from CRBP-II were identical when monitored by either the quenching of retinol fluorescence or the increase in protein fluorescence. The transfer of a hydrophobic ligand from a protein to a membrane can occur via several different mechanisms. There can be effective collisional interactions between protein and membrane lipids, resulting in ligand transfer. There can be release of the ligand to the aqueous milieu, diffusion through the aqueous phase and then association onto the membrane, and finally there can be a combination of both collisional and diffusional events. In order to discern between these transfer mechanisms, the concentration and charge of acceptor vesicles were varied. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained when a constant concentration of holoprotein was mixed with increasing concentrations of EPC-SUV. Increasing the concentration of acceptor membrane did not alter the rate of transfer of retinol from holo-CRBP-II, whereas an increase in acceptor lipid increased the transfer rate from holo-CRBP-I. These results suggest that transfer of retinol from CRBP-I includes effective collisions between protein and lipid, whereas transfer from CRBP-II does not appear to involve such interactions. The potential differences in retinol transfer mechanisms were further explored by changing the surface charge density of the acceptor vesicles, since alterations in acceptor membrane properties can only influence the ligand transfer rate in the case of a collisional mechanism (24Herr F.M. Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11840-11845Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Indeed, increasing the net negative charge on phospholipid vesicles increased the retinol transfer rate from CRBP-I but not from CRBP-II (Fig. 4). Transfer from CRBP-I to vesicles containing 10 mol % phosphatidylserine was 3-fold faster than transfer to neutral vesicles, and transfer to vesicles containing 10 mol % cardiolipin was 4-fold faster. In contrast, transfer of retinol from CRBP-II was relatively unaffected by surface charge density, indicating that transfer from CRBP-II is not affected by the anionic character of the acceptor membranes. Taken together, the acceptor concentration and charge data suggest that these homologous binding proteins transfer retinol to model membranes via distinctly different mechanisms. CRBP-I may utilize collisional interactions with the membrane to effect retinol transfer, whereas retinol transfer from CRBP-II is likely to occur by aqueous diffusion of the dissociated ligand. The large enhancement of retinol transfer rate to acidic vesicles suggests that electrostatic interactions between CRBP-I and membranes may be involved in the retinol transfer mechanism. CRBP-I and CRBP-II can bind both retinol and retinaldehyde with high affinity. The two proteins have equal affinity for retinaldehyde (11Li E. Qian S. Winter N. d'Avignon A. Levin M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3622-3629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10550-10556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but CRBP-I appears to have a greater affinity for retinol than does CRBP-II (see above and Ref. 11Li E. Qian S. Winter N. d'Avignon A. Levin M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3622-3629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As both retinol and retinaldehyde serve as substrates for key metabolic enzymes, we compared the relative rates of transfer of these ligands to phospholipid membranes. Transfer of retinaldehyde from CRBP-II to EPC-SUVs was approximately 4-fold faster than transfer of retinol (on average 0.29 s−1 for retinaldehyde and 0.07 s–1 for retinol, Fig.5 A). Similarly, transfer of retinaldehyde from CRBP-I was 5-fold faster at the lowest lipid ratio examined (2.2 and 0.41 s−1, respectively, Fig.5 B). Therefore, under these conditions both proteins transfer retinaldehyde to EPC membranes at a significantly faster rate than they transfer retinol. Increasing the concentration of acceptor membranes increased the rate of retinaldehyde transfer from CRBP-I but not from CRBP-II, indicating that for both proteins the mechanism of transfer of retinaldehyde is similar to that of retinol (Fig. 5). When diffusional movement through the aqueous phase is involved in the transfer of a hydrophobic ligand, increases in the ionic strength of the milieu can decrease its solubility and thereby decrease transfer rates logarithmically (26Kim H.K. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If transfer occurs via effective collisions, such decreases in rate are not anticipated. Therefore, we examined the effects of ionic strength on transfer of retinol from the CRBPs by measuring the rate of transfer in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 6). Retinol transfer rates from CRBP-I increased significantly with an increase in ionic strength of the buffer. Approximately 85% of the total increase was reached by 0.5 m NaCl, and the rate at 1 mNaCl was more than 3-fold greater than that at 0m NaCl. These results are analogous to those obtained for the transfer of fatty acid from heart fatty acid-binding protein to membranes, which is also postulated to occur by collisional interactions (25Herr F.M. Aronson J. Storch J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1296-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Kim H.K. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20051-20056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wootan M.G. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer rates from CRBP-II to membranes also increased in response to changes in ionic strength, although to a far lesser extent, with a difference of only 10% between 0 and 1m NaCl (Fig. 6). Although these results for CRBP-II are not consistent with the expected decrease in transfer rate for an aqueous diffusion-mediated process, they nevertheless demonstrate substantial differences between the two CRBPs. Circular dichroism spectra showed that the molar ellipticity of the CRBPs did not change between 0.1m NaCl and 0.5 m NaCl (data not shown), and therefore gross tertiary unfolding cannot account for the ionic strength effects seen in Fig. 6. Cytochrome c has been shown to interact with acidic membranes in vitro under conditions of low ionic strength (29Rytomaa M. Kinnunen P.K.J. J. Biol. Che"
https://openalex.org/W1974814614,"Spectroscopic and chemical modification studies of modified flavins bound to old yellow enzyme have led to predictions about the flavin environment of this enzyme. These studies analyzed solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding patterns of particular flavin atoms, in addition to suggesting amino acid residues that are in close proximity to those atoms. Here, these studies are evaluated in the light of the crystal structure of old yellow enzyme to reveal that the spectroscopic and modified flavin results are generally consistent with the crystal structure. This highlights the fact that these are useful methods for studying flavin binding site structure. Although several of the inferred properties of the flavin environment are not consistent with the crystal structure, these discrepancies occurred in cases where an incorrect choice was made from among multiple plausible explanations for an experimental result. We conclude that modified flavin studies are powerful probes of flavin environment; however, it is risky to specify details of interactions, especially because of uncertainties due to induced charge delocalization in the flavin."
https://openalex.org/W2068895167,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a potent inhibitor of proliferation in several cell types, including thyroid FRTL-5 cells. As intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) is a major signal in activating proliferation, we investigated the effect of TNF-α on calcium fluxes in FRTL-5 cells. TNF-α per se did not modulate resting [Ca2+]i. However, preincubation (10 min) of the cells with 1–100 ng/ml TNF-α decreased the thapsigargin (Tg)-evoked store-operated calcium entry in a concentration-dependent manner. TNF-α did not inhibit the mobilization of sequestered calcium. To investigate whether the effect of TNF-α on calcium entry was mediated via the sphingomyelinase pathway, the cells were pretreated with sphingomyelinase (SMase) prior to stimulation with Tg. SMase inhibited the Tg-evoked calcium entry in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, an inhibition of calcium entry was obtained after preincubation of the cells with the membrane-permeable C2-ceramide and C6-ceramide analogues. The inactive ceramides dihydro-C2 and dihydro-C6 showed only marginal effects. Neither SMase, C2-ceramide, nor C6-ceramide affected the release of sequestered calcium. C2- and C6-ceramide also decreased the ATP-evoked calcium entry, without affecting the release of sequestered calcium. The effect of TNF-α and SMase was inhibited by the kinase inhibitor staurosporin and by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C but not by down-regulation of PKC. However, we were unable to measure a significant activation of PKC using TNF-α or C6-ceramide. The effect of TNF-α was not mediated via activation of either c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38 kinase. We were unable to detect an increase in the ceramide (or sphingosine) content of the cells after stimulation with TNF-α for up to 30 min.

TNF-α also potently modulates thyroid function, especially growth and differentiation. In humans, the injection of TNF-α decreases serum triiodothyronine and TSH levels (1van der Poll T. Romijn J.A. Wiersinga W.M. Sauerwein H.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1990; 71: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas in rats and mice TNF-α decreases both serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels and serum TSH levels (2Ozawa M.

Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In human thyroid cells in culture, TNF-α decreases the TSH-evoked incorporation of 125I and the secretion of triiodothyronine and thyroxine (4Sato K. Satoh T. Shizume K. Ozawa M. Han D.C. Imamura H.

TNF-α attenuates also the production of thyroglobulin and cAMP in these cells (5Rasmussen Å.K. Kayser L. Feldt-Rasmussen U. Bendtzen K. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 143: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In rat FRTL-5 cells, TNF-α inhibits the TSH-evoked uptake of iodide and inhibits mitogen-evoked cell proliferation (6Zakarija M. McKenzie J.M.

Furthermore, TNF-α inhibits the TSH-evoked type I 5′-deiodinase activity, the expression of both the thyroid peroxidase gene and the thyroglobulin gene (9Ongphiphadhanakul O. Fang S.L. Tang K.-T.

Kobayashi I. Kondo Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E638-E643Google Scholar). TNF-α binds to two membrane receptors, a 55- and a 75-kDa receptor. Of these two forms, the 55-kDa receptor apparently is the most important (13Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Kampen E. Himmler A. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17997-18001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yanaga F. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Binding of TNF-α to FRTL-5 cells has also been reported (3Pang X.-P. Hershman J.M. Chung M. Pekary A.E. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although the receptor types have not been characterized. TNF-α activates different sphingomyelinases in cells, resulting in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, or the Jun kinase 1 (JNK-1) cascade (15Testi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). TNF-α may also activate protein kinase C (PKC) (13Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Kampen E. Himmler A. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17997-18001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ceramide-evoked activation of NFκB is probably important in linking the TNF-α-evoked stimulus to transcriptional activity in the nucleus (16Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 17Yang Z. Costanzo M. Golde D.W. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

Juillard G.J.F. Stanley T.M. Hershman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this signaling pathway also is present in thyroid cells. The type of SMase activated upon stimulation is apparently crucial for the ultimate fate of the cells, as the SMase-evoked production of ceramide may lead to activation of apoptosis (via JNK-1), stimulate proliferation (via mitogen-activated protein kinase), or protection against cytotoxicity (15Testi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 19Barger S.W. Hörster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Of the reported effects of TNF-α on FRTL-5 cells, the inhibition of proliferation (20Chen G. Pekary A.E. Hershman J.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 863-870PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibition of type I 5′deodinase activity (11Mori K. Stone S. Braverman L.E. DeVito W.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of TSH-evoked production of hydrogen peroxidase (12Kimura T. Okajima F. Kikuchi T. Kuwabara A. Tomura H. Sho K. Kobayashi I. Kondo Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E638-E643Google Scholar) have also been induced by exogenous ceramide, suggesting that these events are the result of the TNF-α-evoked activation of a sphingomyelinase and the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide. Other sphingomyelin breakdown products, like sphingosine (SP) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), potently stimulate proliferation and mobilize sequestered calcium in several cell types (21Spiegel S. Milstein S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These effects of SP and SPP have also been observed in thyroid FRTL-5 cells (22Törnquist K. Ekokoski E. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Okajima F. Tomura H. Sho K. Kimura T. Sato K. Im D.-S. Akbar M. Kondo Y.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4049-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent reports also show that SP attenuated store-operated calcium entry (25Orlati S. Cavazzoni M. Rugolo M. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 26Mathes C. Fleig A. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25020-25030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Sphingosines and ceramides seem to have mostly opposite effects on cellular proliferation. As both SP and SPP mobilize sequestered calcium and stimulate calcium entry in FRTL-5 cells, two important events in the initiation of proliferation, we thought that it would be of interest to investigate whether ceramides could have any effect on the regulation of calcium fluxes in these cells. Our results showed that, in FRTL-5 cells, TNF-α, SMase, and ceramides potently attenuated calcium entry. Thus, one mechanism of action of TNF-α on thyroid cells is an inhibition of calcium entry.

Before an experiment, cells from one donor culture dish were harvested with a 0.2% trypsin solution and plated onto plastic 100- or 35-mm culture dishes. The cells were grown for 7–8 days before an experiment, with 2–3 changes of the culture medium. Fresh medium was always added 24 h prior to an experiment. In the current-clamp experiments, the cells were grown on round coverslips in 24-well culture dishes. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were harvested with HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS, in millimolar concentrations: NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.6; glucose, 10; CaCl2, 1.0; HEPES, 20; pH 7.2) lacking Ca2+ but containing 0.02% EDTA and 0.1% trypsin. After washing the cells three times by pelleting, the cells were incubated with 1 μm Fura 2-AM for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the loading period, the cells were washed twice with HBSS buffer and incubated for at least 10 min at room temperature and washed once again. Fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi F2000 fluorimeter. The excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm, and emission was measured at 510 nm. The signal was calibrated by addition of 1 mmCaCl2 and Triton X-100 to obtain maximal fluorescence. Chelating extracellular Ca2+ with 5 mm EGTA and the addition of Tris-base was used to elevate pH above 8.3 to obtain minimal fluorescence. [Ca2+]i was calculated as described by Gryenkiewicz et al. (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using a computer program designed for the fluorimeter with a K d value of 224 nm for Fura 2. Cells grown on 35-mm dishes were labeled withl-[3-3H]serine (5 μCi/ml) for 48 h in 6H medium. The plates were then washed twice with PBS (in millimolar concentrations; NaCl, 137; KCl, 2.7; Na2HPO4, 8, KH2PO4, 1.5; pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium in a water bath at 37 °C. Then TNF-α (final concentration 100 ng/ml) was added, and the plates were incubated for 3–30 min. In some experiments SMase (final concentration 100 milliunits/ml diluted in Ham's F-12) was added to the plates, and the plates were incubated for 30 min. After the incubation, the plates were rapidly washed with ice-cold PBS and then frozen. Lipids were extracted by two 20-min incubations in 2 ml of hexane:propanol (3:2, v/v) on a shaker at room temperature. For protein measurements, the proteins were hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 0.1 mNaOH and determined according to Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were pipetted to glass tubes and dried in a gentle stream of air. The dried lipids were dissolved in 70 μl of hexane:2-propanol. Sphingomyelin was determined by application of the lipid extract to plastic-backed TLC plates (Whatman). The lipids were separated using chloroform:methanol:concentrated acetic acid:water (50:30:8:3) (30Skipski V.P. Peterson R.F. Barclay M. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). After detection using iodine vapor, the appropriate bands were cut, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Ceramide and sphingosine were separated using high performance TLC plates (Merck), and the lipids were separated by two elutions using chloroform:methanol:2 n NH4OH (40:10:1) (31Sambasivarao K. McCluer R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1963; 4: 106-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were allowed to dry between the separate runs. The lipids were detected using iodine vapor, and the appropriate bands were scraped into scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was determined. Immediately before exposure of the cells, the 6H medium was removed from the wells and the treatment was started by adding 0H medium containing various concentrations of the substances. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity was measured by the method of Kikkawa et al. (32Kikkawa U. Minakuchi R. Takai Y. Nishizuka Y.

The experiments were terminated by removing the medium and washing the cells three times with an ice-cold Ca2+-free salt solution (in millimolar concentrations: NaCl, 145; KCl, 5.2; NaH2PO4, 1; glucose, 11.2; HEPES, 15; pH 7.4). The cells were scraped from the plates and homogenized by sonication (2 × 15 s) in an ice-cold lysis buffer (containing in millimolar concentrations: EDTA, 2; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1; Tris-HCl, 20; pH 7.5, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). Homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant served as the soluble fraction. The pellet was dispersed into the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the homogenate was incubated on ice for 60 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. This supernatant constituted the particulate PKC activity. The protein content in both subcellular fractions was measured according to Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 238-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). In the PKC assay, the final reaction mixture (100 μl) contained in millimolar concentrations the following: Tris-HCl, 35; pH 7.5; mm EGTA, 0.25; EDTA, 0.5; MgCl2, 6; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25; PKC-specific substrate peptide FKKSFKL-NH2, 34 nm (36Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); CaCl2, 1; and 0.1 mm [32P]ATP (100–200 cpm/pmol). The mixture also contained leupeptin (12.5 μg/ml), phosphatidylserine (PS, 40 μg/ml), and diacylglycerol (DAG, 8 μg/ml). PKC activity was calculated as the difference in the activity in the presence and absence of CaCl2, PS, and DAG. The activity in the absence of CaCl2, PS, and DAG was the same as that obtained when only PS and DAG were omitted. The reaction was started by adding protein (0.7–1.5 μg). The samples were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped by spotting 25 μl of each reaction mixture onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper (1.5 × 1.5 cm). The papers were washed three times in 75 mm phosphoric acid. After air-drying, the radioactivity measured was determined. The results are expressed as nanomoles of inorganic phosphate incorporated to substrate peptide/mg of protein/min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run using a minigel apparatus (Midget Electrophoresis Unit, Pharmacia, Sweden). Proteins (1 and 3 μg per well for soluble and particulate proteins, respectively) were loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and separated according to molecular weight. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to methylcellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated three times for 15 min at 45 °C in Tween/TBS (TTBS, containing in millimolar concentrations: NaCl, 500; Tris-base, 20; pH 7.5, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% fat-free dry milk and 15 min in TTBS. Then the membranes were incubated for 2 h with 1:4000–1:80,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-rat PKC antibodies that recognize α, β1, β2, γ, δ, ε, and τ subtypes of PKC (37Wetsel W. Khan W. Merchenthaler I. Rivera H. Halpern A. Phung H. Negro-Vilar A. Hannun Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp., UK). The localization of immunoreactive proteins was compared with those of prestained molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown on 60- or 100-mm plates as described above. The cells were harvested as above and were allowed to rest for 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS. After incubation with TNF-α for 1–30 min, the cells were centrifuged and extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer (containing in mm concentrations: NaCl, 100; Na3VO4, 2; EDTA, 2; Tris-base, 20 mm, pH 8.0; and 3% Nonidet P-40). A sample of the extract was mixed with an equal volume of boiling SDS buffer (glycerol, 20%; 2-mercaptoethanol, 10%; SDS, 4%; bromphenol blue, 0.02%; Tris-base, 0.125 mm, pH 6.8). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, in mm concentrations: NaCl, 500; Tris-base, 20, pH 7.5) to block the remaining binding sites. The blots were incubated with anti-active JNK antibody (1:5000) diluted in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C overnight. The blots were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:10 000) for 2 h at room temperature, and the proteins were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were plated onto 35-mm dishes and grown in 6H medium for 2–3 days. Then the cells were washed twice with PBS and grown in 0H (Coon's medium without hormones or serum) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2 days. The medium was then changed to 0H/bovine serum albumin containing the appropriate concentrations of the test compounds and [3H]thymidine (0.4 μCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for 24 h (38Valente W.A. Vitti P. Kohn L.D. Brandi M. Toccafondi R. Tramontano D. Azou S.M. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with cold PBS solution and once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was made using Student's t test for paired observations. When three or more means were tested, analysis of variance was used. Previous studies have shown that TNF-α and C2- and C6-ceramides potently inhibit both the TSH- and the insulin-evoked incorporation of [3H]thymidine in DNA, i.e. DNA synthesis (6Zakarija M. McKenzie J.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1260-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Patwardhan N.A. Lombardi A. Surgery. 1991; 110: 972-977PubMed Google Scholar, 8Pang X.-P. Yoshimura M.

We confirmed these results and further showed that SMase also inhibited the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in response to TSH and insulin (data not shown). The inactive ceramides dihydro-C2 and dihydro-C6 had only marginal effects (data not shown). In FRTL-5 cells, as well as in other cell types, changes in [Ca2+]i are probably important events in the initialization of cell proliferation (39Takada K. Amino N. Tada H. Miyai K. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1548-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Törnquist K. Ekokoski E. Dugué B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the effect of TNF-α on [Ca2+]i and on the entry of calcium in FRTL-5 cells. TNF-α (100 ng/ml, the highest dose tested) did not per se affect [Ca2+]i in these cells (data not shown). To avoid any possible effects of TNF-α on receptor-mediated events, we activated calcium entry by stimulating the cells with the Ca2+ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (Tg) (41Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drøbak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar). Tg activates a rapid store-operated calcium entry in FRTL-5 cells (42Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with TNF-α for 10–30 min potently attenuated the Tg-evoked calcium entry in both a calcium-containing buffer and in a calcium-free buffer in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). We also observed that TNF-α did not inhibit the Tg-evoked mobilization of sequestered calcium. In cells pretreated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 10 min, the Tg-evoked release of intracellular calcium was 178 ± 15 nm, compared with 155 ± 10 nm in control cells. These experiments were performed in a calcium-free buffer to avoid any interference of Tg-evoked calcium entry. To investigate whether the observed effect of TNF-α was due to activation of a sphingomyelinase, we preincubated the cells with the phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C inhibitor D609. Previous investigations have shown that D609 effectively inhibits TNF-α-evoked events (16Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). However, we observed that D609 was a very potent modulator of calcium entry in FRTL-5 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, D609 also mobilized sequestered calcium in our cells (data not shown). Thus, D609 is apparently not a suitable compound for studies using intact cells, as its effects on calcium fluxes probably will affect a multitude of cellular events. Activation of protein kinases, including PKC, is an important part of the signaling cascade evoked by TNF-α (15Testi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We preincubated the cells with 200 nm staurosporin for 10 min prior to addition of 100 ng/ml TNF-α. In these cells, we were unable to detect any TNF-α-evoked inhibition of calcium entry in cells stimulated with Tg (Fig. 2). We next investigated the effect of the PKC inhibitor calphostin C, and we treated the cells with 100 nm calphostin C for 10 min prior to addition of 100 ng/ml TNF-α. In these cells, the effect of TNF-α on the Tg-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i was abolished (Fig. 2). We have also shown earlier that stimulating FRTL-5 cells with the phorbol ester PMA attenuates store-operated calcium entry (42Törnquist K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, pretreatment with 200 nm PMA significantly decreased the plateau level of [Ca2+]i after readdition of calcium to cells stimulated with Tg in a calcium-free buffer (Fig. 2). Pretreatment of the cells with both PMA and 100 ng/ml TNF-α decreased both the transient increase in [Ca2+]i as well as the new plateau level of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2). In addition, in these cells the increase in the plateau level of [Ca2+]i was of lower magnitude than in cells treated with PMA only, suggesting an additive effect of PMA and TNF-α on calcium entry (Fig. 2). To investigate further whether the effect of TNF-α on calcium entry was mediated via activation of SMase, we preincubated the cells with different concentrations of exogenous SMase for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 3, SMase inhibited calcium entry in a concentration-dependent manner very similar to that of TNF-α. Furthermore, SMase did not affect the amount of sequestered calcium. In cells treated with SMase (1 units/ml) for 30 min, the increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by Tg in a calcium-free buffer was 130 ± 23 nm, compared with 155 ± 10 nm in control cells. In the next series of experiments, the cells were incubated with 200 nm staurosporin for 10 min prior to addition of SMase (1 units/ml for 30 min). In these experiments, pretreatment with staurosporin totally abolished the effect of SMAse (Fig.4), in a manner similar to what was observed in cells treated with both staurosporin and TNF-α. To investigate whether the effect of SMase was mediated via activation of PKC, we pretreated the cells with 100 nm calphostin C. In these experiments calphostin C also abolished the effect of SMase (Fig.4). However, in cells in which PKC was down-regulated by preincubating the cells with 2 μm PMA for 24 h, SMase (1 milliunit/ml for 30 min) still attenuated the Tg-evoked calcium entry (Fig. 4). To investigate whether the observed effect of SMase was due to inhibition o"

The goal of this study was to examine if expression of MTP, whose genetic deletion is responsible for the human recessive disorder abetalipoproteinemia, would recapitulate the lipoprotein assembly pathway in CHO cells. Unexpectedly, expression of MTP mRNA and protein in CHO cells did not allow apoB-containing lipoproteins to be assembled and secreted by CHO cells expressing apoB53. Although expression of MTP in cells allowed apoB to completely enter the endoplasmic reticulum, it was degraded by a proteolytic process that was inhibited by dithiothreitol (1 mm) and chloroquine (100 μm), but resistant toN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. In marked contrast, coexpression of the liver-specific gene product cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase with MTP resulted in levels of MTP lipid transfer activity that were similar to those in mouse liver and allowed intact apoB53 to be secreted as a lipoprotein particle. These data suggest that, although MTP-facilitated lipid transport is not required for apoB translocation, it is required for the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. We propose that, in CHO cells, MTP plays two roles in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins: 1) it acts as a chaperone that facilitates apoB53 translocation, and 2) its lipid transfer activity allows apoB-containing lipoproteins to be assembled and secreted. Our results suggest that the phenotype of the cell (e.g. expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase by the liver) may profoundly influence the metabolic relationships determining how apoB is processed into lipoproteins and/or degraded.

The recent demonstration that inactivation of a single allele of the MTP gene in mice causes significant impairment in the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins by the liver suggests that, in the mouse, MTP plays an essential role in one or more of the rate-limiting steps in the lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway (14Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).

These findings suggest that the role of MTP in regulating lipoprotein assembly/secretion may depend upon complex metabolic relationships that are defined by the genetic background of species and individuals. The third disorder (chylomicron retention disease) is unique in that it disables intestinal, but not hepatic, lipoprotein secretion (5Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989Google Scholar). Although the gene defect responsible for chylomicron retention disease remains unknown, its recessive mode of inheritance (5Kane J.P. Havel R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1989Google Scholar) suggests that its phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation. Based on what is known about the chylomicron retention disease phenotype, we have considered the possibility that hepatic and intestinal lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathways may have distinct requirements. This interpretation is contrary to studies indicating that apoB and MTP are the only tissue-specific gene products required for reconstituting the lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway in somatic cells. (In COS-1 cells (15Leiper J.M. Bayless J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Patel S.B. Grundy S.M.

We developed a somatic Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell model that reflects many of the characteristics that are thought to occur in the livers of abetalipoproteinemic patients. Like the livers of abetalipoproteinemics, CHO cells do not express MTP and display blocked translocation of apoB53 into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The incompletely translocated apoB53 is rapidly degraded by an ALLN-inhibitable process (18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that the expression of liver-specific 7α-hydroxylase (cholesterol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7α-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.13.17) profoundly influenced the processing of apoB53 by CHO cells (i.e. the ALLN-inhibitable ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of apoB was blocked in these cells (designated as JF7 cells) (19Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitzen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Additional studies showed that the translocation-arrested apoB wasN-linked and glycosylated (18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ALLN, proteolysis caused the N terminus to be released from the ER membrane, to resume translocation, and to become secreted as an 85-kDa N-terminal apoB peptide without a lipid core (i.e.density > 1.21 g/ml) (20Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identical truncated N-terminal apoB peptides are enriched ∼2000-fold in the plasma of abetalipoproteinemics, leading to the proposal that CHO cells express a phenotype similar to that of the livers of abetalipoproteinemics (21Du E.Z.

In this study, we examined how complementation of CHO cells with MTP with or without liver-specific gene 7α-hydroxylase affected the cellular processing of apoB. The results provide new insights into how phenotypic gene expression can influence MTP function and the apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly/secretion pathway.

B53 cells were cotransfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) that was constructed to contain a cDNA encoding hamster MTP (a gift from David Gordon) and a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance in a 12:1 ratio. Cells were selected for resistance to puromycin (500 μg/ml). Three independent clones were grown out and shown to express MTP mRNA and protein and to process apoB as described by the cells designated as B53+MTP cells. JF7 cells were cotransfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid encoding hamster MTP and a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance in a 12:1 ratio as described above. Cells were selected for resistance to puromycin (500 μg/ml). Three independent clones were grown out and shown to express MTP mRNA and protein and to process apoB as described by the cells designated as JF7+MTP cells. Cells were grown to 85% confluence and treated with ALLN (50 μg/ml) in Me2SO as described in the figure legends. An equivalent volume of Me2SO was added to untreated cells. The cells and medium were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm). Western blotting was performed as described (20Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibody 1D1, which recognizes an N-terminal apoB epitope (24Marcel Y.L. Innerarity T.L. Spilman C. Mahley R.W. Protter A.A. Milne R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 166-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 85% confluence on 150-mm dishes. mRNA was obtained and Northern-blotted as described (25Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cells were harvested as described above and suspended in homogenization buffer (0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 0.1 mm leupeptin.) The cells were transferred to a nitrogen decavitation minibomb chamber (Kontes), and the cells were cavitated by subjecting them to 500 p.s.i. for 20 min at 4 °C and then rapidly releasing the pressure at atmosphere. The disrupted cell homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm to remove unlysed cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman J2–20 centrifuge using a JA-20 rotor. The supernatant from this spin was aliquoted into fresh tubes and centrifuged for 2 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman TL-45 rotor. The supernatant was removed, and the microsomal pellet was used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cellular proteins were then solubilized in 1 ml of TETN buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 250 mm NaCl) containing the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm). Protein A-Sepharose beads were preincubated with unlabeled cell extract overnight at 4 °C. A rabbit antiserum specific for human apoB (5 μl) was then incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (dry volume) in 1 ml of TETN buffer overnight at 4 °C. The antibody-bound protein A-Sepharose conjugates were incubated at 4 °C with the labeled cellular protein samples. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold TETN buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 100 μl of sample buffer containing SDS and β-mercaptoethanol, and separated on a 1–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. B53, JF7, B53+MTP, and JF7+MTP cells were cultured to 80% confluence and then incubated with oleic acid conjugated to albumin (0.5 mm) and [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for 24 h. The medium was harvested in the presence of the following proteolytic inhibitors: aprotinin (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), and EDTA (0.1%). The medium was then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm to remove any cells. The medium samples were adjusted to a density of 1.065 g/ml with KBr and subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckman L8 centrifuge using an SW 40 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 48 h at 5 °C. The lipoprotein fractions were then obtained by tube slicing and desalted using Sepharose CL-4B beads. Fractions containing radioactivity were separated via SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The MTP lipid transfer assay was similar to the procedure established by Wetterau and Zilversmit (26Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (14Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were diluted to 1.75 mg/ml total cell protein, and deoxycholate was added to a final concentration of 0.05%. After a 30-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing the luminal contents (i.e. MTP), was pipetted off and dialyzed against sample buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Donor vesicles (40 nm egg phosphatidylcholine, 0.08 nm[14C]triolein (NEN Life Science Products), and 3.0 nm cardiolipin) and acceptor vesicles (240 nmegg phosphatidylcholine and 0.48 nm triolein) were prepared in sample buffer. Aliquots of the cell extracts were added to the vesicle preparation and assayed for triglyceride transfer activity at 37 °C in sample buffer as described (14Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S.

Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by adding DEAE-cellulose beads. After pelleting the DEAE-bound donor vesicles, triglyceride transfer was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity in the supernatant. Transfer activity was calculated as percentage triglyceride transferred per h and 100 μg of total cell protein assuming first-order kinetics (14Raabe M. Flynn L.M. Zlot C.H. Wong J.S. Veniant M.M.

Cells were harvested by scrapping them off the dish with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was used for extraction and protein assay. The culture medium was centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Cells and medium were extracted with chloroform/methanol and separated on silica gel TLC plates, and the silica gel containing the individual lipid classes was scraped into scintillation vials for radioactivity quantitation using β-scintillation counting (27Davis R.A. McNeal M.M. Moses R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2634-2640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are given as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was determined by Student's ttest. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be significant. Similar to previous results (18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence of the proteolytic inhibitor ALLN, CHO cells expressing apoB53 mRNA (B53 cells) contained little apoB53 (Fig. 1,lane 1). Adding ALLN caused intact apoB53 to accumulate in B53 cells (Fig. 1, lane 2). JF7 cells, which as a result of expressing 7α-hydroxylase have a block in the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of translocation-arrested apoB53 (19Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitzen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), showed levels of intact apoB53 (Fig. 1, lane 3) that were indistinguishable from those of B53 cells treated with ALLN (Fig. 1, lane 2). Similar to previous results (19Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitzen G.M. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), treating JF7 cells with ALLN did not increase the intracellular content of apoB53 (Fig. 1, lane 4). To investigate the effect of MTP on apoB processing in CHO cells, hamster MTP was expressed in B53 and JF7 cells. Unexpectedly, B53 cells stably expressing MTP (B53+MTP cells) showed no detectable level of intact apoB53 (Fig. 1, lane 5), suggesting that it was degraded. Furthermore, treating these cells with the proteolytic inhibitor ALLN did not cause intact apoB to accumulate (Fig. 1,lane 6). Stable expression of MTP in JF7 cells (JF7+MTP cells) did not affect the intracellular content of intact apoB53 either in the absence (Fig. 1, lane 7) or presence (lane 8) of ALLN. These results were found in three individual single clones of each type of stably expressing CHO cells (data not shown) and thus are not a unique characteristic of a single clone. Similar to previous results (18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), either in the absence (Fig.2, lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of ALLN, no intact apoB53 was secreted into the culture medium by B53 cells. Although there was a marked accumulation of intact apoB53 in JF7 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4), no detectable apoB53 was secreted into the culture medium by JF7 cells treated with and without ALLN (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). B53 cells expressing MTP (B53+MTP cells) also did not secrete intact apoB53 either in the absence (Fig. 2, lane 5) or presence (lane 6) of ALLN. However, JF7 cells expressing MTP (JF7+MTP cells) did secrete intact apoB53 (Fig. 2, lane 7). ALLN did not affect the amount of intact apoB53 secreted by these cells (Fig. 2,lane 8). Further analysis of the apoB53 secreted by JF7+MTP cells and incubated with oleic acid (1 mm) showed that it had a density <1.065 g/ml (Fig. 3). These data suggest that coexpression of 7α-hydroxylase and MTP allows CHO cells to assemble and secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins. In both groups of cells transfected with the MTP expression plasmid, the levels of both MTP mRNA (Fig.4 A) and protein (Fig.4 B) were similar. Thus, differences in the expression of MTP protein cannot account for the differences between B53+MTP and JF7+MTP cells in secreting apoB-containing lipoproteins. In CHO cells not transfected with the MTP expression plasmid, there were no detectable levels of MTP mRNA (Fig. 4 A) or protein (Fig.4 B). MTP-facilitated lipid transfer activity was essentially absent in extracts from B53, JF7, or B53+MTP cells (Fig.5). In marked contrast, fairly high levels of MTP-facilitated lipid transfer activity were present in extracts of JF7+MTP cells (Fig. 5). The level of MTP lipid transfer activity expressed by JF7+MTP cells was similar to the activity observed in primary cultured mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 5). These findings were obtained with four separate preparations of cell extracts from four individual plates of cells. Thus, there was a concordance in the ability of MTP to allow the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins and the enzymatic lipid transfer activity of cell extracts (compare results in Fig. 3 with the results in Fig. 5). To examine the possibility that, in B53+MTP cells, the lack of MTP-facilitated lipid transfer activity was due to the presence of an inhibitor, we performed mixing experiments (Fig. 5). Adding extracts of B53+MTP cells to extracts from JF7+MTP cells caused the same “dilution” of activity as adding buffer alone (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the inability of B53+MTP cells to display MTP-facilitated lipid transfer activity is not likely to be caused by the presence of an inhibitor that can readily associate with or dissociate from MTP in the assay buffer. It is now established that ALLN inhibits the degradation of translocation-arrested apoB by blocking ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation (19Du E.Z. Fleming J.F. Wang S.-L. Spitzen G.M.

ALLN also inhibits the degradation of apoB in the lumen of the ER by blocking ER-60 protease (32Adeli K. Macri J. Mohammadi A. Kito M. Urade R. Cavallo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22489-22494Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inability of ALLN to block the degradation of apoB53 in B53 cells expressing MTP (Fig. 1, lane 6) suggests that it is degraded in an intracellular compartment in which apoB degradation is not dependent upon ALLN-inhibitable proteases. There are at least two additional proteolytic processes that have been reported to degrade apoB and that are resistant to inhibition by ALLN: 1) a DTT-inhibitable process that degrades apoB, which is completely translocated into the ER lumen (33Wu X. Sakata N. Lele K.M. Zhou M. Jiang H. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11575-11580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); and 2) a chloroquine-inhibitable protease that resides in the lysosomal/endosomal compartment (34Wang C.N. Hobman T.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24924-24931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine if the apoB53 expressed by B53+MTP cells was degraded by either of these proteolytic process, these cells were labeled with [35S]methionine to detect intact apoB53 in the absence and presence of chloroquine (100 μm) and DTT (1 mm) for 4 h. Immunoprecipitation and autoradiography showed that there was an ∼8-fold increase in the amount of intact apoB53 in the whole cell extract of cells treated with DTT and an ∼20-fold increase in the amount of intact apoB53 in the whole cell extract of cells treated with chloroquine compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6 A). Ultracentrifugation of the whole cell extract followed by immunoprecipitation showed that most (>85%) of the intact apoB53 that accumulated in cells treated with chloroquine was in the 10,000 ×g pellet (Fig. 6 B). The amount of intact apoB53 that accumulated in the microsomal fraction (100,000 ×g pellet) was ∼5% of the amount in the 10,000 ×g pellet. No detectable intact apoB53 was found in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These data suggest that, in B53+MTP cells, a significant portion of apoB53 enters the ER lumen of the secretory pathway and is transported to an acidic compartment (i.e.lysosomes and en"

When yeast strain JPJ1, in which the gene for the iron-sulfur protein is deleted, was transformed with these constructs on a single copy expression vector, mitochondrial membranes andbc 1 complexes isolated from these strains accumulated intermediate length iron-sulfur proteins in vivo. The cytochrome bc 1 complex activities of these membranes and bc 1 complexes indicate that intermediate iron-sulfur protein (i-ISP) has full activity when compared with that of mature sized iron-sulfur protein (m-ISP). Therefore the iron-sulfur cluster must have been inserted before processing of i-ISP to m-ISP by MIP. When iron-sulfur protein is imported into mitochondria in vitro, i-ISP interacts with components of the bc 1 complex before it is processed to m-ISP. These results establish that the iron-sulfur cluster is inserted into the apoprotein before MIP cleaves off the second part of the presequence and that this second processing step takes place after i-ISP has been assembled into thebc 1 complex.

Trumpower B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Like the majority of mitochondrial proteins it is encoded by a nuclear gene, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and then targeted to the mitochondria by an amino-terminal presequence (2Neupert W.

A matrix processing peptidase (MPP)1 first removes a 22-amino acid peptide from the presequence of the precursor iron-sulfur protein (p-ISP) to form intermediate iron-sulfur protein (i-ISP). Because MPP is a matrix protein (7Bohni P.C. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Luciano P. Geli V.

A mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP) then removes an octapeptide from i-ISP to generate mature length iron-sulfur protein (m-ISP). It is not clear, however, whether this last processing step takes place before or after the protein is inserted into the bc 1 complex. It is also not known at what step during proteolytic processing the 2 Fe:2 S cluster is inserted into the apoprotein.

In the present study we employed yeast strains that express iron-sulfur proteins in which the recognition sites for MPP or MIP in the presequence have been destroyed by site-directed mutagenesis. Mitochondrial membranes isolated from these strains contain only minor amounts of mature length iron-sulfur protein, but their cytochrome c reductase activities are comparable with membranes from wild type yeast, indicating that the iron-sulfur cluster is inserted into the protein before MIP processes i-ISP to m-ISP. Immunoprecipitation of bc 1 complex after import of iron-sulfur protein into mitochondria in vitrodemonstrates that intermediate iron-sulfur protein is assembled into the bc 1 complex.

In vitrotranscription and translation using the TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system were performed according to supplier recommendations. Before use in the import experiment, polyribosomes were removed by centrifugation at 230,000 × g for 20 min. The in vitro import mixture contained 4–12% (v/v) translated iron-sulfur protein precursor in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and an additional 10–18% (v/v) of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The mixture also contained 154 mm sucrose, 49 mm KCl, 7 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 2.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 4 mm NADH, and 20–50 μg of mitochondrial protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml.

After import of the labeled iron-sulfur protein into mitochondria in vitro, the washed mitochondria from 0.2 ml of import mixture were solubilized with 3% SDS, 1% Triton X–100, or 0.8 mg of dodecyl maltoside/mg of protein in 100 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate. The SDS-dissociated sample was vigorously shaken at room temperature for 30 min, whereas the samples treated with Triton X-100 or dodecyl maltoside were shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently all the samples were diluted 10× with the above buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and in some experiments 10 mmEDTA and 4 mm o-phenanthroline were also included. For immunoprecipitation the samples were then incubated with the indicated antiserum for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min 100 μl of agarose bound protein G (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the supernatants, and the mixture was incubated with shaking for 1 h at room temperature. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed two times for 20 min at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 and two times in the same buffer without Triton X-100. The washed agarose-bound precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min.

Uribe S. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol.

Iron-sulfur protein and cytochromec 1 were detected by Western blotting (18Towbin H. Staehhelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44919) Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibodies to the iron-sulfur protein or cytochromec 1. The intensities of the signals were quantified using an Apple Color One Scanner and the NIH Image software. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities of mitochondrial membranes and purifiedbc 1 complexes were assayed in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 23 °C using 80 μm2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6n-decyl-1,4-benzoquinol as substrate and 50 μm cytochrome c. Reduction of cytochromec was monitored in an Aminco DW-2a™ spectrophotometer at 550 versus 539 nm in dual wavelength mode. Data were collected and analyzed using an Online Instrument Systems Inc. computer interface and software. Turnover numbers of thebc 1 complex in membranes and of the purified enzymes were calculated on the basis of the concentration of cytochromeb, which was determined from optical spectra of the dithionite reduced minus ferricyanide oxidized samples (19Ljungdahl P.O. Beckmann J.D. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3723-3731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each yeast strain membranes and purified enzymes from three individual isolations were assayed in triplicate. Activities are expressed as a percentage of the turnover number of membranes orbc 1 complex from yeast strain JN24, carrying wild type RIP1 on a low copy expression vector. The turnover numbers of the enzyme from JN24 ranged between 200 and 220 s−1, as reported previously for the enzyme from wild type strains (20Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using theCLONTECH Transformer Mutagenesis kit. The plasmid pGem3-RIP, carrying the RIP1 gene for the iron-sulfur protein, was used as the template for construction of pJN49. For construction of pJN38 and pJN63 the HindIII-PstI fragment of YEP351-RIP1, encoding iron-sulfur protein and the promoter region, was subcloned into pGem3, and the resulting vector was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenized fragments were then excised with HindIII and PstI and subcloned into the expression vector pFL39:RIP1, a CEN, TRP vector carrying the gene encoding iron-sulfur protein on a HindIII-SacI fragment. The construction of pFL39:RIP-S183C has been previously described (21Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In Neurospora crassaand S. cerevisiae, p-ISP is translocated into the matrix, where it is processed to i-ISP by MPP (4Fu W. Japa S. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16541-16547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hartl F.U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The remaining octapeptide is subsequently removed by MIP to generate m-ISP. However, it has not been established where this last processing step takes place. We previously reported that i-ISP can be found in isolatedbc 1 complex (11Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Graham L.A. Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Graham L.A. Brandt U. Sargent J.S. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that i-ISP is assembled into the bc 1 complex and that processing of i-ISP to m-ISP occurs in the bc 1complex. On the other hand, the results of other studies had suggested that only mature length iron-sulfur protein can be assembled into thebc 1 complex (5Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that i-ISP is assembled into thebc 1 complex we constructed yeast expression plasmids that generate iron-sulfur proteins in which the MPP or the MIP recognition sites have been destroyed. We have shown previously that changing Lys-20 and Arg-21 to glycines in the yeast iron-sulfur protein presequence results in complete inhibition of processing by MPP and accumulation of precursor iron-sulfur protein in vitro (Fig.1 and Refs. 23Nett J.H. Denke E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2212-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 24Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26713-26716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The MIP recognition site is defined by a large hydrophobic residue in position −8 and a small hydroxylated residue or glycine in position −5 from the final MIP cleavage site (25Branda S.S. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27366-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), equivalent to residues Ile-23 and Ser-26 in the yeast iron-sulfur protein presequence. To destroy this site we first changed Ile-23 to glycine. This mutation resulted in accumulation of i-ISP after import in vitro; however, a significant amount of m-ISP was still formed (results not shown). To further improve the inhibition of processing by MIP we then also changed Ser-26 into phenylalanine. As shown in Fig.2, this mutated iron-sulfur protein (pJN49) is processed at an extremely low rate by MIP, and only trace amounts of m-ISP are formed. To determine whether insertion of the iron-sulfur cluster is required before MIP can perform the final processing step, we also included an iron-sulfur protein in which Ser-183 had been changed to cysteine (pFL39:RIP-S183C). We previously showed that this mutation results in the loss of the iron-sulfur cluster but has no effect on the stability of the protein (21Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of these mutations on processing of the iron-sulfur protein presequence, we isolated mitochondrial membranes from yeast strains expressing wild type and mutated iron-sulfur proteins and performed Western blots on them. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the main species that is formed when the MIP site is blocked is i-ISP, as was expected. In this strain very little m-ISP is present in the mitochondrial membranes, and the ratio of i-ISP to m-ISP is the inverse of that in mitochondrial membranes from the wild type strain. In membranes from JN16, where the MPP site has been destroyed, alternative processing of the presequence occurs, such that several intermediates of different lengths can be detected. We determined two of the additional processing sites by NH2-terminal sequencing of the intermediates, indicated by arrows in Figs. 1 and 3 C. One cleavage occurs after Arg-5 in the presequence, and another one occurs after Met-15 with additional cleavage sites in between. The basic residues in the presequence are not part of the recognition motif for those cleavage sites, because changing each basic residue in the presequence individually did not alter the processing pattern compared with that in JN16 (results not shown). The iron-sulfur protein that possesses the S183C mutation is processed like the wild type protein, suggesting that insertion of the iron-sulfur cluster is not an obligatory prerequisite for processing (Fig. 3 A). However, the relative amount of m-ISP in the S183C form of the iron-sulfur protein is decreased in comparison to that from the wild type strain (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that processing from i-ISP to m-ISP is retarded if the cluster is not inserted. To determine whether the intermediate length forms of the iron-sulfur protein are assembled into the bc 1 complex, we isolated bc 1 complexes from the mutant and wild type strains and performed Western blots on them (Fig. 3 B). From the Western blots of the mitochondrial membranes in Fig.3 A and of the purified bc 1 complexes in Fig. 3 B, it is clear that basically all of the intermediate length species that are found in the membranes are assembled into the bc 1 complex. In a parallel experiment we stained an SDS-PAGE gel of thesebc 1 complexes with Coomassie blue (Fig.3 C). These findings confirm that i-ISP is assembled into thebc 1 complex. To test whether the intermediate length species in the bc 1 complexes of JN16 and JN20 contain iron-sulfur cluster, we determined the cytochrome c reductase activities of membranes andbc 1 complexes isolated from these strains. We also determined the relative amounts of i-ISP and m-ISP from the intensity of the bands on the Western blots. From the results in Fig. 4, it is clear that basically all of the i-ISP in the strain in which the MIP site is blocked (JN20) and at least a major portion of the intermediates in the strain in which MPP is blocked (JN16) are functionally active and therefore must contain the iron-sulfur cluster. The densitometry measurements (Fig. 4 A) indicate that m-ISP accounts only for about 5–15% of the total iron-sulfur protein when the MIP or MPP processing site is blocked, whereas mitochondrial membranes isolated from these strains exhibit bc 1 complex activity comparable with those from the wild type strain (Fig.4 B). These results show that i-ISP is assembled and functionally active in the bc 1 complex of S. cerevisiae. However, it is noteworthy that the bc 1 complex isolated from JN20, in which the MIP site is blocked, has only about 50% activity when compared with that from the wild type strain. A similar drop in turnover number in the isolatedbc 1 complex in comparison to the mitochondrial membranes is observed in the case of JN16. It therefore seems that activity is lost during purification of the complex in which i-ISP is not processed to m-ISP. To determine whether the intermediate length forms of the iron-sulfur protein also interact with other subunits of the bc 1 complexin vitro, we imported wild type iron-sulfur protein and iron-sulfur proteins in which the MIP or MPP recognition sites were destroyed into mitochondria in vitro. After import the membranes were extracted with different detergents, and the extracts were precipitated with antibodies against the iron-sulfur protein or antibodies that recognize the bc 1 complex but not the iron-sulfur protein. As shown in Fig.5 A, if membranes are extracted with either Triton X-100 or dodecyl maltoside, which do not denature the bc 1 complex, i-ISP is precipitated by the antibodies against the complex. If the membranes are extracted with SDS, which denatures the bc 1 complex, antibodies raised against the iron-sulfur protein precipitate the iron-sulfur protein, but antibodies raised against the bc 1complex do not. These results clearly show that i-ISP can also be assembled into the bc 1 complex in vitro. During the 16-h incubation for immunoprecipitation there appears to be some proteolytic processing of i-ISP and m-ISP (Fig. 5 A). When we included high concentrations of EDTA ando-phenanthroline during the overnight incubation step (but not during import), this processing was strongly inhibited (Fig.5 B). In the precipitations in Fig. 5 A the amounts of iron-sulfur protein precipitated by the antibodies to thebc 1 complex are comparable with that precipitated by antibodies to the iron-sulfur protein, provided that the membranes were extracted with nondenaturing detergents. Ifo-phenanthroline is included during the incubation and precipitation, the amounts of iron-sulfur protein precipitated by the antibodies to the bc 1 complex are significantly decreased, relative to what is precipitated by antibodies specific to the iron-sulfur protein (Fig. 5 B). This suggests thato-phenanthroline destabilizes the binding of iron-sulfur protein to the rest of the bc 1 complex, probably as a result of disruption of the iron-sulfur cluster as described by Boumans and co-workers (26Boumans H. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 27Boumans H. van Gaalen M.C. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16753-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have investigated the order of processing and assembly steps during import of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein into S. cerevisiae mitochondria. In N. crassa p-ISP is translocated into the matrix where the first part of the presequence is removed by MPP, and then i-ISP is retranslocated across the inner mitochondrial membrane and assembled into thebc 1 complex (22Hartl F.U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). At some point during this step the second part of the presequence is removed by MIP, and the iron-sulfur cluster is inserted. It had been controversial whether i-ISP was first incorporated into the bc 1complex and then cleaved (11Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Graham L.A. Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Graham L.A. Brandt U. Sargent J.S. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or whether only m-ISP could be assembled into the bc 1 complex (5Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isaya and co-workers (28Isaya G. Miklos D. Rollins R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5603-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed that approximately 40% of the total amount of MIP in the mitochondria fractionates with the mitochondrial membranes and that the majority of the i-ISP also fractionates with the mitochondrial membranes in a MIP-deficient strain. We therefore changed Ile-23 and Ser-26 in the presequence to glycine and phenylalanine, respectively, so that the in vitro processing of i-ISP to m-ISP was inhibited and i-ISP accumulated in mitochondrial membranesin vivo. Although the membranes only contained 5–15% of the amount of m-ISP of wild type membranes, they exhibited 100% cytochrome c reductase activity. This result clearly shows that not only is i-ISP assembled into the bc 1complex but also that it contains the iron-sulfur cluster. We cannot conclude from our results, however, whether the iron-sulfur cluster is inserted into i-ISP while it is still in the matrix or after it has been translocated to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The last step of the assembly process then seems to be the processing of i-ISP containing the 2 Fe:2 S cluster to m-ISP by MIP. In bovine mitochondria the cleaved presequence of the iron-sulfur protein is retained as a subunit in the bc 1complex (29Brandt U. Yu L. Yu C.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8387-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the bovinebc 1 complex, the amino terminus of m-ISP and the cleaved presequence are located on the matrix side of the complex (30Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar,31Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). It thus seems likely that the bovine iron-sulfur protein is processed after it is assembled into the complex (29Brandt U. Yu L. Yu C.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8387-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variation of this mechanism could be applicable to the S. cerevisiae iron-sulfur protein. No subunit analogous to the bovine iron-sulfur protein presequence has been identified so far in S. cerevisiae. However, in contrast to the bovine iron-sulfur protein, the S. cerevisiae presequence is processed in two steps. In unpublished experiments we have found that the 22-amino acid peptide that is removed by MPP is not present in thebc 1 complex or in mitochondrial membranes. However, the octapeptide that is cleaved from i-ISP by MIP may stay in the complex as a yet unidentified subunit. This might explain why mitochondrial membranes isolated from JN20, in which the blocked MIP site prevents formation of the octapeptide, exhibit 100%bc 1 complex activity, whereas isolatedbc 1 complex is only 50% active. The absence of the cleaved octapeptide might impair structural integrity in a manner that indirectly affects catalytic activity but does not cause loss of iron-sulfur protein from the complex. In the purified bc 1 complexes from the strains in which the MIP and MPP sites were blocked, we noticed reduced levels of subunit 10 (Fig. 3 C). The amount of subunit 10 was also decreased, but to a lesser extent, in the bc 1complex from the S183C mutant. In the crystal structure of the bovine enzyme, the homologous subunit interacts with the iron-sulfur protein and is peripherally located (30Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that subunit 10 is added after i-ISP is processed to m-ISP. To determine whether the iron-sulfur cluster must be inserted before i-ISP is processed to m-ISP, we included a mutant in which the iron-sulfur cluster is not properly inserted but the apoprotein is stably assembled into the complex (21Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The ratio of m-ISP to i-ISP in isolated bc 1 complex or mitochondrial membranes from the S183C mutant as judged by Coomassie blue staining is diminished compared with the ratio in the membranes from wild type yeast. Therefore we conclude that although the iron-sulfur cluster normally is inserted into i-ISP, the processing from i-ISP to m-ISP does not require cluster insertion, but either the processing is slowed in the absence of cluster insertion or m-ISP is less stable without the cluster. In previous experiments, Fu and Beattie (5Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) imported iron-sulfur protein into S. cerevisiae mitochondria in vitroand precipitated the radioactively labeled protein with antibodies specific to iron-sulfur protein or with antibodies that had been raised against bc 1 complex but did not recognize iron-sulfur protein. After in vitro import of iron-sulfur protein and extraction of the mitochondria with detergent, both antibodies precipitated m-ISP. When MIP processing of i-ISP to m-ISP was inhibited by addition of EDTA and o-phenanthroline, the antibodies against iron-sulfur protein precipitated i-ISP, whereas the antibodies raised against bc 1 complex did not. From this it was concluded that m-ISP but not i-ISP could be assembled into the bc 1 complex. We performed similar experiments, but instead of blocking the processing of the presequence with metal chelators we imported iron-sulfur proteins with modified presequences in which the MPP or MIP recognition sites had been destroyed. Our data show that i-ISP is assembled with other components of the bc 1complex in these mutant strains and that even in mitochondrial membrane extracts from wild type yeast a significant amount of i-ISP can be precipitated with antibodies against bc 1complex. Boumans and co-workers (26Boumans H. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 762-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 27Boumans H. van Gaalen M.C. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16753-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that o-phenanthroline binds to solubilized bc 1 complex and disrupts the iron-sulfur cluster. This can explain our finding that coimmunoprecipitation of iron-sulfur protein with thebc 1 complex in the presence ofo-phenanthroline is much less efficient, if aftero-phenanthroline has disrupted the iron-sulfur cluster the protein is less stably associated with the complex. In addition, we have shown previously that high concentrations of EDTA ando-phenanthroline not only block processing of the iron-sulfur protein but also inhibit import of the precursor protein into the mitochondrial matrix (24Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26713-26716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Either of theseo-phenanthroline effects might explain why Fu and Beattie (5Fu W. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16212-16218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were unable to detect i-ISP associated with thebc 1 complex after they inhibited MIP witho-phenanthroline. We thank Dr. Diana Beattie for the gift of antibodies against bc 1 complex. We also thank Dr. Chris Snyder for bc 1 complex isolated from yeast strain CHS14 and many helpful discussions."

(3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H.

Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) for the bovine enzyme. In bovine complex III, cytochrome b is largely membrane-intercalated, with heme b L near the cytoplasmic surface of the molecule and 21 Å away from hemeb H toward the matrix side. The iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster of ISP is 27 Å away from heme b L and 31 Å away from the c 1 heme (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). With the chicken and the bovine complex III, Zhang et al. (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) noted that in the presence of the inhibitor stigmatellin the FeS cluster of ISP was located closer to b L than in the native crystals and 31 Å away from the c 1 heme. They propose that the extramembranous domain of ISP can assume two conformations, a proximal conformation with the FeS cluster nearb L (or the QO site of the Q cycle) and a distal conformation with the FeS cluster ∼20 Å closer to thec 1 heme. In a more recent report, Kim et al. (12Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) agree with the results and conclusions of Zhang et al. (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) regarding the effect of stigmatellin on the conformation of ISP. They further indicate that 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazol, but not myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, and antimycin, also fixes the conformation of ISP nearb L. We have shown recently in energized submitochondrial particles (SMP) that reverse electron transfer from ISP/c 1 to cytochrome b is inhibited more by antimycin, which binds near b H, than by myxothiazol, which binds nearb L (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antimycin also inhibited reverse electron transfer from ISP/c 1 to b in Q-extracted SMP, which contained ≤0.06 mol Q/mol cytochromeb or c 1 (200-fold less than the unextracted SMP) and was incapable of oxidizing NADH or succinate by molecular oxygen (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have also shown that when SMP were treated with antimycin, KCN, and ascorbate plus TMPD to reduce the high potential centers of complex III, subsequent addition of NADH or succinate resulted in rapid and complete reduction ofb H, and only the reduction ofb L became slow and partial when ISP/c 1 were prereduced (14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These and other results reported in Refs. 13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol.

As pointed out by Zhang et al. (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), the possible movement of the extramembranous domain of ISP between b L andc 1 has important mechanistic implications, because in its proximal position the FeS cluster of ISP would be 31 Å away from the c 1 heme, a distance incompatible with rapid electron transfer. However, whether in the absence of stigmatellin or 5-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazol the extramembranous domain of ISP can move so close tob L is not known. Nor is it known whether in the uninhibited enzyme the redox states of cytochrome b, ISP andc 1 affect the movement of the extramembranous domain of ISP between its proposed proximal and distal positions. This paper examines features of the bis-heme cytochrome breduction in SMP in the absence and the presence of complex III inhibitors when it is reduced by the respiratory chain substrates, NADH and succinate, and when it is reduced by reverse electron transfer from ISP/c 1. The results confirm our previous data that Q is not an obligatory electron carrier between b and ISP and suggest that when ISP and c 1 are both reduced, reduced ISP inhibits the rapid and complete reduction ofb L by respiratory substrates. Antimycin A, EFA, and carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were obtained from Sigma. Myxothiazol was from Boehringer Mannheim. Stigmatellin, ascorbic acid, and TMPD were from Fluka. NADH was from CalBiochem. ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Potassium ferricyanide was from Fisher Chemicals. MOA-stilbene was a generous gift of Dr. G. von Jagow (Universitatsklinikum, Frankfurt, Germany). The sources of other chemicals were as indicated elsewhere (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol.

SMP were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of 1.5 mm ATP during sonication as described previously (16Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Extraction of Q from SMP and determination of the Q content of SMP and Q-extracted SMP were the same as previously reported (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of SMP with EFA and the activity measurements were done essentially as described before (18Yagi T. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, SMP at 10 mg/ml were incubated with 6.9 mm EFA at 0 °C for 30–40 min in a buffer containing 0.25 msucrose and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity of SMP after EFA treatment was 5–10% of that of the untreated SMP. To prevent the inactivation of succinate dehydrogenase by EFA, either 10 mm malonate or 15 mm fumarate was added during incubation of SMP with EFA (18Yagi T. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome b was monitored spectrophotometrically at 563 minus 575 nm in a buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. SMP concentration was 1.1–1.14 mg/ml. Results were essentially the same at 565 minus 575 nm. Reduction of cytochromes c/c 1 was monitored at 550 minus 540 nm. At this wavelength pair, contribution from the reduction of the b hemes was negligible. KCN, ascorbic acid (neutralized with NaOH), and TMPD were added at 10, 1.0, and 0.1 mm, respectively. Inhibitors of complex III were added from an ethanolic solution at the final concentrations indicated: antimycin A (2 μm), myxothiazol (4 μm), stigmatellin (4 μm), and MOA-stilbene (4 μm). Ethanol concentration never exceeded 1%. Absorbance changes and spectra were recorded using an SLM DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The data shown were collected and stored in a computer on line to the spectrophotometer. When the spectra of the cytochromes were recorded, addition of dithionite to SMP gave rise to a small increase in absorbance below 556 nm, which was not related to the absorbances of the cytochromes. Spectra recorded in the presence of dithionite were corrected for this absorbance increase. Assay temperature was 30 °C throughout. As stated above, the x-ray diffraction data of complex III crystals from three different groups (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) state that in their native complex III crystals the QObinding pocket is empty and that when these crystals were soaked with either Q-6 or Q-10 difference density maps had their highest peaks at the antimycin-binding site, i.e. nearb H. Moreover, Rich and co-workers (19Jünemann S. Heathcote P. Rich P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21603-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have concluded from their recent studies that there is no detectable ubisemiquinone at the QO site, thus making the proposed chemistry of bifurcated QH2 oxidation at the QOsite of the Q cycle hypothesis even more complicated. These recent data agree with our previous results (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as with those of Palmer and co-workers (20Degli Esposti M. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Lenaz G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Tsai A.-L. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8677-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Q is not an obligatory electron carrier between cytochrome b and ISP/c 1. In the Q cycle terminology, the complex III inhibitors binding near b H (e.g.antimycin, funiculosin, and 2-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide) are referred to as Qi site inhibitors, and those binding nearb L (e.g. myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, mucidin, and stigmatellin) as QO site inhibitors. However, in view of the absence of evidence for a Q binding site nearb L and ISP, we shall refer, as before (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), to these two sets of inhibitors, respectively, as inside or N-side inhibitors, and outside or P-side inhibitors. As mentioned above, we have shown that addition of NADH or succinate to SMP pretreated with antimycin, KCN, and ascorbate (± TMPD) results in the rapid and complete reduction of b H. Only the reduction of b L became slow and incomplete under these conditions (14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results do not agree with the Q cycle hypothesis, which requires that blocking of the Qi site by antimycin and prereduction of ISP/c 1 by ascorbate should inhibit the reduction of bothb H and b L by NADH or succinate. Treatment of SMP with myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, or stigmatellin in the presence or the absence of KCN and ascorbate (± TMPD) resulted in a similar pattern of substrate reduction ofb H and b L (14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hemeb H was rapidly reduced, whereasb L was only partially reduced. Furthermore, when SMP were pretreated with myxothiazol, KCN, and ascorbate and then succinate was added to reduce cytochrome b, subsequent addition of K3Fe (CN)6 to oxidize ISP/c 1 also resulted in the rapid oxidation of the partially reduced b L, butb H remained in rapid electronic communication with the reduced Q pool and could not be oxidized by ferricyanide (14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows an example of the partial reduction of cytochrome b when NADH was added to SMP treated with MOA-stilbene. However, as seen in Fig. 1 B, no complex III inhibitor is needed to obtain a partial breduction. In this experiment, the SMP were treated only with KCN, and no complex III inhibitor was added, but the pattern of bheme reduction upon addition of NADH was essentially the same as in Fig. 1 A and the experiments described above. Cytochromeb reduction was partial (Fig. 1 B), and what was not reduced was a portion of b L (Fig.1 C). In this experiment, the partial reduction ofb L is referable to the fact that addition of NADH results first in the reduction of the high potential electron carriers on the oxygen side of cytochrome b, and this condition inhibits the complete reduction of b L. Thus, there are essentially two conditions in SMP that inhibit the complete reduction of b L by NADH or succinate: (i) prereduction of ISP/c 1 and (ii) presence of a P-side complex III inhibitor. Neither condition inhibits the rapid and complete reduction of b H. As stated above, prereduction of ISP/c 1 in the presence of an N-side inhibitor (e.g. antimycin) results in a very slow and partial reduction of b L by NADH or succinate (14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This also applies to prereduction of ISP/c 1 in the presence of a P-side inhibitor, in the sense that the partial reduction of b L by NADH or succinate also becomes slower. However, the fact that bothb hemes are rapidly and completely reduced by either succinate or NADH in antimycin-treated SMP (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicates that the partial reduction of b L under conditions (i) and (ii) is not an inherent feature of the system. Nor can we relegate the complete reduction of b L in the presence of antimycin and its incomplete reduction in the presence of a P-side inhibitor, respectively, to favorable and unfavorable Emchanges effected by these inhibitors. According to Howell and Robertson (7Howell N. Robertson D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), antimycin lowers the Em of b Lby 20 mV, myxothiazol raises it by 10–30 mV, and stigmatellin causes no detectable change. The reason for the incomplete reduction ofb L under conditions (i) and (ii) must therefore rest in the changes effected on complex III by the P-side inhibitors or by reduced ISP/c 1. In SMP, cytochrome b can be reduced by reverse electron transfer via reduced ISP/c 1 when the particles are treated with KCN and ascorbate plus TMPD (Fig.2 A). The reduction of cytochrome b is slow and partial, in keeping with the thermodynamically uphill nature of the process, and the electrons accumulate in the higher potential heme b H. As was shown previously, this reaction is strongly inhibited by antimycin and unaffected when the Q content of SMP was reduced 200-fold by extraction to ≤0.06 mol Q/mol cytochrome b orc 1 (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The rate of reverse electron transfer to b is also inhibited by myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene (81% inhibition, Fig. 2 B) but to a much smaller extent than by antimycin (94% inhibition, Fig.2 C). 3The greater inhibition by antimycin ofb H reduction by reverse electron transfer may be in part because antimycin lowers the Em ofb H by 20–40 mV (7Howell N. Robertson D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We had shown earlier that in SMP complex III is inhibited by incubation of the particles with EFA and that the inhibition is completely reversed by subsequent treatment of SMP with hydroxylamine, indicating that EFA ethoxyformylates the imidazole nitrogen(s) of one or more essential histidyl residues (18Yagi T. Vik S.B. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4777-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The inhibition appeared to block electron transfer between b and c 1, and subsequent studies with complex III and isolated ISP showed that EFA modifies ISP and alters its EPR spectrum (22Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. von Jagow G. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Stigmatellin also alters the EPR line shape of ISP in complex III. However, pretreatment of complex III with EFA completely prevented the effect of stigmatellin on the EPR signal of ISP, and pretreatment with stigmatellin largely prevented the effect of EFA, suggesting overlapping sites of ISP modification by the two inhibitors (22Ohnishi T. Meinhardt S.W. von Jagow G. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 D, treatment of SMP with EFA inhibits (by ∼70%) the initial rate of electron transfer from ascorbate/TMPD to b, further confirming that this reaction involves ISP as an intermediate electron carrier. As pointed out elsewhere (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the stronger inhibition by antimycin than by myxothiazol (and MOA-stilbene, Fig. 2 B) of reverse electron transfer from ISP/c 1 tob does not agree with the Q cycle scheme. This is because in order for this reaction to be antimycin-sensitive in the Q cycle, the electrons from ISP would have to go to Q at the QO site. Then the reduced Q would have to become protonated from the P-side, move to the Qi site, reduce b H via the antimycin inhibition site, and deposit protons to the N-side. Clearly, this reverse proton translocation from the P-side to the N-side cannot take place in an unenergized system, and we have shown that the reverse electron transfer reactions shown in Fig. 2 and elsewhere (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) are unaffected in the presence of the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Recent x-ray crystallographic data of complex III have shown that, unlike myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene, stigmatellin fixes the extramembranous domain of ISP near b L (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 12Kim H. Xia D. Yu C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Also in our reverse electron transfer experiments, stigmatellin showed a different effect than myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene. As seen in Fig.3 A, treatment of SMP with stigmatellin slowed down the rate of b reduction by reverse electron transfer but considerably increased its extent (compare with Fig. 2 A). As in the case of Fig. 2, the reduced bin the presence of stigmatellin was also b H (see below). It has been reported by Ohnishi, von Jagow, and co-workers (23von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,24Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that stigmatellin raises the Em of ISP in cytochrome reductase preparations by 250 mV. Because in our reverse electron transfer experiments, the extent of b reduction was much greater in the presence than in the absence of stigmatellin, we were concerned that stigmatellin may be promoting b reduction by a mechanism not involving ISP and an antimycin-sensitive pathway. However, as seen in Fig. 3 (B and C),b reduction by reverse electron transfer was inhibited when EFA- or antimycin-treated SMP were subsequently treated with stigmatellin, KCN, ascorbate, and TMPD. These results suggest that in the presence of stigmatellin the path of electrons from ISP/c 1 to b remains unaltered. Therefore, the greater extent of b reduction in the presence of stigmatellin must somehow be a consequence of the increased proximity of the FeS cluster of ISP to b L, even though the reported 250 mV increased Em of ISP in the presence of stigmatellin is difficult to reconcile with the results. It should be pointed out, however, that these Em measurements were made in detergent-treated and fractionated preparations (23von Jagow G. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Ohnishi T. Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whether the Em of ISP in intact SMP treated with stigmatellin is the same or different remains to be determined. As seen in Fig. 4 A, whenb was reduced by addition to SMP of KCN, ascorbate, and TMPD, subsequent addition of antimycin resulted in partial reoxidation of the reduced b. The extent of reoxidation upon antimycin addition was greater when EFA-treated SMP was used (Fig.4 B), suggesting a balance between the rates of breduction by reverse electron transfer and its reoxidation as a consequence of antimycin addition. Fig. 4 C shows that theb heme (b H, see Fig. 4 E) reduced by reverse electron transfer in the presence of stigmatellin was also reoxidized upon addition of antimycin. These results suggested that the recipient of electrons from b H is ubiquinone. Antimycin would inhibit electron flow from ISP/c 1 to b H (viab L; Fig.5 A) and also would lower the Em of b H by 20–40 mV (7Howell N. Robertson D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11162-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), resulting in the oxidation of b H by Q. This conclusion proved correct, because when the experiment of Fig. 4 C was repeated with Q-extracted SMP, the reduction ofb H via ISP/c 1 was unaltered, but subsequent addition of antimycin caused only a small degree of reoxidation (Fig. 4 D). In Fig. 4 E, trace 1 shows the absorption peaks of the hemes reduced (b H heme, λmax at 562 nm;c + c 1 hemes, λmax at 553 nm) in the experiment of Fig. 4 C after addition to SMP of KCN, stigmatellin, ascorbate, and TMPD, and trace 2 shows the absorption of the heme (b H, λmaxat 562 nm) oxidized after addition of antimycin where indicated to the SMP of trace 1. The experiments of Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 were repeated with ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate instead of TMPD, and the results were essentially the same. Davidson et al. (25Davidson E. Ohnishi T. Tokito M. Daldal F.

C, depiction of the paths of inhibition (wavy lines) by N-side (N) and P-side (P) inhibitors (see Ref. 13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The scheme also shows the suggestion that the combination of the two inhibitors (N+P) alters the conformation of cytochrome b and the binding site of Q/QH2 (wavy cytochrome bborder), thereby inhibiting the off rate of ubiquinone. Large, hollow N and P refer, respectively, to the negative (matrix) and positive (cytosolic) sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data of Fig. 4 (C and D) confirm our previous results and conclusions that Q is not an obligatory electron carrier between cytochrome b and ISP (13Matsuno-Yagi A.

The fact that the x-ray crystallographic data of complex III from three different groups (2Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xian J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

Another interesting point is suggested by the results of Fig. 4. It is well known that a combination of an N-side and a P-side inhibitor strongly inhibits the reduction of cytochrome b by NADH or succinate. However, as seen in Fig.4 C, the combination of stigmatellin and antimycin did not inhibit the rapid reoxidation of b. On the basis of our finding that the stoichiometric inhibitors antimycin, myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, and stigmatellin appear each to inhibit three redox reactions of the bis-heme cytochrome b (Fig. 5 C), we proposed that these inhibitors act by causing conformational changes in cytochrome b (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), a suggestion that agreed with the results of others (26Rieske J.S. Baum H. Stoner C.D. Lipton S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4854-4866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27McCurley J.P. Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We now suggest further that the conformation changes effected by the combination of an N-side and a P-side inhibitor retards the off-rate of Q bound to cytochromeb. In such a case, the reduction of b by NADH or succinate in SMP treated with, for example, antimycin and myxothiazol (or stigmatellin) would be inhibited, because the oxidized Q bound tob would not come off rapidly to be replaced by reduced Q. However, in the experiment of Fig. 4 C, there would be sufficient oxidized Q bound to b to reoxidize the partially reduced b H. As regards the inhibition of b L reduction when ISP/c 1 are prereduced (Fig. 1 B and Ref. 14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the following considerations may be of interest. As stated above, Zhang et al. (3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) have suggested that the extramembranous domain of ISP moves during electron transfer between its proximal position near b L and its distal position near c 1. These electron transfer steps may be graphically illustrated as follows, with the asterisked electron carriers indicating reduced species and the length of the lines between them indicating proximity: [b L* – ISP —c 1] → [b L – ISP* —c 1, ⇆ b L — ISP* –c 1] → [b L — ISP – c1*]. In other words, oxidized ISP would move near reducedb L, and reduced ISP would move near oxidizedc 1. However, by prereduction of ISP/c 1 with ascorbate or as in the experiment of Fig. 1 B where the oxidation of reduced ISP andc 1 was prevented by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase with KCN, we create a situation that does not exist under normal electron transfer conditions. We propose that when both ISP andc 1 are reduced, the reduced ISP is repulsed from the proximity of reduced c 1 to reside near oxidized b L, i.e.[b L – ISP* — c 1*], and that the proximity of reduced ISP to b Linhibits the rapid and complete reduction of this heme. It is also possible that the P-side inhibitors binding nearb L exert a similar effect on its reducibility. Our new results and conclusions agree with the tentative electron transfer scheme published earlier (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, this scheme has been expanded to incorporate (i) the conclusion of Zhang et al. (Ref. 3Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 12Kim H.
