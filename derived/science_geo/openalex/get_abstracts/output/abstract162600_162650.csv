https://openalex.org/W2148185586,"During the next 50 years, which is likely to be the final period of rapid agricultural expansion, demand for food by a wealthier and 50% larger global population will be a major driver of global environmental change. Should past dependences of the global environmental impacts of agriculture on human population and consumption continue, 10 9 hectares of natural ecosystems would be converted to agriculture by 2050. This would be accompanied by 2.4- to 2.7-fold increases in nitrogen- and phosphorus-driven eutrophication of terrestrial, freshwater, and near-shore marine ecosystems, and comparable increases in pesticide use. This eutrophication and habitat destruction would cause unprecedented ecosystem simplification, loss of ecosystem services, and species extinctions. Significant scientific advances and regulatory, technological, and policy changes are needed to control the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion."

We tested the specificity of neurons in the lateral belt with species-specific communication calls presented at different azimuth positions. We found that neurons in the anterior belt are more selective for the type of call, whereas neurons in the caudal belt consistently show the greatest spatial selectivity. These results suggest that cortical processing of auditory spatial and pattern information is performed in specialized streams rather than one homogeneously distributed system."

This led to the isolation of the cellulase activator ace2encoding for a protein belonging to the class of zinc binuclear cluster proteins found exclusively in fungi. The DNA-binding domain of ACEII was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and ACEII was shown to bindin vitro to the 5′-GGCTAATAA site present in thecbh1 promoter. This site also contains the proposed binding sequence of the xylanase activator XlnR of Aspergillus niger. Mutation of the GGC triplet abolished ACEII binding. The function of ACEII was studied by analyzing the effects oface2 deletion in the hypercellulolytic T. reesei strain ALKO2221. Deletion of the ace2 gene led to lowered induction kinetics of mRNAs encoding the major cellulases cellobiohydrolases I and II and endoglucanases I and II and to 30–70% reduced cellulase activity when the fungus was grown on medium containing Solka floc cellulose. The expression level of the gene encoding xylanase was also affected. ace2 deletion led to lowered xyn2 expression in cellulose-induced cultivation.

They can be degraded and used as an energy source by numerous microorganisms that produce extracellular enzymes capable of hydrolysis of the polymeric substrates to monomeric sugars, such as to glucose in the case of cellulose. Yet filamentous fungi play a special role because many yeasts, such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae, lack the ability to hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose. The cellulolytic system of the soft rot fungus Trichoderma reesei is one of the best characterized among microorganisms. Mutant strains have been reported to produce over 35 g/liter extracellular protein (1Durand H. Clanet H. Tiraby G. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1988; 10: 341-346Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and nearly all of the secreted protein consists of cellulases and hemicellulases. Of these cellobiohydrolase I encoded by a single gene forms the major part (2Gritzali M. Brown R.D.J. Adv. Chem. Ser. 1979; 181: 237-260Crossref Google Scholar). The synergistic activities of cellobiohydrolases (CBHs),1 endoglucanases (EGs), and β-glucosidases are necessary for the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose. The hemicellulolytic system of Trichoderma consists of a more complex set of enzymes among which are the two endo-β-xylanases, the β-mannanase, and the side chain cleaving enzymes. The production of the main cellulases in Trichoderma is regulated at the transcriptional level depending on the carbon source available (3Kubicek C.P. Penttilä M. Harman G.E. Kubicek C.P. Regulation of Production of Plant Polysaccharide Degrading Enzymes by Trichoderma.in: Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1998Google Scholar), the genes being repressed tightly by glucose and induced up to several thousand fold by cellulose or the disaccharide sophorose (4Ilmén M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.L. Penttilä M.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mandels M. Parrish F.W. Reese E.T. J.

Carbon catabolite repression of cellulase genes has been extensively studied, and the repressor gene cre1 ofTrichoderma has been shown to mediate glucose repression of cellulase expression (7Ilmén M. Thrane C. Penttilä M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the various conditions studied expression of the main cellulase genes, cbh1, cbh2,egl1, and egl2, has been shown to be coordinate, and expression of the cbh1 gene encoding cellobiohydrolase I has been shown to be always the strongest (4Ilmén M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.L. Penttilä M.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of relative expression levels of various hemicellulase genes on different carbon sources and inducing compounds indicate that several regulatory mechanisms operate, some of which may be shared by genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases (8Margolles-Clark M. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 167-179Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the molecular mechanism involved in the strong activation of the cellulase genes or various hemicellulase genes. To isolate cellulase regulators we have developed a novel yeast-based method to isolate transcriptional activators by selecting simultaneously for their promoter binding and activation properties. This led to the discovery of the transcriptional regulator,ace1 (9Saloheimo A. Aro N. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5817-5825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this article we describe the cloning and functional studies of another cellulase regulator, ACEII, obtained in a similar screening. We show that this novel transcription factor binds to the cbh1 promoter and provide evidence thatace2 has a role in the induction of the major cellulase and xylanase genes of Trichoderma. Escherichia colistrain DH5α was used for plasmid construction, and strain BL21(DE3)LysS was used as a host for production of GST fusion proteins.S. cerevisiae strain DBY746 (ATCC44773, α,his3-1, leu2-3, leu2-112,ura3-52, trp1-289, cyh r,cir +) (D. Bothstein, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) was used as a host for the screening of activators. The deletion of ace2 was made in a low protease mutant strain ALKO2221 2A. Mäntylä, unpublished data. originating from the hypercellulolytic strain VTT-D-79125 (10Bailey M.J. Nevalainen K.M.H. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1981; 3: 153-157Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Synthetic selection media lacking the appropriate nutrients were used for the plasmid-carrying yeast strains (11Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.in: Academic Press, London1991Google Scholar). TheTrichoderma strains were grown in minimal medium described by Ilmén et al. (4Ilmén M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.L. Penttilä M.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with either 2% glycerol or 1% Solka floc cellulose (James River Corp.) as the carbon source. In the 6-day-long Solka floc cellulose cultivation, 0.2% proteose peptone was also added. 1 mm α-sophorose (Serva) was added to the glycerol medium to induce cellulase expression. ace2 was isolated from a T. reeseicDNA library expressed in S. cerevisiae as described by Saloheimo et al. (9Saloheimo A. Aro N. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5817-5825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To isolate the chromosomalace2 gene the genomic λ library of T. reeseiQM9414 (12Vanhanen S. Penttilä M. Lehtovaara P. Knowles J. Curr. Genet. 1989; 15: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was screened with the ace2 cDNA from pAS26. The chromosomal ace2 gene was subcloned as a 6.5-kbHindIII-EcoRI fragment into pZErO-1 vector (Invitrogen). This plasmid, pAS33, contained 0.6 and 4.9 kb, respectively, of the ace2 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. To construct the GST-ACEII fusion expression vector, a DNA fragment encompassing the ACEII DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–58) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in frame with the GST gene in the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to obtain pARO17. Production of GST-ACEII1–58 inE. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pARO17 and purification by glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed according to the supplier's manual. Short double-stranded DNA for binding assays was made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides designed to produce a 3′ recessed end that was then filled in with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Fragments longer than 100 bp were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using sequence specific primers, gel-purified, and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Binding assays were performed at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mmKCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mm spermidine, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 2.5 μm ZnCl2 with 0.5–1 μg of the GST-ACEII1–58 fusion protein and 1 ng (about 20,000 cpm) of the labeled double-stranded DNA. In competition experiments unlabeled DNA was added to the reaction in 20–200-fold excess over the labeled DNA fragment. Electrophoresis was performed as described by Saloheimo et al. (9Saloheimo A. Aro N. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5817-5825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the ace2 deletion cassette was constructed as follows. The hygromycin resistance cassette was cloned from pRLMEX30 (13Mach R.L. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as a XhoI-HindIII fragment into the XhoI-HindIII cut pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to create pARO21. An Asp718-SalI fragment from pAS33 containing 2.2 kb of the 3′-flanking sequence oface2 was cloned into the Asp718-XhoI sites of pARO21. Then the NruI fragment containing 1.6 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of ace2 gene was cloned directly from a λ clone containing chromosomal ace2 into theSmaI site of pARO21, which already contained the 3′-flanking sequences of ace2, to obtain pAS40. The deletion cassette was released from pAS40 by an Asp718-BamHI digestion, and 5 μg was used for transformation of the ALKO2221 strain according to Penttilä et al. (14Penttilä M. Nevalainen H. Rättö M. Salminen E. Knowles J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 61: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) except that the transformants were selected on plates containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Fungal DNA was isolated from transformants by the Easy-DNA kit according to the manufacturer's protocol number 3 (Invitrogen) and subjected to Southern analysis to verify the replacement of theace2 gene in the genome and the presence of no other copies of the deletion cassette. For the 6-day cultivation on Solka floc cellulose 50 ml of growth medium in two parallel shake flasks of ace2 deletants and three of the host strain ALKO2221 were inoculated with 107 spores. The cultures were carried out in 250-ml flasks with shaking at 200 rpm at 28 °C. Culture medium samples were collected for enzyme activity measurements from each flask. For RNA isolation mycelia were combined from the two parallel shake flasks of the ace2 deletants. Mycelia from the host cultures were treated separately. In the experiment designed to study induction kinetics of cellulases,ace2 deletants and ALKO2221 were each cultivated in three parallel 2-liter shake flasks on 400 ml of glycerol medium for 72 h, after which mycelia of each strain were combined, and an equal amount was transferred into two shake flasks containing Solka floc cellulose medium and one shake flask containing glycerol medium (control). Samples of mycelium were collected for RNA isolation 9, 12, 15, 18, and 32 h after transfer. For sophorose induction studies strains were grown on glycerol medium for 72 h after which 1 mm sophorose was added, and mycelial samples were collected 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after the sophorose addition. Total RNA was isolated with the Trizol reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The probes for Northern analyses were the entire cDNAs of cbh1, cbh2 (15Penttilä M.E. Andre L. Lehtovaara P. Bailey M. Teeri T.T. Knowles J.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 63: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar),egl1 (16Penttilä M.E. Andre L. Saloheimo M. Lehtovaara P. Knowles J.K. Yeast. 1987; 3: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and egl2 (previously calledegl3) (17Saloheimo M. Lehtovaara P. Penttilä M. Teeri T.T. Ståhlberg J. Johansson G. Pettersson G. Claeyssens M. Tomme P. Knowles J.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 63: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) released from vector sequences. The probes for the β-xylanases xyn1 and xyn2 (18Törrönen A. Mach R.L. Messner R. Gonzalez R. Kalkkinen N. Harkki A. Kubicek C.P.

Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 167-179Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with the actin fragment and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding (gpd1) cDNA fragment as internal RNA loading controls. The probes were labeled using the random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amounts of the hybridized mRNAs were quantified by densitometric scanning using ImageQuant software of Phosphoimager SI (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized for the total amount of mRNA by using the amount of gpd1 and actin mRNA as a loading control for each filter. CBHI and EGI activity in the culture supernatants were measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-lactoside (MUL) (Sigma) as a substrate according to van Tilbeurgh et al. (20van Tilbeurgh H. Claeyssens M. de Bruyne C.K. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 152-156Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using 0.17 mm MUL and 10 min of incubation time at pH 5.0 and 50 °C. The endoglucanase activity in the culture supernatant was measured as liberation of reducing sugars using 1% hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) (Fluka) as a substrate in 10 min of incubation time at 50 °C and pH 4.8. Total protein amount was measured according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from proteins precipitated from the culture medium with 20% trichloroacetic acid. The amino acid similarities of ACEII with other proteins were calculated, and the multiple alignment of Fig.2 was generated with the Clustal W program (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56001) Google Scholar) with a gap opening penalty of 10.0 and a gap extension penalty of 0.2. The similarity searches of data bases were done using the BLAST program with an existence gap penalty of 11 and an extension gap penalty of 1. All procedures not described above were carried out using standard methods. To isolate the transcriptional activators of cellulase genes, the 1.15-kb-long promoter of the T. reesei cbh1 gene was fused to theS. cerevisiae HIS3 gene to provide a reporter construct, pAS3, in which the HIS3 gene is not expressed without activation from the cbh1 promoter (9Saloheimo A. Aro N. Ilmén M. Penttilä M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5817-5825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). ATrichoderma cDNA expression library present on a multicopy vector was transformed to a his3 mutant yeast containing the reporter construct pAS3, and the transformants were selected on plates containing no histidine. One of the growing colonies contained a cDNA library plasmid named pAS26. pAS26 supported growth only when the reporter construct was also present in the cell, indicating activation of HIS3 expression through binding to the cbh1 promoter (Fig.1). The cDNA in plasmid pAS26 contains an open reading frame coding for a protein of 341 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 38 kDa. This new gene was named ace2 for activator of cellulase expression (GenBankTMaccession number AF220671). The N-terminal part of the deduced ACEII protein has a typical zinc binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain of the fungal type (Zn(II)2Cys6), first characterized in S. cerevisiae (23Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows an alignment of the ACEII zinc binuclear cluster domain with the corresponding domains of 12 other proteins showing the highest similarity with the ACEII DNA-binding domain and that of XlnR, a factor regulating xylanase expression in Aspergillus nidulans. The DNA-binding domain of ACEII is most similar (70%) to the DNA-binding domains found in ACU-15 (SWISS-PROT entry P87000), a positive regulator of acetate induction of Neurospora crassa, and in theA. nidulans FacB (70%), the major regulatory protein involved in acetamide and acetate utilization (24Todd R.B. Murphy R.L. Martin H.M. Sharp J.A. Davis M.A. Katz M.E. Hynes M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Aside from the zinc binuclear cluster domain, no significant similarities with known proteins or sequences contained in the expressed sequence tag data bases were found by the BLAST program. The overall similarity of ACU-15 and FacB with ACEII is low (25 and 23%, respectively). However, the DNA-binding domain of ACEII is followed by a histidine-rich area (amino acids 53–66) in which a His-Xaa sequence is repeated seven times. A similar histidine repeat of unknown function is found in the Zn(II)2Cys6-type aflatoxin regulatory protein AflR of two Aspergillus species (25Woloshuk C.P. Foutz K.R. Brewer J.F. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Payne G.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2408-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chang P.K. Ehrlich K.C., Yu, J. Bhatnagar D. Cleveland T.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a glutamine-rich region (82QQQEQQQGQPQHPPPPVQ99) resembling the glutamine-rich activation domains of other transcription factors,e.g. the human transcription factor Sp1 (27Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), is present in ACEII. Because thecbh1 promoter used in the initial screening was about 1.15 kb, further experiments were needed to characterize the ACEII-binding site more precisely. Therefore, the ACEII segment coding for the zinc binuclear cluster domain (amino acids 1–58) was fused to GST, and the ability of the resulting of GST-ACEII1–58 hybrid to bind to DNA was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with four polymerase chain reaction amplified fragments: fragment 1 (from −133 to −392 upstream from ATG), fragment 2 (−621 to −941), fragment 3 (−886 to −1177), and fragment 4 (−1116 to −1421). DNA-protein complexes were detected with fragments 2 and 3 (data not shown). Because binding to fragment 2 produced the strongest specific shift, it was further characterized by amplifying shorter DNA fragments and designing specific oligonucleotides to further delimit the ACEII-binding region. Of the four partially overlapping oligonucleotides named 2B (−843 to −809), 2C (−818 to −780), 2D (−789 to −764), and 2G (−772 to −736), GST-ACEII1–58binding was observed only to oligonucleotide 2D. No competition was observed by the addition of nonspecific DNA to the binding reaction, whereas addition of excess of oligonucleotide 2D clearly competed out the binding (data not shown). Interestingly, 2D (Fig.3) contains a sequence 5′-GGCTAA that is similar to the one (5′-GGCTAAA) recently shown to bind the xylanase activator XlnR of Aspergillus niger (28van Peij N.N. Visser J. de Graaff L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To study whether this sequence in 2D was the recognition site for GST-ACEII1–58, four mutations of nucleotide triplets were made to the 2D oligonucleotide. Fig. 3 shows that the mutation of the three nucleotides upstream from the 5′-GGCTAA sequence in thecbh1 promoter did not affect the binding of GST-ACEII1–58; instead the following three nucleotides (GGC) were essential for binding. The mutations of the following two TAA triplets in the promoter each reduced ACEII binding. Thecbh1 promoter also contains regions identical to the proposed XlnR-binding site (5′-GGCTAAA). One is found at position −825, present in the oligo 2B, but GST-ACEII1–58 did not bind to it (data not shown). To investigate the role the of ace2 gene in carbon utilization, the protein coding region of the ace2 chromosomal fragment was replaced with the hygromycin selectable marker hph in the T. reesei strain ALKO2221. The ace2 deletants VTT-D-99729, VTT-D-99757, and VTT-D-99758 were selected for further experiments. Because the induction and high level expression of cellulase genes occurs in the presence of cellulose as the sole carbon source, the possible negative effect of ace2 deletion on cellulase expression in cellulose-based cultivations was analyzed. In the first approach several parallel cultures of the three deletants and the host strain were cultivated on medium containing Solka floc cellulose as the sole carbon source. Cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase activities were measured from culture supernatants with MUL and HEC as substrates, respectively (Table I). The values for MUL mainly reflect the amount of CBHI and EGI produced by the fungus, and the values for HEC reflect the amount of endoglucanases (e.g. EGI and EGII). The ace2 deletants clearly produced less cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase activities than the host strain. At day 3 the ace2 deletants only had on the average 20% of the cellobiohydrolase activity when compared with the host strain ALKO2221, and after 6 days the cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase activities produced by the ace2 deletants were on the average 55% of the activities of ALKO2221. Biomass determination cannot be made from the cultures containing cellulose particles, but the pH level of the medium indicated thatace2 deletant may have grown slower than the host. This would be expected if the lower cellulase levels would lead to reduced amount of sugar available for the fungus. No difference in biomass accumulation was observed on glucose- or glycerol-based cultures.Table ICellulase activitiesTimeStrainsVTT-D-99729VTT-D-99757VTT-D-99758ALKO22213 daysMUL (nkat/ml)0.320.240.191.24HEC (nkat/ml)5.85.14.218.3Total protein (mg/ml)0.070.060.050.136 daysMUL (nkat/ml)25201834HEC (nkat/ml)251202177382Total protein (mg/ml)1.61.41.22.4Cellulase activities (1 nkat = 1 nmol of methylumbelliferyl or reducing sugar released from the substrate(s) for MUL and HEC, respectively) were measured using MUL and HEC as substrates and total protein amounts in Solka floc cellulose cultivation of the three ace2deletant strains VTT-D-99729, VTT-D-99757, and VTT-D-99758 and their host strain ALKO2221 at two different time points of the culture. The values for ace2 deletants are the mean values from two parallel shake flasks, and the values for the ALKO2221 strain are the mean values from three parallel flasks. Open table in a new tab Cellulase activities (1 nkat = 1 nmol of methylumbelliferyl or reducing sugar released from the substrate(s) for MUL and HEC, respectively) were measured using MUL and HEC as substrates and total protein amounts in Solka floc cellulose cultivation of the three ace2deletant strains VTT-D-99729, VTT-D-99757, and VTT-D-99758 and their host strain ALKO2221 at two different time points of the culture. The values for ace2 deletants are the mean values from two parallel shake flasks, and the values for the ALKO2221 strain are the mean values from three parallel flasks. To verify that the effect of ace2 deletion is seen also at transcriptional levels at later time points of the culture and not only at the enzyme level, the expression of three of the main cellulase genes, cbh1, cbh2, and egl2, was analyzed by Northern analysis from the mycelia collected after 6 days of cultivation. Transcript levels of all of the cellulases analyzed were lower in the three ace2 deletants than in their host strain ALKO2221; the mean values of the transformants were at this time point 70, 70, and 80% for cbh1, cbh2, andegl2 mRNA, respectively, of the values of the host (data not shown). The finding that ace2 deletion resulted in reduced expression levels of cellulases after 3 and 6 days of cultivation on Solka floc cellulose prompted us to analyze the role of ace2in induction kinetics of cellulase genes at earlier time points in cellulose-based cultures. For this study we cultivated two parallel shake flasks of both the ace2 deletant VTT-D-99729 and ALKO2221. The strains were first pregrown to accumulate biomass on glycerol, a neutral carbon source with respect to cellulase expression (4Ilmén M. Saloheimo A. Onnela M.L. Penttilä M.E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1298-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereafter the mycelia were transferred to Solka floc cellulose to induce expression and to glycerol medium as a control. After 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 32 h of the transfer, mycelium was harvested, and Northern blot analyses were performed. The differences between theace2 deletant and the host were seen in the level of induction of the cbh1, cbh2, and egl1(Fig. 4) mRNAs studied. Quantification of the signals showed that on the average the signals of the three cellulase mRNAs of the ace2 deletant were 30–75% of the amount seen in the ALKO2221 strain at time points 9–18 h after transfer but were closer to the control levels at later time points (Fig. 4 B). No cellulase signals were detected from the mycelia transferred to the glycerol medium (data not shown). Taken together the results obtained on Solka floc cellulose medium show that cellulase transcript levels of the ace2 mutant strain are on the average lower throughout the cultivation until day 6. The difference is greater at the early stages of cultivation, indicating that induction has become slower in the mutant. It was of interest whether ace2 functions also in the induction caused by a known strong and rapid cellulase inducer, the disaccharide sophorose. Each of the strains VTT-D-99729, VTT-D-99757, and ALKO2221 were grown in two parallel shake flasks on glycerol medium for 4 days, after which sophorose was added into the culture. mRNA analyses were performed 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after sophorose addition. The induction of cbh1 (Fig. 5) and of cbh2 and egl1 (data not shown) was followed by Northern analysis. The levels of cellulase mRNA were very similar between the two independent ace2 deletants and the control strain ALKO2221. This result suggests that ace2deletion does not affect sophorose induction of cbh1 and the other cellulase genes. We wanted to study whether ace2 deletion would also affect the transcription of the two main endo-β-xylanase genes, xyn1and xyn2, encoding enzymes that hydrolyze the main chain of xylan. The same filter as probed for cellulase expression was probed with the xyn1- and xyn2-specific probes. After transfer of mycelia from glycerol medium to Solka floc cellulose medium the xyn1 gene was induced weakly at 18 h and more strongly at 32 h after transfer to cellulose medium (Fig.4 A). The expression of xyn2 was induced more strongly already at 18 h. Fig. 4 shows that the expression ofxyn2 is much more weakly induced in the ace2deletant than in the host strain ALKO2221, and the quantification reveals that the xyn2 signal in VTT-D-99729 is only 30–45% of that of the host strain ALKO2221 at 15, 18, and 32 h. No significant difference in the xyn1 expression level between the host and the ace2 deletant strain can be seen in this experiment (Fig. 4 B). Despite the importance of plant material breakdown in basic biology and biotechnology, very little is yet known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the genes encoding the tens or even hundreds of hydrolytic enzymes needed for the efficient breakdown of the polymeric substrates, cellulose and hemicellulose.

We found that microinjection of G protein betagamma subunits (Gbetagamma) mimics serotonin's inhibitory effect on neurotransmission. Release of free Gbetagamma was critical for this effect because a Gbetagamma scavenger blocked serotonin's effect. Gbetagamma had no effect on fast, action potential-evoked intracellular Ca2+ release that triggered neurotransmission. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release by serotonin was still seen after blockade of all classical Gbetagamma effector pathways. Thus, Gbetagamma blocked neurotransmitter release downstream of Ca2+ entry and may directly target the exocytotic fusion machinery at the presynaptic terminal."

Whereas most small globular proteins will refold spontaneously in vitro to a native conformation, in vivo folding often exploits auxiliary molecules and defined subcellular compartments to avoid the deposit of misfolded forms (3Thomas P.J. Qu B.-H. Pederson P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 456-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Increasingly, a role for protein misfolding in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases has emerged. A common thread joining prion-based diseases and Alzheimer's disease, and possibly Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia, is the conversion of a normal, cellular, monomeric isoform of a protein into a β-sheet-rich, polymeric form (4Prusiner S.B.

So far, these proteins have not been associated with human deposition diseases. This finding has led to the suggestion that the ability to adopt alternative β-rich folds capable of forming amyloid is not a unique property of specific proteins associated with conformational diseases but reflects a general property of polypeptide chains (13Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The interplay between protein concentration and the conformational preferences of the monomeric chain in driving the transition to a β-rich multimeric isoform remains to be more fully explored. Glockshuber and colleagues (14Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have shown that a fragment of the mouse prion protein folds very rapidly into the α-helix-rich conformation with a half-life of 170 μs as measured at 4 °C. Here, we report that a β-sheet-rich conformation of the mouse prion protein (MoPrP)1 is thermodynamically more stable than its native α-helix-rich conformation. The conformational transition from the α-helical to a β-sheet-rich isoform is controlled by a large energetic barrier that is associated with partial unfolding and oligomerization of an intermediate state. Under partially denaturing conditions, it is possible to avoid the kinetic trap that leads to the normal cellular isoform, PrPC, and fold the prion protein directly to a thermodynamically more stable, non-native β-isoform. Our data demonstrate that folding the prion protein to its native α-conformation is under kinetic, not thermodynamic, control. The expression and purification of recombinant MoPrP 89–231 was performed as described by Mehlhornet al. (15Mehlhorn I. Groth D. Stöckel J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Yansura D. Willett W.S. Baldwin M.

CD spectra were recorded with a J-720 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD) scanning at 20 nm/min, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and data spacing of 0.5 nm using a 0.1-cm cuvette. Each spectrum represents the accumulation of three individual scans after subtracting the background spectra. To monitor the refolding curves, MoPrP was diluted from 10 m to various concentrations of urea in 20 mm sodium acetate in the absence or in the presence of 0.2 m NaCl, pH 3.6, and then incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. No change in pH value was detected during the time course of incubation. To monitor the kinetic trace of the conformational transition, α-MoPrP was rapidly mixed with 10 m urea in a 1:1 volume ratio, whereas to monitor the kinetics of refolding to the β-MoPrP, MoPrP unfolded in 10 m urea was mixed with buffer, again at a 1:1 volume ratio. All kinetic experiments were carried out in 20 mm sodium acetate and 0.2 m NaCl, pH 3.6. The rate constant and apparent rate order of refolding were calculated from Equation 1, 1/Cn−1=1/C0n−1+(n−1)ktEquation 1 in which C0 is concentration of the monomer MoPrP at zero time, C is concentration of monomer MoPrP at time t, and n is apparent order of the process. ΔE ‡ was calculated from the Arrhenius relation (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar) with kobs measured experimentally and k0 determined from the equation for diffusion-controlled reaction, assuming that the reaction follows fifth-order kinetics. All separations were performed at 23 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using TSK-3000 high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration column (300 mm × 7.80 mm) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.2m NaCl, pH 3.6, and the corresponding concentration of urea. To follow the kinetics of amyloid formation, 0.64 mg/ml β-MoPrP was incubated in 20 mmsodium acetate and 0.2 m NaCl, pH 5.5, constantly shaken at 36 °C. In the time course of incubation, aliquots of MoPrP were diluted 8 times by phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and the fluorescence was measured using a LS50B fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 482 nm (excitation at 450 nm, excitation slit is 5 nm, emission slit is 10 nm, 0.4-cm rectangular cuvettes) with 5 μm thioflavin T. Congo red (Sigma) was dissolved in 5 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, filtered 5 times with a 0.22-mm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and adjusted to 0.2 mm. The difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the Congo red spectra in the absence of MoPrP from the Congo red spectra in the presence of 1.5 μm MoPrP amyloid, corrected for MoPrP scattering. Samples were absorbed on carbon-coated, 600-mesh copper grids for 30 s, stained with freshly filtered 2% ammonium molybdate or 2% uranyl acetate, and were viewed in a JEOL JEM 100CX II electron microscope at 80 kV at standard magnifications of 40,000. To estimate the thermodynamic stability of α-MoPrP, its urea-induced unfolding and refolding was measured using the far-UV CD as a probe of its secondary structure. In a low salt buffer, pH 3.6, the urea-induced unfolding profile of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm shows a single cooperative transition between the α-isoform and the unfolded state (Fig.1 a). When α-MoPrP is unfolded in 10 m urea and then refolded by diluting the urea concentration, its refolding curve expresses hysteresis, a phenomenon indicative of a non-two-state process (Fig. 1 a). Both the unfolding and refolding limbs of the curve remain stable for at least 5 weeks when MoPrP is kept in a low salt buffer (20 mm sodium acetate). However, when refolding of MoPrP at 10 μm concentration is performed in a high salt buffer (0.2m NaCl, 20 mm sodium acetate), the refolding curve undergoes a gradual time-dependent transformation from a single cooperative transition to a transition with local intermediates (Fig. 1 b). If a similar experiment is performed at 30 μm MoPrP, the migration of refolding curve occurs more rapidly (Fig. 1 c). Unfolded MoPrP folds first to the α-helical form upon dilution from 10 m urea (Fig. 1 d). During incubation for 5 weeks in the high salt buffer, it undergoes a slow conformational transition to the β-rich form as illustrated by the change in the overall CD spectra, as well as by reduction of the CD signal at 222 nm (Fig. 1, b and d). The conformational transition from the α-helical to a β-sheet-rich isoform is accompanied by oligomerization as judged by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig.1 e). Immediately after dilution from 10 m urea, a new peak corresponding to an oligomer appears, in addition to the peak that represents a monomer. During the conformational transition, the population of monomer decreases whereas the fraction of oligomer grows. Although the square variance analysis of the oligomer peak indicates that there is certain heterogeneity of the oligomer species, electrospray mass spectrometry suggests that an octamer is the dominant multimeric assembly (data not shown). The unfolding and refolding behavior of MoPrP demonstrates hysteresis, a time-dependent transformation of the single transition curve into a double transition curve, and a concentration-dependence for this process. These observations challenge the application of either of the two possible classical three-state models used previously to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for PrP unfolding (16Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6010-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 17Swietnicki W. Petersen R. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27517-27520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In contrast, a model with two independent transitions, one between the α-isoform and unfolded and the other between the β-isoform and unfolded, can be used to fit the data. We have observed that the refolding to the α-isoform is much faster than the refolding to a β-isoform, whereas the time-dependent accumulation of a β-isoform indicates that it is thermodynamically more stable than the α-isoform. Thus, MoPrP diluted out of urea folds predominantly to the α-isoform with little β-isoform present. The presence of a β-isoform would account for the hysteresis between the unfolding and the refolding curves (Fig.1 b). With time, the refolding curve transforms from an apparent single transition to the double transition, demonstrating equilibration of the α- and the β-isoforms. Direct comparison of the thermodynamic stability of the α-and the β-isoforms illustrate that the α-isoform is not the lowest energy state. First, we estimated the thermodynamic parameters for the α-isoform using the urea-induced unfolding curve and applying a classical two-state model (see Fig. 1 a and TableI) (18Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). To evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the β-isoform, two parameters, the molar ellipticity at 222 nm and the fraction of the oligomer, were monitored in parallel as a function of urea concentration after re-equilibration of MoPrP for 5 weeks. Despite the fact that a small fraction of MoPrP remains trapped in the α-helical conformation even after 5 weeks, we have exploited the fraction of the β-oligomer as directly measured by SEC to analyze the “unfolded ↔ β-isoform” equilibrium using the two-state model (Fig.2 a). The unfolding curve measured by CD requires deconvolution, because it is composed of signals from the β-isoform, the unfolded state, and the α-isoform. Using the population of the monomer measured by SEC as a function of urea concentration and the thermodynamic parameters estimated previously for the “α-isoform ↔ unfolded” equilibrium, we calculated the contribution of the α-isoform to the CD curve (Fig.2 b). When this contribution is subtracted from the original curve, a curve reflecting the unfolded ↔ β-isoform transition results. As shown in Fig. 2 c, the transition curves for the β-isoform are superimposible, with ΔG, m, and C1/2 determined from the two techniques equal within the uncertainty of the experiment (Table I). Both ΔG and C1/2demonstrate that the β-isoform is thermodynamically more stable than the α-isoform (see Fig. 2 c and Table I). Because both isoforms can be refolded directly from the unfolded state, we have used the unfolded state as a reference in the free energy diagram (Fig.2 d).Table IThermodynamic parameters for the urea-induced unfolding of the α- and β-isoforms of recombinant MoPrP 89–231ΔGmC12kcal/molkcal/mol mmα-PrP−3.95 ± 0.121.18 ± 0.033.3β-PrP by SEC−6.07 ± 0.120.88 ± 0.026.9β-PrP by CD/SEC−6.19 ± 0.550.91 ± 0.116.8 Open table in a new tab Although the β-isoform is thermodynamically more stable than the α-isoform, it might be not a true global energy minimum state, because the β-isoform can undergo an additional time-dependent transition to a polymeric amyloid form. Incubation of β-MoPrP at 37 °C and constant shaking lead to the formation of higher molecular weight aggregates that possess amyloid properties. The process of amyloid formation monitored by thioflavin T binding displays an apparent latent period and then an exponential accumulation of the aggregate (Fig.3 a). In addition to thioflavin T, the amyloid of MoPrP binds Congo red in a specific manner as judged by birefringence of polarized light and typical red shift of absorbance spectra (Fig. 3 b). Aggregated MoPrP forms numerous twisted fibrilar filaments as seen by electron microscopy (Fig.3 c). Why is the thermodynamically more stable β-isoform not accessible during folding under native conditions? Previously, it has been shown that the folding of PrP to the α-isoform is an extremely fast, first-order process (14Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Folding to the β-isoform is slower by several orders of magnitude and is concentration-dependent. To prevent the conformational conversion, the α-isoform has to be separated by a large energetic barrier from the β-isoform. Although the free energy diagram does not provide a view of the actual kinetic pathway for the conformational transition, several important observations can be made concerning the origin of the energetic barrier. First, the α-isoform has to unfold substantially on route to the β-isoform. As we have seen before, the α-isoform converts very slowly to the β-isoform at pH 3.6 in the absence of urea (Fig.1 b). This process can be accelerated by shifting the α-isoform ↔ unfolded equilibrium toward the unfolded state. After jumping the urea concentration from 0 to 5 m, we observed a very fast loss of secondary structure by the α-monomer within the dead time of manual mixing, followed by an accumulation of a β-sheet-rich conformation (Fig.4 a). This result illustrates that a substantial portion of the energetic barrier requires partial unfolding of the α-isoform. The connection between the structural complexity of the pretransition state and the energetic barrier is demonstrated by previous observations that conversion of PrP-derived peptides with low structural complexity into β-rich isoforms occurs spontaneously and does not require partially denaturing conditions (19Supattapone S. Bosque P. Muramoto T. Wille H. Aagaard C. Peretz D. Nguyen H.-O.B. Heinrich C. Torchia M. Safar J. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.

Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Whether the transition state on the way from the α- to the β-isoform is predominantly unfolded under native conditions or whether it has residual β-sheet or α-helical structure remains to be established. A significant contribution to the energetic barrier seems to be associated with the process of oligomerization. As shown on Fig.4 b, the accumulation of a β-rich conformation is accompanied by oligomerization. The fact that both kinetic curves are superimposible illustrates that the two processes are coupled (Fig.4 a). MoPrP can be refolded directly to the β-isoform if the unfolded protein is diluted first to 5 m urea (Fig.4 b). When dialyzed out of urea and salt, β-MoPrP is stable for months at room temperature with no detectable conversion to the α-isoform. Analysis of the kinetic traces indicates that the process of folding to the β-isoform represents a single transition with apparent reaction order of 5, regardless of whether the refolding is initiated by dilution of urea from 10 to 5 m, a jump of the urea concentration from 0 to 5 m, or if the conformational transition occurs in the absence of urea. Such a high order of reaction suggests that the conformational transition will depend upon the concentration of the transition state. To estimate the energy of activation (ΔE ‡) of the conformational transition, the Arrhenius relation,kobs=k0exp(−ΔE‡/RT)Equation 2 can be used, in which kobs is the constant rate of the conformational transition measured experimentally, andk0 is the rate of the process under diffusion control. Under experimental conditions employed (pH 3.6 and 10 μm MoPrP), we found that the α-isoform is separated from the β-isoform by an energy barrier of 20 kcal/mol (Fig.4 c). The energetic barrier is predicted to be much higher under physiological conditions because of the lower concentration of PrP and the higher thermodynamic stability of the α-isoform at pH 5–7 (Fig. 4 d). For wild-type MoPrP, the calculated energy barrier of 35–45 kcal/mol is sufficient to prevent the process of conformational transition over the functional lifetime of the protein. Hence, a large energetic barrier prevents the conversion of the α-isoform to the thermodynamically more stable β-isoform. From the kinetic perspective, the process of conformational transition can be facilitated by the reduction of the energetic barrier (22Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, single point mutations associated with inherited forms of prion diseases might reduce the energetic barrier by stabilizing the transition state. Additionally, if PrPSc provides a template for the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc by binding and stabilizing the transition state, this would also speed up the conformational conversion. Our results clearly indicate that the folding of native PrPC is under kinetic control. The observations that many proteins are able to adopt alternative amyloid-like folds require us to revisit the role of kinetic traps in protein folding (8Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A.

If a β-rich amyloid competent structure is an intrinsic preference especially at a high protein concentration, then compartmentalization of partially folded intermediates and proteins that mediate unfolding and clearance of misfolded proteins play critical roles in cellular health. In addition, side-chain patterns that favor the formation of amyloid, such as alternating polar and non-polar amino acid residues, will be avoided (23Broome B.M. Hecht M.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Despite these strategies, some proteins, including PrP, Aβ, α-synuclein, parkin and tau, find a route to a β-rich, multimeric structure with unfortunate consequences."

Such interactions are accompanied by the recruitment of multiple cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins to focal adhesions involved in coordinating integrin-mediated signal transduction associated with cell motility, gene expression, and cell proliferation (1Turner C.E.

ILK is comprised of three domains: the amino terminus, which contains four ankyrin repeats that have been shown to interact with the LIM-only adapter protein PINCH (15Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C.

A second human ILK isoform (ILK-2) that is selectively up-regulated in metastatic melanoma cells has recently been described (23Janji B. Melchior C. Vallar L. Kieffer N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify ILK as a 50-kDa paxillin LD1 motif-binding protein, and we have cloned the rat homologue of human ILK-1. We demonstrate that ILK associates directly with paxillin via an interaction with the paxillin LD1 motif and co-localizes with paxillin in focal adhesions. The rat homologue of ILK and the two human ILK isoforms contain a sequence within their carboxyl terminus with similarity to the paxillin-binding subdomain (PBS) sequences of other paxillin LD-binding proteins such as vinculin, FAK, and actopaxin (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,13Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ILK PBS mutants found to be defective for paxillin bindingin vitro were unable to localize to focal adhesions, indicating that the paxillin-ILK interaction is required for efficient focal adhesion targeting of ILK. Taken together, these data suggest that ILK binding to paxillin may be an important factor in the regulation of ILK signaling function. Mouse monoclonal ILK antibody (clone 3) was generated in collaboration with Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Paxillin (clone 349) antibody was also from Transduction Laboratories. A goat polyclonal ILK antibody (clone C19) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, α-actinin and α-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma; actin antibody (clone C4) was from Roche (Indianapolis, IN), Xpress monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and GFP antibody was a generous gift of Dr. P. Silver (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Rat smooth muscle cells, rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52), and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, D.C.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/50 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were cultured in modified Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated, certified fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin/50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated transfection of HeLa cells was performed as described elsewhere (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Paxillin GST-LD1-binding proteins from chicken smooth muscle tissue lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by Ponceau S staining and excised. Proteolytic digestion, high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation, and internal peptide sequencing was performed by Dr. John Leszyk (Worcester Foundation for Biomedical Research, Worcester, MA). Peptide sequencing derived from a 50-kDa band revealed peptides with sequences identical to those of the human integrin-linked kinase-1 sequence. The full coding sequence for ILK (aa 1–452) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from rat smooth muscle cells using forward oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGTCTAGAATGGCCACATCCCCAC-3′ and reverse oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGTCTAGATCACTCCACATTCCGG-3′. A nucleotide tail coding for the EcoRI restriction site (underlined nucleotides) was engineered at the 5′ end of each oligonucleotide to facilitate in-frame cloning into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1HisC (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) vectors. All constructs were sequenced on both strands (BioResource Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Individual GST fusion proteins of paxillin LD1 (aa 1–20), LD2 (aa 141–160), LD3 (aa 212–231), LD4 (aa 263–282), and LD5 (aa 299–317) were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding experiments, exponentially growing NIH-3T3 cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (in vitro translation grade; ICN) were lysed in lysis binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors (CompleteTM EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by clarification by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Lysates (0.5–1 mg of protein) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with GST-paxillin LD proteins (50 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in fusion protein lysis/binding buffer in a total volume of 500 μl. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with the same buffer, and bound proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by enhanced fluorography as described previously (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, GST-paxillin LD fusion proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled ILK generated by in vitro transcription translation in a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system (TNT; Promega, Madison, WI) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The reaction mixture containing the [35S]methionine-labeled ILK was clarified by centrifugation before incubation with GST-fusion proteins and 0.1% w/v ovalbumin (Sigma) in fusion protein-binding buffer as described above. Binding proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE gels followed by enhanced fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vivo binding studies, association of endogenous ILK with paxillin was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of ILK from rat smooth muscle cells or REF-52 lysates prepared in lysis binding buffer with ILK antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C or by immunoprecipitation of paxillin from CHO-K1/chicken paxillin stable transfectants with the chicken-specific PAX1 antibody (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), fractionation of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and probing of the membranes with paxillin or ILK antibody, respectively. Total RNA from rat smooth muscle cells was prepared using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNAs were prepared from total RNA using SuperScriptII (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the generation of ILK-PBS mutants, we used the QuickChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with the modification that antibody dilutions were made in Western block buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 3% w/v bovine serum albumin). Photographs were taken on a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence illumination using Kodak Tmax 400 film or a digital camera (SPOTTMRT; Diagnostic Instruments Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 3.0.5. The cytoskeletal adapter protein paxillin contains five LD motifs that function as discrete protein recognition domains originally identified as vinculin- and FAK-binding sites (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies, in which GST-paxillin LD motif fusion proteins were utilized in precipitation binding experiments, identified the LD motif-binding proteins PKL and actopaxin (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J.

In addition, a prominent 50-kDa LD1 motif-binding protein was reported (denoted by anarrow in Fig. 1). To identify this LD1-binding protein, GST-LD1 fusion protein and GST control were incubated with smooth muscle tissue lysate. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Ponceau S. The GST-LD1 motif-bound 50-kDa protein band was excised, digested, and subjected to microsequencing as described previously (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N.

Two peptide sequences (GDDTPLHLAASHGHR and EVPFADLSNMEIGMK) were obtained (Fig.2 B). Surprisingly, both peptides exhibited 100% identity with ILK-1, a protein previously described as having a molecular mass of 59 kDa (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G.

Comparison between the deduced amino acid sequences of rat and human ILK-1 (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S.

An alignment of the amino acid sequences of rat ILK, mouse ILK, human ILK-1, and ILK-2 is presented in Fig. 2 B for comparison. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for rat ILK have been deposited in the GenBankTM/European Molecular Biology Laboratory/DDBJ data bases with accession numberAF329194. Consistent with a model in which paxillin LD motifs interact with their binding partners through conserved sequences known as PBSs (8Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol.

Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we have identified a PBS sequence within the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of ILK (Fig. 2). Sequence alignment of the ILK PBS sequence with those of vinculin, FAK, and actopaxin revealed conservation among all three proteins (Fig. 2 C). The ILK PBS (aa 377–396), which is invariant in all ILK isoforms, displays 33% identity with the actopaxin PBS (aa 273–290), 20% identity with the FAK PBS (aa 919–938), and 15% identity with the vinculin PBS (aa 951–970) (Fig. 2 D). Val928/Leu931of FAK and Val282/Leu285of actopaxin have previously been shown to be essential for binding to paxillin (13Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp.

The corresponding amino acids of ILK, Val386 and Thr387, were both mutated to glycine and used in the experiments described in Fig. 7. In an effort to resolve the discrepancy in the molecular mass for the p50ILK band observed in the paxillin LD1 motif binding experiments and the reported p59ILK protein, we generated a monoclonal antibody, in collaboration with Transduction Laboratories, raised against a GST fusion protein of the carboxyl terminus of ILK (aa 326–453). This sequence is 100% conserved between rat ILK and human ILK-1. Western blotting of total lysates from various cells lines and rat tissues indicated that the ILK monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes a band with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa in all cell lines and tissues examined without any evidence of a 59-kDa band (Fig.3). To further confirm the relative molecular mass of ILK, the blots were reprobed sequentially with α-tubulin (recognizing a 58-kDa band) and actin (recognizing a 42-kDa band) antibodies (Fig. 3). Identical results were obtained with another commercially available ILK antibody (clone C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; data not shown). Finally, in vitrotranscription translation of the rat ILK cDNA using a reticulocyte lysate system produced a 50-kDa peptide (see Fig. 5 C) that was recognized by both ILK antibodies (data not shown).Figure 5ILK associates directly with the paxillin LD1 motif in vitro. A, Coomassie Blue staining of the GST-paxillin LD motif fusion proteins. B, paxillin LD motif fusion proteins were incubated with in vitrotranscribed/translated 35S-labeled ILK in binding buffer. After washing, binding proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the subcellular distribution of ILK, rat smooth muscle, REF-52, and HeLa cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using either the mouse monoclonal ILK antibody (clone 3) from Transduction Laboratories (Fig.4) or the goat polyclonal ILK antibody (clone C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; data not shown). In all cell lines mentioned above, as well as in CHO-K1 and NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown), ILK demonstrated robust focal adhesion staining at the end of actin stress fibers (Fig. 4, A, B, E, and F) and co-localized with paxillin (Fig. 4, C and D). To confirm the subcellular distribution of ILK, the rat ILK cDNA was subcloned in-frame with GFP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfection of the GFP-ILK construct into HeLa cells, followed by replating of the transfectants on fibronectin-coated slips, revealed that GFP-ILK is efficiently targeted to focal adhesions (Fig.4, G and H). Identical results were obtained with Xpress-tagged ILK (data not shown). Previously identified paxillin LD-binding proteins bind either a single LD motif (e.g. PKL) or multiple LD motifs (e.g. vinculin, FAK, and actopaxin) (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine whether ILK binds directly and exclusively to the LD1 motif, each paxillin LD motif was synthesized as a GST fusion protein (Fig.5 A) and incubated with35S-labeled rat ILK prepared by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation. Strong binding was observed only with the paxillin LD1 motif (Fig. 5 B), consistent with the precipitation data presented in Fig. 1. To evaluate the interaction between ILK and paxillinin vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using either REF-52 or rat smooth muscle lysates. Total lysates of these cell lines were incubated with ILK antibody or with control IgG. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on Western blots and probed sequentially with paxillin and α-actinin antibodies. Paxillin was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with ILK antibody from lysates of adherent cells, whereas α-actinin failed to bind (Fig.6 A). The same results were obtained from lysates of cells maintained in suspension (Fig.6 A), indicating that the paxillin-ILK association is constitutive rather than adhesion-induced. Additionally, ILK was co-precipitated in paxillin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 B). For these experiments, CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with chicken paxillin cDNA (8Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A.

Chicken paxillin was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal chicken-specific PAX1 antibody (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were prepared for Western blot analysis and probed with ILK and α-actinin antibodies. ILK was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with the PAX1 antibody, whereas α-actinin was not (Fig. 6 B), confirming the in vivo association of paxillin and ILK. To investigate the importance of the paxillin-ILK association in the localization of ILK to focal adhesions, we generated ILK mutants carrying either a deletion of a portion of the PBS (aa 384–390) (ILKΔPBS) or a double point mutation of V386G/T387G within the PBS (ILK PBSpoint mut). Residues Val928/Leu931 of FAK and Val282/Leu285 of actopaxin (Fig. 2 C) have previously been shown to be essential for binding to paxillin (25Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar,13Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To test the ability of these ILK PBS mutants to bind paxillin LD1 motif, they were generated in vitro by coupled transcription translation as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins and used in binding reactions with GST or the paxillin GST-LD1 motif. Results showed that in contrast to wild-type ILK, which bound strongly to GST-LD1, neither of the ILK PBS mutants were able to bind to the paxillin LD1 motif, thus confirming the paxillin-binding site on ILK (Fig. 7 A). Analysis of the ability of either of the ILK PBS mutants defective for paxillin-binding to localize to focal adhesions was evaluated by transfection of GFP-ILK, GFP-ILKΔPBS, and GFP-ILK V386G/T387G (GFP-ILK PBSpoint mut) into HeLa cells. Western blotting analysis of total lysates from all transfectants probed with the ILK antibody confirmed expression and the correct size of the GFP-ILK mutants (Fig. 7 B). Immunofluorescence analysis of the transfectants showed that, in contrast to GFP-ILK which localized efficiently to focal adhesions, GFP-ILKΔPBS and GFP-ILK PBSpoint mut were unable to localize to focal adhesions (Fig.7 C). In contrast, the localization of paxillin to focal adhesions was unaffected by ectopic expression of the GFP-ILK mutants (Fig. 7 D). These results indicate that the paxillin-ILK interaction is a requirement for efficient focal adhesion targeting of ILK. We have previously determined that individual paxillin LD motifs function as independent and selective binding interfaces for focal adhesion proteins including vinculin, the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase FAK, PKL, and actopaxin (12Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J.

Such interactions are consistent with a role for paxillin as a molecular adapter protein involved in integrin-mediated cytoskeletal organization and intracellular signaling (6Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified a 50-kDa paxillin LD1-binding protein as the ILK. To further explore the observed ILK-paxillin association, an ILK cDNA was cloned from rat smooth muscle cells. This cDNA exhibited 99.6% identity at the amino acid level with the human ILK-1 (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) and ILK-2 genes (23Janji B. Melchior C. Vallar L. Kieffer N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A similar high level of homology is exhibited by ILK genes cloned from mouse (26Li F. Liu J. Mayne R. Wu C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and guinea pig (GenBankTM accession number AF256520). ILK has previously been reported as a 59-kDa protein (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 19Wu C. Keightley S.Y.

Although the rat ILK isoform identified in this report as a 50-kDa protein represents the rat homologue of human ILK, its predicted molecular mass of 51.4 kDa is identical to the predicted molecular mass of either human ILK-1 or ILK-2. A monoclonal antibody raised against a sequence in the carboxyl terminus of ILK that is 100% conserved between human ILK-1 and rat ILK, recognized a single 50-kDa band on Western blots of all tissues and cells examined. Thus, whereas it has been suggested that the expression of different ILK isoforms may be developmentally and spatially restricted (23Janji B. Melchior C. Vallar L. Kieffer N. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Chung D.H. Lee J.I. Kook M.C. Kim J.R. Kim S.H. Choi E.Y. Park S.H. Song H.G. Virchows Arch. 1998; 433: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the reason for the discrepancy in the reported size for ILK is unclear at this time. Although ILK was originally identified as an integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domain-associated protein (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), its ability to co-localize with integrins in focal adhesions has only recently been demonstrated (16Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we confirm the robust localization of endogenous ILK to focal adhesions, using the monoclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of ILK. Expression of epitope-tagged rat ILK cDNA in either HeLa or CHO-K1 cells confirmed that exogenously expressed ILK demonstrated a similarly restricted distribution. The mechanism by which ILK is localized to focal adhesions appears to be quite complex. Sequence analysis of ILK demonstrated the presence of a carboxyl-terminal paxillin-binding PBS domain with homology to the PBS domains of FAK, vinculin, and actopaxin (7Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 13Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mutation of this region not only confirmed its function in mediating paxillin binding but also revealed that a functional interaction between ILK and paxillin is required for the localization of ILK to focal adhesions. However, another protein contributing to ILK localization to focal adhesions is the LIM-containing adapter protein PINCH (15Tu Y. Li F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Elimination of the PINCH binding site within the amino-terminal ankyrin repeat of ILK also inhibits ILK targeting to focal adhesions (16Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PINCH localizes to focal adhesions is currently unknown. Finally, the integrin cytoplasmic domains represent a third potential docking site for ILK. A detailed analysis of a role for integrin binding in ILK subcellular localization has not been performed, although expression of an ILK mutant comprising the first 230 amino acids and thus containing the PINCH binding site but not the carboxyl integrin and paxillin binding sites failed to target to focal adhesions (16Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus multiple interactions utilizing regions within both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of ILK likely contribute to its stable localization to focal adhesions. Both paxillin and ILK have been implicated as important downstream effectors of integrin activation, displaying roles in the regulation of cell adhesion, cell motility, and gene expression (6Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 21Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement for paxillin binding in the recruitment of ILK to focal adhesions, coupled with the close physical proximity of the paxillin and integrin binding sites on ILK, may have important implications in the efficient transduction of extracellular cues via these proteins. In this regard, it is noteworthy that several additional regulatory proteins critical to integrin function, including the tyrosine kinases FAK and Src, bind to regions within the amino terminus of paxillin adjacent to the ILK binding site (6Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). This may not only facilitate cross-talk between these proteins but may also facilitate the activation of shared downstream targets such as AKT/PKB, a component of the cell survival pathway that is activated in both an ILK- and FAK-dependent manner (3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar,17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Finally, ILK has also been implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial cells (18Novak A. Hsu S.C. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Papkoff J. Montesano R. Roskelley C. Grosschedl R. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and therefore in the control of gene expression and mesenchymal morphogenesis. A potential role for the paxillin-ILK interaction in these events is suggested by the co-precipitation from epithelial cells of a protein complex containing ILK, paxillin, and the protein dishevelled, a cytoplasmic signaling component of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (29Torres M.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dishevelled, like paxillin and ILK, was found to localize to focal adhesions in these cells. Delineating the precise role for the paxillin interaction in mediating the ability of ILK to regulate cell survival, transformation, and differentiation represents an important area for future study.

In this study, we investigated the ROS production in human monocytes stimulated by several viral proteins of hepatitis C virus.

By using different metabolic inhibitors, we showed that ROS production requires calcium influx, tyrosine kinases, and the stress-activated protein kinase, p38. The study of p47PHOX phosphorylation and translocation showed that NADPH oxidase was activated and involved in ROS production induced by NS3. In a second experiment, NS3 inhibited the oxidative burst induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Virol. 1998; 143: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and chronic infection with HCV is a major cause of liver disease and liver cancer worldwide. The viral genome is a 9.5-kilobase, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule that contains a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein of 3,010–3,030 amino acids (2Choo Q.L. Richman K.H. Han J.H. Berger K. Lee C. Dong C. Gallegos C. Coit D. Medina-Selby R. Barr P.J. Weiner A.J. Bradley G. Kuo P.J. Houghton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2451-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). The HCV polyprotein undergoes proteolytic processing by both host signal peptidases and viral proteases, giving rise to at least 10 mature proteins, which are encoded on the viral RNA in the following order: NH2-Core-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH. Core, E1, E2, and p7 are viral-structural proteins. The remaining viral proteins (NS2 to NS5B) are believed to be nonstructural proteins, components of the viral replication machinery. The catalytic domain of the NS3 protease has been mapped to the N-terminal 180-amino acid region of NS3, which contains a characteristic serine protease catalytic triad (3Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L. Mous J. Jacobsen H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Wychowski C. Feinstone S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2832-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal protease domain, the C-terminal two-thirds domain of the NS3 protein contains conserved sequence motifs, which are the hallmark of RNA helicases (5Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent experiments indicate that NS3 could suppress apoptosis and be involved in persistent infection (6Fujita T. Ishido S. Muramatsu S. Itoh M. Hotta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 7Ishido S. Muramatsu S. Fujita T. Iwanaga Y. Tong W.Y. Katayama Y. Itoh M. Hotta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these authors reported that NS3 could inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) production triggered by phorbol ester, a PKC agonist (10Tauber A.I. Brettler D.B. Kennington E.A. Blumberg P.M. Blood. 1982; 60: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been suggested that liver injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatitis C could be partly caused by HCV-mediated oxidative stress (11Barbaro G. Di Lorenzo G. Asti A. Ribersani M. Belloni G. Grisorio B. Filice G. Barbarini G. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1999; 94: 2198-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Chronic infection was also associated with ROS production in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (12Boya P. de la Pena A. Beloqui O. Larrea E. Conchillo M. Castelruiz Y. Civeira M.P. Prieto J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 808-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13De Maria N. Colantoni A. Fagiuoli S. Liu G.J. Rogers B.K. Farinati F. Van Thiel D.H.

Med. 1998; 24: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ROS, especially superoxide anion (O⨪2), are essential contributors to host defense against invading microorganisms. They are able to activate transcription factors and, thus, modulate immune and inflammatory responses and control cell survival (15Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L.

During immune response, release of ROS from sequestered phagocytes and activated resident macrophages represent the predominant component of oxidative stress in the liver. Monocytes could be target cells for HCV (17Bouffard P. Hayashi P.H. Acevedo R. Levy N. Zeldis J.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Muller H.M.

Immunol. 1996; 103: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In these cells, ROS production requires the activation of NADPH oxidase, which catalyzes reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide in conjunction with oxidation of NADPH (21Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are key cells in antigen presentation and in the inflammatory response and could thus be involved in the natural history of HCV infection. However, little is known about the ability of the monocyte to produce ROS in response to HCV proteins. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of several proteins of HCV to activate ROS production in human monocytes and to clarify the signaling pathway involved. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, sodium orthovanadate, catalase, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c, rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), myxothiazol, antimycin A, diphenyleneionodium chloride (DPI), lanthanum chloride (LaCl3), U73122, calphostin C, antibody specific for p38 and NG-methyl-l-arginine (LNMMA) were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific for p47PHOX and p67PHOX were obtained from Becton Dickinson (Le Pont de Claix, France). Antibodies specific for mitogen-activated protein kinases and herbimycin A were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, and Sepharose beads were purchased from Calbiochem. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant NS3 protein (1007–1534 amino acids) was produced in Escherichia coli by Mikrogen Research (Germany) and solubilized in 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. The final concentration of SDS in cell culture was always less than 0.001%. Core, NS4, NS5A, and NS5B were also produced in E. coli and purchased by Mikrogen Research (Germany). Core protein (1–115 amino acid) does not include E1, E2, and p7. NS4 protein (1616–1862) includes NS4A and NS4B. Control medium was the buffer solution in which NS3 was solubilized. Mononuclear cells were obtained from buffy coats from healthy blood donors by a standard Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method. Human monocytes were isolated from mononuclear cells by adherence to plastic for 2 h in special macrophage serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with Hepes-buffered saline solution (Biomedia, Boussens, France), and the remaining adherent cells (>85% monocytes) were incubated in serum-free medium. Mononuclear cells 1.5 × 105 were placed in a 96-well microplate. ROS production was measured by chemiluminescence in the presence of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (luminol, Sigma) using a thermostatically (37 °C) controlled luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor2, Finland). The generation of chemiluminescence was monitored continuously for 30 min after incubation of the cells with luminol (66 μm) in basal conditions and in the presence of either NS3 (10−8, 10−9, or 10−10m) or 100 nm PMA. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 10 min before adding NS3 in the presence of different inhibitors. None of the inhibitors used affected cell viability at the concentration used. To assess superoxide anion production, chemiluminescence was measured in the presence of superoxide dismutase (scavenger for O⨪2), catalase (scavenger for hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), and LNMMA (inhibitor of nitrogen monoxide production). Statistical analysis was performed using the area under the curve expressed in counts ×s. Intracellular calcium concentration was measured in single cells by a video digital microscopy technique using the fluorescent probe Fluo 3-AM (Molecular Probe) as previously described (22Sozzani P. Cambon C. Vita N. Seguelas M.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Pipy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5084-5088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were plated into 35-mm diameter plastic culture dishes, and nonadherent cells were washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline solution (with and without Ca2+). Then adherent monocytes (6 × 105) were loaded with 11.5 × 10−6m Fluo 3-AM for 10 min at 37 °C. The time course of the intracytosolic Ca2+ level was recorded every 0.5 s for a total period of 3 min after the addition of NS3 (10−8m). In parallel assays, cells were preincubated with several inhibitors for 10 min before the addition of NS3. Cells were visualized with an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300). The light source was a xenon lamp XBO 100 W (Orsam, Munich, Germany). Excitation (488 nm) and emission (525 nm) were selected by a XF23 filter block (Nikon). These wavelengths were acquired by an intensified camera LHESA, LH 5038-STD (Cergy-pontoise, France). Images were digitalized, and fluorescence was analyzed using the IMSTAR starwise/fluo software system (Paris, France). Fluorescence calibration was performed using ionomycin and a heavy metal as described previously (23Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes (1.2 × 107 cells/ml) were isolated from mononuclear cells by adherence to 60-mm plastic dishes for 2 h in serum-free medium. After washing nonadherent cells, the remaining monocytes were incubated in phosphate-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 500 μCi of 32P/107 cells/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline solution. NS3 (10−8m), PMA (100 nm), or medium was then added for 2 min in phosphate-free medium with or without inhibitors. Then 32P-labeled monocytes were scraped off into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 with aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, orthovanadate, calpain inhibitor) and centrifuged. The cleared lysate was incubated with p47PHOX antibody for 2 h. Then 50 μl of Sepharose beads were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer. The beads were then pelleted by brief centrifugation, and the proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) according to Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) for 80 min on a 4 Mini Trans Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes first blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween. Membranes were then incubated overnight with a specific primary antibody (anti-p47PHOX monoclonal antibody 1/1000). Immuno complexes were revealed by an anti-mouse Ig peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1/1000) and then visualized using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL system. 32P-Labeled p47PHOX were detected by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Monocytic cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-p47PHOX or anti-p67PHOX (1/200)) for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with a fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno Research (Montluçon, France)). The cells were visualized in a confocal microscope system (Leica TCS 4D) using a laser-scanning head fitted to a Leitz DMIRB microscope with double-label sequential detection. The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. For each experiment, the data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance followed by the means multiple comparison method of Tukey (24Tukey J.W. Ciminera J.L. Heyse J.F. Biometrics. 1985; 41: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). p < 0.05 was considered as the level of statistical significance. Human monocytes were incubated with luminol and stimulated by several doses of NS3 (10−8, 10−9, 10−10m), medium, or PMA (100 nm). ROS production was measured by chemiluminescence. As shown in Fig.1, NS3 induced a rapid, transient, and significant increase in luminescence as compared with control. This effect was dose-dependent and the peak observed with NS3 10−8m occurred at 10 min. Chemiluminescence returned to the basal level about 15 min after stimulation. We performed the same experiments with the viral proteins, namely core (1), NS4 (1616–1862), NS5A, and NS5B (and did not observe any ROS production (data not shown). Human monocytes were incubated with luminol and stimulated by several doses of NS3 (10−8, 10−9, 10−10m) or medium for 60 min. Monocytes were then stimulated with 100 nm PMA. ROS production was inhibited when monocytes were preincubated with NS3 (Fig.2). Inhibition was dose-dependent, and NS3 10-8melicited a 80% decrease in ROS production in response to PMA. To investigate the nature of the ROS produced by human monocytes after NS3 treatment, we tested the effect of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and LNMMA (respectively, scavengers for O⨪2, H2O2, and NO) on chemiluminescence production. The chemiluminescence was completely abolished when the cells were preincubated with superoxide dismutase (Fig.3, left panel). Catalase and LNMMA had no effect (Fig. 3, right panel). These results suggest that O⨪2 is the major oxygen radical produced in response to NS3 stimulation. Furthermore, ROS produced in the presence of NS3 were shown to reduce cytochrome c (data not shown), a widely used method to assess O⨪2 production (25McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In monocytes, the primary source of oxygen metabolites is NADPH oxidase. However in conditions of cellular stress, the mitochondria have been shown to generate ROS. Therefore several inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I (rotenone (26Bironaite D.A. Cenas N.K. Anusevicius Z.J. Medentsev A.G. Akimenko V.K. Usanov S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), II (TTFA (27Suno M. Nagaoka A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)), and III (antimycin A and myxothiazol (28von Jagow G. Engel W.D. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)) and DPI, an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase (29O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), were used to assess whether mitochondria or NADPH oxidase was involved in ROS production. We compared the effects of these different inhibitors on the oxidative burst induced by NS3 or PMA. Rotenone and TTFA failed to suppress chemiluminescence induced by either NS3 (Fig.4) or PMA (data not shown). Myxothiazol or antimycin suppressed the effect of NS3 on monocytic cells (Fig. 4). However, inhibition was similar to that observed with these agents on ROS production after stimulation by PMA (data not shown). Furthermore DPI totally abolished the effects of NS3 and PMA. These observations suggest that NS3 is able to induce ROS production by activating the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and led us to investigate the phosphorylation of p47PHOX. Indeed phosphorylation of p47PHOX is one of the first steps required for the activation of NADPH oxidase in monocytes (21Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To establish the activation of NADPH oxidase by NS3, monocytes were loaded with 32P and stimulated with NS3 (10-8m) or PMA or medium for 2 min. Then p47PHOX was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody. Fig. 5 presents the PhosphorImager radioscan (middle) and the corresponding Western blot analysis of p47PHOX (bottom). Histograms represent the ratio of radioactivity on the corresponding protein level. Phosphorylation of p47PHOX increased on average 2-fold after stimulation with NS3 as compared with control. These results support the earlier chemiluminescence data and suggest that NS3 activates NADPH oxidase. To confirm the activation of NADPH oxidase induced by NS3, we used immunofluorescence staining with confocal analysis to see whether p67PHOX and p47PHOX were translocated to the membrane. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig.6) shows that, in resting conditions, p67PHOX and p47PHOX were located in the cytoplasm. Stimulation with NS3 resulted in condensation of p67PHOX and p47PHOX in particular spots (30El Benna J. Dang P.M. Andrieu V. Vergnaud S. Dewas C. Cachia O. Fay M. Morel F. Chollet-Martin S. Hakim J. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Control antibodies yielded no staining (data not shown). These results confirm that NADPH oxidase is activated by NS3 in human monocytes. The intracellular calcium concentration could be involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase. To investigate the role of calcium in the NS3-induced ROS production, cells were preincubated for 10 min with lanthanum chloride (LaCl3), an inhibitor of extracellular calcium influx, BAPTA, an intracellular calcium scavenger, or U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C. BAPTA suppressed ROS production in NS3-stimulated monocytes, which suggests that an increase in intracellular calcium concentration is required for ROS production triggered by NS3. Likewise, lanthanum chloride totally abolished the oxidative burst, suggesting that extracellular calcium inflow was essential. In contrast U73122 had no effect (Fig.7), which indicates that mobilization of intracellular calcium pools is not implicated in ROS production in our model. To support these results, intracellular calcium concentration was measured in cells after stimulation by NS3 using a video digital microscopy technique. The results presented in Fig.8 A clearly demonstrate that NS3 enhanced the intracellular calcium concentration. Indeed NS3 induced an early, transient, and significant increase in intracellular calcium concentration as compared with control medium. This increase was inhibited when calcium-free medium was used. Then monocytes were incubated with lanthanum chloride and U73122 for 10 min before adding NS3. Only lanthanum chloride suppressed the increase of intracellular calcium concentration (Fig. 8 B). These results confirm that the activation of ROS production requires a calcium influx triggered by NS3. PKC, tyrosine kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinase are known to activate NADPH oxidase. To assess the possible involvement of PKC, tyrosine kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases, cells were preincubated for 10 min with several inhibitors of these different signaling pathways, and ROS production was measured after stimulation by NS3. Fig. 9 shows that calphostin C (inhibitor of PKC), PD980592, and U0126 (two inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2) failed to suppress the effect of NS3. Conversely, the NS3-induced respiratory burst was inhibited by SB 203580, an inhibitor of stress-activated protein kinase 2 p38 (SAPK2/p38) and by herbimycin A and AG 126, two inhibitors of tyrosine kinases. Thus SAPK2/p38 and tyrosine kinases participate in the signal transduction pathway leading to ROS production induced by NS3. To assess the role of calcium inflow, tyrosine kinases, and p38 in the activation of NADPH oxidase, p47PHOX phosphorylation was investigated in the absence or presence of corresponding specific inhibitors. Fig. 5 shows that phosphorylation of p47PHOX was diminished by SB203580, lanthanum chloride, and herbimycin A. These results are in accordance with those obtained with measurement of ROS production and confirm that NS3 is able to trigger ROS production in monocytic cells by activating the phagocytic NADPH oxidase via calcium influx, tyrosine kinases, and p38. ROS are essential contributors to host defense against invading microorganisms owing to their direct cytotoxicity (31Bogdan C. Rollinghoff M. Diefenbach A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). They are also able to modulate signal transduction by activating tyrosine kinases (32Yan S.R. Berton G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23464-23471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and transcription factors (33Feng L. Xia Y. Garcia G.E. Hwang D. Wilson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 34Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that they can activate the NFκB pathway, which may trigger tumor necrosis factor α production (15Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaul N. Forman H.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Feng L. Xia Y. Garcia G.E. Hwang D. Wilson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress can also trigger membrane and DNA damages (35Adelman R. Saul R.L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2706-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). During the immune response, the release of reactive oxygen species from sequestered phagocytes and activated resident macrophages represents the predominant component of oxidative stress in the liver. Thus, monocytes could be involved in the inflammatory and immune response during hepatitis C virus infection and in the pathogenesis of liver lesions. However, little is known about the ability of monocytes to produce ROS in response to HCV proteins. In the present study, we investigated the ability of the Core, NS3, NS4, and NS5 proteins of HCV to trigger ROS production in human monocytic cells from healthy subjects; among them, only NS3 induced a biphasic response on ROS production, which was initially activated, then inhibited. The major ROS produced was O⨪2. Signal transduction involved NADPH oxidase, calcium inflow, tyrosine kinases, and p38. Lipopolysaccharide contamination could not be implicated in the modulation of ROS production because other proteins were also produced in E. coli and had no significant effect. The most informative method we used to assess these effects was chemiluminescence. However, this method is not specific enough to determine whether or not O⨪2 was the main ROS produced. This is why we also used the cytochrome c reduction method, a standard assay for measuring O⨪2 production (25McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, this demonstrates that the NO pathway is not involved in the NS3-induced ROS production. The source of ROS was also questioned since they can originate from the NADPH oxidase pathway or from mitochondria. DPI completely abolished oxidative burst induced by NS3. DPI is known to inhibit NADPH oxidase (29O'Donnell B.V. Tew D.G. Jones O.T. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) but could also affect mitochondrial complex I (36Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, rotenone, which inhibits mitochondrial complex I (26Bironaite D.A. Cenas N.K. Anusevicius Z.J. Medentsev A.G. Akimenko V.K. Usanov S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and TTFA (mitochondrial complex II inhibitor (27Suno M. Nagaoka A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)), had no effect. Myxothiazol and antimycin A (complex III inhibitors (28von Jagow G. Engel W.D. FEBS Lett. 1981; 136: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)) were able to suppress the effect of NS3 on human monocytic cells. However, these two inhibitors of mitochondrial complex III also inhibited the oxidative burst in monocytes stimulated with PMA (results not shown), which is well known to increase ROS production through NADPH oxidase activation (10Tauber A.I. Brettler D.B. Kennington E.A. Blumberg P.M. Blood. 1982; 60: 333-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot totally exclude that mitochondria are partially involved in the ROS generation. However, the most likely explanation for these discrepant results would be that antimycin and myxothiazol are not perfectly specific and partially inhibit NADPH oxidase activity. In support of this hypothesis, the phosphorylation of p47PHOX was found to be increased. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining with confocal analysis evidenced the translocation of p47PHOX and p67PHOX from the cytoplasm to the membrane, confirming that NADPH oxidase activity was not only primed (37Dang P.M. Dewas C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Pedruzzi E. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20704-20708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but actually increased. We therefore conclude that among HCV proteins, NS3 is specifically able to trigger O⨪2through NADPH oxidase activation. In a second set of experiments, we investigated how NS3 activated NADPH oxidase. Different separate signal transduction pathways could be involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase, among them: calcium signal, PKC, tyrosine kinases, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. After stimulation by NS3, a rapid and transient calcium signal was evidenced by digital microscopy. Both calcium signal and oxidative burst were totally abolished by a calcium channel inhibitor (lanthanum chloride), whereas a specific inhibitor of phospholipase C (U73122) had no effect. This strongly suggests that calcium influx but not intracellular calcium mobilization is involved in the NS3-induced activation of NADPH oxidase. The absence of intracellular calcium increase when monocytes were incubated in a calcium-free medium corroborates this interpretation. The use of specific inhibitors showed that NS3-induced ROS production involves tyrosine kinases and p38 pathways but neither extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 or 2 nor PKC. Inhibitors of p38, tyrosine kinases, and lanthanum chloride decreased the phosphorylation of p47PHOX, demonstrating that both p38, tyrosine kinases, and calcium signal are involved in the phosphorylation of p47PHOX, which thereafter activates NADPH oxidase. This is in keeping with others studies showing that p38 plays a role in the activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils (38Lal A.S. Clifton A.D. Rouse J. Segal A.W. Cohen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, p38, a member of the stress-activated protein kinases is known to activate apoptosis but could also be involved in cell proliferation and survival (40Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The relevance of these effects in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C remains to be investigated. After the initially triggering an oxidative burst, NS3 was shown to secondarily inhibit the PMA-induced ROS production. This is in accordance with the results of Borowski et al. (9Borowski P. zur Wiesch J.S. Resch K. Feucht H. Laufs R. Schmitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30722-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who showed a similar inhibition of PMA effects by NS3 in neutrophils. These authors provide evidence that NS3 could disrupt PKC-mediated signal transduction (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Borowski P. zur Wiesch J.S. Resch K. Feucht H. Laufs R. Schmitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30722-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However the neurophils were permeabilized before NS3 was added. This could explain why these authors did not observe the initial oxidative burst we evidenced. Actually, when NS3 was added in the medium and after a 1-h incubation time, PMA stimulation of ROS production was abolished. This requires a tight interaction between NS3 and PKC (8Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Borowski P. zur Wiesch J.S. Resch K. Feucht H. Laufs R. Schmitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30722-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Accordingly, this suggests that NS3 initially could promote ROS production through a membrane receptor and, thereafter, is internalized and interacts with PKC to inhibit ROS production. This hypothesis clearly needs to be assessed by further experiments. Several studies have provided evidence that ROS production activates the transcription factor NFκβ in monocytes and, thus, modulates immune and inflammatory responses as well as apoptosis by modulating the transcription of several genes (15Bonizzi G.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) Furthermore oxidative genomic damage might be relevant in viral induced-carcinogenesis (35Adelman R. Saul R.L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2706-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In human immunodeficiency virus infection, many studies have shown that viral proteins, especially Tat, trigger ROS production (41Lachgar A. Sojic N. Arbault S. Bruce D. Sarasin A. Amatore C. Bizzini B. Zagury D. Vuillaume M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1447-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This oxidative stress facilitates viral replication through NFκB activation and inhibits the proliferation of immune cells (42Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 43Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 44Pace G.W. Leaf C.D. Free Radic.

Whether these phenomena play a role in the natural history of HCV infection remains to be assessed."

Prevention efforts and control of tuberculosis is seriously hampered by the appearance of multi-drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, new approaches to the treatment of tuberculosis are needed. Because, the mycobacterial cell wall is essential for viability, it represents a very attractive target for new anti-mycobacterial agents (2Barry III., C.E. Biochem.

Recent biochemical studies indicate that cell wall synthesis occurs in conjunction with mycolic acid, arabinogalactan, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. 2I. C. Hancock and G. S. Besra, unpublished results. Initially, LU synthesis involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P and Rha from their respective sugar nucleotides (UDP-GlcNAc and dTDP-Rha) to endogenous polyprenol-P (probably C50-P) to form the polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc (lipid 1) and polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (lipid 2) precursors involved in LU synthesis (19Mikusova K.

These glycolipid intermediates then serve as acceptors first for the sequential addition of Galf from UDP-Galf to generate polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galx (x is ∼25–30 residues) and second for the transfer of Araf to this growing lipid intermediate polyprenol-P-P-LU-galactan using β-d-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryldecaprenol (DPA) and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate donors to afford polyprenol-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galx-Aray (x is ∼20–30 residues and y is 60–70 residues) (20Mikusova K.

For instance, dTDP-Rha (rmlA(Rv0034), rmlB (Rv3464),rmlC (Rv3465), rmlD(Rv3266c), and UDP-Galf formation (UDP-Glcp→UDP-Galp (galE,Rv3634) and UDP-Galp→UDP-Galf(glf, Rv3809c)) have been studied in detail (21Ma Y.

Similarly, other preliminary evidence has established other open reading frames involved in LU synthesis, notably, rfe(Rv1302) as the decaprenol-monophosphate-α-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and wbbL (Rv3265c) as the rhamnosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of lipid intermediates 1 and 2 (20Mikusova K.

Based on the findings that the UDP-GlcNAc transferase is tunicamycin-sensitive (25Ward J.B. FEBS Lett. 1977; 78: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Ward J.B. Curtis C.A. Eur. J.

McNeil, unpublished results. and ethambutol and isoniazid target later steps involved in arabinan and mycolic acid biosynthesis, we suggest that the intermediate steps in mAGP synthesis, notably galactan polymerization, would represent novel drug targets. An understanding of the enzymology and genetics of the β-d-(1→5)-Galf and β-d-(1→6)-Galf transferases is therefore warranted. In this study, we describe the development of a novel mycobacterial neoglycolipid-based acceptor assay for β-d-(1→5)Galf and β-d-(1→6)Galf transferases. Furthermore, based on this simple neoglycolipid acceptor assay and genome mining of the M. tuberculosis data base using hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA), we describe the cloning and characterization of the gene Rv3808c, which we have termed glfT. It is responsible for mycobacterial galactan polymerization catalyzing both β-d-(1→5)-Galf and β-d-(1→6)-Galf transferases. Thus, GlfT represents a new cell wall drug target to be exploited in drug discovery programs leading to novel chemotherapeutics targetingM. tuberculosis. All cloning steps were performed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 was a generous gift from W. R. Jacobs, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY (27Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). M. smegmatis mc2155 was transformed as described previously (28Kremer L. Baulard A. Estaquier J. Content J. Capron A. Locht C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and recombinant clones were selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (OADC; Difco, Detroit, MI) containing 25 µg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Liquid cultures ofM. smegmatis pMV261 and M. smegmatispMV261-Rv3808c were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) broth medium (Difco) supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures of E. coli pUC8 and E. coli pUC8-Rv3808c were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with 100 µg/ml ampicillin to anA 600 nm = 0.4 and induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose. Large scale cultures of bacteria, as described above, were harvested, washed, with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C until further use. The E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector pMV261 containing thehsp60 promoter was used as described previously (29Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bansal G.P.

Analysis of plasmids from mycobacteria was achieved by electroduction in E. coli as described previously (30Baulard A. Jourdan C. Mercenier A. Locht C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Vent DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All DNA manipulations were performed using standard protocols, as described by Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch F.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Rv3808c open reading frame was cloned into the mycobacterial over-expression vector pMV261 as follows. PCR amplification was performed using the upstream primer P1 5′-TGA GTG AAC TCG CCG CGA GCC TGC TGT C-3′ and the downstream primer P2 5′-CGA ATT CAG CCA TGC TCG GGC TCT TG-3′, which contains an EcoRI restriction site (underlined). The 1918-base pair PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and cloned into the MluNI/EcoRI-restricted pMV261 giving rise to pMV261-Rv3808c. For expression in E. coli, the blunt-ended PCR fragment was cloned into a pUC8 plasmid cut by SmaI giving rise to pUC8-Rv3808c. DNA sequencing for each construct verified the coding sequence ofRv3808c as well as its junctions with the hsp60and Plac promoters. The synthetic acceptors based on β- d -Galf were synthesized using a combination of methods developed by Sugawaraet al. (32Sugawara F. Nakayama H. Ogawa T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 1557-1561Google Scholar), Veeneman et al. (33Veeneman G.H. Notermans S. Hoogerhout P. van Boom J.H. Recl. Trav. Chim.

Pays-Bas. 1990; 109: 437-441Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the case of the β-d-(1→5)-Galf disaccharide, the thioethyl glycoside was initially acetylated, chlorinated, and alkylated with 9-decen-1-ol using mercuric cyanide and mercuric bromide. Following deprotection and selective protection, the 5-OH position of the triprotected monosaccharide derivative was glycosylated using the activated donor chloro-tetra-O-acetyl-β- d -Galf,which was eventually deprotected to yield the desired disaccharide, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The synthesis is convenient because it can be adapted to generate the β-d-(1→6)-Galf disaccharide. Basically, following deprotection and selective protection/deprotection, using the dimethoxytrityl group, the 6-OH position is glycosylated using chloro-tetra-O-acetyl-β- d -Galf, which is then deprotected to yield the β-d-(1→6)-Galf disaccharide as shown in Fig.2 B. The acceptor products (boxed in Fig. 2,A and B) were purified to homogeneity by silica gel chromatography and analyzed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and electrospray mass spectroscopy (ES-MS) as follows: for β-d-Galf-(1→5)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1, melting point 103–105 °C, [αD] −42.8o (c 1, H20), 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD) 1.27–1.48 (10H, m), 1.51–1.62 (2H, m), 2.01–2.10 (2H, m), 3.40 (1H, dt, J = 9.5 and 6.5 Hz), 3.61–4.12 (13H, m), 4.81 (1H, d, J = 2Hz), 4.91 (1H, dm, J = 10.3 Hz), 4.98 (1H, dm, J = 16.9 Hz), 5.17 (1H, s), 5.81 (1H, ddt, J = 16.9, 10.3, and 6.7 Hz); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CD3OD) 27.4, 30.3, 30.4, 30.6, 30.7, 30.9, 35.1, 63.0, 64.3, 69.1, 72.3, 77.3, 78.7, 78.9, 82.9, 83.5, 83.8, 84.9, 109.2, 109.4, 114.9, 140.3.m/z (ES-MS) 498.2926 (M+ + NH4); and for β-d-Galf-(1→6)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1, melting point 92–93 °C, [α]D−74.8o (c 1, H20), 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD3OD) 1.38–1.52 (10H, m), 1.64–1.71 (2H, m), 2.10–2.15 (2H, m), 3.52 (1H, dt, J = 9.5 and 6.5 Hz), 3.65 (1H, dd, J = 7.0 and 10.4 Hz), 3.72 (1H, dd,J = 4.0 and 2.7 Hz), 3.77–3.82 (1H, dt), 3.83–3.87 (1H, m), 3.89 (1H, dd, J = 4.6 Hz) 3.95–4.13 (7H, m), 4.94 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz), 4.98 (1H, dm,J = 12.5 Hz), 5.00 (1H, s), 5.05 (1H, dm,J = 17.1 Hz), 5.90 (1H, ddt, J = 17.1, 12.5, and 6.7 Hz); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CD3OD) 27.3, 30.2, 30.3, 30.6, 30.6, 30.8, 34.9, 69.0, 64.5, 70.7, 71.1, 72.6, 78.9, 78.9, 82.9, 83.5, 84.6, 85.0, 109.3, 110.0, 114.9, 140.3.m/z (ES-MS) 498.2917 (M+ + NH4). The complete synthesis and full description of all intermediates leading to β-d-Galf-(1→5)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1and β-d-Galf-(1→6)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1will be documented separately. 4C. Flaherty and G. S. Besra, unpublished results. M. smegmatis pMV261, M. smegmatis pMV261-Rv3808c, E. coli pUC8, andE. coli pUC8-Rv3808c were grown as described earlier, harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −20 °C until required. Mycobacterial cells (10 g wet weight) were washed and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A, containing 50 mm MOPS (adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH), 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C and subjected to probe sonication (Soniprep 150, MSE Sanyo Gallenkamp, Crawley, Sussex, UK; 1-cm probe) for a total time of 10 min in 60-s pulses with 90-s cooling intervals between pulses. E. colicells were disrupted in a similar fashion using 30-s pulses and 45-s cooling intervals between pulses. The sonicates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting mycobacterial cell wall pellets were resuspended in buffer A. Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was added to yield a 60% suspension and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The upper, particulate, diffuse cell wall enzymatically active (P60) band was collected and washed three times with buffer A and resuspended in buffer A at a final protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the 27,000 × g supernatant at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed and the membranes gently resuspended in buffer A at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). β-d-Galf(1→5)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1and β-d-Galf(1→6)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1(2 mm), which were stored as 100 mm ethanol stocks, were dried under a stream of argon in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml), which was placed in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min to remove any residual solvent. Both acceptors were then resuspended with the remaining constituents of the galactosyltransferase assay in buffer A. The reaction mixtures for assessing [14C]Gal incorporation consisted of UDP-[U-14C]Gal (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 327 mCi/mmol, 0.25 µCi, 10 µl), ATP (1 mm, 5 µl), NADH (100 mm, 8 µl), membranes (250 µg, 12.5 µl), and the cell wall fraction (250 µg, 25 µl) in a final reaction volume of 80 µl. In some instances the cell wall fraction was omitted and replaced by buffer A. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1, 533 µl) solution was then added to the incubation tubes and the entire contents centrifuged at 18,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered, dried under a stream of argon, resuspended in C2H5OH:H2O (1:1, 1 ml), and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (C2H5OH:H2O (1:1)) 1-ml Whatman strong anion exchange cartridge, which was washed with 3 ml of ethanol. The eluate was dried and the resulting products partitioned between the two phases arising from a mixture ofn-butanol (3 ml) and H20 (3 ml). The resulting organic phase was recovered following centrifugation at 3,500 ×g, and the aqueous phase was again extracted twice with 3 ml of n-butanol-saturated water; the pooled extracts were back-washed twice with water saturated with n-butanol (3 ml). The n-butanol-saturated water fraction was dried and resuspended in 200 µl of n-butanol. The total cpm of radiolabeled material extractable into the n-butanol phase was measured by scintillation counting using 10% of the labeled material and 10 ml of EcoScintA (National Diagnostics, Atlanta). The incorporation of [14C]Gal was determined by subtracting counts present in control assays (either incubation of the reaction components in the absence of the acceptors or from membranes prepared from empty pMV261 or pUC8 constructs). Another 10% of the labeled material was subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in CHCl3:CH3OH:NH4OH:H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6) on aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 F254plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing TLCs to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat) for 4–5 days. Large scale reaction mixtures containing unlabeled UDP-Gal (80 mm), β-d-Galf(1→5)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1or β-d-Galf(1→6)-β-d-Galf-O-C10:1(80 mm), and the other components were prepared and processed as described above. The final water-saturatedn-butanol phases were dried, applied to preparative TLC plates along with radiolabeled material (50,000 cpm) to trace the cold enzymatically synthesized products, and developed in CHCl3:CH3OH:NH4OH:H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6). The plates were then sprayed with 0.01% 1,6-diphenylhexatriene in petroleum ether:acetone (9:1), and the starting material (acceptors) and products were localized under long wave (366 nm) UV light (36Besra G.S. Sievert T. Lee R.E. Slayden R.A. Brennan P.J. Takayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12735-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The plate was then redeveloped in toluene to remove the reagent. Autoradiography was performed by exposing the TLC to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat) for 24 h. The bands corresponding to reaction products were recovered from the plates by re-extraction with n-butanol (3 × 3 ml). The combinedn-butanol phases were washed with water saturated previously with n-butanol, and the dried samples were per-O-methylated, subjected to FAB-MS and subsequent mild acid hydrolysis, per-O-ethylation, and glycosyl linkage analysis. Per-O-methylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure was performed as described previously (37Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After derivatization the reaction products were purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) as described (37Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Partially per-O-methylated, per-O-ethylated alditols were prepared for GC-MS linkage analysis as follows. Partial hydrolysis of the per-O-methylated sample was achieved using 2m trifluoroacetic acid at 70 °C for 1 h. Samples were dried and then reduced with NaBH4 (10 mg/ml) in 2m NH3 for 2 h at room temperature. Excess borates were removed by repeated additions (4×) of 10% acetic acid in methanol followed by evaporation. Samples were then per-O-ethylated following the per-O-methylation procedure described previously but using C2H5I (37Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis was carried out on a Fisons Instruments MD800 fitted with a RTX-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, Restek Corp.). The partially per-O-methylated, per-O-ethylated alditol acetates were dissolved in hexanes prior to on-column injection at 65 °C. The GC oven was held at 65 °C for 1 min before being increased to 290 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. FAB mass spectra were acquired using a ZAB-2 S.E. 2 FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 30 kV. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. Solvents and matrices were as described (37Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). M. smegmatis cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by sonication (1-cm probe; Soniprep 150; MSE Ltd., Crawley, Sussex, UK) for 10 cycles of 60-s pulses with 90-s cooling intervals between pulses and fractionated as described previously. Separation of 20 µg of proteins from the membrane or the P60 cell wall fractions was carried out by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a MiniProtean II system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R350 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Similarity between glycosyltransferases is often very low and precludes their straightforward grouping by standard sequence alignment algorithms (38Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Joziasse D.H. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sensitive HCA method has been used successfully in several cases for the grouping of proteins of very low sequence similarity (40Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). This method relies upon a two-dimensional representation of protein sequences, in which hydrophobic clusters are determined and then used for sequence comparisons, thus allowing a visual comparison and detection of conserved structural features (see Fig.3 B). Wiggins and Munro (41Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the amino acid DXD motif was found to be conserved in several glycosyltransferase families from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, even though these families do not show any other obvious sequence relationships. In almost all cases, the pair of aspartic acid residues are flanked by four hydrophobic residues on the N-terminal side, with the third of these often being an aromatic residue. This motif has also been reported to be crucial for substrate recognition and/or catalytic activity of several glycosyltransferases including galactosyltransferases (41Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 42Shibayama K. Ohsuka S. Tanaka T. Arakawa Y. Ohta M. J.

Notably, these analyses identified the gene Rv3808c, which being located immediately downstream from the UDP-Galp mutaseglf (Rv3809c) (Fig. 3 A), represented a strong candidate as a galactofuranosyltransferase. The first four nucleotides of Rv3808c and the last four ofRv3809c overlapped, suggesting that Rv3808c was possibly a β-galactosyltransferase transcriptionally coupled to theglf gene. BLAST analysis also revealed that Rv3808c possessed homology with glycosyltransferases fromMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Pyrococcus abyssi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and RfbE (Rv3782), another putative glycosyltransferase from M. tuberculosis.

https://openalex.org/W2014621592,"Amylosucrase (E.C. 2.4.1.4) is a member of Family 13 of the glycoside hydrolases (the α-amylases), although its biological function is the synthesis of amylose-like polymers from sucrose. The structure of amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is divided into five domains: an all helical N-terminal domain that is not similar to any known fold, a (β/α)8-barrel A-domain, B- and B′-domains displaying α/β-structure, and a C-terminal eight-stranded β-sheet domain. In contrast to other Family 13 hydrolases that have the active site in the bottom of a large cleft, the active site of amylosucrase is at the bottom of a pocket at the molecular surface. A substrate binding site resembling the amylase 2 subsite is not found in amylosucrase. The site is blocked by a salt bridge between residues in the second and eight loops of the (β/α)8-barrel. The result is an exo-acting enzyme. Loop 7 in the amylosucrase barrel is prolonged compared with the loop structure found in other hydrolases, and this insertion (forming domain B′) is suggested to be important for the polymer synthase activity of the enzyme. The topology of the B′-domain creates an active site entrance with several ravines in the molecular surface that could be used specifically by the substrates/products (sucrose, glucan polymer, and fructose) that have to get in and out of the active site pocket.1G5A Amylosucrase (E.C. 2.4.1.4) is a member of Family 13 of the glycoside hydrolases (the α-amylases), although its biological function is the synthesis of amylose-like polymers from sucrose. The structure of amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is divided into five domains: an all helical N-terminal domain that is not similar to any known fold, a (β/α)8-barrel A-domain, B- and B′-domains displaying α/β-structure, and a C-terminal eight-stranded β-sheet domain. In contrast to other Family 13 hydrolases that have the active site in the bottom of a large cleft, the active site of amylosucrase is at the bottom of a pocket at the molecular surface. A substrate binding site resembling the amylase 2 subsite is not found in amylosucrase. The site is blocked by a salt bridge between residues in the second and eight loops of the (β/α)8-barrel. The result is an exo-acting enzyme. Loop 7 in the amylosucrase barrel is prolonged compared with the loop structure found in other hydrolases, and this insertion (forming domain B′) is suggested to be important for the polymer synthase activity of the enzyme. The topology of the B′-domain creates an active site entrance with several ravines in the molecular surface that could be used specifically by the substrates/products (sucrose, glucan polymer, and fructose) that have to get in and out of the active site pocket.1G5A amylosucrase glycoside hydrolase cyclodextrin glucanotransferase root mean squared multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion Amylosucrase (AS)1 is a hexosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.4) produced by non-pathogenic bacteria from the Neisseria genus and was identified inN. perflava as early as 1946 (1Hehre E.J. Hamilton D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 166: 777-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MacKenzie et al. (2MacKenzie C.R. McDonald I.J. Johnson K.G. Can. J. Microbiol. 1978; 24: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) identified intracellular AS in six otherNeisseriae species, and later an extracellular N. polysaccharea AS was discovered (3Riou J.Y. Guibourdenche M. Popoff M.Y. Ann. Microbiol. 1983; 134B: 257-267Google Scholar). N. polysacchareawas isolated from the throats of healthy children, and it was suggested that the function of the secreted glucansucrase AS was to produce insoluble polymers. Until recently AS has only been found in bacteria from the Neisseria genus, but the Deinococcus radiodurans genome (4White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J.

In the presence of an activator polymer (e.g. glycogen), AS catalyzes the synthesis of an amylose-like polysaccharide composed of only α-(1→4)-glucosidic linkages using sucrose as the only energy source (6Hehre E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 267-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This glycogen pathway is not found in e.g. Escherichia coli, which like most bacteria require activated α-d-glucosyl-nucleoside-diphosphate substrates for polysaccharide synthesis (7Preiss J. Romeo T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 299-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The utilization of a readily available substrate makes AS a potentially very useful glucosylation tool for the production of novel amylopolysaccharides. The recent cloning of N. polysaccharea AS in E. coli (8Buttcher V. Welsh T. Willmitzer L. Kossmann J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3324-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has made mutational (10Sarcabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki De Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and detailed kinetic studies of highly purified enzyme possible (11Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarcabal P. Planchot V. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has also provided AS in sufficient amounts for successful crystallization experiments (13Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Monatlk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The recombinant AS is derived from a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and consists of a single polypeptide chain with 636 amino acid residues including 6 cysteines and 15 methionines. Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, AS has been suggested to belong to the α-amylase superfamily, the α-retaining glycoside hydrolase (GH) Family 13 (14). Putative active site residues in the predicted (β/α)8-barrel have also been pointed out (9Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most members of this family hydrolyze α-(1→4) and α-(1→6)-glucosidic linkages of starch. The α-amylase reaction mechanism is a general acid catalysis, similar to all of the glucoside hydrolases (16Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (805) Google Scholar), and the same mechanistic scheme can also accommodate glucan synthesis from sucrose as shown in Scheme FS1. The reaction is initiated by simultaneous protonation of the glycosidic bond by a proton donor and a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the glucose moiety. This leads to the covalently linked substrate-enzyme intermediate. The intermediate can react with either water or with another saccharide molecule, as shown in the scheme. This implicates that the ratio between hydrolysis and transglycosylation is determined only by the relative concentrations of water and sugar moieties in the active site. Consistent with Scheme FS1, AS catalyzes both sucrose hydrolysis and oligosaccharide and polymer synthesis in the absence of an activator polymer (11Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R. Monsan P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With 10 mm sucrose as the sole substrate, AS produces glucose (30%), maltose (29%), maltotriose (18%), turanose (11%), and insoluble polymer (12%). Apart from AS, the GH Family 13 comprises other enzymes with non-hydrolytic functions. The crystal structure of a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (17Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) (CGTase) showed an active site architecture very similar to the α-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae (18Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) (TAKA-amylase, the first α-amylase structure determined) and thus implicated very similar reaction mechanisms at least for the formation of the covalent intermediate. The presence of a covalent intermediate has been verified experimentally in CGTases (19Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). These findings all suggest that the active site of AS is highly similar to those of the α-amylases and CGTases. Structure determinations of complexes with substrate analogues have yielded detailed information on the α-amylase structure/function relationships. A stringent nomenclature for enzyme-substrate interactions has been developed, and substrate binding is usually described in terms of numbered sugar binding subsites (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The catalytic residues are then located between the sugar binding subsites −1 and +1, when numbering the polysaccharide from the reducing end. In this work, we present the crystal structure of AS at a resolution of 1.4 Å, which represents the first crystal structure of a glucansucrase and is the first structure of a glucan-elongating enzyme from the GH 13 family. The structural alignment of AS and α-amylase-substrate analogue complexes is well suited to provide a basis for the understanding of product profile and substrate specificity observed for AS. Expression and purification of recombinant AS was performed as described previously (9Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarcabal P. Planchot V. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The production of Se-Met AS and the crystallization conditions (equal amounts of 4 mg/ml protein solution (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm α-dithiothreitol) and reservoir solution (30% polyethylene glycolM r 6000 and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0)) have been published (13Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki De Monatlk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarcabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All data were collected at the ESRF, Grenoble and were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Cryst. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were collected at beamline BM 14. Data were collected using energies corresponding to the inflection point and peak of the experimentally determined selenium K edge and a remote high energy wavelength (TableI). All 15 selenium sites were identified when the MAD data were analyzed by the SOLVE program (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Phases were extended to 1.7 Å using DM (23Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and the structure was build with the automated tracing procedure ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). This tracing located 625 of the total 628 amino acid residues found in the structure. Later a 1.4 Å native data set was obtained at beamline ID 14 EH 1 (λ = 0.934 Å), and the structure was refined at this level of resolution. Further rebuilding was done in program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and refinement was performed with the CNS program package (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). A total of 628 amino acid residues, one Tris molecule, one HEPES molecule, a sodium ion, and 751 water molecules were included in the final model. Refinement statistics are listed in Table I. Several patches of elongated electron density that could arise from a polyethylene glycol molecule were not fitted. Thirty-one of the side chains were fitted with two conformations, and for sixteen surface side chains some of the outermost atoms displayed high B-factors. A polymerase chain reaction error was detected in the structure. Surface residue 537 was found to be an Asp/Asn instead of a Gly predicted by the sequence of the native enzyme. The nucleotide sequence of the recombinant DNA identified the residue as an Asp. The stereochemistry of the final model was analyzed by PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar): 91% of the residues were found to lie in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot and 8.6% in the additional allowed regions. Only two residues (Glu344 and Phe250) were found in a generously allowed region. A schematic representation of the enzyme is shown in Fig. 1. The overall B-factor for the protein is 16.4 Å2, whereas it is 15.9 Å2 and 16.5 Å2 for the main chain and the side chain atoms, respectively. The B-factors of the Cα atoms are plotted in Fig. 2.

The single polypeptide chain (628 amino acid residues) is folded into a tertiary structure with five domains named N, A, B, B′, and C (Fig.1). Residues 1–90 comprise the all α-helical N-domain. It contains six amphiphilic helices that we have chosen to name nh1 to nh6. The helices consist of the residues Pro2–Leu12, Thr16–Lys25, Ser26–Pro41, Pro41–Gly52, Leu57–Arg75, and Ser77–Asn88 as defined by the Kabsch-Sander algorithm (28Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12270) Google Scholar) in the program PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). No known structures or domains were found to be similar to the AS N-domain in a database search with the DALI (29Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) server. Two helices from the N-domain (nh4 and nh5) are packed against two helices (h3 and h4) from the central (β/α)8-barrel (domain A) forming a four-helix bundle. The interface between the helices in the bundle is almost entirely hydrophobic, and no solvent molecules are located in the interface. Domain A (residues 98–184, 261–395, and 461–550) is made up of eight alternating β-sheets (e1-e8) and α-helices (h1-h8) giving the catalytic core (the well characterized (β/α)8-barrel) common to the GH Family 13 (Figs. 1 and 4). A characteristic of the (β/α)8-barrel enzymes is that the loop region connecting strands to helices (labeled loop1 to loop8) are much longer on average than those connecting helices to strands. In particular AS has two loops (loop3 and loop7) that are so long that they constitute the separate domains B and B′. The positions of the secondary structural elements within the primary structure of domain A are shown in Fig. 4. Domain B (residues 185–260) contains two short antiparallel β-sheets. The inner sheet (relative to the barrel) is formed by two strands (residues 187–190 and 253–256) and the outer sheet is formed by three strands (residues 211–213, 237–240, and 245–248) flanked by two α-helices (residues 193–201 and 216–222) (Figs. 1 and 4). A B-domain is found in many α-amylases. In TAKA-amylase the main structural feature is a short three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. There are also α-amylases that do not have a B domain. For example, barley α-amylase (30Kadziola A. Abe J. Svensson B. Haser R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 104-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) has a short hairpin at this position. Domain B′ (residues 395–460) starts with two α-helices (residues 400–407 and 410–422) (Figs. 1 and 4). They are followed by a short β-sheet (residues 433–436 and 446–449) where the strands are separated by a hairpin-like stretch of amino acid residues. A short α-helix (residues 451–456) terminates the domain. The domain starts immediately after two catalytically important residues (His392 and Asp393, see below) found in all related enzymes. Domain C is an eight-stranded β-sandwich found C-terminal to the (β/α)8-barrel (residues 555–628). A C domain is found in other α-amylases, for example TAKA-amylase and barley α-amylase. Several of these domains are found in the CGTases, but so far the functional role of the C domain is unknown. Although the complete AS sequence contains six cysteine residues no disulfide bridges are found in the structure. Some of the cysteines are exposed on the surface, but no tendency to multimerization has been reported. The Cα displacement parameters (B-factors) are plotted in Fig.2. The enzyme displays low overall thermal vibration with a mean B-factor for all atoms of 16.4 Å2. The plot shows that especially the region 250–400 (from the start of h3 to the beginning of the B′ domain) has low displacement parameters and that the regions of the molecule with the highest displacement parameters are localized far from the substrate binding pocket. A comparison of the full-length enzyme with known protein structures using the DALI server (29Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) showed that the glycoside hydrolase Family 13 exo-acting enzyme oligo-1,6-glucosidase (31Watanabe K. Hata Y. Kizaki H. Katsube Y. Suzuki Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) had the highest similarity to AS. A total of 458 Cα atoms could be superimposed with an rms of 2.7 Å. The superimposable residues are almost all found in the A and C domains. The structural similarity to Family 13 α-amylases is also high. In particular, the TAKA-amylase-acarbose complex (32Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) had 368 superimposable Cα atoms with a rms of 2.8 Å. A structural-based sequence alignment between TAKA-amylase, AS, and oligo-1,6-glucosidase starting after the unique N-domain is shown in Fig. 4. The boxed sequence patches represents regions of genuine structural similarity. Because of the high structural similarity the alignment can be used to propose AS-substrate interactions from enzyme-substrate investigations performed on related enzymes. The general acid residue Glu328 and the nucleophile Asp286 have been identified using conventional sequence alignment (9Potocki De Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mutational studies (10Sarcabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki De Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results are supported by the structural alignment found in Fig. 4, which shows that the Cα positions of the two residues coincides with catalytic residues from both TAKA-amylase and oligo-1,6-glucosidase. Asp286 and Glu328 are found at the tips of β-sheets 4 and 5 in the (β/α)8-barrel of AS (Fig. 1), as required for Family 13 members. The distance between Asp286 Cα and Glu328 Cα is 5.4 Å in accordance with AS being an α-retaining enzyme (14Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). A Tris molecule is bound at the active site (Fig. 3) with a short hydrogen bond (2.6 Å) between Oδ2 of Asp286 and one of the Tris oxygens and several hydrogen bonds to surrounding amino acid side chains (Asp144, His187, Glu328, and Arg509). Tris has previously been found to be a very good probe for the active site of α-amylases (33Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The TAKA-amylase-acarbose complex (32Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) has identified a number of enzyme-substrate active site interactions. Around the −1 subsite the following interactions are reported (conserved residues at an equivalent position in AS given in parentheses): The nucleophile Asp206 Oδ2 (Asp286) is forming a hydrogen bond to the O6 of the I-ring of the modified acarbose (Fig. 5). His122 (His187) also forms a hydrogen bond to O6I. Arg204 (Arg284) forms a salt-bridge to the Oδ1 of the nucleophile and is very important for the correct positioning of the nucleophile. Arg204 (Arg284) has an additional weak hydrogen bond to O2I. Glu230 (Glu328) is the general acid/base. It forms a hydrogen bond to the acarbose N. Asp297(Asp393) Oδ1 and Oδ2 forms hydrogen bonds to O2I and O3I respectively. Tyr82(Tyr147) provides an important stacking platform for the substrate ring at the −1 position. Finally His392(His296) forms a short hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl O of Tyr82 (Tyr147) an interaction suggested to be pivotal for the positioning of the stacking platform (32Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). All of these residues can be found at identical Cα positions in TAKA-amylase, AS, and oligo-1,6-glucosidase (Figs.4 and 5). As seen in Fig. 5, the side chains of these residues are found in identical spatial positions as well. Thus α-amylases and AS have very similar active site architecture with respect to the immediate surroundings of the scissile bond (subsite −1). This is in agreement with the general mechanism outlined in Scheme FS1. The mechanism for the formation of the covalent intermediate is similar. But how does AS ensure specificity for sucrose as the first substrate, and how does AS prevent water from being the second substrate? These questions can be addressed by studying the superposition of AS and TAKA-amylase at the other subsites mapped out by the TAKA-amylase-acarbose complex. TAKA-amylase is an endo-acting enzyme. It has a total of six specific binding sites for linked α-(1→4)-glucosyl moieties. The TAKA-amylase residues reported to be involved in enzyme-substrate contacts in subsites +1 and +2 are not structurally conserved in AS. TAKA-amylase His210 in subsite +1 donating a hydrogen bond from Nε2 to O5J is a Phe in AS, whereas TAKA-amylase Lys209 with hydrogen bonds to the modified acarbose hydroxyls OK2 and OK3 is an Ala in AS. This suggests that the +1 subsite in AS is modified to accommodate specificity for the furanosyl ring of sucrose. The TAKA-amylase-2 subsite has been completely disrupted in AS. Asp144 from loop2 forms a salt bridge with Arg509 and thus occupies the subsite. An equivalent salt bridge is observed in the exo-acting oligo-1,6-glucosidase. An Ala and an Asp are found in these positions in TAKA-amylase. The salt bridges gives the active site a pocket topology in AS and oligo-1,6-glucosidase, in contrast to the cleft observed in TAKA-amylase. The result of the pocket topology is an exo-acting enzyme. The α-amylase cleft is closed by residues from domain B, domain B′, and loop2. The bottom of the pocket is quite thin-walled with a solvent accessible dent in the protein surface right behind the Asp144–Arg509 salt bridge. Without this blockage the active site topology would be a tunnel. In conclusion, the assumed furanosyl specificity at the +1 site and the salt bridge creates the sucrose specificity in AS. The pocket topology in AS greatly reduces the solvent accessibility to the active site. When examining the AS structure superimposed with the TAKA-amylase-acarbose structure it can be seen that the pocket includes the −1 and +1 subsites. The superposition also suggests that Phe250 is sandwiching the I-ring of the modified acarbose at the −1 subsite with Tyr147 in AS. TAKA-amylase has a Gly at this position, oligo-1,6-glucosidase also have a Phe. This could implicate a more stable covalent intermediate in AS and oligo-1,6-glucosidase compared with α-amylases. This in turns could reflect the reduced accessibility of the active site. The intermediate simply has to exist long enough for the fructose to leave the active site and the second substrate (oligosaccharide or water) to enter. The pyranosyl ring bound at the TAKA-amylase +2 subsite can just be seen in the surface plot (Fig. 6). Compared with the exo-acting hydrolase oligo-1,6-glucosidase the pocket of AS is very narrow leaving little room for water to enter when an oligosaccharide such as elongated acarbose is in the pocket. In the superimposition of acarbose into the AS structure the modified acarbose molecule fills the pocket almost completely. The surface area of the enzyme around the pocket-entrance is however quite open (Fig. 6). In fact several ravines in the surface leads to the pocket. Hence, it could be speculated that the growing glucan polymer is embedded in one ravine, whereas sucrose/fructose approaches/leaves the active site through another ravine. An architecture like this with a number of remote glucose binding subsites (securing a high “effective” concentration of the oligosaccharide chain) could be responsible for the transferase rather than hydrolase activity of AS. The unique AS domain-B′ is involved in the formation of these ravines (Fig. 6,dark gray surface). Because of the close proximity to the active site and the high content of aromatic residues (7 Phe, 3 Tyr, and 1 Trp out of 54 residues) it is tempting to propose that the B′-domain is essential for the binding of the growing glucan polymer. However, this hypothesis has to be tested by experiments involving complex formation with different oligosaccharides. No calcium ions were found in the structure. This also makes AS more similar to oligo-1,6-glucosidase than to TAKA-amylase. However, most of the Ca2+ site arrangement found in many amylases is conserved. In TAKA-amylase a calcium ion is hepta-coordinated by oxygen atoms from Asp175 (Oδ1 and Oδ2), Asn121 (Oδ1), Glu162 (backbone O), His210 (backbone O), and three water molecules. For both AS and oligo-1,6-glucosidase the calcium ion found in α-amylases is replaced with a presumable protonated lysine Nζ (Lys293 in AS and Lys206in oligo-1,6-glucosidase). The two side chains involved in calcium binding (Asn121 and Asp175 in TAKA-amylase) are structurally conserved (Asn186 and Asp256) in AS. However, only Asp256 Oδ2 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the TAKA-amylase Ca2+ site. One of the backbone interactions (O from His210 in TAKA-amylase) is also conserved in AS (Phe290), but the change in side chain disables the interaction between the “calcium” site and the subsite +1 described for TAKA-amylase (32Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The last of the three hydrogen bonds found for Lys293 Nζ comes from a water molecule. The lack of calcium has also been observed in neopullulanase (34Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2101499146,"Relationships between the M and P retino-geniculo-cortical visual pathways and “dorsal” visual areas were investigated by measuring the sources of local excitatory input to individual neurons in layer 4B of primary visual cortex. We found that contributions of the M and P pathways to layer 4B neurons are dependent on cell type. Spiny stellate neurons receive strong M input through layer 4Cα and no significant P input through layer 4Cβ. In contrast, pyramidal neurons in layer 4B receive strong input from both layers 4Cα and 4Cβ. These observations, along with evidence that direct input from layer 4B to area MT arises predominantly from spiny stellates, suggest that these different cell types constitute two functionally specialized subsystems."

We describe a biotechnological approach to the elimination of this problem by the creation of a bacterial cre recombinase expression system, tightly controlled by the arabinose regulon. This permits the Cre-mediated and -directed excision of the entire bacterial vector sequences from plasmid constructs to create supercoiled gene expression minicircles for gene therapy.

These immunotoxic responses are largely due to the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs and their associated stimulatory sequences on plasmids, following bacterial propagation of plasmid DNA. Simple methylation of DNA in vitro may be enough to reduce an inflammatory response but is likely to result in severely depressed gene expression (6Krieg A.M. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 209-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The removal of CpG islands by cloning out, or elimination of non-essential sequences is more successful in reducing inflammatory responses but is time-consuming and tedious (7Yew N.S. Zhao H. Wu I.H. Song A. Tousignant J.D. Przybylska M. Cheng S.H. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 255-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Because bacterial DNA contains on average four times more CpG islands than does mammalian DNA (8Swartz M.N.T., T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a good solution is to entirely eliminate the bacterial control regions from gene delivery vectors during the process of plasmid production.Removal of bacterial sequences needs to be efficient, using the smallest possible excision site, while creating supercoiled DNA minicircles, consisting solely of gene expression elements under appropriate mammalian control regions.This can be achieved by the use of Cre recombinase, a bacteriophage P1-derived integrase (9Abremski K. Hoess R. Sternberg N. Cell. 1983; 32: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1986; 187: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), catalyzing site-specific recombination between direct repeats of 34 base pairs (loxP sites).In the case of a supercoiled plasmid containing DNA flanked by twoloxP sites in the same orientation, Cre recombination produces two DNA molecules that are topologically unlinked, circular, and mainly supercoiled (10Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each containing a single 34-bp1 loxPsite.Efficient minicircle production requires the use of a stable bacterial based cre expression system for efficient production of supercoiled DNA. However, currently available bacterial strains do not have sufficient control of cre recombinase expression to avoid leakage during the bacterial and concomitant plasmid growth phases (12Buchholz F. Ringrose L. Angrand P.O. Rossi F. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4256-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).This leads to premature Cre recombination, resulting in loss of the replication-deficient minicircle due to out-competition by the replication-competent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial vector. 2B. W. Bigger, unpublished.2B. W. Bigger, unpublished.We therefore utilized the tightly controlled arabinose expression system (13–15, for review see Ref. 16Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Brooks-Low K. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987Google Scholar) to create acre-expressing bacterial strain, which is both stable and easily controllable by altering the carbon source available for metabolism by these bacteria.To increase minicircle yield we have improved the kinetics of thecre/loxP reaction by modification of the loxPsites (17Albert H. Dale E.C. Lee E. Ow D.W. Plant J. 1995; 7: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18Araki K. Araki M. Yamamura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) to induce a shift in reaction equilibrium toward increased production of minicircle. This will also serve to reduce concatamer formation from multiple copies of minicircle DNA.This approach to eliminating bacterial DNA from delivery vectors is also stimulated by our work on the development of expression vectors for use in mitochondrial gene therapy. Our aim is to express an ornithine transcarbamylase gene sequence, modified for mitochondrial translation (sOTC), within mitochondria (19Wheeler V.C. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Williamson R. Coutelle C. Gene. 1996; 169: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because no vectors exist for mammalian mitochondrial gene expression, we have inserted the sOTC gene between two tRNA genes within the entire mouse mitochondrial genome, cloned into a bacterial plasmid vector for propagation (19Wheeler V.C. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Williamson R. Coutelle C. Gene. 1996; 169: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,20Wheeler V.C. Aitken M. Coutelle C. Gene. 1997; 198: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the rarity of non-coding sequences within mammalian mtDNA the presence of a bacterial vector is likely to be deleterious to either or all of the processes of mitochondrial RNA splicing, replication, and transcription. Elimination of the bacterial vector sequences should both overcome this problem and reduce the size of these vectors, increasing the ease of their introduction into mitochondria.In this paper we describe the construction and testing of a bacterial strain exhibiting tightly controlled and efficient expression ofcre recombinase. We have developed this system for DNA minicircle generation using a wide range of producer plasmids designed for both nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression with sizes ranging from 6 to 20 kb. We also demonstrate the use of mutant loxPsites to direct the Cre reaction resulting in improved yields of supercoiled luciferase minicircle, as well as showing significantly increased gene expression in vitro of this construct over standard plasmid vectors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Strains, and OligonucleotidesPlasmid pBC SK(+) was purchased from Stratagene, Plasmid pDSRed1-N1 was purchased from CLONTECH. Plasmids p705Cre, pBAD33Cre, and pSVpAX1, as well as bacterial strain MM294, were kind gifts from Dr. F. Buchholz and Dr. A. F. Stewart (EMBL). Plasmid pCIKluc was a gift from Dr. D. Gill and Dr. S. Hyde (Oxford University). Mitochondrial plasmids pRSmtOTCAPr, and pRSmtJMC, were made as previously described (21Bigger B. Tolmachov O. Collombet J.M. Coutelle C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides (Genosys) DLOX 5′-GGAATTCATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATTAATCTCGAGTAATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTATGGTACCGCGCCCG-3′ and REVDL 5′-CGGGCGCGGTACCATAACT-3′ were used to synthesize a DNA fragment with two loxP sites to ultimately create plasmid pDlox3, as well as to reconstruct the ND5/ND6 junction to create pDlox1. Oligonucleotides LINK1 5′-TCGAGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCGAGCTCCCCGGGAAGCTTCTGCAGT-3′ and LINK2 5′-TCGAACTGCAGAAGCTTCCCGGGGAGCTCGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGAC-3′ were used to create a polylinker sequence for the plasmid pDlox3. Oligonucleotides LoxF 5′-CTCGAATTCATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAACGGTACTCGAGTACCGTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGGTACCAAAAA-3′ and LoxR5′-TTTTTGGTACCATAACT-3′ were used to create LE and RE mutantloxP sites to ultimately create construct pFIX. Primers NsiICre 5′-GTGAATGATGTAGCCGTCAAG-3′ (homologous to a sequence in thecre gene) and CreIntFwd 5′-CCATGATTACGGATTCAC-3′ (homologous to nucleotides 2–18 of the chromosomal lacZ gene) were used to amplify a 1.9-kb region, demonstrating insertion of thecre-araC cassette into the bacterial genome. All constructs were sequenced over the insertion regions and gene expression regions, including loxP sites, using the Big Dye kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 377 sequencing apparatus.Construction of the pBAD75Cre-targeting PlasmidPlasmid p705Cre was adapted by the excision of part of thecre gene, the promoter, and most of the CI 857temperature-sensitive repressor, at NsiI/RsrII sites. This 583-bp fragment was then replaced with the 1624-bp control regions from pBAD33Cre, including the same part of the cregene, the BAD promoter, and the araC regulator, also using NsiI/RsrII sites to create pBAD75Cre.Construction of the MM219Cre StrainThe recombination-competent (recA+) bacterial strain MM294 was transformed with pBAD75Cre, and the cre/araCcassette was inserted into the bacterial lacZ gene using the targeting method of Hamilton et al. (22Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) to produce strain MM219Cre.Construction of pDlox1 and pDlox3 Dual loxP PlasmidsThe SacI site was removed from pBC SK(+) bySacI digestion, filling-in with Klenow (Life Technologies, Inc.) and religation. Two loxP sites were inserted into the resulting pBC SK-SacI0 plasmid by annealing DLOX and REVDL oligonucleotides, endfilling with Klenow, digesting of both the fragment and the plasmid byEcoRI/KpnI and subsequently ligating to create pDlox1. The polylinker was removed by XbaI/PstI digestion, endfilled with Klenow, and ligated to form pDlox2. Then a new polylinker formed by the annealing of LINK1 and LINK2 was introduced between the loxP sites of pDlox2 atXhoI to create pDlox3.Construction of pNIXluc and Mutant loxP Containing pFIXluc Nuclear PlasmidsPlasmid pNIXluc was created by the insertion of theBamHI/BglII luciferase cassette from pCIKluc, into the BamHI site of pDlox3.Dual mutant loxP sites (LE and RE) were introduced into pBCSK+ by annealing LoxF and LoxR oligos, filled-in with Pfxpolymerase (Life Technologies Inc.), digesting further withEcoRI/KpnI, and ligating to create pMlox1. The unwanted polylinker was removed from pMlox1 byPstI/XbaI digestion, Klenow treatment, and self-ligation to produce pMlox2. A replacement polylinker was added within the loxP sites by the insertion of the entire pDSRed1-N1 plasmid at XhoI (pMlox3), before removal of the remainder of pDSRed1-N1, excluding the polylinker, byBamHI/NheI digestion, endfilling using Klenow, and subsequent ligation to create pFIX. Plasmid pFIXluc was created by the replacement of the pDSRed1-N1 BamHI/BglII fragment from pMlox3 with the BamHI/BglII luciferase cassette from pCIKluc.Construction of pMEV8, pMEV46, pMEV88 Mitochondrial PlasmidsConstruct pMEV8 was made by the insertion of pDlox1 into the unique XhoI site of pRSmtOTCAPrΔXhoI (21Bigger B. Tolmachov O. Collombet J.M. Coutelle C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ampicillin-resistant vector pRS316 was removed from this construct by digestion with SacI and religation to form pMEV8.Construct pMEV46 was formed by exchange of pRS406 with pDlox3 at theBamHI site of pRSmtJMC (21Bigger B. Tolmachov O. Collombet J.M. Coutelle C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Construct pMEV88 was constructed by the deletion of the 16 S and most of the 12 S rRNA genes at the Klenow-filled BlpI/SnaBI sites of pMEV46.Minicircle Production and PurificationElectrocompetent MM219Cre cells (25 μl) were electro-transformed (Bio-Rad Gene pulser) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the appropriate minicircle producer plasmids. Transformed cells were allowed to recover for 1 h in Luria-Bertani media (LB) containing 1% glucose, before plating on LB 1% glucose containing 30 μg/μl chloramphenicol (Cm). Selected colonies were amplified in LB 1% glucose, Cm and frozen in 20% v/v glycerol. Transformed cells containing a minicircle producer plasmid were grown as a 5-ml starter culture overnight at 37 °C in LB 1% glucose with Cm, before inoculation of 500-ml flasks. The most successful growth and cre induction conditions were as follows:Technique 1Cells were grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 37 °C in modified M9 minimal media (with the addition of 0.2% yeast extract) (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 30 μg/μl Cm (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 10 min before resuspension in 1 volume of modified M9 minimal media. After washing, cells were re-pelleted at 5000 rpm and resuspended in the same volume of cre induction media (modified M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5% l-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich)) and further grown in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 2–4 h.Technique 2Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB supplemented with 0.5% glucose and 30 μg/μl Cm. Cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 10 min before resuspension in 1 volume of M9 minimal media. After washing, cells were re-pelleted at 5000 rpm and resuspended in the same volume of cre induction media (M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.5% l-arabinose) and further grown in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 4–6 h.One liter of cells was treated in 5 mg/ml lysozyme in 40 ml of solution I (50 mm glucose, 25 mm Tris.Cl pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA), followed by lysis in 80 ml (0.2N NaOH, 1% SDS) and finally neutralized in 60 ml of 3 m potassium acetate (pH 4.8). The cleared supernatant was isopropanol-precipitated, and the resulting DNA solution was further purified by RNA precipitation in 6 m lithium chloride, RNase treatment, and phenol/chloroform extraction (23Tolmachov O.E. Biotekhnologiya. 1990; 1: 25Google Scholar). This technique provides very high yields of DNA per liter of culture (∼10 mg).The resulting pool of DNA products, producer plasmid, and excised bacterial vector were cut with the triple-cutting PvuII for luciferase plasmids and with NotI for mitochondrial plasmids. Undigested supercoiled minicircle could then be density-separated from linear producer plasmid and excised bacterial vector on a cesium chloride gradient using the intercalating agent ethidium bromide (24Radloff R. Bauer W. Vinograd J. Biochemistry. 1967; 57: 1514-1521Google Scholar) or, more effectively, propidium iodide. Removal of cesium chloride was achieved by dilution in 3 volumes of water, ethanol precipitation, and two washes in 70% ethanol (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Minicircle DNA was run through cation exchange columns AG50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) to remove ethidium bromide or propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions to achieve maximal DNA yield from the columns.Transfection of Mammalian Cells with Minicircles and Control Plasmids2 × 105 cells were seeded into a 24-well tissue culture plate in 1 ml of growth medium (DMEM (Life Technologies) + 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS)) and incubated at 37 °C until 50–80% confluent (∼16 h). 0.24–0.5 μg of DNA in 100 μl of OPTIMEM media (Life Technologies) was complexed to LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100 μl of OPTIMEM media (2 mg/ml) in the ratio of 10 μl of LipofectAMINE/μg of DNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain six replicates per treatment, this reaction was appropriately scaled-up and the DNA-liposome complex was allowed to form at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were washed once in OPTIMEM, and a 200-μl reaction volume of complexed DNA in OPTIMEM was then overlaid onto the cells in each well. 4 h later 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS was added and the incubation continued at 37 °C. 24 h after the start of transfection, the media was exchanged (DMEM + FCS) and 24 h following this, cells were harvested and transgene activity was measured.Measurement of Relative Luciferase Activity and Statistical AnalysisLuciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on a Lucy1 luminometer (Anthos, Life Technologies, Inc., UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total protein per measurement was determined in a colorimetric assay using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative light units of luciferase activity per minute per measurement were then adjusted to that obtained for 1 mg of total protein per measurement.Significance tests were based on the mean from six replicates for each assay. To satisfy requirements for analysis of variance, raw data was transformed by taking the Log10 of each figure. This results in data that are relatively normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test) within treatments, with more equal treatment variances.We have used the analysis of variance to determine the pooled variance for the 9 treatments and subsequently used a method for multiple comparisons based on the Studentized range (Q) between means, which is considerably more stringent than either 95% confidence intervals based on 1.96 (standard error) or the least significant difference test. Given that all sample sizes are equal between compared treatments (six replicates each), this determines a critical value (ω) for the difference between the largest and the smallest sample means and applies this to the whole experimental set to obtain a 95% confidence interval between any pair of means. The value of theQ method is such that, when comparing all of the differences between means in this manner over a large number of treatments, the probability that no erroneous claims of significance are made is ≥95%.DISCUSSIONWe describe the creation of a bacterial strain expressingcre recombinase under the tight control of thearaC regulon, which can be used to produce large quantities of DNA minicircle in vivo. We have also developed a range of minicircle constructs for both mitochondrial expression ofsOTC and for nuclear luciferase expression. In addition, we demonstrate both effective and substantially increased luciferase expression from nuclear minicircle constructs over both parental plasmids.Previous techniques for minicircle production (34Darquet A.M. Cameron B. Wils P. Scherman D. Crouzet J. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Darquet A.M. Rangara R. Kreiss P. Schwartz B. Naimi S. Delaere P. Crouzet J.

Biotechnol. 1998; 49: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), have used bacterial phage λ integrase-mediated recombination to produce minicircle DNA. This system results in attL orattR excision sites of 100–165 bp, following recombination (37Landy A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 913-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the Cre-mediated recombination system employed here results in a recognition site of only 34 bp (9Abremski K. Hoess R. Sternberg N. Cell. 1983; 32: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 10Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1986; 187: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), thus producing a minimal construct size.Yields of over 300 μg of purified minicircle per liter of culture are sufficient for most in vitro and in vivoapplications, whereas further scale-up and optimization of the process seems likely to be relatively straightforward.The mitochondrial minicircles eliminate bacterial sequences that may be able to act specifically as potential mitochondrial origins of replication (38Kazakova T.B.M. Babich S.G. Golovina G.I. Mel'nikova M.P. Tsymbalenko N.V. Genetika. 1983; 19: 381-387PubMed Google Scholar), or break-points for transcription. However, we cannot be sure that even a 34-bp loxP site insertion into gene junction sites will not disrupt transcription and maintenance of these constructs in mitochondria.Although the reduced-size mitochondrial constructs pMEV46 and pMEV88, made by gene deletion, present additional concerns for stabilityin organello, the minicircle constructs resulting from these producer plasmids (mMEV46, mMEV88) are now of a size that should enable their electroporation into mitochondria (28Collombet J.-M.

We are currently investigating the internalization and functionality of these mitochondrial constructs.The nuclear minicircle vectors mNIXluc and mFIXluc clearly possess the advantage of being approximately half the size of their plasmid counterparts. As such, these small constructs demonstrate 4.5-fold increased luciferase activity over their parental plasmid counterparts when transfected on a mole:mole basis (with stuffer DNA) and 8.8-fold increase on a weight:weight basis. The huge increase seen in the mole:mole without stuffer comparison (152-fold) only serves to highlight the versatility of these vectors in reducing the cytotoxic load of DNA/liposome complexes to cells while maximizing the number of transcriptional units transfected. Indeed by the simple expedient of removing the entire bacterial DNA complement, we have also reduced the CpG content of most of these expression vectors by more than 60%. As such, minicircle expression vectors are likely to provide a useful tool for reducing inflammatory responses in non-viral vector deliveryin vivo as well as the increased transgene activity already demonstrated in vitro. There is increasing evidence to suggest that plasmid DNA used for non-viral gene delivery can cause unacceptable inflammatory responses in eukaryotes (1Krieg A.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Yew N.S. Wang K.X. Przybylska M. Bagley R.G. Stedman M. Marshall J. Scheule R.K. Cheng S.H. Hum.

These immunotoxic responses are largely due to the presence of unmethylated CpG motifs and their associated stimulatory sequences on plasmids, following bacterial propagation of plasmid DNA. Simple methylation of DNA in vitro may be enough to reduce an inflammatory response but is likely to result in severely depressed gene expression (6Krieg A.M. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 209-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The removal of CpG islands by cloning out, or elimination of non-essential sequences is more successful in reducing inflammatory responses but is time-consuming and tedious (7Yew N.S. Zhao H. Wu I.H. Song A. Tousignant J.D. Przybylska M. Cheng S.H. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 255-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because bacterial DNA contains on average four times more CpG islands than does mammalian DNA (8Swartz M.N.T., T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a good solution is to entirely eliminate the bacterial control regions from gene delivery vectors during the process of plasmid production. Removal of bacterial sequences needs to be efficient, using the smallest possible excision site, while creating supercoiled DNA minicircles, consisting solely of gene expression elements under appropriate mammalian control regions. This can be achieved by the use of Cre recombinase, a bacteriophage P1-derived integrase (9Abremski K. Hoess R. Sternberg N.

In the case of a supercoiled plasmid containing DNA flanked by twoloxP sites in the same orientation, Cre recombination produces two DNA molecules that are topologically unlinked, circular, and mainly supercoiled (10Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1509-1514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each containing a single 34-bp1 loxPsite. Efficient minicircle production requires the use of a stable bacterial based cre expression system for efficient production of supercoiled DNA. However, currently available bacterial strains do not have sufficient control of cre recombinase expression to avoid leakage during the bacterial and concomitant plasmid growth phases (12Buchholz F. Ringrose L. Angrand P.O. Rossi F. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4256-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This leads to premature Cre recombination, resulting in loss of the replication-deficient minicircle due to out-competition by the replication-competent and antibiotic-resistant bacterial vector. 2B.

To increase minicircle yield we have improved the kinetics of thecre/loxP reaction by modification of the loxPsites (17Albert H. Dale E.C. Lee E. Ow D.W.

In analogy with other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily like NCAM (22Feizi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 233-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Ng-CAM/L1-CAM (23Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is likely that the formation of ALCAMcis-homo-oligomers at the cell surface is essential for strong ligand binding and homophilic interactions.Here we describe a detailed molecular analysis of the homophilic ALCAM interaction and the construction of an amino-terminally deleted ALCAM molecule that inhibited wild-type ALCAM-mediated aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. These combined data lead us to propose a model for homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion.DISCUSSIONHeterophilic interactions between ALCAM and CD6 have been extensively studied and mapped (18Skonier J.E. Bodian D.L. Emswiler J. Bowen M.A. Aruffo A. Bajorath J. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Bowen M.A. Aruffo A.A. Bajorath J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular basis for homophilic ALCAM-ALCAM interactions has remained largely elusive. Functional homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion was demonstrated for melanoma cells (19Degen W.G. Van Kempen L.C.L.T. Gijzen E.G. Van Groningen J.J. Van Kooyk Y. Bloemers H.P.J. Swart G.W.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 805-813PubMed Google Scholar) and hematopoietic cells (8Uchida N. Yang Z. Combs J. Pourquie O. Nguyen M. Ramanathan R. Fu J. Welply A. Chen S. Weddell G. Sharma A.K. Leiby K.R. Karagogeos D. Hill B. Humeau L. Stallcup W.B. Hoffman R. Tsukamoto A.S. Gearing D.P. Peault B. Blood. 1997; 89: 2706-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that ALCAM-mediated homophilic adhesion is dynamically regulated through the actin cytoskeleton (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of specific domains in ALCAM-ALCAM-mediated adhesion had not been addressed yet.Here we have shown that wild-type ALCAM (V1V2C1C2C3) is bimodular, consisting of a distinct ligand binding module comprising the membrane-distal domain V1 and an oligomerization module comprising the membrane-proximal C-type domains C2C3. Both modules are required for stable cell adhesion and aggregation. We propose a molecular model that accounts for the observed properties of homophilic ALCAM interactions (Fig.6).Using a series of progressively amino-terminally truncated ALCAM mutants, we found that the amino-terminal domain V1 is critically involved in the homophilic interaction. Deletion of domain V1 not only disrupted the homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell-cell interaction but also completely prevented binding of soluble wild-type ALCAM-Fc. These observations indicated that a direct and exclusive interaction between two opposing domains V1 is crucial for homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion. If multiple Ig domains were directly involved in the homophilic ALCAM interaction, cells expressing an ALCAM construct that solely lacks domain V1would be expected to display a residual capacity to aggregate with cells expressing wild-type ALCAM. Moreover, truncated ALCAM-expressing cells would be expected to bind soluble wild-type ALCAM, albeit at lower affinity, if additional domains were involved in ligand binding. However, both cell-cell aggregation and soluble ligand binding were completely abolished upon deletion of the amino-terminal domain V1. Furthermore, mAb AZN-L50, which maps to the membrane-proximal domains C2C3, only slightly decreased the soluble ligand binding affinity, whereas it completely inhibited aggregation of these cells in suspension at the same concentration (10 µg/ml). It is therefore unlikely that the slight decrease in soluble ligand binding (i.e. increase in half-maximal ligand-binding value from 1.5 to 3.5 µg/ml in the presence of AZN-L50) accounted for the total inhibition of ALCAM-mediated cellular aggregation via AZN-L50. Thus, these data indicate that ligand binding in itself is independent of the C-type Ig domains and that homophilic ALCAM-ALCAM trans-interactions are exclusively mediated by binding of opposing amino-terminal V1 domains.mAb J4-81, which specifically recognizes domain V1, enhanced homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion and aggregation, possibly by inducing a conformational change that promotes ligand binding. KG1 cells with abundant ALCAM cell surface expression were only able to form homotypic cell clusters after activation by mAb J4-81. In contrast, spontaneous cell clustering of K562 cells with ectopic ALCAM expression could not be further enhanced by J4-81 treatment. These findings suggest differential activation of ALCAM in these two cell lines. We could exclude the possibility that mAb J4-81-enhanced aggregation and adhesion to immobilized ALCAM-Fc is caused by cross-linking ALCAM molecules of opposing cells, because the stimulatory effect of mAb J4-81 was temperature-dependent and efficiently inhibited by the blocking anti- ALCAM mAb AZN-L50. The observed enhancement of homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion and aggregation by mAb J4-81 is in contrast with the inhibitory effect of this antibody on the heterophilic ALCAM-CD6 interaction (25Bowen M.A. Bajorath J. Siadak A.W. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Nadler S.G. Aruffo A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17390-17396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This indicates that different mechanisms are regulating the homophilic and heterophilic ALCAM ligand binding interactions.The inhibitory effect of AZN-L50, which is mapped to the membrane-proximal domains C2C3, indicated that these domains are also essential for the homophilic ALCAM-mediated interaction. In analogy with other Ig superfamily molecules like IgG, major histocompatibility complex class II, NCAM (27Kasper C. Rasmussen H. Kastrup J.S. Ikemizu S. Jones E.Y. Berezin V. Bock E. Larsen I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and Ng-CAM/L1-CAM (23Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these C-type Ig domains are probably involved in the formation ofcis-homo-oligomers at the cell surface via lateral oligomerization. Aruffo and co-workers (28Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J.B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have speculated that ALCAM oligomerization might be essential for the heterophilic ALCAM-CD6 interaction. Recently, we have shown that homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion is regulated through actin cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of ALCAM molecules at the cell surface. The resulting increased avidity of ALCAM clusters is essential to obtain stable adhesive interactions (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we show that expression of ΔN-ALCAM, which lacks the ligand binding domain, in the wild-type ALCAM-expressing BLM cells reduced cell aggregation but not soluble ligand binding. This indicates that ΔN-ALCAM expression changes wild-type ALCAM avidity rather than affinity, suggesting a direct interaction of ΔN-ALCAM with wild-type ALCAM without disturbing soluble ligand binding. In the model proposed in Fig. 6 A, ALCAM monomers form lateral oligomers via their membrane-proximal C-type domains, whereas the amino-terminal domain V1 mediates the actual ligand binding. Triggering of lateral oligomerization might be a ligand-induced event, which possibly occurs through a conformational change of ALCAM. This concept is supported by previous findings that in response to ligand binding, the linkage of ALCAM to the actin cytoskeleton is strengthened (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which can stabilize oligomers at the cell surface. Similar to ligand-induced clustering, mAb J4-81 might induce a conformational change that triggers oligomerization.Since the epitope for ALCAM-blocking mAb AZN-L50 is localized in domains C2C3, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibitory effect of this mAb is a result of prohibited lateral oligomerization of ALCAM molecules by steric hindrance. This notion is supported by the observation that mAb AZN-L50 does not affect soluble ligand binding (Fig. 4) and therefore only modulates ALCAM avidity. Although inhibition of cell aggregation via ΔN-ALCAM was dependent on its expression level, aggregation could not completely be reduced to background levels. This residual cell-cell aggregation capacity is consistent with the proposed model because some homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell-cell interactions are maintained (Fig.6 B).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ALCAM-mediated homophilic interactions most likely require lateral homo-oligomerization through the membrane-proximal C-type Ig domains, while the membrane-distal Ig domain V1 is exclusively involved in ligand binding. Coordinate oligomerization and ligand binding leads to the formation of a tight, bilayered ALCAM network, enabling stable adhesive interactions. Adhesion molecules play an important role in development, leukocyte function, and homeostasis in multicellular organisms, which are mainly governed by inter- and intracellular communication via cell-cell interactions. Alterations in cellular adhesion and communication can contribute to uncontrolled cell growth (1Li G. Herlyn M. Mol. Med.

Commun. 1994; 2: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Activation of adhesion molecules generally involves both modulation of affinity and avidity. The affinity of adhesion molecules often reflects a specific conformation of the extracellular ligand-binding domain. Avidity modulation involves changes in the cell surface distribution of adhesion molecules (e.g. lateral oligomerization), which leads to clusters of molecules and thereby specifically increases the number of available receptors at the site of cell-cell interaction.

ALCAM has a short cytoplasmic tail and its extracellular part comprises five Ig domains: two amino-terminal variable (V) type Ig domains followed by three constant (C) type Ig domains (V1V2C1C2C3).

Previously, we have shown that homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell-cell adhesion is regulated through actin cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of ALCAM molecules at the cell surface and that this clustering is necessary to obtain stable adhesive interactions (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In analogy with other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily like NCAM (22Feizi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 233-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Ng-CAM/L1-CAM (23Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it is likely that the formation of ALCAMcis-homo-oligomers at the cell surface is essential for strong ligand binding and homophilic interactions. Here we describe a detailed molecular analysis of the homophilic ALCAM interaction and the construction of an amino-terminally deleted ALCAM molecule that inhibited wild-type ALCAM-mediated aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. These combined data lead us to propose a model for homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion. DISCUSSIONHeterophilic interactions between ALCAM and CD6 have been extensively studied and mapped (18Skonier J.E. Bodian D.L. Emswiler J. Bowen M.A. Aruffo A. Bajorath J.

In contrast, the molecular basis for homophilic ALCAM-ALCAM interactions has remained largely elusive. Functional homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion was demonstrated for melanoma cells (19Degen W.G. Van Kempen L.C.L.T. Gijzen E.G. Van Groningen J.J. Van Kooyk Y. Bloemers H.P.J. Swart G.W.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 805-813PubMed Google Scholar) and hematopoietic cells (8Uchida N. Yang Z. Combs J. Pourquie O. Nguyen M. Ramanathan R. Fu J. Welply A. Chen S. Weddell G. Sharma A.K. Leiby K.R. Karagogeos D. Hill B. Humeau L. Stallcup W.B. Hoffman R. Tsukamoto A.S. Gearing D.P. Peault B. Blood. 1997; 89: 2706-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that ALCAM-mediated homophilic adhesion is dynamically regulated through the actin cytoskeleton (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of specific domains in ALCAM-ALCAM-mediated adhesion had not been addressed yet.Here we have shown that wild-type ALCAM (V1V2C1C2C3) is bimodular, consisting of a distinct ligand binding module comprising the membrane-distal domain V1 and an oligomerization module comprising the membrane-proximal C-type domains C2C3. Both modules are required for stable cell adhesion and aggregation. We propose a molecular model that accounts for the observed properties of homophilic ALCAM interactions (Fig.6).Using a series of progressively amino-terminally truncated ALCAM mutants, we found that the amino-terminal domain V1 is critically involved in the homophilic interaction. Deletion of domain V1 not only disrupted the homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell-cell interaction but also completely prevented binding of soluble wild-type ALCAM-Fc. These observations indicated that a direct and exclusive interaction between two opposing domains V1 is crucial for homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion. If multiple Ig domains were directly involved in the homophilic ALCAM interaction, cells expressing an ALCAM construct that solely lacks domain V1would be expected to display a residual capacity to aggregate with cells expressing wild-type ALCAM. Moreover, truncated ALCAM-expressing cells would be expected to bind soluble wild-type ALCAM, albeit at lower affinity, if additional domains were involved in ligand binding. However, both cell-cell aggregation and soluble ligand binding were completely abolished upon deletion of the amino-terminal domain V1. Furthermore, mAb AZN-L50, which maps to the membrane-proximal domains C2C3, only slightly decreased the soluble ligand binding affinity, whereas it completely inhibited aggregation of these cells in suspension at the same concentration (10 µg/ml). It is therefore unlikely that the slight decrease in soluble ligand binding (i.e. increase in half-maximal ligand-binding value from 1.5 to 3.5 µg/ml in the presence of AZN-L50) accounted for the total inhibition of ALCAM-mediated cellular aggregation via AZN-L50. Thus, these data indicate that ligand binding in itself is independent of the C-type Ig domains and that homophilic ALCAM-ALCAM trans-interactions are exclusively mediated by binding of opposing amino-terminal V1 domains.mAb J4-81, which specifically recognizes domain V1, enhanced homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion and aggregation, possibly by inducing a conformational change that promotes ligand binding. KG1 cells with abundant ALCAM cell surface expression were only able to form homotypic cell clusters after activation by mAb J4-81. In contrast, spontaneous cell clustering of K562 cells with ectopic ALCAM expression could not be further enhanced by J4-81 treatment. These findings suggest differential activation of ALCAM in these two cell lines. We could exclude the possibility that mAb J4-81-enhanced aggregation and adhesion to immobilized ALCAM-Fc is caused by cross-linking ALCAM molecules of opposing cells, because the stimulatory effect of mAb J4-81 was temperature-dependent and efficiently inhibited by the blocking anti- ALCAM mAb AZN-L50. The observed enhancement of homophilic ALCAM-mediated adhesion and aggregation by mAb J4-81 is in contrast with the inhibitory effect of this antibody on the heterophilic ALCAM-CD6 interaction (25Bowen M.A. Bajorath J. Siadak A.W. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Marquardt H. Nadler S.G. Aruffo A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17390-17396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This indicates that different mechanisms are regulating the homophilic and heterophilic ALCAM ligand binding interactions.The inhibitory effect of AZN-L50, which is mapped to the membrane-proximal domains C2C3, indicated that these domains are also essential for the homophilic ALCAM-mediated interaction. In analogy with other Ig superfamily molecules like IgG, major histocompatibility complex class II, NCAM (27Kasper C. Rasmussen H. Kastrup J.S. Ikemizu S. Jones E.Y. Berezin V. Bock E. Larsen I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and Ng-CAM/L1-CAM (23Silletti S. Mei F. Sheppard D. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 149: 1485-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these C-type Ig domains are probably involved in the formation ofcis-homo-oligomers at the cell surface via lateral oligomerization. Aruffo and co-workers (28Aruffo A. Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Starling G.C. Gebe J.A. Bajorath J.B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 498-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have speculated that ALCAM oligomerization might be essential for the heterophilic ALCAM-CD6 interaction. Recently, we have shown that homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion is regulated through actin cytoskeleton-dependent clustering of ALCAM molecules at the cell surface. The resulting increased avidity of ALCAM clusters is essential to obtain stable adhesive interactions (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we show that expression of ΔN-ALCAM, which lacks the ligand binding domain, in the wild-type ALCAM-expressing BLM cells reduced cell aggregation but not soluble ligand binding. This indicates that ΔN-ALCAM expression changes wild-type ALCAM avidity rather than affinity, suggesting a direct interaction of ΔN-ALCAM with wild-type ALCAM without disturbing soluble ligand binding. In the model proposed in Fig. 6 A, ALCAM monomers form lateral oligomers via their membrane-proximal C-type domains, whereas the amino-terminal domain V1 mediates the actual ligand binding. Triggering of lateral oligomerization might be a ligand-induced event, which possibly occurs through a conformational change of ALCAM. This concept is supported by previous findings that in response to ligand binding, the linkage of ALCAM to the actin cytoskeleton is strengthened (21Nelissen J.M. Peters I.M. De Grooth B.G. Van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which can stabilize oligomers at the cell surface. Similar to ligand-induced clustering, mAb J4-81 might induce a conformational change that triggers oligomerization.Since the epitope for ALCAM-blocking mAb AZN-L50 is localized in domains C2C3, it is tempting to speculate that the inhibitory effect of this mAb is a result of prohibited lateral oligomerization of ALCAM molecules by steric hindrance. This notion is supported by the observation that mAb AZN-L50 does not affect soluble ligand binding (Fig. 4) and therefore only modulates ALCAM avidity. Although inhibition of cell aggregation via ΔN-ALCAM was dependent on its expression level, aggregation could not completely be reduced to background levels. This residual cell-cell aggregation capacity is consistent with the proposed model because some homophilic ALCAM-mediated cell-cell interactions are maintained (Fig.6 B).In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ALCAM-mediated homophilic interactions most likely require lateral homo-oligomerization through the membrane-proximal C-type Ig domains, while the membrane-distal Ig domain V1 is exclusively involved in ligand binding. Coordinate oligomerization and ligand binding leads to the formation of a tight, bilayered ALCAM network, enabling stable adhesive interactions. Heterophilic interactions between ALCAM and CD6 have been extensively studied and mapped (18Skonier J.E. Bodian D.L. Emswiler J. Bowen M.A. Aruffo A. Bajorath J.

Transcriptional activation of genes by MTF-1 is mediated through binding to metal-responsive elements of consensus TGCRCNC in the target gene promoters. In an attempt to further clarify the mechanisms by which certain external signals activate MTF-1 and in turn modulate gene transcription, we show here that human MTF-1 has a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in response to diverse stress stimuli. MTF-1 contains a consensus nuclear localization signal located just N-terminal to the first zinc finger that contributes to but is not essential for nuclear import. MTF-1 also harbors a leucine-rich, nuclear export signal. Under resting conditions, the nuclear export signal is required for cytoplasmic localization of MTF-1 as indicated by mutational analysis and transfer to the heterologous green fluorescent protein. Export from the nucleus was inhibited by leptomycin B, suggesting the involvement of the nuclear export protein CRM1. Our results further show that in addition to the heavy metals zinc and cadmium, heat shock, hydrogen peroxide, low extracellular pH (pH 6.0), inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, and serum induce nuclear accumulation of MTF-1.

One type of stress response is triggered by heavy metals, such as zinc, cadmium, and copper, and induces transcription of metallothionein genes. Metallothioneins (MTs)1 are a group of low molecular weight metal-binding proteins that are represented by four isoforms in mammals (1Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). MT gene transcription is also induced by many different conditions other than heavy metals, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, hormones, and viral infection (2Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Methods. 1997; 11: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Moffatt P. Denizeau F. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 261-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, other eukaryotes and some prokaryotes also contain metallothioneins, but their primary sequence and their transcriptional regulation may deviate from the situation in vertebrates (4Thiele D.J.

The mammalian metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) is a zinc finger transcription factor that activates the transcription of target genes in response to heavy metal exposure via binding to MREs (6Radtke F.

Recently, targeted gene disruption of MTF-1 in the mouse revealed that MTF-1 is essential for liver development during embryogenesis because the null mutant embryos died in utero at embryonic day 14 due to liver decay. MTF-1-deficient cells in culture are more susceptible to cadmium and H2O2 treatments in comparison with their wild type counterparts (7Günes C. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Müller K.H. Lichtlen P.

Another implication of MTF-1 in cellular stress response came from the work of Dalton et al. (10Dalton T.P. Li Q. Bittel D. Liang L. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Recently, hypoxia has also been reported as a condition by which MTF-1 activates MT gene expression through MRE sequences (11Murphy B.J. Andrews G.K. Bittel D. Discher D.J. McCue J. Green C.J.

However, the mechanism(s) of MTF-1 activation by heavy metals is only partially understood, and the activation by non-metal stimuli remains to be elucidated. The rapid cellular response to a multitude of external and internal stress-associated agents is orchestrated by multiple signal transduction pathways. Several transcription factors involved in stress-regulated rapid events, including p53, nuclear factor κB, and nuclear factor of activated T cells, localize differentially between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in response to DNA damage, growth signals, or environmental stimuli (12Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 291-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The import of proteins destined for the nucleus requires a nuclear localization signal; the export of large macromolecules from the nucleus is also an active transport process mediated by nuclear export signals (NESs) (12Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Kaffman A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

NES sequences are short, leucine-rich motifs that were first identified in the cellular proteins, protein kinase A inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and the human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein (16Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 17Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Recognition of NES motifs by the nuclear export receptor CRM1 is specifically suppressed by the antifungal drug leptomycin B (LMB) (19Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Here we have addressed the molecular mechanisms of MTF-1 regulation by a variety of stress inducers to explore possible regulatory mechanisms. We demonstrate that cytoplasmic MTF-1 is imported into the nucleus of serum-starved cells by stress inducers, including heavy metals. While this work was in progress, another group also found a cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of MTF-1 upon zinc and cadmium treatment of cells (20Smirnova I.V. Bittel D.C. Ravindra R. Jiang H. Andrews G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9377-9384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here we characterize a nuclear localization signal (NLS) of MTF-1 and show that MTF-1 enters the nucleus not only upon metal load but also upon oxidative stress, heat shock, low pH, inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, and serum factors. Additionally, we find that MTF-1 has a functional NES that is sensitive to LMB and mediates subcellular localization and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the nuclear accumulation of MTF-1 per se does not result in transcriptional activation via MRE sequences, indicating that nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation functions can be separated. The human MTF-1 expression vector was described previously (21Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). An 11-mer VSV epitope from vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (22Soldati T. Perriard J.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 277-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was inserted at amino acid position 744 in the C-terminal end. The NES and NLS mutants (designated MTF-1NESmut and LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV, respectively) were created by site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides used were as follows (the sense strand is shown; lowercase letters represent mutated nucleotides): (a) NESmut, 5′-GGATACAAATCACTCACTTTGTgcAAGTGACgctAGCgcTgcGTCCACAGATTCTG-3′; (b) NES′mut, 5′-CCACAGGAAATTCAGCATCTgcATCTgcTCCAgcTGTAgcGCAACCTGGCCTCTCCG-3′; (c) LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV, 5′-gcagtcggaatgtccGgaaacACTaCtGaTagaagtaaagcggtacc-3′. mMTI-Luc was constructed by inserting a blunt-ended fragment encompassing the promoter (−727 to −13) region of the mMTI gene (23Glanville N. Durnam D.M. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1981; 292: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) into theSmaI site of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). The NLS (133KRKEVKR139), NES (336LCLSDLSLL344), and NES′ (417LSLPLVLQPGL427) sequences of human MTF-1 were cloned in the HindIII-KpnI sites of double peGFP (peGFP2x), which is located in the C terminus. The peGFP2x vector containing tandemly repeated eGFP coding sequences was a kind gift from Dr. Ulrike Kutay (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland). Adenovirus-transformed human embryonal kidney 293 cells, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells, and SV40-transformed MTF-1−/− embryonic stem cells designated as DKO7 cells (24Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). 293 and U2OS cells were plated onto coverslips in 6-well tissue culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS 16 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 2 μg/well plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method. Sixteen h after transfection, cells were washed and incubated for another 24 h in the medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were switched to the medium in which serum was replaced by 0.5% BSA (DMEM-BSA). After 24 h in the serum-limited condition, the treatments were initiated as indicated. To monitor redistribution of MTF-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after zinc or cadmium withdrawal, cells were pretreated with 100 μmZnCl2 or 60 μm CdCl2 for 1 h and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and three times with DMEM-BSA. Further incubations were performed in DMEM-BSA as indicated. For treatment of cells with low pH, the pH of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA was adjusted by the addition of HCl from pH ∼7.4 to pH 6.0. This pH remained stable throughout the experiment. For fixation, cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. After blocking nonspecific binding by incubation in 5% newborn calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, the cells were incubated with anti-VSV antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:250 in 5% newborn calf serum at room temperature for 30 min. After rinsing, cells were incubated with fluorescein-coupled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in 5% newborn calf serum at room temperature for 1 h. After three washings, nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.001 mg/ml) for 2 min, and cells were imaged by using a Reichert-Jung Polyvar upright fluorescence microscope equipped with fluorescein filters (excitation, 475–495 nm; emission, 520–560 nm), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filters (excitation, 330–380 nm; emission, 420 nm/long pass), and Nomarski optics. Images were recorded through a ×40 objective (oil immersion) and collected on an 8-bit charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu C 5405) online to an Apple Macintosh computer, as described previously (26Greber U.F. Suomalainen M. Stidwill R.P. Boucke K. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5998-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Digital images were processed using photoshop software (Adobe). Multiple fields were examined to count at least 200 positive cells, and localizations of MTF-1 were classsified as nuclear, cytoplasmic, and both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Mean and S.D. values of the number of cells showing nuclear, cytoplasmic, and both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of MTF-1 were derived from three independent experiments, each sampling about 200 different cells. 293 cells plated on coverslips were transfected with 2 μg of the eGFP plasmid constructs. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described above. 293 and DKO7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient transfections were carried out in 100-mm tissue culture plates with 5 μg of reporter plasmid, 3 μg of LacZ expression vector, and 5 μg of each MTF-1 expression vector by the calcium phosphate method. 16 h after transfection, the medium was removed, and cells were fed with medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, media were changed to 0.5% BSA-supplemented medium, and cells were serum-starved in that medium by incubation for another 24 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (27Ausubel F.M. Roger B. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). The results were normalized to the LacZ expression from the cotransfected reference gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (6Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed by incubating 2–5 fmol of an end-labeled, 31-base pair-long oligonucleotide containing a strong MRE consensus sequence (MRE-s), with nuclear extracts obtained according to the protocol of Schreiber et al. (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, 2 pmol of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture before the addition of the extracts. To determine the effects of zinc and cadmium on the intracellular localization of MTF-1, 293 (adenovirus-transformed human embryonal kidney) cells and U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding a VSV-tagged MTF-1. This allowed for easy identification of functional MTF-1 (data not shown). 24 h after serum deprivation, subcellular localization of the MTF-1-VSV fusion protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Under normal growth conditions in serum-containing cell culture medium, a considerable fraction of MTF-1 localizes to the nucleus (Ref. 24Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar; data not shown). Here, we have addressed this point and find that MTF-1 stays almost exclusively in the cytoplasm in serum-starved 293 cells (Fig. 1A). In U2OS cells, however, the fluorescence signal of tagged MTF-1 was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1B). Exposure of the cells to 200 μm zinc chloride (ZnCl2) (Fig.1, C and D) or 60 μm cadmium chloride (CdCl2) (Fig. 1, E and F) for 1 h resulted in a striking nuclear accumulation of MTF-1 in both 293 and U2OS cells. In addition, the treatment of 293 cells with heat shock (43 °C, 1 h), H2O2 (800 μm, 3 h), low pH (pH 6.0, 1 h), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, 3 h), and serum factors (10% FBS, 3 h) caused nuclear translocation of MTF-1 (Fig.2A). The calculated percentages of nuclear accumulation upon each different treatment are shown in Fig. 2B. The cells were also treated with substances that induce nuclear translocation of other transcription factors: tumor necrosis factor α (50 ng/ml, 1 h) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (100 ng/ml, 1 h), which activate nuclear factor κB by inducing the nuclear translocation of RelA (29Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and sorbitol (400 mm, 1 h) which is known to stimulate the nuclear translocation of signal transducer- activators of transcription in mammalian cells (30Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Häusinger D. Kerr I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and HOG1 mitogen-activated protein kinase in yeast (31Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 19: 5606-5614Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar); however, these treatments did not induce any obvious change in the subcellular localization of MTF-1 (data not shown). This indicates that the nuclear translocation of MTF-1 in response to stress conditions is a specific property of this transcription factor.Figure 2Heat shock and other stress conditions also induce nuclear import of MTF-1. Subcellular localization of MTF-1-VSV exposed to various stress conditions was examined. 293 cells transiently transfected with MTF-1-VSV were treated with heat (43 °C, 1 h), hydrogen peroxide (800 μm, 3 h), low pH (pH 6.0, 1 h), serum (10% dialyzed FBS, 3 h), and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, 3 h) (A). Control cells were processed in parallel as described in the Fig. 1 legend, and MTF-1 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 20 μm.B, about 200 MTF-1-positive cells were counted to quantify nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution of MTF-1, and the results were classified as exclusively cytoplasmic (C), exclusively nuclear (N), and both cytoplasmic and nuclear (C+N). The mean values of cells with exclusively nuclear MTF-1 were calculated from three different experiments using ∼200 cells, with the corresponding S.D. (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding VSV-tagged human MTF-1 were treated with different concentrations of zinc chloride or cadmium chloride, and MTF-1 localization was analyzed at several time points by indirect immunofluorescence staining. Rapid translocation of MTF-1-VSV was obtained at 100 μm zinc chloride, with a half-maximal nuclear transport time (t 1/2) of 23 min (Fig.3A). Nuclear translocation was nearly complete after 30 min of exposure. A higher zinc concentration (200 μm) had little accelerating effect (Fig.3A). Similarly, increasing concentrations of cadmium decreased t 1/2 from 25 min (40 μm) to 21 min (120 μm cadmium chloride) (Fig.3B). Human MTF-1 contains near the first zinc finger the motif (133KRKEVKR139) that fits the consensus of a classical NLS sequence. To evaluate the contribution to nuclear accumulation of this motif, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to replace the three basic amino acids Lys133-Arg134-Lys135 with Leu-Leu-Ile (Fig. 4). The mutated protein (LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV) was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm of resting cells. Nevertheless, when the LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV-expressing cells were treated with either 200 μm zinc chloride or 60 μmcadmium chloride for 1 h, 72% of the transfected cells had fluorescent nuclei (Fig. 5A). However, the kinetics of nuclear localization upon zinc treatment was delayed, with a pronounced extension of the initial lag phase (Fig.5B). The most pronounced difference was observed in a short-term incubation (30 min) with 200 μm zinc chloride in which 75% of the cells transfected with wild type MTF-1 showed nuclear staining, but only 6.5% of the cells contained nuclear NLS-mutated MTF-1. At 60 min of zinc treatment, this difference had almost leveled out in that wild type and mutant MTF-1 were localized in the nucleus in 90.5% and 72% of the cells, respectively. Thus, it was not unexpected to find only marginal differences in metallothionein promoter activation by wild type compared with NLS mutant MTF-1, as measured during a 3-h time period. In these experiments, the first time point with clearly elevated reporter gene transcripts was 2.5 h after stress induction for both wild type and NLS mutant (Fig. 5C). However, a strong effect of the NLS mutant was observed in other stress conditions. Translocation of NLS mutant MTF-1 to the nucleus by administration of hydrogen peroxide, low pH, cycloheximide, and serum factors was severely impaired, reaching only about 10% of wild type MTF-1 levels, even after extended incubation times of up to 4 h (data not shown).Figure 5Nuclear accumulation of MTF-1 in response to zinc or cadmium is delayed by mutations in the NLS-like basic amino acid cluster. 293 and MTF-1-negative DKO7 cells were transfected with either the expression plasmids coding for MTF-1-VSV or the LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV. 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for another 24 h and treated with zinc for the indicated times. LLI(133–135)MTF-1-VSV-expressing 293 cells were either untreated or treated with 200 μmZnCl2 for 1 h and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (A). Scale bar, 20 μm. The kinetics of zinc-induced nuclear import of the wild type or the NLS mutant MTF-1 was determined in 293 cells (B). After treatment with 200 μm ZnCl2 for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 180 min, cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. The percentages of the cells showing exclusively nuclear staining from three independent experiments are presented graphically with the S.D. The kinetics of zinc-induced transcriptional activity of the wild type and the NLS mutant MTF-1 was analyzed by luciferase assay using a natural mouse metallothionein I promoter as a reporter in 293 cells (C). After treatment with 200 μmZnCl2 for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h, cells were harvested and processed for luciferase assays. Results were normalized to cotransfected β-galactosidase activity. The data from the three independent experiments are shown with the S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To define the mechanism(s) responsible for the steady-state cytoplasmic retention of MTF-1, we decided to use LMB, a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export protein CRM1 (19Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 32Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Upon LMB treatment of MTF-1 transfected cells for 3 h, 63 ± 6% of the transfected cells showed nuclear accumulation (Fig.6). The shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was detectable within 30 min of LMB administration and was nearly complete after 6 h (data not shown). Treatment with LMB at 4 °C did not cause any nuclear MTF-1 accumulation (data not shown). To test the effect of LMB on the metal-induced nuclear accumulation of MTF-1, 293 cells were pretreated with 10 ng/ml LMB for 15 min and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of 200 μm zinc chloride or 60 μm cadmium chloride. As expected for an export blocker, simultaneous treatments with LMB and heavy metals did not impair the nuclear import of MTF-1 (data not shown). Examination of the sequence of human MTF-1 revealed two candidate NES sequences (tentatively designated NES and NES′),336LCLSDLSLL344 (NES) and417LSLPLVLQPGL427 (NES′), respectively (Fig.4). The putative MTF-1 NES motifs are similar in sequence to the well-established leucine-rich NES sequences in other proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus Rev (18Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), protein kinase A inhibitor (16Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (17Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Fig.7). This figure also shows a comparison to MTF-1 NES candidate motifs from three different species (human, mouse, and Japanese puffer fish (Fugu rubripes)). To determine whether the putative NES sequences are functional, we generated three human MTF-1 mutants in which the four most critical leucine residues in either NES, NES′, or both were replaced by alanines (MTF-1NESmut, MTF-1NES′mut, and MTF-1NESNES′mut, respectively) (Fig. 4). VSV-tagged versions of these mutants were transfected into 293 cells in parallel to wild type MTF-1. The subcellular distribution of each protein was determined by indirect immunofluorescence staining. The wild type MTF-1 and the MTF-1NES′mut localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of serum-starved cells. In contrast, MTF-1NESmut and MTF-1NESNES′mut localized to the nucleus, with 92 ± 3% nuclear staining (the remaining cells showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence) (Fig. 8). These data indicate that NES but not NES′ is required for efficient cytoplasmic localization of MTF-1.Figure 8Cytoplasmic localization of MTF-1 requires nuclear export mediated by NES but not by NES′. 293 cells were transfected with the expression vectors encoding MTF-1 wild type, NESmut, NES′mut, or NESNES′mut proteins. After 24 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with 200 μm ZnCl2 for 1 h and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the activities of the NLS and NES sequences of MTF-1 are transferable to another protein, we transfected the NLS- or NES-eGFP2x constructs into 293 cells and observed their localizations 24 h after transfection. The tandem duplication of GFP protein is suitable for such studies because it apparently distributes almost equally to cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.9A). In agreement with a role in nuclear export for the NES motif, NES-eGFP2x was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9C). By contrast, the NLS and NES′ sequences of MTF-1 did not change the cellular localization of the double GFP protein (Fig. 9, Band E versus A). To test for a possible involvement of CRM1 in the MTF-1 nuclear export, we analyzed the effect of leptomycin B on the subcellular localization of NES-eGFP2x fusion proteins in 293 cells. Treatmen"

Here, we establish tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) levels as an important factor controlling the extent of metacyclogenesis. H4B levels decline substantially during normal development, and genetic or nutritional manipulations showed that low H4B caused elevated metacyclogenesis. Mutants lacking pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) had low levels of H4B, remained infectious to mice, and induced larger cutaneous lesions (hypervirulence). Thus, the control of pteridine metabolism has relevance to the mechanism of Leishmania differentiation and the limitation of virulence during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2063216482,"The PDZ1 domain of the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) binds with nanomolar affinity to the carboxyl-terminal sequence QDTRL of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and plays a central role in the cellular localization and physiological regulation of this chloride channel. The crystal structure of human NHERF PDZ1 bound to the carboxyl-terminal peptide QDTRL has been determined at 1.7-Å resolution. The structure reveals the specificity and affinity determinants of the PDZ1-CFTR interaction and provides insights into carboxyl-terminal leucine recognition by class I PDZ domains. The peptide ligand inserts into the PDZ1 binding pocket forming an additional antiparallel β-strand to the PDZ1 β-sheet, and an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions stabilize the complex. Remarkably, the guanido group of arginine at position −1 of the CFTR peptide forms two salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds with PDZ1 residues Glu43 and Asn22, respectively, providing the structural basis for the contribution of the penultimate amino acid of the peptide ligand to the affinity of the interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1996648954,"AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT), a peptide from the G domain of the laminin α1 chain, has diverse biological activities with different cell types. The heparan sulfate side chains of syndecan-1 on human salivary gland cells were previously identified as the cell surface ligand for AG73. We used homologous peptides from the other laminin α-chains (A2G73–A5G73) to determine whether the bioactivity of the AG73 sequence is conserved. Human salivary gland cells and a mouse melanoma cell line (B16F10) both bind to the peptides, but cell attachment was inhibited by glycosaminoglycans, modified heparin, and sized heparin fragments in a cell type-specific manner. In other assays, AG73, but not the homologous peptides, inhibited branching morphogenesis of salivary glands and B16F10 network formation on Matrigel. We identified residues critical for AG73 bioactivity using peptides with amino acid substitutions and truncations. Fewer residues were critical for inhibiting branching morphogenesis (XKXLXVXXXIRT) than those required to inhibit B16F10 network formation on Matrigel (N-terminal XXRLQVQLSIRT). In addition, surface plasmon resonance analysis identified the C-terminal IRT of the sequence to be important for heparin binding. Structure-based sequence alignment predicts AG73 in a β-sheet with the N-terminal K (Lys2) and the C-terminal R (Arg10) on the surface of the G domain. In conclusion, we have determined that differences in cell surface glycosaminoglycans and differences in the amino acids in AG73 recognized by cells modulate the biological activity of the peptide and provide a mechanism to explain its cell-specific activities.

Modifications of the GAG side chains provide structural heterogeneity and a basis for the exquisite specificity of its interactions (1Perrimon N. Bernfield M.

Heparin is used to study GAG interactions with cells and is the most negatively charged GAG, whereas heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfates are the biological GAG ligands present on epithelial cell surfaces. The sulfation patterns of GAGs vary in different sites, cells, and tissues and at various times in development, allowing for protein- and cell-specific interactions (5Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E.

For example, extensive studies on the role of heparin and fibroblast growth factor receptor function have revealed important size and sulfation requirements of heparin for different tissue-specific FGF-mediated biological activities (8Pye D.A.

Laminins are a family of heparin-binding, biologically active glycoproteins found in basement membranes. Currently, there are five α, three β, and three γ chains, which form 15 different heterotrimers (11Libby R.T. Champliaud M.F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D.

Laminin isoforms are present at different times during development with tissue-specific expression patterns. Cell type-specific interactions between laminin isoforms and multiple integrins and heparan sulfate-containing receptors provide mechanisms for regulating the broad range of biological activities of laminins (13Woods A.

Recent data from our laboratory with B16F10 cells suggest a similar AG73 receptor, with related but different GAG side chains. 2J. A. Engbring, unpublished data. Here, we compare the activity of AG73 with the homologous sequences in the other laminin α-chains (A2G73–A5G73, TableI) to determine whether the active sequence is specific to the α1 chain. We show that cell type-specific interactions with the peptides involve different GAGs. We identify the amino acids in AG73 that mediate its specific biological activity in different assays. Our data indicate that cell-specific activities of AG73 are mediated by interactions with cell surface GAGs and that specific amino acids in AG73 modulate different biological activities in a cell-specific manner.Table ISummary table of resultsIdentical (medium shading) and conserved (light shading) residues in the AG73 homologs from the other laminin α-chains are highlighted.

Cancer. 1981; 48: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12), containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). B16F10, a mouse melanoma cell line (31Fidler I.J. Gersten D.M. Hart I.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1978; 28: 149-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), was cultured in DMEM containing minimal essential medium with nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Both cell types were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. All peptides were manually synthesized using the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid-phase strategy with a C-terminal amide form and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (32Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Song S.Y. Ponce M.L. Hoffman M.P. Powell S.K. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32198-32205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The peptide-resin beads were also synthesized as described previously (25Nomizu M. Kuratomi Y. Malinda K.M. Song S.Y. Miyoshi K. Otaka A. Powell S.K. Hoffman M.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32491-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell attachment to peptide beads was assayed in 48-well dishes. The dishes and peptide beads were blocked with 3% BSA in DMEM/F-12 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with 0.1% BSA in DMEM/F-12, 3.0 × 104cells were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The beads were washed, stained with DiffQuik (Baxter, Miami, FL), and photographed. Peptides were coated onto round-bottomed 96-well plates (Immulon 2B, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) by either drying overnight in 50 μl of distilled H2O or by incubating in 50 μl of PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then blocked with 3% BSA in DMEM/F-12 for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with 0.1% BSA in DMEM/F-12. 3.5 × 104 HSG cells in 100 μl of 0.1% BSA in DMEM/F-12 or 3.0 × 104 B16F10 cells in 50 μl of 0.1% BSA in DMEM were added per well for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was gently removed from the wells, and the cells were stained with crystal violet for 10 min. After washing twice with water, the cells were lysed with 50 μl of 10% SDS and the optical density (600 nm) measured. Peptide-coated plates, prepared as above, were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Biotinylated, sized heparin (Heparin-BH with an average mass of 12.5 kDa, Celsus Laboratories, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), 20 ng/well in 0.1% BSA in PBS, was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The heparin was gently removed, the plate was washed twice with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and the bound biotinylated heparin was detected with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Pierce). After incubation with the enzyme substrate, the optical density was measured at 405 nm. Initial dose-response experiments with biotinylated heparin binding to a fixed amount of peptide determined that 20 ng/well resulted in 50% of the maximal binding detected with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. GAGs, modified heparin, and heparin fragments were added to the cell attachment assay. GAGs (5 μg/ml) were incubated with the peptide-coated wells for 15 min, and then the cells were added. Heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A, B, and C, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid (Sigma), de-N-sulfated-N-acetylated heparin (DNSNAc), completely desulfated-N-acetylated heparin (CDSNAc), and completely desulfated-N-sulfated heparin (CDSNS) (Seikagaku, Rockville, MD) were used. Sized heparin fragments (a gift from Dr. A. Marolewski, RepliGen Corp., Needham, MA) were prepared by alkaline depolymerization of heparin with an average mass of 5 kDa, (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) that was fractionated on a Sephadex G50 column using ammonium bicarbonate buffer (33Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fractions were dried and weighed. Size was determined by gradient electrophoresis with comparison to known standards that had been prepared by capillary electrophoresis (34Desai U.R. Wang H. Ampofo S.A. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell attachment by competition with peptides was used to determine IC50 values of competitor peptides. Decreasing amounts of substrate peptides AG73–A5G73 were used to determine the amount of peptide coating resulting in half-maximal cell attachment. The cells were preincubated in solution with different amounts of the competitor peptide for 10 min at 37 °C. Then the cells and competitor peptide were added to the wells, and cell attachment was quantitated as above. HSG and B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 was also competed with a series of peptides containing amino acid substitutions and truncations. The amount of peptide used to compete was the same as the amount of AG73 used to compete itself. B16F10 cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were cultured in serum-free DMEM with 200 μg/ml peptides in 48-well flat-bottomed plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) coated with 133 μl of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). After 18 h, the cells were fixed, stained with DiffQuik, and photographed. Submandibular/sublingual salivary gland rudiments dissected from embryonic day 13 (E13) ICR mice were cultured on Whatman Nucleopore Track-etch filters (13 mm, 0.1-μm pore size, VWR, Buffalo Grove, IL) at the air/medium interface. The filters were floated on 240 μl of DMEM/F-12 in 50-mm glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). The medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 150 μg/ml vitamin C, and 50 μg/ml transferrin. Six E13 gland rudiments were cultured on each filter at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Glands were photographed after ∼1, 24, and 48 h, and the number of end buds was counted at each time point. Various peptide concentrations (26Kadoya Y. Nomizu M. Sorokin L.M. Yamashina S. Yamada Y. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were added to the medium at the beginning of the experiment. Biotinylated, sized heparin (Heparin BH, Celsus Laboratories Inc., Cincinnati, OH) was prepared by oxidative cleavage with periodate, and the terminal aldehyde at the reducing end of the heparin was labeled with biotin hydrazide. Thus, the heparin would attach by its reducing end when immobilized to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (Sensor Chip SA, BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Heparin attached to a sensor ship by the reducing end interacted more with protein than if attached at its midpoint (35Caldwell E.E. Andreasen A.M. Blietz M.A. Serrahn J.N. VanderNoot V. Park Y., Yu, G. Linhardt R.J. Weiler J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The heparin, at 40 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20 was immobilized on the sensor chip at 10 μl/min for 4 min to an immobilization level of 300 resonance units. Peptides (20 μm in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) were injected on the heparin-coated surface at 30 μl/min in a BIA-core™ 1000 instrument. The association rates (ka ) and dissociation rates (kd ) were registered (2 min each), and theKD was calculated from the equationKD=kd /ka . The streptavidin-heparin surface was regenerated between each run by two successive injections of 30 μl of 20 mm NaOH containing 1m NaCl. In control experiments, the peptides were run over a blank streptavidin chip. The sensorgrams were analyzed by non-linear least square curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 software assuming single-site association and dissociation models. AG73 was mapped on the crystal structure of the α2 LG5 module (Protein Data Bank code 1qu0) using the RasMol program (36Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The AG73 sequence aligns to Gly2955–Thr2966 of the α2 sequence. Resin beads with peptides synthesized directly on the beads were initially used to compare HSG cell attachment to AG73 and to the homologous sequences from the other laminin α-chains. Cell attachment after 2 h to AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 was greater than to A4G73 and A5G73 (Fig. 1 A). AG73T, a scrambled version of AG73, showed no cell attachment activity. Different amounts of peptides were then dried onto 96-well plates, and HSG and B16F10 cell attachment was compared. Both cell types bound to the AG73 homologues but not to AG73T. For both cell types, the relative amount of cell attachment activity of the peptides was similar: AG73 > A3G73 > A2G73 > A5G73 > A4G73 (Fig. 1, Band C). These data demonstrate that homologues of the laminin α1 chain peptide AG73 are active for cell attachment, to varying degrees, when coated on culture plates. The specificity of HSG and B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 was determined by competing attachment with the other homologous peptides. Increasing amounts of peptides in solution were added to both HSG and B16F10 cell attachment assays to AG73, and the IC50for each peptide was determined (TableII). AG73 inhibited HSG and B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 with IC50 values of 15 and 27 μg/ml, respectively, and A2G73 inhibited HSG and B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 with IC50 values of 24 and 119 μg/ml, respectively. A3G73 inhibited HSG and B16F10 cell attachment with IC50values of 13 and 277 μg/ml, respectively. However, A4G73 (IC50 > 400 μg/ml for both cell lines) could not inhibit HSG or B16F10 cell attachment to AG73, and A5G73 could not inhibit B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 but could compete HSG cell attachment with an IC50 of 241 μg/ml. These data show that HSG cell attachment to AG73 can be inhibited by AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 with similar IC50 values, suggesting they recognize a similar receptor. In contrast, B16F10 cell attachment to AG73 is more specific, in that A2G73, A3G73, A4G73, and A5G73 do not compete cell attachment with an IC50 similar to that for AG73 and may bind with lower affinity or recognize different cell surface receptors.Table IIIC50 values of competitor peptides (μg/ml) during HSG and B16F10 cell adhesion to AG73Competitor peptideAG73A2G73A3G73A4G73A5G73HSG cells152413>400241B16F10 cells27119277>400>400 Open table in a new tab We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assay to investigate heparin binding to the peptides. Biotinylated, sized heparin (12.5 kDa) was incubated in peptide-coated 96-well plates and detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. The biotinylated heparin also inhibited HSG cell attachment to the peptides (data not shown). The biotinylated heparin bound in a saturable, dose-dependent manner to AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 with KD values (50% maximal binding) all in the nanogram range: 38 ng for A3G73, 107 ng for A2G73, and 121 ng for AG73 (Fig.2). Biotinylated heparin bound to A4G73 and A5G73 with KD values in the microgram range, 4.4 μg for A4G73 and 21 μg for A5G73. AG73T showed some heparin binding when >30 μg of peptide/well were used, suggesting nonspecific trapping of heparin occurred at these doses. Thus, biotinylated heparin binding to the peptides follows a similar pattern of activity as the cell attachment to the peptides, in that AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 are more active than A4G73 and A5G73, although A3G73 binds to heparin with a higher affinity than AG73. Interestingly, different GAGs inhibited HSG and B16F10 cell attachment to the peptides, suggesting cell type-specific interactions with the peptides (Fig. 3). Various amounts of the GAGs were used to inhibit cell attachment to the peptides (data not shown). The concentration shown (5 μg/ml) highlights the differences (Fig. 3, A and B). HSG cell attachment to all five peptides was inhibited by heparin. Although cell attachment to A3G73 was only inhibited ∼50% by the dose shown, it was completely inhibited at higher doses. HSG cell attachment to the peptides was inhibited by heparan sulfate, with the exception of attachment to A3G73, which was not inhibited even at higher doses. Chondroitin sulfate B inhibited HSG cell attachment to A4G73 and A5G73, and DNSNAc inhibited cell attachment to A5G73. Thus, cell attachment to A4G73 and A5G73 is inhibited by less sulfated GAGs. HSG cell attachment to the AG73 homologues was not inhibited by less sulfated GAGs, such as chondroitin sulfate-A and -C, keratan sulfate, CDSNAc, or CDSNS. B16F10 cell attachment to the peptides was inhibited with different GAGs than HSG cells (Fig. 3 B). Generally, B16F10 cell attachment was inhibited by less sulfated GAGs, including chondroitin sulfate B. Heparin and heparan sulfate inhibited B16F10 cell attachment to the AG73 homologues. Chondroitin sulfate B and DNSNAc heparin inhibited cell attachment to AG73, A4G73, and A5G73, but not to A2G73 and A3G73. Thus, a more sulfated region on the GAG mediates cell attachment to A2G73 and A3G73 and a less sulfated region not requiring an N-sulfate mediates cell attachment to AG73, A4G73, and A5G73. CDSNS heparin inhibited attachment to AG73, suggesting the interaction between B16F10 cells and AG73 requires only one sulfate/disaccharide. Chondroitin sulfates A and C and CDSNAc heparin did not inhibit cell attachment to any of the peptides. Taken together, these data indicate that different GAGs or similar GAGs with different patterns of sulfation potentially mediate the interactions between HSG and B16F10 cells with the peptides. A2G73 and A3G73 may bind to regions of higher sulfation than AG73, and A4G73 and A5G73 may bind to less sulfated regions or to chondroitin sulfate. The interaction of heparin with growth factors and their receptors is dependent on a critical size and sulfation pattern of the heparin chain (37Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The inhibition of HSG cell attachment to the laminin peptides was also dependent on oligosaccharide size. Heparin oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 10 saccharides (dp10) inhibited HSG cell attachment to AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 by ∼50%, to A4G73 by ∼90%, and to A5G73 by ∼75% (Fig.4 A). Heparin oligosaccharides with dp12 inhibited HSG cell attachment to AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 by 60–70% and to A4G73 and A5G73 by 90%. HSG cell attachment to A4G73 was also inhibited ∼85% by an oligosaccharide with dp8. The trend was similar for B16F10 cell attachment; heparin oligosaccharides with dp10 inhibited B16F10 cell attachment to AG73, A3G73, A4G73, and A5G73 by >50% but only inhibited cell attachment to A2G73 by ∼25% (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, B16F10 cell attachment to A2G73 was not inhibited with dp20. Taken together with Fig. 3, the data further indicate that different types of cell surface GAGs may recognize the peptides with different sized areas of charge distribution or sulfation patterns. In cell attachment and heparin binding assays, AG73, A2G73, and A3G73 gave similar, although not identical results, suggesting they may bind a similar receptor. Therefore, we compared their biological activities in more complex assays. When E13 mouse embryonic salivary gland rudiments are cultured on filters, they undergo branching morphogenesis. When the homologous peptides from the other laminin α-chains were added to the assay, they had no inhibitory effect on branching (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, AG73 activity is specific; even though the other peptides compete HSG cell attachment to AG73-coated wells in a more complex assay, they do not have the same activity as AG73. When B16F10 cells are cultured on basement membrane (Matrigel), they form networks within 18 h. These cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are important in the invasive phenotype exhibited by malignant tumor cells on Matrigel (38Kramer R.H. Bensch K.G. Wong J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1980-1989PubMed Google Scholar). When the peptides were added to this assay, only AG73 inhibited network formation and the cells grew as a monolayer (Fig. 5 B). Thus, AG73 was able to competitively inhibit specific cell-matrix interactions that the other peptides could not. Although the five homologous peptides are similar, based on the number of identical and conserved residues in their sequences (TableI), our data suggest that there are specific residues or motifs in AG73 that are responsible for its biological activity.

Although human umbilical vein endothelial cells express little CEACAM receptor in vitro, we found neisserial infection to induce expression of CEACAM1, CEACAM1-3L, and CECAM1-4L splice variants. This mediates an increased Opa52-dependent binding of gonococci by these cells. The induced receptor expression did not require bacterial Opa expression, but it was more rapid with adherent bacteria. Because the time course of induction was similar to that seen for induced proinflammatory cytokines, we tested whether CEACAM1 expression could be controlled by a similar mechanism. Gonococcal infection activated a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) heterodimer consisting of p50 and p65, and inhibitors that prevent the nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB complex inhibited CEACAM1 transcript expression. Each of these effects could be mimicked by using culture filtrates or purified lipopolysaccharide instead of intact bacteria. Together, our results support a model whereby the outer membrane “blebs” that are actively released by gonococci trigger a Toll-like receptor-4-dependent activation of NF-κB, which up-regulates the expression of CEACAM1 to allow Opa52-mediated neisserial binding. The regulation of CEACAM1 expression by NF-κB also implies a broader role for this receptor in the general inflammatory response to infection.

Initial contact with host tissues is thought to be mediated by neisserial type IV pili, and a tight secondary interaction can then be established by the bacteria's phase-variable, colony opacity-associated (Opa)1 outer membrane proteins. There are two distinct classes of Opa proteins based on their differential binding specificity for cellular receptors. One class targets the Neisseriae to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptors (1Chen T. Belland R.J. Wilson J. Swanson J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2van Putten J.P. Paul S.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2144-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and, via binding to the extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and fibronectin, to cell surface integrins (3Dehio M. Gomez-Duarte O.G. Dehio C. Meyer T.F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Duensing T.D. van Putten J.P. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 964-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other Opa proteins bind to the CD66 epitope-containing members of thecarcinoembryonic antigen-relatedcellular adhesion molecules (CEACAM), which are expressed differentially on multiple tissues throughout the human host (5Prall F. Nollau P. Neumaier M. Haubeck H.D. Drzeniek Z. Helmchen U. Loning T. Wagener C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Some Opa proteins interact with both HSPG and CEACAM receptors (7Chen T. Grunert F. Medina-Marino A. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Virji M. Evans D. Hadfield A. Grunert F. Teixeira A.M. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 538-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), presumably via distinct binding sites; however, each variant appears to be able to mediate host cellular invasion only via either one or the other receptor class (9Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). CEACAM1 (previously called BGP or CD66a; new nomenclature for this and other CEA family members was introduced by Beauchemin et al.(42Beauchemin N. Drabert P. Dveksler G. Gold P. Gray-Owen S.D. Grunert F. Hammarstrom S. Holmes K.V. Karlsson A. Kuroki M. Lin S.-H. Lucka L. Naijar M. Neumaier M. Obrink B. Shively J.E. Skubitz K.M. Stanners C.P. Thomas P. Thompson J.A. Virji M. von Kleist S. Wagener C. Watt S. Zimmermann W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar)), CEACAM3 (CGM1 or CD66d), CEACAM5 (CEA or CD66e), and CEACAM6 (NCA or CD66c) can all serve as receptors for the pathogenicNeisseria spp.; however, individual Opa variants are specific for various combinations of these closely related proteins (7Chen T. Grunert F. Medina-Marino A. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1557-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Virji M. Evans D. Hadfield A. Grunert F. Teixeira A.M. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 538-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 10Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The closely related receptors CEACAM4, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 are not bound by any Opa variants tested to date (16Popp A. Dehio C. Grunert F. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each CEACAM receptor consists of an immunoglobulin variable domain-like region followed by up to six immunoglobulin constant domain-like structures (6Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 are inserted into the cellular membrane via a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain, whereas CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 possess glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. Even though each receptor is highly glycosylated, binding is a protein-protein interaction with Opa proteins recognizing CEACAM residues exposed on the GFCC′ face of the amino-terminal domain (17Billker O. Popp A. Gray-Owen S.D. Meyer T.F. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 258-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These different binding specificities may have important implications for the pathogenic process ofNeisseria because the distribution pattern of each CEACAM receptor should influence the cellular tropism of neisserial strains expressing different Opa variants in vivo. In addition, very different cellular processes have been linked to individual CEA family members (6Thompson J.A. Grunert F. Zimmermann W. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 344-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 18Kuijpers T.W. Hoogerwerf M. van der Laan L.J. Nagel G. van der Schoot L.E. Grunert F. Roos D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cellular response to neisserial binding depends upon the specific combination of CEACAM receptors engaged. Even though CEACAM receptors are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily, their functions are poorly understood. They mediate intercellular adhesion via both homotypic (CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6) and/or heterotypic (CEACAM5-CEACAM6 and CEACAM6-CEACAM8) interactions (22Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 23Oikawa S. Inuzuka C. Kuroki M. Arakawa F. Matsuoka Y. Kosaki G. Nakazato H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CEACAM1 and CEACAM6 are also involved in the adherence of activated neutrophils to cytokine-activated endothelial cells, both directly through their ability to present the sialylated Lewisx antigen to E-selectin and indirectly by the CEACAM6-stimulated activation of CD18 integrins (18Kuijpers T.W. Hoogerwerf M. van der Laan L.J. Nagel G. van der Schoot L.E. Grunert F. Roos D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The role of CEACAM receptors is not, however, restricted to simple anchorage to adjacent cells because various receptors can influence cell cycle control and cellular differentiation. For example, CEACAM1 expression inhibits the proliferation of mouse colonic carcinoma cells bothin vitro and in vivo, and this effect was abrogated by deleting the receptor's cytoplasmic domain (24Kunath T. Ordonez-Garcia C. Turbide C. Beauchemin N. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2375-2382PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hsieh J.T. Luo W. Song W. Wang Y. Kleinerman D.I. Van N.T. Lin S.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 190-197PubMed Google Scholar). Such a growth-inhibitory role is consistent with clinical observations that CEACAM1 expression is down-regulated in various colonic carcinomas (26Neumaier M. Paululat S. Chan A. Matthaes P. Wagener C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10744-10748Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 27Kleinerman D.I. Troncoso P. Lin S.H. Pisters L.L. Sherwood E.R. Brooks T. von Eschenback A.C. Hsieh J.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1215-1220PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these features imply a role for members of the CEACAM receptor family as sensory and regulatory molecules in cell-cell adhesion events (28Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM6 are expressed by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils and can mediate gonococcal binding and opsonin-independent phagocytosis by these phagocytes (10Virji M. Makepeace K. Ferguson D.J. Watt S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Chen T. Gotschlich E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14851-14856Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Gray-Owen S.D. Dehio C. Haude A. Grunert F. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 29Hauck C.R. Lorenzen D. Saas J. Meyer T.F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1863-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction appears to play a central role in the pathogenic process because a urethral exudate consisting primarily of polymorphonuclear neutrophils associated with both extracellular and intracellular attached gonococci is the hallmark of gonorrhea. CEACAM receptors expressed by other cells also appear to play an important role during other stages of neisserial infection. Polarized T84 epithelial cells express CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 on their apical surface, and Opa binding to these receptors mediates bacterial uptake, cellular transcytosis, and release at the basolateral surface (30Wang J. Gray-Owen S.D. Knorre A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous findings that N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis appear in the subepithelial layers following the in vitro infection of organ cultures (31McGee Z.A. Stephens D.S. Hoffman L.H. Schlech W.F. Horn R.G. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: S708-S714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both of these pathogens can also cause invasive disease, interactions with the endothelia must also occur. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown in culture express little CEACAM receptor. There is, however, a substantial up-regulation of CEACAM1 expression after treatment with the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (13Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Majuri M.L. Hakkarainen M. Paavonen T. Renkonen R. APMIS. 1994; 102: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is present in serum at high levels during invasive meningococcal disease (33Waage A. Halstensen A. Espevik T. Lancet. 1987; 1: 355-357Abstract PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). This increased up-regulation of CEACAM1 correlates with an increased adherence and invasion of different Opa-expressing bacteria into these cells in vitro (13Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that prolonged infection of HUVECs resulted in an increased binding of gonococci expressing the CEACAM receptor-specific Opa52 adhesin. We have shown previously that N. gonorrhoeae infection induces TNF-α expression by epithelial cells (36Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). If a similar response occurs during neisserial infection of endothelial cells, then these bacteria could presumably induce an autocrine loop that results in the expression of CEACAM1. We thus determined the kinetics of CEACAM1 expression pattern after neisserial infection and related these to the induced cytokine profile. We demonstrate that the CEACAM1-4L andCECAM1-3L splice variants are both induced with a time course similar to that of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. Our results indicate that the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) directly triggers CEACAM1 expression and mediates increased Opa-dependent bacterial binding to HUVECs. This phenomenon could clearly contribute to neisserial attachment to and penetration into the vasculature during invasive disease. It also has broad implications for our understanding of the natural role of CEACAM1 because its regulation by the immune regulator factor NF-κB implies a role in the innate response of endothelial cells to infection. This represents the first example that we are aware of in which a human pathogen directly induces the expression of its receptor by a target host cell. HUVECs were obtained from human umbilical vein by chymotrypsin digestion as described previously (37Dehio C. Meyer M. Berger J. Schwarz H. Lanz C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2141-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then grown in low serum endothelial cell growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) using flasks precoated with 0.2% gelatin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HUVECs at passage 4 were grown to form a confluent monolayer and then seeded to new precoated flasks or into wells containing gelatin-coated glass coverslips to obtain a confluence of about 60%. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) were cultured in MCDB-131 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and used between passages 4 and 5. Construction of the recombinant strains invariantly synthesizing the 11 genetically defined Opa proteins ofN. gonorrhoeae MS11 were described previously by Kupschet al. (9Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cloned opa genes were expressed in the genetic background of the MS11 derivative N279, which lacks pili and carries a deletion in the epithelial cell invasion-associated opaC30 locus. Daily subculture of all strains was carried out using a binocular microscope to select for desired Opa phenotypes. Opa protein expression patterns were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis of total bacterial extracts using the monoclonal antibody 4B12C11 (38Achtman M. Neibert M. Crowe B.A. Strittmatter W. Kusecek B. Weyse E. Walsh M.J. Slawig B. Morelli G. Moll A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 507-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which was generously provided by Dr. Mark Achtman (Berlin, Germany). Recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing N. meningitidis Opa variants were also described previously (15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For infection experiments, HUVECs were seeded into 75-cm2flasks to obtain cultures at about 70% confluence at the time of infection. One night before infection, the medium was changed to M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Gonococci were harvested from fresh overnight cultures into M199 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum to obtain a culture density of 108 colony-forming units/ml and then used to infect HUVECs at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20 bacteria/cell for the indicated time points. For immunofluorescence analysis, HUVECs were infected as outlined above except that cells were initially seeded onto gelatin-coated 12-mm glass coverslips, and the samples were fixed after the final washing step postinfection by incubating in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in 200 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. To determine the levels of gonococcal adherence and invasion, the gonococci were stained for immunofluorescence and then analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described previously (15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Gray-Owen S.D. Knorre A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Where indicated, various other stimuli were added directly to the culture medium. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems. Where indicated, purified mouse anti-human TNF-α monoclonal antibodies (BD PharMingen, San Diego) were added at 15 μg/ml just prior to infection. The polyclonal anti-human CEACAM antiserum was puchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Experiments involving LPS were done using LPS prepared from E. coli serotype O111:B4 and/orSalmonella typhimurium by phenol extraction (Sigma). LPS suspensions were sonicated in endotoxin-free water (Life Technologies, Inc.) to disperse any aggregates formed and were then diluted to the indicated final concentration in supplemented medium. Neisserial LPS was purified according to the method of Galanos et al.(62Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) and was generously provided by Dr. Anne Muller from our group (Berlin). CEACAM1 protein expression in response to exposure to bacterial strains, TNF-α, or other stimuli was determined by immunoblot analysis of total cellular protein essentially as described before (15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein concentration in each sample was determined by colorimetric Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10–11%) and blotted onto Immobilon P transfer membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed using the CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 cross-specific monoclonal antibody D14HD11, the CEACAM6-specific antibody 9A6 (Immunotech, Marseille, France), and the CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 cross-specific antibody 4/3/17. D14HD11 and 4/3/17 were both generously provided by Dr. Fritz Grunert, University of Freiburg, Germany. Bound antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To test for IκBα degradation, cytosolic fractions obtained from HUVECs exposed to various stimuli were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an IκBα-specific polyclonal antibody that does not cross-reactive with other IκB family members (C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NF-κB SN50 (BIOMOL Research laboratories, Inc.) is a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits the translocation of active NF-κB complex into the nucleus. Cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml of this peptide for 15 min at 37 °C before TNF-α or the bacteria were added. To confirm the role of NF-κB in CEACAM1 expression, two other inhibitors with different mechanisms of action were also used. The cells were pretreated either with the serine protease inhibitor tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK; Sigma) or a proteasome inhibitor (PSI) obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. (U. K.) for 30 min before addition of the stimuli. To inhibit phosphorylation-dependent steps involved in the activation of NF-κB, HUVECs seeded in 75-cm2 flasks were either not pretreated or were pretreated with 1 μmherbimycin A for 24 h or 100 mm genistein for 1 h and then either infected with N309 or stimulated with TNF-α. The effects of these inhibitors on CEACAM1 expression levels were then determined as indicated. Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs that had been treated with various stimuli, as indicated, using either Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or the Qiagen RNEasy Kit, as outlined by the manufacturers, and then treated further with RNase-free DNase-I. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using Superscript IIRT (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) primers. As a control, the synthesis of cDNA was performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Subsequent amplification of CEACAM1 was carried out using CEACAM1-specific primers for 30 cycles at 56 °C annealing temperature. The differential amplification of CEACAM1 splice variants was performed using Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 33 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 °C. The primers used were 5′-primer B1 (ACAGTCAAGACGATCATAGT) and 3′-primer C2 (ATCTTGTTAGGTGGGTCATT), resulting in amplified fragments of between 189 and 530 bp (39Kammerer R. Hahn S. Singer B.B. Luo J.S. von Kleist S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Amplification of cytokine DNA was done using the primers that we have described previously (36Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To detect Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, PCR amplification of the cDNA template was performed using Taq polymerase for 28 cycles at 95 °C for 40 s, 54 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR primers used for TLR-2 were GCCAAAGTCTCTTGATTGATTCC and TTGAAGTTCTCCAGCTCCTG, and those used for TLR-4 were TGGATACGTTTCCTTATAAG and GAAATGGAGGCACCCCTTC (40Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Mancinelli R. Xu X.P. Jin Y. Faure E. Mantovani A. Rothe M. Muzio M. Arditi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7611-7614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Depending on which primer sets were used for the primary amplification, primers specific for the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene GAPDH or β-actin was also included within the reaction mixture to provide an internal control that allowed samples to be loaded equally. In each case, PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. At the indicated time points after infection, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared by using the non-ionic detergent method described previously (36Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays for the detection of active NF-κB complex were performed using an Igκ oligonucleotide that had been labeled using the large fragment DNA polymerase (Klenow) in the presence of deoxy-[α-32P]ATP. The DNA binding reactions were performed in 20 μl of binding buffer for 20 min at 30 °C. Competition experiments and supershift assays were performed with antibodies as described previously (36Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Meyer T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel using 12.5 mm Tris, 12.5 mm boric acid, and 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, and the gels were then dried and exposed to Amersham TM films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. Previously, we had found very little CEACAM1 receptor expression by HUVECs unless they were prestimulated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Other members of the CEA receptor family were not found in either unstimulated or stimulated HUVECs. Consistent with this, N. gonorrhoeae or recombinant E. coli expressing either gonococcal or meningococcal CEACAM-specific Opa proteins showed only low levels of binding to HUVECs using standard (i.e. 3 h) in vitro infection assays unless the HUVECs were pretreated with TNF-α (13Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Muenzner P. Dehio C. Fujiwara T. Achtman M. Meyer T.F. Gray-Owen S.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, we found that extended infection resulted in consistently increasing levels of Opa-mediated bacterial binding to otherwise unstimulated HUVECs, and this correlated with an increased level of bacterial internalization (Fig. 1 A). To demonstrate that the increased binding was caused by interactions with CEACAM receptor(s), HUVECs were pretreated with polyclonal anti-CEACAM antibody prior to infection. This treatment blocked interaction with the HUVECs almost completely, and the increased bacteria binding with time was no longer evident (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether these increased interactions could result from increased CEACAM receptor expression, we performed immunoblot analysis of cellular lysates prepared at various intervals after infection. The HUVECs were either left untreated, infected with various gonococcal strains, or stimulated with TNF-α as a positive control. Expression of the CEACAM1 protein was found to be induced during neisserial infection, and the time course of this induction was similar to that seen when stimulating the cells with purified TNF-α (Fig.2 A). No other CEACAM family member(s) were detected in either stimulated or unstimulated cells. The rapid induction of CEACAM1 expression after infection was also confirmed by FACS analysis (data not shown) and by semiquantitative RT-PCR to detect CEACAM1-encoding transcript (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, N. gonorrhoeae strains expressing either the HSPG receptor-specific Opa50 or the CEACAM receptor-specific Opa52, and the nonadherent Opa− strain N302 induced CEACAM1 expression (Fig. 2,A and B). This implies that this effect was not likely the result of a specific signal directly downstream of Opa binding to one of its cellular receptors. We generally observed increased levels of three defined protein bands by immunoblot analysis using the CEACAM receptor-specific monoclonal antibody D14HD11 (Fig.2 A) and have confirmed that all three bands represent the CEACAM1 receptor by comparing blots probed with various CEACAM-specific antibodies (data not shown). This banding pattern likely results from a combination of the variable glycosylation of CEACAM1 and/or the expression of multiple splice variants because the relative levels of each of these can vary among cells and cell lines (41Hefta S.A. Paxton R.J. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8618-8626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 13 different CEACAM1 splice variants are known to exist. To analyze which splice variant(s) are induced in endothelial cells, we performed RT-PCR experiments with RNA from unstimulated, TNF-α-treated, and gonococcal-infected HUVECs. The primer pair used amplifies the mRNA fragment that spans from the middle of the Ig constant domain-like B1 region to the carboxyl-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain. Using these primers, it is possible to discriminate among known splice variants according to the size of the RT-PCR products (39Kammerer R. Hahn S. Singer B.B. Luo J.S. von Kleist S. Eur. J.

However, a subset of papillomaviruses, the “high risk” HPVs, cause lesions that can progress to carcinomas. Inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) are produced by cells in response to a viral infection. To determine the effects of TNF-α and TRAIL on keratinocytes expressing the high risk HPV-16 oncoprotein E7, human foreskin keratinocytes stably expressing E7 were treated with TNF-α and TRAIL. Treatment with TNF-α alone, but not TRAIL, induced growth arrest and differentiation in keratinocytes that was almost completely overcome by expression of HPV-16 E7. Both cytokines induced apoptosis when administered in combination with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but the apoptotic response to TRAIL was significantly more rapid and efficient compared with the response seen after TNF-α treatment. HPV-16 E7-expressing keratinocytes were more prone to both TNF-α- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis compared with vector-infected controls.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5019s-5022sPubMed Google Scholar). Infection with a member of this large family of viruses usually causes papillomatous hyperplasia (warts) but lesions caused by a subset of these viruses, the “high risk” HPVs (such as HPV-16, -18, -31, or -33) have a propensity for malignant progression. Although the link between HPVs, cervical cancer, and other anogenital tract carcinomas is most firmly established (2zur Hausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F55-F78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar), there is also evidence linking HPV infection to carcinomas of oral and respiratory mucosa (3Sugerman P.B. Shillitoe E.J. Oral Dis. 1997; 3: 130-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During malignant progression, the HPV genome frequently integrates into the host DNA resulting in the expression of only two viral proteins, E6 and E7, that bind and induce the degradation of the p53 and pRB tumor suppressor proteins, respectively (4Dyson N. Howley P.M. Munger K. Harlow E. Science. 1989; 243: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar, 5Münger K. Werness B.A. Dyson N. Phelps W.C. Harlow E. Howley P.M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4620-4624PubMed Google Scholar). An important function of pRB is to modulate the activity of members of the E2F family of transcription factors that play important roles in regulating the G1/S-phase transition (9Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2576) Google Scholar, 10Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). Degradation of pRB by E7 abrogates this regulatory circuit and relaxes G1/S checkpoint control (11Jones D.L. Munger K. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). E6 promotes the proteasomal degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, rendering the cell unable to efficiently execute a program of growth arrest and apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress, DNA damage, or aberrant growth signals (10Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar, 12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The loss of cellular surveillance function permits replication of damaged DNA, resulting in the accumulation of cells with genomic aberrations and increasing the likelihood of neoplastic changes (13Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Viral infection of an immunocompetent host induces the production and release of cytokines, powerful mediators of inflammation produced by fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, and keratinocytes themselves (14Kondo S. Sauder D.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). TNF-α is one of the main mediators of inflammation in the skin and mucosa, the first barrier encountered by an epitheliotropic virus (14Kondo S. Sauder D.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). TNF-α and its related cytokines bind to specific members of the TNF receptor superfamily initiating various signaling pathways that lead to growth arrest, proliferation, or cell death (15Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4526) Google Scholar). The cellular response to a cytokine depends upon the specific ligand-receptor interaction, the cell type, and the immediate cellular microenvironment (16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). TNF-R1 contains four cysteine-rich extracellular domains that become trimerized upon TNF-α binding (16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Ligation of this receptor approximates and cross-links intracellular death domains that then bind the death-domain-containing adapter proteins TRADD and FADD. Oligomerization of these proteins results in caspase activation and apoptosis (17Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

In addition, TNF-R1 can simultaneously activate protective responses via NF-κB-dependent and -independent gene transcription and protein synthesis (19Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F. Moretti F.

A recently identified member of the TNF family of cytokines, TRAIL has not been as extensively studied, and its effects on keratinocytes are largely unknown. Found in a wide range of tissues, TRAIL (also known as Apo-2 ligand) is a type II transmembrane protein closely homologous to Fas ligand, TNF-α, and lymphotoxin-β (21Wiley S.R. Schooley K.

Like other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, the cytoplasmic domains of TRAIL receptors 1 and 2 are believed to interact with the death-domain-containing adapter molecules TRADD and FADD to transmit a death signal.

To determine the effects of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and TRAIL on the natural host cell of human papillomaviruses, the genital keratinocyte, retroviruses expressing the HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoprotein were used to infect HFKs. These cells were treated with cytokines with and without the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. TNF-α alone induced growth arrest and differentiation in control HFKs but not in HFKs expressing HPV-16 E7. HFKs expressing E6 or dominant negative p53 also arrested in the presence of TNF-α, indicating that TNF-α-induced cytostasis is p53-independent and can be overcome by E7. In contrast, TRAIL alone did not inhibit proliferation, suggesting a basic difference in the way these cytokines and their corresponding receptors transmit intracellular signals. As in many other cell types, apoptosis could be induced in cytokine-treated HFKs only with the concurrent administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. TRAIL treatment induced apoptosis more rapidly and efficiently than TNF-α and expression of the HPV-16 E7 protein potentiated the cytotoxicity of both TNF-α and TRAIL. Primary HFKs were prepared from a pool of several neonatal foreskins obtained after routine circumcision, following the protocol of Rheinwald and Beckett (39Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (Keratinocyte-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.). IMR-90 fibroblasts were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2383-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were prepared using the protocols of Miller and Rosman (43Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-982PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were infected with viral supernatants for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma Chemical Co.). The viral supernatant was removed, and the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. HFKs were maintained in normal keratinocyte growth medium for the first 24 h after infection and then selected for 2 days in keratinocyte growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Subconfluent plates of HFKs were treated with the indicated concentrations of TNF-α (R&D Systems), TRAIL (Alexis), or agonistic Fas antibody (Clone DX 2.1, R&D Systems) for the indicated periods of time. Fresh media containing the appropriate cytokine was added to the cultures for each day where the treatment extended past 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from a subconfluent plate of HFKs using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). A 5-μg aliquot was reverse-transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England BioLabs), and the resulting cDNA was combined with 5 pm of each primer pair and PCR Supermix (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. A polymerase chain reaction was carried out for 35 cycles (95 °C melting temperature for 1 min; 55 °C annealing temperature for 1 min; 72 °C extension temperature for 1 min). The nucleotide sequences for the PCR primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) have been described previously (44Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in EBC lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm NaF and 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad assay. 100 μg of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate antibodies. The antibodies used were as follows: TRAIL-R1 (Alexis, 210-730-C100); TRAIL-R2 (Imgenex, IMG-120); TRAIL-R3 (Alexis, 210-744-R100); TRAIL-R4 (Imgenex, IMG-121); p53 (Ab-6, Oncogene Science); p21 (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products); transglutaminase (Ab-II, Neomarkers); actin (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products); phospho-Akt (Thr-308, New England BioLabs). Proteins were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and quantitation was performed with National Institutes of Health IMAGE software. Equal numbers of HFKs, as determined by a cell counter (Coulter), were aliquoted into 35-mm plates and treated with the appropriate cytokines. At each time point, the cells were trypsinized in equal volumes of trypsin/EDTA and quantified. Cells were trypsinized and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma), as described previously (45Thompson D.A. Belinsky G. Chang T.H.-T. Jones D.L. Schlegel R. Münger K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3025-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Keratinocytes growing on 35-mm tissue culture plates were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or TRAIL and 30 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). The cells were stained with 1 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258, Sigma) and apoptotic nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (41Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Munger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 500 cells were counted per sample. Although it has been previously reported that TNF-α treatment causes a cytostatic effect in HFKs (46Symington F.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 798-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Detmar M. Orfanos C.E. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1990; 282: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Pillai S.

J. Dermatol. 1990; 17: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), little is known about the effects of TRAIL on HFK growth. Therefore, HFKs were grown with or without 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml TNF-α or TRAIL, and the cells were counted at regular intervals. As previously reported, TNF-α treatment of control HFKs had a strong cytostatic effect (Fig.1 a). FACS analysis revealed that TNF-α-treated cells were mostly arrested in G0/G1 (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, treatment with 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml TRAIL (Fig. 1 a) or 1 or 10 μg/ml agonistic Fas antibody (data not shown) did not affect HFK growth. To eliminate the possibility that the lack of growth arrest in response to TRAIL treatment was due to the failure of TRAIL receptor signaling, an immunoblot for the phosphorylated, active form of c-Akt was performed. c-Akt is a cell survival factor that is phosphorylated by the phosphatidylinositol 3′-OH kinase in response to ligation of surface receptors such as those for platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and TNF-α (50Datta S.R.

HFKs incubated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or TRAIL showed strong c-Akt phosphorylation 2 min after addition of the cytokine to the media, indicating that TRAIL signaling is intact (Fig. 1 b). To determine whether the cytostatic effect is not only specific for TNF-α but also keratinocyte-specific, IMR-90 normal human diploid lung fibroblasts were treated with 10 or 25 ng/ml TNF-α. No growth inhibition was observed in these cells (Fig. 1 c). HPV-16 E7 can interact with pRB and accelerate its degradation, an effect closely correlated with transformation (5Münger K. Werness B.A. Dyson N. Phelps W.C. Harlow E. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 41Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Munger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine if HPV 16 E7 expression could interfere with TNF-α-mediated growth arrest. Therefore, HPV 16 E7-expressing HFKs were grown with or without 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml TNF-α or TRAIL, and the cells were counted at regular intervals. The growth of HPV-16 E7-expressing HFKs was not significantly inhibited at any concentration of TNF-α (Fig. 2 a). HFKs stably expressing the transformation-defective HPV-16 E7 mutants 16E7 ΔP6-E10, which can bind but not degrade pRB, and 16E7 ΔD21-C24, which can neither bind nor degrade pRB (41Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Munger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), were unable to overcome TNF-α-induced growth arrest (Fig. 2 b). To further test whether inactivation of pRB is linked to abrogation of TNF-α-mediated growth arrest, we tested SV40 large tumor antigen, which can also interact with and inactivate pRB (54DeCaprio J.A. Ludlow J.W. Figge J. Shew J.Y. Huang C.M. Lee W.H. Marsilio E. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1988; 54: 275-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Like HPV-16 E7-expressing cells, HFKs stably expressing SV40 large tumor antigen were resistant to TNF-α-mediated growth arrest at all concentrations of TNF-α (Fig. 2 c, left panel). In contrast, HFKs expressing a non-transforming pRB binding-deficient SV40 large tumor antigen mutant (T107) remained sensitive to TNF-α-mediated growth arrest (Fig. 2 c,right panel). Hence, the ability of a viral oncoprotein to overcome the TNF-α-mediated growth arrest correlates with pRB inactivation and cellular transformation. In HPV-infected cells the E7 protein is co-expressed with E6, which targets p53, an important mediator of growth arrest, for proteasomal degradation (7Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar). To determine if p53 mediates the TNF-α cytostatic effect, HFKs were infected with a retrovirus expressing either the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein or a dominant negative form of p53 (55Gottlieb E. Haffner R. von Ruden T. Wagner E.F. Oren M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1368-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). p53 protein levels were then analyzed by an immunoblot. Cells expressing HPV-16 E6 contained very low p53 levels, presumably due to E6-mediated protein degradation (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, p53 levels were increased in cells expressing the dominant negative mutant, which binds and stabilizes endogenous p53 (Fig.3 a). Cells expressing either E6 or dominant negative p53 underwent growth arrest when incubated with TNF-α (Fig.3 b). This indicates that the TNF-α-induced cytostatic effect is not mediated by p53. The TNF-α cytostatic effect in keratinocytes may be related to differentiation (48Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Elias P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 816-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 49Kono T. Tanii T. Furukawa M. Mizuno N. Taniguchi S. Ishii M. Hamada T. J. Dermatol. 1990; 17: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore examined HFKs treated with TNF-α for transglutaminase, a late marker of keratinocyte differentiation (56George M.D. Vollberg T.M. Floyd E.E. Stein J.P. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11098-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Transglutaminase expression increased in response to TNF-α in LXSN- and E6-expressing cells but not in E7-expressing cells (Fig. 4 a). This demonstrates that the growth inhibitory activity of TNF-α correlates with induction of differentiation in human keratinocytes and can be resisted by cells expressing HPV-16 E7. Because the cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 plays an important role in coupling growth arrest and differentiation in human and murine keratinocytes in response to Ca2+ (40Jones D.L. Alani R.M. Munger K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 58Missero C. Calautti E. Eckner R. Chin J. Tsai L.H. Livingston D.M. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carcinog. 1998; 23: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we probed the same blot for p21Cip1/Waf1. There was an increase of p21Cip1/Waf1 protein in LXSN-, E7-, and E6-infected HFKs (Fig. 4 a). Although p21Cip1/Waf1 levels increased in E7 populations, this may be due to the ability of E7 to bind and stabilize p21Cip1/Waf1 (60Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Suh-Burgmann E. Grace M. Munger K. Virology. 1999; 258: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which may contribute to the ability of E7-expressing cells to overcome arrest (40Jones D.L. Alani R.M. Munger K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 61Funk J.O. Waga S. Harry J.B. Espling E. Stillman B. Galloway D.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). To further examine whether growth arrest and differentiation were specific for TNF-α, we treated HFKs with TRAIL. As expected, TRAIL treatment, which does not cause growth arrest, did not increase transglutaminase levels (Fig. 4 b). Because TNF-α and TRAIL differentially affected keratinocyte proliferation, we wanted to investigate the effects of these cytokines on apoptosis. In many cell types, TNF-α or TRAIL induces an apoptotic response only when new protein synthesis is suppressed by treatment with cycloheximide. HFKs were therefore treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or TRAIL, along with 30 μg/ml cycloheximide. Under these conditions, TRAIL caused a rapid and strong apoptotic response whereas the apoptotic response to TNF-α treatment of keratinocytes was less pronounced (Fig.5 a). Importantly, however, expression of E7 enhanced HFK apoptosis 2-fold for TNF-α treatment and almost 4-fold for TRAIL treatment (Fig. 5 b). It has been reported that the relative abundance of TRAIL receptors, in particular the anti-apoptotic decoy receptors TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4, may contribute to the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (26Marsters S.A.

To determine if TRAIL receptors R1 through R4 are present in HFKs, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using keratinocyte mRNA as a template. Signals for TRAIL receptors R1, R2, R3, and R4 were detected in HFKs (Fig. 6 a). Next, we performed immunoblots on LXSN and E7 HFK extracts. These results corroborated the results of the reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments showing expression of these four receptors and demonstrated that they are present at similar levels in both LX- and E7-expressing cells (Fig.6 b).

Proper regulation of RetGC-1 is essential in photoreceptor cells for normal light adaptation and recovery to the dark state. In this study we show that cGMP synthesis by RetGC-1 requires dimerization, because critical functions in the catalytic site must be provided by each of the two polypeptide chains of the dimer. We also show that an intact α-helical coiled-coil structure is required to provide dimerization strength for the catalytic domain of RetGC-1. However, the dimerization strength of this domain must be precisely optimized for proper regulation by GCAP-1. We found that Arg838 within the dimerization domain establishes the Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC-1 by determining the strength of the coiled-coil interaction. Arg838 substitutions dominantly enhance cGMP synthesis even at the highest Ca2+ concentrations that occur in normal dark-adapted photoreceptor cells. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Arg838 substitutions disrupt a small network of salt bridges to allow an abnormal extension of coiled-coil structure. Substitutions at Arg838 were first identified by linkage to the retinal degenerative disease, autosomal dominant cone rod dystrophy (adCORD). Consistent with the characteristics of this disease, the Arg838-substituted RetGC-1 mutants exhibit a dominant biochemical phenotype. We propose that accelerated cGMP synthesis in humans with adCORD is the primary cause of cone-rod degeneration.

Guanylyl cyclase is stimulated by the lowered [Ca2+] to synthesize cGMP and enhance photoreceptor cell recovery and light adaptation. There are two forms of photoreceptor cell membrane guanylyl cyclases in humans, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2. Immunofluorescence studies suggest that RetGC-1 is primarily expressed in cones and to a lesser extent in rods (3Dizhoor A.M. Lowe D.G. Olshevskaya E.V. Laura R.P. Hurley J.B.

Mutations in the RetGC-1 gene have been linked to Leber congenital amourosis, a severe retinopathy inherited in an autosomal recessive mode (5Perrault I. Rozet J.M. Calvas P. Gerber S. Camuzat A.

RetGC-1 belongs to the membrane GC1 family that includes natriuretic peptide receptor-GCs (NPR-A/GC-A and NPR-B/GC-B), heat stable enterotoxin (StaR/GC-C), and sea urchin sperm GCs (6Shyjan A.W. de Sauvage F.J.

Each member of the membrane GC family is a type I transmembrane protein that has an extracellular domain linked by a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular catalytic domain. In contrast to most other membrane GCs that are stimulated by the binding of a ligand to extracellular domain, RetGC-1 is stimulated intracellularly by a Ca2+-binding protein, GCAP- 1 (3Dizhoor A.M.

Both GCAP-1 and a related protein, GCAP-2, have four EF-hand-like domains, including three functional EF-hands that bind Ca2+. At low levels of Ca2+, the Ca2+-free form of GCAP-1 activates photoreceptor cell membrane guanylyl cyclase, but at high (∼1 µm) Ca2+ concentrations, the Ca2+-bound form of GCAP-1 inhibits it. This mechanism of regulation was established by demonstrating that mutations that prevent Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands turn GCAPs into constitutive activators of photoreceptor cell membrane guanylyl cyclases (11Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W.

Therefore, the effect of Ca2+ on photoreceptor cell membrane guanylyl cyclases is mediated solely through Ca2+binding to the GCAP protein and not through a direct interaction of Ca2+ with the cyclase. This type of Ca2+-sensitive regulation of photoreceptor cell membrane guanylyl activity by GCAPs occurs both with photoreceptor cell homogenates and with recombinant RetGC-1 expressed in HEK-293 or COS-7 cell lines (9Gorczyca W.A.

Several lines of evidence suggest that membrane guanylyl cyclases function as dimers. A recent report showed that the structure of the extracellular domain of NPR-A is a dimer (15van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and modeling studies of guanylyl cyclases based on the known structure of adenylyl cyclases suggest that the catalytic domains function as dimers (16Liu Y.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15547-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also suggested that dimerization of RetGC-1 may be an essential step in regulation by GCAPs. A putative coiled-coil structure that is near the catalytic domains of all membrane GCs enhances dimerization of GC-A (22Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The α-helical coiled-coil is the most widespread subunit oligomerization motif found in proteins (23Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). However, the role of the coiled-coil domain in regulation of RetGC-1 has not been previously established. Recent genetic linkage studies have shown that mutations at the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain of RetGC-1 cause a form of autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (adCORD), a human disease in which cones and then rods degenerate (24Weigell-Weber M. Fokstuen S. Torok B. Niemeyer G. Schinzel A. Hergersberg M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2000; 118: 300Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Gregory-Evans K. Kelsell R.E. Gregory-Evans C.Y. Downes S.M.

Moore A.T. Hunt D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Those studies identified four independent mutations in RetGC-1 linked to adCORD. Each of them involves a substitution at Arg838, highlighting the critical role of this residue. We showed previously that one of these mutations, R838C, alters the Ca2+ sensitivity of GCAP-1-stimulated RetGC-1 activity (27Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9039-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we report additional biochemical and structural analysis of this and other Arg838 mutations. Surprisingly, our analyses reveal that Arg838 may be part of a critical network of salt bridges that normally destabilizes the active state of the cyclase. Arg838 substitutions disrupt this network. Consequently, the coiled-coil structure is extended in the mutant enzymes resulting in abnormally enhanced stability of the dimerized catalytic domain. In other words, the normal molecular interactions within this structure are in fact not optimized for maximum extension and stability of the coiled-coil, and instead Arg838 represents a stop signal for dimerization. Thus, the coiled-coil domain of RetGC-1 appears to be fine-tuned for optimal regulation by physiological concentrations of Ca2+. λKH54, λimm21, and the Escherichia coli strain AG1688 were kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Hu (Texas A&M University). AG1688, which carries the lacI q gene for maintaining low expression level of the fusion protein, was used to assess immunity to the tester phage λKH54. λKH54 carries a deletion of cI repressor. λimm21 contains a substitution of the immunity region of lambda such that lambda repressor is not able to repress its growth. The E. coli strain XL-1 blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for cloning of the plasmids. E. coli strains used in this study were grown routinely in Luria broth (LB) (28Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Antibiotics were added to cultures at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 µg ml−1) and kanamycin (30 µg ml−1). All strains were stored at −70 °C in LB containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. HA-tagged RetGC-1 was generated by single-stranded mutagenesis (29Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, single-stranded DNA was made from a plasmid, pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), containing the 1.35-kb XbaI/BamHI N-terminal RetGC-1 fragment. After synthesis of second-strand DNA using the mutant oligonucleotide, a 677-bp HindIII/BstEII fragment containing the HA-tagged GC-1 was used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequence in expression plasmid pRC-CMV RetGC-1. Point mutations were generated using a PCR-based method of primer-directed mutagenesis (27Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (ABI Prizm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The entire RetGC-1 cDNA (3.6 kb) was then excised withHindIII/XbaI and subcloned into expression plasmid pRC-CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A 630-bp fragment containing the human GCAP-1 (hGCAP-1) coding region was amplified from a λgt10 Human Retinal cDNA library (30Nathans J. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) using forward primers,NcoI-hGCAP1 (5′-GGCAAAACCATGGGCAACGTGATGGAGGGAAAG-3′) and reverse primer BamHI-hGCAP1 (5′-CAAACGGGGATCCTCAGCCGGCTGCCTCAGCGGCCTCG-3′). After digestion withNcoI/BamHI, the resulting PCR fragment was cloned into E. coli expression vector pET-21d (Novagen, Madison, WI). hGCAP-1 protein was prepared as described previously (11Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Based on the molecular mass of purified hGCAP-1, as determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we find that 50% of purified hGCAP-1 is myristoylated in these preparations. The human form of GCAP-2 cDNA (hGCAP-2) was also cloned into E. coliexpression vector pET21d. However, the hGCAP-2 protein produced inE. coli did not effectively stimulate the human RetGC-1 we used in our experiments. The expressed hGCAP-2 was functional, because it effectively stimulated human RetGC-2. To obtain measurable activity using GCAP-2, we used bovine GCAP-2, which was slightly more effective than hGCAP-2 at stimulating human RetGC-1. Bovine GCAP-2 protein was prepared as described previously (11Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 4–5 µg of the constructs was transiently transfected into 50–60% confluent HEK-293 cells using Fugene-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (50/50) (Life technologies Inc., Rockville, MD), 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were harvested after 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and removed from dishes by rocking for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and were swollen in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5/5 mm MgCl2/1 mm ATP/5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min on ice. Cells were lysed by passing four times through a 26-gauge needle. The lysates were pelleted at 2000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge to remove large debris and unbroken cells. The supernatant from this spin was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in lysis buffer, frozen on dry ice, and stored as aliquots at −70 °C. Protein content was measured in the presence of 0.1%SDS using Bio-Rad protein reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. HEK-293 membranes containing equal amounts of total membrane protein (40 µg) were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes was were blocked in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. For detection of RetGC-1 protein, membranes were probed using a mix of rabbit polyclonal CAT-Ab (corresponding to Met747-Ser1052 of RetGC-1) and KHD-Ab (corresponding to Met443-Ser746 of RetGC-1) for an hour in blocking buffer (31Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with TTBS, the membrane was probed for 1 h at room temperature with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). After several washes with TTBS, the membrane was developed using chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged RetGC-1 was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-linked Anti-HA (3F10) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Membranes containing equal amounts of total protein were resuspended in GC buffer (100 mm KCl/50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4/7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol/10 mm MgCl2/8 mm NaCl/0.5 mm ATP). All reactions also contained the appropriate Ca2+-EGTA buffers. Measurement of guanylyl cyclase activity was carried out at 30 °C for 20 min as described previously (27Tucker C.L. Woodcock S.C. Kelsell R.E. Ramamurthy V. Hunt D.M. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9039-9044Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Stimulated reactions contained recombinant human GCAP-1 or bovine GCAP-2. Assays measuring Mn2+/Triton X-100 activity contained 1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm MnCl2instead of MgCl2. All experiments shown were repeated at least twice from independent transfections with similar results. Ca2+-EGTA buffers were prepared from solutions of EGTA (Sigma) and EGTA saturated with CaCl2 (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI) by pH titration as described previously (32Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations under the assay conditions were calculated using a multifactor program (33Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and verified by Ca2+ electrode analysis and by titration with Rhod-2 fluorescent dye (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). All repressor chimeric proteins were expressed from a lacUV5 promoter on a pBR322-based plasmid called pJH391 (34Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The wild-type, coil2 (L824S,Y827S) and coil3 (L831S,L834S) RetGC-1 gene were each amplified by PCR from amino acid position 817–844 using pRC-CMV RetGC-1, pRC-CMV L824S,Y827S RetGC-1, and pRC-CMV L831S,L834S RetGC-1 as template, respectively. The oligonucleotide primers used in polymerase chain reaction introduced a unique 5′-SalI restriction site, a 3′-BamHI restriction site, and a stop codon at the C-terminal end. After digestion with SalI andBamHI, the PCR products were ligated into the vector pJH391 to create an in-frame fusion to the N-terminal 117 amino acids of the Lambda phage cI protein, generating plasmids pJH391-DDwt, pJH391-DDcoil2, and pJH-DDcoil3. The negative control, pKH101, expresses only the first 101 amino acids of the DNA binding domain of the lambda repressor. The positive control expresses a fusion between the repressor and the leucine zipper of GCN4 (34Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells expressing different lambda repressor N-terminal fusions were assessed for immunity to λKH54 by cross-streak analysis. λKH54 lysate (∼109 plaque-forming units), prepared as described by Miller (1992), was spread down a corner of a Petri dish, and bacterial colonies were streaked across the phage. Immunity was scored as the ability to grow after contact with the phage on the far side of the streak. A second control phage lysate, λimm21, with different immunity was spread down the Petri dish adjacent to phage λKH54. All strains of bacteria, including those that express oligomeric repressor fusions would be sensitive to λimm21. The purpose of using two different host ranges was to ensure discrimination of cells that are immune because of λ repressor dimerization from cells that have lost the lambda receptor. E. coli (AG1688) expressing different repressor fusions were grown in 3 ml of Luria broth overnight. Cells were harvested, and soluble proteins were extracted with 300 µl of B-Per Bacterial protein extraction reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of total soluble protein (40 µg), as determined by a Bio-Rad assay, were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Lambda repressor-dimerization domain fusions were detected by an affinity-purified DD antibody. The antibody was raised against Met747-Ser1052 catalytic domain of RetGC-1 and affinity-purified using a glutathioneS-transferase dimerization domain (amino acids 817–857) RetGC-1 fusion (31Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described earlier. MD simulations were performed using the program ENCAD (35Levitt M. ENCAD, Computer Program, Energy Calculations and Dynamics. Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA1990Google Scholar). The potential energy function and MD protocols have been described elsewhere (36Levitt M. Hirshberg M. Sharon R. Daggett V. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 215-231Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 37Levitt M. Hirshberg M. Sahron R. Laidig K.E. Daggett V. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 5051-5061Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). An all-atom representation was used for both the protein and solvent. Side-chain protonation states were chosen to represent neutral pH (Lys and Arg residues were positively charged and Asp and Glu were negatively charged). Because a crystal structure is not available for the dimerization domain of RetGC-1, the initial starting structures for the simulations were modeled as parallel coiled-coils spanning residues 823–857. The models were designed to keep the residues in register with respect to sliding along the helix axis while aligning nonpolar and complementary-charged groups at the interface. An antiparallel coiled-coil was also investigated, but complementarity of the residues along the interface was not as good as in the parallel arrangement, resulting in a ∼37 kcal/mol higher (less favorable) potential energy after 1000 steps of in vacuo minimization. Amino acid mutations were made to the minimized parallel structure to yield mutant homodimers: R838C and R838S. The proteins were then each solvated using a box extending at least 8 Å in all directions, resulting in the addition of ∼3870 water molecules. The water density was set to the experimental value at 25 °C of 0.997 g ml−1, and periodic boundary conditions were employed to reduce edge effects. The solvent was then subjected to 1000 cycles of minimization, 2 ps of MD, and another 1000 steps of minimization. This water preparation was followed by 1000 steps of minimization of the protein in the field of the solvent and then 1000 steps of minimization of the full protein-solvent system. After the preparatory steps described above, the system was heated to 25 °C. Each independent simulation was carried out for 5 ns using a 2-fs integration time step (5000 ps, or 2.5 × 106iterations). An 8-Å smooth, nonbonded cutoff was used, and the nonbonded list was updated every 2 cycles; this procedure has been shown to yield stable and reasonable simulations (35Levitt M. ENCAD, Computer Program, Energy Calculations and Dynamics. Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA1990Google Scholar, 36Levitt M. Hirshberg M. Sharon R. Daggett V. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 215-231Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar). 25,000 structures were saved for analysis (5 per ps) from each trajectory. The purpose of this study is to investigate the structural basis by which a coiled-coil dimerization domain plays an essential role in regulation of RetGC-1 by Ca2+. In the first step of our analysis we establish that the catalytic domain of RetGC-1 must form a dimer to synthesize cGMP. We show this by demonstrating that the catalytic site is made up of essential functional groups contributed separately by each polypeptide chain of the dimer. We then demonstrate that the coiled-coil domain is essential to bring the subunits of the catalytic domain together. Finally, we analyze how mutations linked to adCORD alter the Ca2+ sensitivity of cGMP synthesis by affecting the dimerization strength of the coiled-coil domain. Molecular modeling studies based on the structure of adenylyl cyclase suggest that synthesis of cGMP by RetGC-1 requires an intramolecular nucleophilic attack by a deprotonated 3′-hydroxyl of GTP on the α-phosphate (Pα) of GTP (16Liu Y.

A metal ion-A (MgA2+) appears to be involved in the activation of the 3′-OH group (Fig.1 a). This is followed by stabilization of the transition state by two metal ions (MgA2+ and MgB2+) (39Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol.

A recent report of an adenylyl cyclase crystal structure in complex with metal ions conclusively shows that two metal ions bind in the active site (20Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Two highly conserved aspartic acid residues from the catalytic C1a domain of adenylyl cyclase coordinate both metal ions (16Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 20Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

A structure of the RetGC-1 guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain has not yet been determined, but a model for it has been proposed (16Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 43Tucker C.L. Hurley J.H. Miller T.R. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In this model the two metal ions essential for activation and conversion of GTP to cGMP in RetGC-1 are coordinated by aspartates (Asp885 and Asp929) from one subunit of the RetGC homodimer (Fig. 1 a). Residues that interact with the guanine ring appear to be on the opposite subunit (16Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Rao V.D. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This proposed mechanism predicts that dimerization of the cyclase catalytic domains is necessary for cGMP formation. To confirm this dimeric model experimentally, we used two types of RetGC-1 mutations that inactivate separate functions of the catalytic site: 1) We substituted Asp885 and Asp929 with alanine to prevent Mg2+ binding. We then expressed the mutant cyclases in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) and assayed their abilities to produce cGMP from GTP. Both mutants, D885A and D929A failed to synthesize cGMP either in the presence or absence of GCAPs, consistent with the role of these amino acids in coordinating essential metal ions (Fig. 1, b and c). These mutants also were inactive in the presence of Mn2+ and Triton, which constitutively activates normal membrane GCs and has been used to quantitate general catalytic ability (44Pot"

Stopped-flow kinetic studies with trimethylamine as substrate have indicated that mutation of His-172 to Gln reduces the limiting rate constant for flavin reduction ∼10-fold (Basran, J., Sutcliffe, M. J., Hille, R., and Scrutton, N. S. (1999) Biochem. J. 341, 307–314). A kinetic isotope effect (KIE =k H/k D) accompanies flavin reduction by H172Q TMADH, the magnitude of which varies significantly with solution pH. With trimethylamine, flavin reduction by H172Q TMADH is controlled by a single macroscopic ionization (pK a = 6.8 ± 0.1). This ionization is perturbed (pK a = 7.4 ± 0.1) in reactions with perdeuterated trimethylamine and is responsible for the apparent variation in the KIE with solution pH. At pH 9.5, where the functional group controlling flavin reduction is fully ionized, the KIE is independent of temperature in the range 277–297 K, consistent with vibrationally assisted hydrogen tunneling during breakage of the substrate C–H bond. Y169F TMADH is ∼4-fold more compromised than H172Q TMADH for hydrogen transfer, which occurs non-classically. Studies with Y169F TMADH suggest partial thermal excitation of substrate prior to hydrogen tunneling by a vibrationally assisted mechanism.

In the context of vibrationally assisted tunneling mechanisms, major experimental challenges are now presented. These include correlation of (i) protein flexibility with the degree of tunneling (26Kohen A. Klinman J. J. Am. Chem.

Corchado J. Sanchez M. Gao J. Truhlar D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8197-8203Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this work, we have extended our studies of hydrogen tunneling to the iron-sulfur flavoenzyme trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH1; EC 1.5.99.7), which catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of trimethylamine to dimethylamine and formaldehyde (28Steenkamp D.J.

The reaction is initiated by the cleavage of a C–H bond in one of the substrate methyl groups, and the reducing equivalents are transferred to a 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN in the enzyme active site (29Lim L.W.

In this study, we present the first analysis of vibrationally assisted hydrogen tunneling in two mutant forms of TMADH that have compromised rates of flavin reduction and are thus accessible to study by stopped-flow methods. Trimethyl-d 9-amine HCl (99.7% deuterium; chemical purity > 99% as determined by high performance liquid chromatography, NMR, and gas chromatography) was from CK Gas Products Ltd. Titration curves for protiated and deuterated trimethylamine HCl were generated using 20 mmsolutions (5 ml) of each tertiary amine at 19.5 °C. The pH of the solution was measured using a Mettler Toledo Inlab 410 electrode after sequential addition of sodium hydroxide from a concentrated stock (100 mm). All chemicals were of analytical grade where possible. Wild-type TMADH was purified from Methylophilus methylotrophus (sp. W3A1) as described by Steenkamp and Mallinson (28Steenkamp D.J. Mallinson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 429: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but with the modifications of Wilson et al. (39Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The isolation, expression, and purification of H172Q and Y169F TMADH have been described previously (30Basran J.

Stopped-flow experiments with TMADH were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar, 38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol.

For single-wavelength studies, data collected at 443 nm were analyzed using nonlinear least-squares regression analysis on an Acorn RISC PC using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Experiments were performed by mixing TMADH contained in buffer of the desired pH with an equal volume of substrate contained in the same buffer at the desired concentration. The concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of TMADH, thereby ensuring pseudo first-order reaction conditions. Transients at 443 nm were analyzed as monophasic decreases in absorption, consistent with previous studies (38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For each substrate concentration, at least five replica measurements were collected and averaged. The error for individual rates measured by fitting to a single transient was <0.5% in all cases, and the error for the rate fitted to averaged transients was <0.4%. Substrate-reduced TMADH is quite stable to reoxidation by molecular oxygen (half-life of ∼50 min (39Wilson E.K. Mathews F.S. Packman L.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), negating the need to use anaerobic conditions in the kinetic experiments. Reaction scheme modeling for flavin reduction by trimethylamine has been described in detail elsewhere (38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Flavin reduction involves the reversible formation of a Michaelis complex, followed by the C–H bond cleavage/flavin reduction step (Equation 1). E+S⇌k2k1ES→k3EPEquation 1 The observed rate of flavin reduction (v obs) is dependent on substrate concentration, as described by the general hyperbolic expression in Equation 2(41Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vobs=k3[S]K+[S]Equation 2 where K is a constant and equal to (k 2 +k 3)/k 1. As discussed elsewhere (38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in reactions of TMADH with trimethylamine, the reaction is modeled such that k 2 ≫k 3, and K thus approximates to the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant, K d . For multiple-wavelength stopped-flow studies, the reaction was monitored using an Applied Photophysics photodiode array detector and operated using XSCAN software. Analysis of photodiode array data was carried out using PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). TMADH is stable over the temperature range used in the stopped-flow studies. This is evident since the total absorption change for 6-S-cysteinyl-FMN reduction at all temperatures remains constant and is identical to that observed in spectrophotometric titrations of the enzyme with its substrate. Enzyme and substrate were equilibrated for 10 min in the stopped-flow apparatus at the appropriate temperature prior to mixing and the acquisition of stopped-flow data. The optimal time for equilibration was determined empirically. Temperature control was achieved using a thermostatic circulating water bath, and the temperature was monitored directly in the stopped-flow apparatus using a semiconductor sensor (Model LM35CZ, National Semiconductor). In studies of the temperature dependence of bond cleavage, all substrates were used at saturating concentrations (see “Results and Discussion”). Studies of the concentration dependence of bond cleavage at 5 and 35 °C indicated that the value of K in Equation 2 was not substantially perturbed upon changing temperature. These control experiments thus ensured that substrate was saturating at all the temperatures investigated in the temperature dependence studies. Studies of the pH dependence of flavin reduction were conducted at 5 °C. The buffers used were 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0–7.5), 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.0–8.5), 100 mm sodium borate (pH 9.0–10.0), and 100 mmglycine/NaCl (pH 10.5 and 11.0). Previous studies have established that increased ionic strength upon addition of substrate (trimethylammonium chloride) over the range employed in this study does not affect the rate of flavin reduction (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). pH profiles for the kinetic parametersk 3 and K were constructed, and the data were fitted to Equations 3 and 4, respectively, to obtain the relevant pK a values, k3=EH×10(−pH)+E×10(−pKa)10(−pH)+10(−pKa)Equation 3 k3K=Tmax1+10(pKa1−pH)+10(pH−pKa2)Equation 4 where EH and E are the catalytic activities of the protonated and unprotonated forms of the ionization group, respectively; and T max is the theoretical maximal value of k 3/K. Previously, we analyzed the pH dependence of flavin reduction by trimethylamine with H172Q TMADH at 5 °C (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar). This study revealed the presence of a single kinetically influential ionization (pK a = 6.8 ± 0.1) in the enzyme-substrate complex. Similar studies with native TMADH are compromised owing to the very fast flavin reduction rates (>1200 s−1 (38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). We have, however, analyzed the pH dependence of the native enzyme using perdeuterated trimethylamine (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar) since the primary KIE (∼7) upon C–H bond cleavage/flavin reduction allowed us to analyze the full kinetic transient on the stopped-flow time scale. In native TMADH, there are two kinetically influential ionizations in the enzyme-substrate complex, and their origin is of interest from a mechanistic viewpoint. The upper ionization is attributed to the side chain of His-172 (since it is lost in H172Q TMADH (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar)); the lower ionization is as yet unassigned, but it most likely represents the deprotonation of the trimethylammonium cation ((CH3)3NH+) to form trimethylamine base. Deprotonation of the substrate cation is consistent with a mechanism of flavin reduction in which the substrate nitrogen lone pair undergoes nucleophilic addition at the flavin C-4a atom (Fig. 2) (42Trickey P. Basran J. Lian L.-Y. Chen Z.-W. Barton J.D. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This mechanism is analogous to that proposed recently for monoamine oxidase A on the basis of structure-activity relationships withpara-substituted benzylamine analogs (43Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All ionizable groups in the active site of TMADH (His-172 (30Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 307-314PubMed Google Scholar), Tyr-169 (40Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol.

Results are from analysis of Y60F and Y174F TMADH. Kinetic studies with Y60F TMADH, trimethylamine, and perdeuterated trimethylamine indicated that this ionization is perturbed substantially (pK a ∼ 10). This likely reflects the different electronic environment of the substrate imparted by Phe-60 (which directly contacts the substrate by forming an amino-aromatic interaction). and Tyr-60 2) have been mutated without loss of this ionization, thus supporting assignment to the deprotonation of substrate itself in the enzyme-substrate complex. In this study, we have performed an analysis of the pH dependence of flavin reduction in H172Q TMADH using perdeuterated substrate (Fig.1 and TableI). The plot ofk 3 versus solution pH retains the features we reported previously for H172Q TMADH in reactions with trimethylamine as substrate (shown also in Fig. 1 A), but the macroscopic pK a describing the kinetically influential ionization in the enzyme-substrate complex is shifted from 6.8 ± 0.1 (trimethylamine) to 7.4 ± 0.1 (perdeuterated trimethylamine). The isotope dependence of this pK a value is of interest. Although, in the literature, this pK a value has not been attributed formally to a group in the enzyme-substrate complex, as discussed above, the balance of evidence suggests that it represents the deprotonation of the substrate molecule itself ((CH3)3NH+ → (CH3)3N) on moving from low to high pH. It is anticipated that perdeuteration of the substrate will affect this ionization (and see below). (i) the shorter C–D bond results in a larger charge density, and thus, it is electron-supplying (i.e. stabilizing the N–H bond) relative to C–H; and (ii) the perdeuterated substrate has a greater reduced mass for the (CD3)3N–H stretching vibration and therefore lies lower in the asymmetric potential energy well. Thus, the (CH3)3N–H bond dissociates more readily than the (CD3)3N–H bond, accounting for the elevated macroscopic pK a value seen with perdeuterated substrate in our kinetic studies.Table ILimiting rate constants for flavin reduction and enzyme-substrate dissociation constants for the reaction of H172Q TMADH with trimethylamine and perdeuterated trimethylaminepHk 3H 1-aData taken from Ref. 30, except for data at pH 11.K d H 1-aData taken from Ref. 30, except for data at pH 11.k 3DK d DKIEs−1mms−1mm6.05.3 ± 0.9265 ± 660.26 ± 0.04197 ± 4620.4 ± 6.66.519.3 ± 2.0149 ± 271.2 ± 0.1200 ± 2816.1 ± 3.07.040.0 ± 3.474.4 ± 144.0 ± 0.35126 ± 2010 ± 1.77.566.1 ± 2.737.3 ± 3.39.6 ± 0.767 ± 9.06.9 ± 0.88.069.9 ± 6.910.5 ± 3.013.1 ± 0.930.0 ± 3.75.3 ± 0.98.574.8 ± 4.92.3 ± 0.314.7 ± 0.76.4 ± 0.65.1 ± 0.69.070.7 ± 3.30.28 ± 0.0517.2 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.59.574.8 ± 4.90.19 ± 0.0416.2 ± 0.30.44 ± 0.024.6 ± 0.410.073.9 ± 6.20.053 ± 0.00916.3 ± 1.00.28 ± 0.044.5 ± 0.710.578.3 ± 6.20.14 ± 0.0317.0 ± 0.40.14 ± 0.014.6 ± 0.511.069.9 ± 4.30.3 ± 0.0416.5 ± 0.80.31 ± 0.044.2 ± 0.5Experimental errors are those from curve fitting to Equation 2.1-a Data taken from Ref. 30Basran J.

Open table in a new tab Experimental errors are those from curve fitting to Equation 2. The KIE for C–H bond breakage in H172Q TMADH across the pH range is illustrated in Fig. 1 C. Inflated KIE values (>7) are seen in the low pH range. These result from the isotope-dependent, kinetically influential ionization in the enzyme-substrate complex (Fig. 1 A). SchemeFS1 summarizes the prototropic control of flavin reduction in the enzyme-substrate complex. In Scheme FS1, it is assumed that the rate of breakdown of the ES complex toEP is slow relative to the dissociation steps, so the dissociation steps remain in thermodynamic equilibrium. Clearly, as a result of the elevated pK a value seen with perdeuterated substrate, there is a greater concentration of theESH+ (unreactive) complex (i.e. the lower branch of Scheme FS1). The effect of this partitioning betweenES and ESH+ forms of the enzyme-substrate complex is that the observed KIE is inflated over the intrinsic value that would be realized if the concentration of theES species were equivalent (at a given pH value) for both perdeuterated and protiated substrate. Only at pH values of 9.5 and above (where the group identified in the plot ofk 3 versus pH is fully ionized and where the rate of flavin reduction is maximal) is the intrinsic isotope effect realized, owing to the enzyme being in the ES form for both protiated and perdeuterated substrate. In this regime, the KIE approaches a constant value of ∼4.5 (Fig. 1 C and TableI). Fig. 1 B illustrates the plot ofk 3/K versus pH for both protiated and perdeuterated substrate. Again, the general features of the plot are retained for both substrates, indicating that two ionizations in the free enzyme and/or free substrate are kinetically influential. The assignments of the ionizations in thek 3/K plot are unknown. Previously, we hypothesized that the acid limb of the bell-shaped curve might reflect ionization of Tyr-60, which contacts the substrate in the enzyme-substrate complex (38Jang M.-H. Basran J. Scrutton N.S. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13147-13154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, studies with the Y60F mutant now indicate this is not the case since the bell-shaped dependence of the k 3/K plot was still observed in this mutant.2 We also conjectured (again without formal demonstration) that the alkaline limb might represent the deprotonation of trimethylammonium cation when not complexed to the enzyme. This suggestion was made since it was initially thought that the substrate cation was the catalytically active species, whereas based on the isotope evidence presented above, computational studies (42Trickey P. Basran J. Lian L.-Y. Chen Z.-W. Barton J.D. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the mechanism of inactivation of TMADH with phenylhydrazine (42Trickey P. Basran J. Lian L.-Y. Chen Z.-W. Barton J.D.

Chem. 1979; 254: 2684-2688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by analogy with the mechanism proposed for monoamine oxidase A (43Miller J.R. Edmondson D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13670-13683Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it now seems likely that unprotonated substrate is the active species. The pK a value for deprotonation of trimethylammonium cation is ∼9.8, which is close to the values on both the acid and alkaline limbs of the curve generated from fitting to the plot of k 3/K versuspH. It thus seems appropriate to reevaluate the assignments of the two ionizations in the plot of k 3/K versus pH, especially in the light of the proposed mechanism in which a complex between trimethylamine base and enzyme is the catalytically active species (Fig. 2). In such a scenario, it clearly makes more sense for the enzyme to have evolved a higher affinity for trimethylamine base rather than its protonated cation. Improved binding (in terms of K d ) is observed on moving from the acid to alkaline region of the lower (acid) limb of the k 3/K versus pH plot, and this ionization therefore most likely represents deprotonation of the substrate cation. The upper, alkaline limb remains unassigned, but as discussed above, extensive mutagenesis studies have failed to identify a chemical group in the enzyme active site responsible for this ionization; a possible candidate is the N3H position of the flavin isoalloxazine ring (pK a ∼ 10). With H172Q TMADH, the enzyme-substrate dissociation constants measured across the pH range are modestly elevated with perdeuterated trimethylamine relative to protiated substrate (Table I). Again, as discussed above, these small differences are likely related to the different chemical properties of the (CD3)3N–H and (CH3)3N–H bonds, which will affect the pK a for the ionization of the cationic form of the substrate (pK a for (CH3)3N–H = 9.8 and pK a for (CD3)3N–H ="

Thus, selected polyanionic molecules endowed with the capacity to affect HIV life cycle at different levels can be exploited for the development of novel “multitarget” anti-AIDS drugs. The heparin analog xylanopolyhydrogensulfate (pentosan polysulfate, PPS) prevents the interaction of HIV-1 with target cells (19Schols D. Pauwels R. Desmyter J. De Clercq E.

To assess this possibility, as a part of a long-term project aimed to identify polyanionic multitarget HIV-Tat antagonists (9Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A.

The results demonstrate that PPS binds Tat and prevents its interaction with heparin. Accordingly, PPS inhibits cell surface interaction and internalization of extracellular Tat causing the inhibition of HIV-LTR-transactivating activity, mitogenic capacity, and angiogenic potential of the protein. These observations identify PPS as a prototypic molecule for the design of novel multitarget drugs for the treatment of AIDS and AIDS-associated pathologies. Recombinant HIV-1 Tat (86-amino acid isoform) was expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein (9Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A.

Fluorescein-labeled bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) was kindly provided by Prof. S. Marchesini (University of Brescia, Italy). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to measure changes in refractive index caused by the capacity of free PPS to bind GST·Tat and prevent its interaction with heparin immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip (26Sadir R.

To this purpose, size-defined heparin (9 kDa) was biotinylated on its reducing end, and a flow cell of an F1 sensor chip was activated with streptavidin. Then, biotinylated heparin was allowed to react with the streptavidin-coated sensor chip. GST·Tat alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of PPS was then injected over the heparin surface for 5 min to allow the association of the protein with heparin and then washed until dissociation was observed. The SPR signal was expressed in terms of resonance units (RU). Heparin was 3H-labeled as described (28Hatton M.W.C. Berry L.R. Machovich R. Regoeczi E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with a specific radioactivity of 5,000 cpm/nmol. To assay the capacity of PPS to compete with [3H]heparin for the binding to immobilized GST·Tat, [3H]heparin was loaded onto a GST·Tat-glutathione-agarose column in the presence of increasing concentrations of PPS, β-cyclodextrin, or unlabeled heparin. The column was then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 2.0 m NaCl. Radioactivity in the eluate was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. HL3T1 cells are derived from HeLa cells and contain integrated copies of pL3CAT, a plasmid in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) bacterial gene is driven by HIV-1 LTR (29Wright C.M.

T53 Tat-less cells, obtained by subcloning T53 cells, do not produce detectable amounts of extracellular Tat but retain the capacity to proliferate when exposed to exogenous Tat (14Rusnati M.

All cell types were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (DMEM/FCS, Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). HL3T1 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at 20,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM/FCS. After 24 h, cells were incubated for another 24 h period in fresh DMEM/FCS and 100 μm chloroquine in the absence or in the presence of 200 ng/ml of GST·Tat and increasing concentrations of the polysulfated compound that was to be tested. Then, conditioned medium was removed, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in DMEM/FCS. In some experiments, subconfluent cultures of HL3T1 cells were lipofectin-transfected with 2 μg/ml of pCEP-Tat expression vector harboring the HIV-1 Tat cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. A. Gualandris, University of Torino, Italy). Five hours after transfection, cells were washed and incubated for another 24 h in DMEM/FCS in the absence or presence of PPS (100 nm). At the end of the incubation, the amount of CAT protein present in the cell extracts was determined using the CAT ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). T53 Tat-less cells were seeded in 96-well dishes at 10,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM/FCS. After 24 h, cells were incubated for another 24 h in fresh DMEM/FCS in the absence or presence of 200 ng/ml of GST·Tat and increasing concentrations of the polysulfated compound being tested. At the end of the incubation, cells were trypsinized and counted in a Burker chamber. HL3T1 cells adherent to glass coverslips were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in DMEM/FCS containing 400 ng/ml of GST·Tat·GFP in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the polysulfated compound being tested. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed and fixed. GST·Tat·GFP internalization was quantified by computerized image analysis as described (14Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Spillmann D.

T53 Tat-less cells adherent to glass coverslips (20,000/cm2) were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in DMEM/FCS and 400 ng/ml of GST·Tat·GFP in the absence or presence of PPS (1 μm). At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and fixed as described (8Rusnati M. Taraboletti G. Urbinati C. Tulipano G. Giuliani R. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Sennino B. Giacca M. Tyagi M. Albini A. Noonan D. Giavazzi R. Presta M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Observations were carried out in a Nikon photomicroscope equipped for epifluorescence. The CAM assay was performed as described (30Ribatti D. Gualandris A. Bastaki M. Vacca A. Roncali L. Presta M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, a window was opened in the egg shell of 3-day-old fertilized chicken eggs. At day 8, gelatin sponges (Gelfoam; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) were implanted on the CAMs and adsorbed with 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline alone or containing GST or GST·Tat (both at 400 ng/sponge) in the absence or presence of PPS (25 μg/sponge; 5–6 embryos per group). In parallel experiments, the sponges were adsorbed with 10 μl of DMEM/FCS alone or containing T53 cells (6 × 104 cells/sponge) in the absence or presence of 25 μg of PPS (5–6 embryos per group). After 4 days, CAMs were observed in ovo under a Zeiss SR stereomicroscope, and the angiogenic response was scored by two investigators without knowledge of the samples tested and graded on an arbitrary scale of 0–4+, with 0 representing no angiogenic response and 4+ representing the strongest activity. To assess its ability to interact with Tat protein, PPS was evaluated for the capacity to prevent GST·Tat binding to biotinylated heparin immobilized onto a streptavidin-activated BIAcore sensor chip. Preliminary experiments were performed to assess the ability of GST·Tat to bind immobilized heparin. In a typical experiment, increasing concentrations of GST·Tat were injected over the heparin surface, and a set of sensograms was obtained (Fig.1 A). An association rate constant (kon) equal to 4.2 × 104m−1 s−1 and a slow dissociation rate constant (koff) equal to 2.7 × 10−3 s−1 characterized the interaction of GST·Tat with immobilized heparin. Thus, GST·Tat-heparin interaction occurs with high affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) =koff/kon = 64 nm) and results in the formation of highly stable complexes. This interaction is specific because GST protein devoid of the Tat moiety does not bind to immobilized heparin, and GST·Tat does not bind to a streptavidin surface in the absence of immobilized heparin (Fig. 1 B). In some experiments, the association phase of GST·Tat-heparin interaction was allowed to proceed to equilibrium, and the data were used to calculate an affinity value independent of the kinetics of binding. This analysis demonstrates that GST·Tat-heparin interaction occurs with a Kd equal to 58 nm, a value consistent with our kinetics analysis and with previous determinations obtained with different experimental approaches (14Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Spillmann D. Tanghetti E. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28198-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On this basis, we evaluated the capacity of PPS to compete with immobilized heparin for the binding to GST·Tat. To this purpose, increasing concentrations of PPS were preincubated with GST·Tat and then injected onto the heparin-coated sensor chip. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PPS causes a dose-dependent inhibition of GST·Tat-heparin interaction, with an ID50 equal to 120 nm. The binding data allowed the calculation of the relative affinity of PPS-GST·Tat interaction (Kd is equal to 9.0 nm).Figure 2Interaction of PPS with GST·Tat.Competition binding assays: A, surface plasmon resonance, GST·Tat (5 μg/ml) alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of PPS was injected over a flow cell of a BIAcore sensor chip containing streptavidin plus 120 RU of immobilized biotinylated heparin. The responses (in RU) were plotted as a function of PPS concentration. Inset, overlay of sensograms showing the binding of GST·Tat to immobilized heparin in the presence of increasing concentrations of PPS (0, 0.085, 0.13, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.66, 1.0 μg/ml; from top curve to bottom).B, GST·Tat glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, GST·Tat-glutathione-agarose columns (80 μl) were loaded with 300 μl samples containing 25 μg of [3H]heparin alone or added with increasing concentrations of unlabeled heparin (○), PPS (●), or polysulfated β-cyclodextrin (▵). Radioactivity in the 2.0m NaCl eluate was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding, measured in the presence of an excess of unlabeled heparin (1.0 mm) was subtracted from all the values. Each point is the mean of 2–4 determinations performed in duplicate. The S.E. never exceeded 6% of the mean value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PPS was also evaluated for its capacity to compete with free [3H]heparin for the binding to GST·Tat immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 2 B, PPS inhibits the binding of [3H]heparin to GST·Tat in a dose-dependent manner with a potency similar to unlabeled heparin (ID50 equal to 100 and 300 nm, respectively). Under the same experimental conditions, the polysulfated β-cyclodextrin, here used as a negative control (10Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Giuliani R. Giacca M. Ciomei M. Corallini A. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16027-16037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), did not prevent the binding of [3H]heparin to immobilized GST·Tat even when tested at doses as high as 300 μm (Fig.2 B). Taken together, the data demonstrate that PPS binds Tat in a specific manner with an affinity comparable with that of Tat-heparin interaction. The capacity of PPS to abolish the interaction of Tat with immobilized heparin raised the possibility that PPS may prevent the binding of extracellular Tat to cell-associated heparin-like HSPGs that are required for its internalization (13Tyagi, M., Rusnati, M., Presta, M., and Giacca, M. J. Biol. Chem., 276, 3254–3261.Google Scholar). To assess this hypothesis, we evaluated the capacity of PPS to inhibit cell internalization of GST·Tat conjugated to fluorescent GFP. As shown in Fig. 3, PPS inhibits the internalization of GST·Tat·GFP in HL3T1 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an ID50 equal to 1.0 nm, close to that observed for heparin (ID50 = 3.0 nm). When tested under the same experimental conditions, PPS does not affect the uptake of fluorescein-labeled BSA, as assessed by image analysis of the total fluorescence internalized by HL3T1 cells incubated with 400 ng/ml of FITC-BSA in the absence or in the presence of 100 nm PPS (1.21 ± 0.48 and 1.92 ± 0.67 arbitrary units, respectively). It must be pointed out that ∼90% of GST·Tat·GFP or FITC-BSA remained associated to the cells after a 2.0 m NaCl wash of the cell monolayer, thus confirming the intracellular localization of the fluorescent proteins (data not shown). The specificity of PPS-Tat interaction was demonstrated further by the inability of polysulfated β-cyclodextrin to affect Tat internalization (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with its capacity to inhibit Tat internalization, PPS abolished the LTR-CAT transactivating activity exerted by GST·Tat in HL3T1 cells whereas β-cyclodextrin was ineffective (Fig.4 A). It should be noted that 100 nm PPS did not affect the basal levels of LTR-CAT transactivation measured in HL3T1 cells incubated in the absence of GST·Tat (0.166 ± 0.036 and 0.170 ± 0.034A405 nm units for PPS-untreated and -treated cells, respectively). Also, no inhibition of LTR-CAT transactivation was observed when Tat was expressed as an intracellular protein in PPS-treated HL3T1 cells following transient transfection with an expression vector harboring the HIV-1 Tat cDNA (Fig.4 B). These data demonstrate that the antagonist effect of PPS on GST·Tat-mediated LTR-CAT transactivation is specific and depends on an extracellular interaction with Tat protein. To investigate further the mechanism(s) of action of PPS on extracellular Tat activity, PPS was administered to HL3T1 cells together with GST·Tat or at different times after the transactivating factor. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the LTR-transactivating activity of Tat is completely abolished when PPS was administered within the first 2 h following the beginning of GST·Tat treatment. Addition of PPS to the cell culture medium at later time points instead causes a progressive decrease of its antagonist activity that depends on an early interaction with extracellular Tat. Similar results were obtained when PPS was replaced by heparin as Tat antagonist (Fig. 4 C). Endogenous Tat induces cell proliferation in T53 cells derived from an adenocarcinoma of the skin adnexa of atat transgenic mouse (6Campioni D. Corallini A. Zauli G. Possati L. Altavilla G. Barbanti-Brodano G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have characterized a subclone of T53 cells, named T53 Tat-less cells, that does not produce significant amounts of endogenous Tat but that retains the capacity to proliferate when exposed to exogenous Tat (14Rusnati M.

Also, the mitogenic activity exerted by Tat in T53 Tat-less cells is inhibited by heparin (14Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Spillmann D. Tanghetti E. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28198-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On this basis, the Tat antagonist activity of PPS was evaluated in this model. As shown in Fig.5 A, PPS inhibits the binding of GST·Tat·GFP to the surface of T53 Tat-less cells. Approximately 80% of cell-associated fluorescence was removed by a 2.0m NaCl wash of the cell monolayer, thus confirming the extracellular nature of GST·Tat·GFP (data not shown). In agreement with these observations, PPS inhibits the mitogenic activity exerted by GST·Tat with a potency similar to that shown by heparin (ID50 equal to 1.0 nm for both compounds) (Fig.5 B). On the contrary, PPS does not affect T53 Tat-less cell proliferation induced by 10% FCS (Fig.5 B). Extracellular Tat is endowed with angiogenic potentialin vivo (7Corallini A. Campioni D. Rossi C.

This activity is specific because GST devoid of the Tat moiety does not exert any effect when tested under the same experimental conditions (Fig.6 A). In agreement with its in vitro antagonist activity, PPS caused a significant inhibition of GST·Tat-induced neovascularization when tested in vivo at the dose of 25 μg/implant (Fig. 6 A). PPS also inhibited the unstimulated, physiological vascularization of the CAM that is mediated by endogenous FGF-2 produced by the chick embryo (31Ribatti D. Urbinati C. Nico B. Rusnati M. Roncali L. Presta M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Tat-overexpressing parental T53 cells exert a significant angiogenic response when implanted on the top of the CAM (Fig. 6 B), a biological effect because of the release of bioactive Tat protein (7Corallini A.

Again, PPS was able to suppress neovascularization induced by T53 cells when tested at the dose of 25 μg/implant (Fig. 6,B and C). Tat protein has been considered as a target for anti-AIDS therapies aimed to block its intracellular interaction with RNA target structures and various intracellular cofactors required for transactivation of the viral genome (32Gatignol A. Jeang K-T. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 209-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, an increasing body of evidence point to a role for extracellular Tat in the progression of AIDS and AIDS-associated pathologies (3Noonan D. Albini A. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 48: 229-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the use of extracellular Tat antagonists may be of therapeutic benefit for AIDS patients. Accordingly, the development of anti-Tat vaccines has been undertaken (33Cafaro A. Caputo A. Fracasso C. Maggiorella M.T. Goletti D. Baroncelli S. Pace M. Sernicola L. Koanga-Mogtomo M.L. Betti M.

Here, we provide experimental evidence that PPS binds extracellular Tat with high affinity (Kd = 9.0 nm), similar to the physiological ligand heparin (14Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Spillmann D. Tanghetti E. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28198-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This interaction inhibits the binding of Tat to free and surface-immobilized heparin. Accordingly, PPS inhibits cell internalization of extracellular Tat and its biological activity in different experimental models. However, PPS does not inhibit LTR-CAT transactivation exerted by endogenous intracellular Tat and does not affect FITC-BSA internalization. Also, PPS inhibits the mitogenic activity exerted by extracellular Tat in T53 cells without affecting cell proliferation induced by serum. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that the antagonist activity of PPS is mainly caused by a specific interaction with extracellular Tat protein. The interaction of extracellular Tat with cell-associated HSPGs allows the accumulation of the bioactive protein in the ECM and mediates its interaction with the cell surface (11Albini A. Benelli R. Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), leading to cell internalization of the protein and LTR-transactivation (13Tyagi, M., Rusnati, M., Presta, M., and Giacca, M. J. Biol. Chem., 276, 3254–3261.Google Scholar). The capacity of PPS to prevent the binding of GST·Tat to immobilized heparin indicates that PPS may hamper HSPG-mediated interaction of extracellular Tat with target cells. Accordingly, PPS inhibits the internalization of extracellular Tat in HL3T1 cells and its association with the surface of T53 Tat-less cells. Consequently, PPS antagonizes the transactivating and mitogenic activity exerted by extracellular Tat in the two cell lines, respectively. Association with free heparin is required for the chemotactic and angiogenic activity of extracellular Tat (11Albini A. Benelli R. Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar). Together with its ability to inhibit FGF-2-mediated angiogenesis, the capacity of PPS to prevent the binding of Tat to free heparin may contribute to the angiostatic activity exerted by PPS in vivo. PPS retains its Tat antagonist activity when added to HL3T1 cells 2 h after the administration of the transactivating factor, when extracellular Tat is already bound to the cell surface (10Rusnati M. Tulipano G. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Giuliani R. Giacca M. Ciomei M. Corallini A. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16027-16037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This appears to be of particular importance when considering that significant amounts of Tat can be avidly sequestered by ECM HSPGs (12Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), as indicated by the slow dissociation rate of the Tat-immobilized heparin complex. It should be pointed out that, at variance with PPS, thrombospondin-1 retains its Tat antagonist activity only when the transactivating factor is present in the extracellular environment as a free protein, being ineffective when Tat is bound to the cell surface (8Rusnati M. Taraboletti G. Urbinati C. Tulipano G. Giuliani R. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Sennino B. Giacca M. Tyagi M. Albini A. Noonan D. Giavazzi R. Presta M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1917-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the high stability of the Tat-heparin complex appears to be a unique feature of this transactivating factor. Indeed, different heparin-binding growth factors and cytokines, including FGF-2 (36Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25803-25809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) (27Amara A. Lorthior O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J-L.

Lortat-Jacob, unpublished observations. dissociate rapidly from the GAG. The capacity of sulfated GAGs and polysulfonated compounds to bind extracellular Tat and to inhibit its biological activity depends on the backbone structure and, at least in part, on the degree of sulfation (9Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol.

Indeed, a series of distamycin A derivatives structurally related to suramin but characterized by different chemical structure and degree of sulfation differ significantly for their Tat antagonist activity (10Rusnati M.

Here, we have demonstrated that PPS binds Tat and inhibits its biological activity with a potency similar to that shown by heparin and 1,000 times higher than that of suramin (10Rusnati M.

These data indicate that the backbone structure of PPS presents its sulfate group(s) to Tat protein under optimal steric conditions, resembling more closely heparin interaction. PPS inhibits the receptor binding and mitogenic activity of FGF-1 and FGF-2, being ineffective on cell proliferation mediated by IGF-1 or TGF-α. In contrast, suramin exerts a nonselective inhibitory effect at doses 100 times higher than that of PPS (23Zugmaier G. Favoni R. Jaeger R. Rosen N. Knabbe C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 886: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous observations had shown that PPS binds also HIV gp120, thus preventing its interaction with cellular CD4 (19Schols D. Pauwels R. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Virology. 1990; 175: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and inhibits HIV-induced syncytium formation (37Baba M. Schols D. Pauwels R. Nakashima H. De Clercq E. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 493-499PubMed Google Scholar) and lymphocyte-to-epithelial transmission of HIV-1 (38Pearce-Pratt R. Phillips D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPS inhibits reverse transcriptase activity (20Sydow G. Klocking H.P. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1987; 46: 527-530PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that PPS is a potent extracellular Tat antagonist at doses significantly lower than those required to inhibit blood coagulation (21Wellstein A. Zugmaier G. Califano III, J.A. Kern F. Paik S. Lippman M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Accordingly, phase I and II clinical trials have shown that PPS is well tolerated and may cause stabilization of the disease in AIDS-related KS patients (39Marshall J.L. Wellstein A. Rae J.

Taken together, the data indicate that PPS may represent a prototypic molecule for the design of novel multitarget extracellular Tat antagonists to be used for the treatment of AIDS and AIDS-associated pathologies. In particular, the potency and specificity shown by PPS in inhibiting the biological activity of Tat and FGF-2 may be an advantage for the treatment of AIDS-related KS where both proteins appear to contribute to the progression of the disease (42Ensoli B.

A nonphenolic tetrameric lignin model was synthesized that contains β-O-4 linkages. The fungal and recombinant wild type lignin peroxidase both oxidized the tetrameric model forming four products. The four products were identified by mass spectral analyses and compared with synthetic standards. They were identified as tetrameric, trimeric, dimeric, and monomeric carbonyl compounds. All four of these products were also formed from single turnover experiments. This indicates that lignin peroxidase is able to attack any of the Cα-Cβ linkages in the tetrameric compound and that the substrate-binding site is well exposed. Mutation of the recombinant lignin peroxidase (isozyme H8) in the heme access channel, which is relatively restricted and was previously proposed to be the veratryl alcohol-binding site (E146S), had little effect on the oxidation of the tetramer. In contrast, mutation of a Trp residue (W171S) in the alternate proposed substrate-binding site completely inhibited the oxidation of the tetrameric model. These results are consistent with lignin peroxidase having an exposed active site capable of directly interacting with the lignin polymer without the advent of low molecular weight mediators.

These enzymes include peroxidases and/or laccases (1Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 2Thurston C.F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 19-26Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The role of each enzyme in this complicated process is an active area of research and debate. The most studied white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, produces two types of peroxidases, manganese peroxidase (MnP),1 and lignin peroxidase (LP) (3Tien M. Kirk T.K. Science. 1983; 221: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 4Glenn J.K. Morgan M.A. Mayfield M.B. Kuwahara M. Gold M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), but no detectable laccase. The heme-containing peroxidases undergo the classical catalytic cycle, where H2O2 first oxidizes the native (ferric) enzyme, forming compound I (5Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two reducing substrates then donate two electrons, one each, to complete the catalytic cycle via the formation of a compound II intermediate (5Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).MnP and LP are similar in structure (6Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Piontek K. Glumoff T. Winterhalter K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but distinguished and unique in the nature of their reducing substrates. MnP can oxidize phenolic substrates, but compound II exhibits specificity for complexed Mn2+, oxidizing it to Mn3+ (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Mn3+, in turn, is able to oxidize a wide range of phenolic substrates including phenolic lignin (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, LP oxidizes a variety of phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic compounds (10Kirk T.K. Tien M. Kersten P.J. Mozuch M.D. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Paszczynski A. Huynh V.-B. Crawford R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 750-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). How these two enzymes interact with their ultimate substrate, lignin, has been intensely investigated. Several studies have shown that the pore size of the plant cell wall does not allow for direct contact between the peroxidases and lignin (12Flourney D.S. Paul J.A. Kirk T.K. Highley T.L. Holzforschung. 1993; 47: 297-301Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Messner K. Srebotnik E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 351-364Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Paice M. Bourbonnais R. Reid I.D. Archibald F.S. Jurasek L. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1995; 27: J280-J284Google Scholar). For MnP, trivalent Mn is proposed to deliver the oxidizing equivalents of the heme active site to the aromatic substrate (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). For LP, the secondary metabolite, veratryl (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl) alcohol has been proposed to play a similar role (15Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This alcohol has been shown to facilitate the oxidation of many compounds in vitro (16Paszczynski A. Crawford R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Hammel K.E. Moen M.A. Enzyme Microbiol. Technol. 1991; 13: 15-18Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This observation led these investigators to speculate that the veratryl alcohol cation radical is the low molecular weight mediator in the case of LP. However, the life span of the veratryl alcohol cation radical is too short to permit diffusion to distant sites (19Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-66424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, LP may be involved in the oxidation of the soluble, partially degraded lignin fragments. However, the possibility that LP can directly oxidize lignin in the partially degraded cell wall cannot be excluded.The present study maps the site of electron transfer for LP in respect to substrate size. Two likely substrate-binding sites have been proposed. One is the so-called heme access channel (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows for direct interaction between the substrate and the heme. Residues Ile85, Val184, Gln222, Phe148, His82, Glu146, and Asp183 are located in this channel. This channel is sterically restricted and would not allow access to large bulky (lignin) substrates. The other site, Trp171, is located at the enzyme surface and would only allow for long range electron transfer (20Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have designed a tetrameric nonphenolic lignin model compound, which does not fit into the heme access channel (Fig.1), and determined the initial products of its oxidation. The product profile indicates that the site of electron transfer of LP is very exposed. Site-directed mutagenesis studies where Glu146 and Trp171 were altered indicate that the site of electron transfer is Trp171.DISCUSSIONResults from the present study help resolve the issue of whether LP can degrade polymeric lignin without redox mediators and have also identified the site of electron transfer for polymeric substrates. These results have relevance on the role of LP in lignin degradation, a question still debated after the discovery of LP 17 years ago. This debate is partly because of the finding that many lignin-degrading fungi apparently do not contain LP (29Orth A.B. Royse D.J. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4017-4023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because of the relatively slow rate of this enzyme with the substrate lignin (30Sarkanen S. Razal R.A. Piccariello T. Yamamoto E. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3636-3643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because LP is proficient in oxidizing low molecular weight models of lignin, some have proposed that the role of LP in lignin degradation is solely for the oxidation of smaller lignin fragments (30Sarkanen S. Razal R.A. Piccariello T. Yamamoto E. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3636-3643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generated by MnP catalysis. The ability of LP to bind to its putative substrate, lignin, has also been questioned. Research from a number of laboratories has shown that the pores of the wood matrix are not large enough to allow access to enzyme (12Flourney D.S. Paul J.A. Kirk T.K. Highley T.L. Holzforschung. 1993; 47: 297-301Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Messner K. Srebotnik E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 351-364Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Paice M. Bourbonnais R. Reid I.D. Archibald F.S. Jurasek L. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1995; 27: J280-J284Google Scholar). However, similar to how MnP can degrade lignin through utilizing Mn2+/Mn3+ as a mediator, Harvey et al. (15Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) suggest that veratryl alcohol serves as a redox mediator for LP. In this mechanism, the oxidation to the cation radical, followed by diffusion into the wood matrix, delivers the oxidizing power of the heme active site to the distal substrate lignin. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitrostudies by Hammel et al. (31Hammel K.E. Jensen Jr., K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed maximal depolymerization of lignin by LP occurred only in the presence of veratryl alcohol. This hypothesis, however, has been questioned by kinetic studies (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by chemical studies showing the chemical instability of the veratryl alcohol cation radical (19Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-66424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Relevant to the question of the role of LP in lignin degradation is whether LP can directly interact with the lignin polymer. To date, crystallographic and spectroscopic data have yielded no information on the substrate-binding site. Based on mainly theoretical studies at least three substrate-binding sites have been proposed. Poulos et al. (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a binding site for veratryl alcohol is an access channel analogous to that found in CcP. This channel provides a hydrophobic environment near to the heme. This channel allows for direct interaction between the substrate and the heme. Modeling of substrates into this channel indicates that only monomeric substrates would bind or that larger linear polymers could bind through an “end-on” manner. The ability of LP to directly interact with lignin would not exclude this site, because the polymer could be envisioned to bind through an exo mechanism. In addition to the heme access channel, two long-range electron transfer routes have been proposed. Schoemaker and Piontek (32Schoemaker H.E. Piontek K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1996; 68: 2089-2096Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed residues 82–84 (His, Pro, Asn) of isozyme H8, whereas His82 was proposed also as the part of the heme access channel (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other site was proposed by Blodiget al. (20Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) involving residues Trp171 and Leu172. Both of these long range sites connect the heme to surface residues thus allowing for direct contact with lignin. Here, LP could be envisioned to interact in an endo manner with lignin.To gain insight into the nature of the binding site, we have synthesized a larger (tetrameric) model of lignin to map the size of the LP site of electron transfer. We utilized a tetrameric substrate, which is actually larger than a tetramer, because a benzyl group, rather than a methyl group, is attached to the terminal phenolic oxygen. The tetramer was designed such that if the site of electron transfer is the heme access channel, it could only gain access from an end-on manner. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 1 where the size of the tetramer is compared with that of LP and its heme access channel. Our studies clearly indicate, through time course studies and through single turnover studies, that LP is able to oxidize the tetramer to yield the dimer as the first product. In all incubations with the tetramer, the monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric aldehydes were detected. Of significance here is the finding that dimeric products are formed from single turnover studies. This clearly maps the site of electron transfer to be relatively unhindered and that LP can oxidize the lignin polymer directly. In accordance with this interpretation is our results from the chemical oxidation system. The single electron oxidant, Ce4+, yielded the same profile of products. Thus, LP can act as an endo lignin-degrading enzyme. This is consistent with LP being able to interact with lignin directly and catalyze Cα-Cβ cleavage anywhere along the polymer.Indirect evidence for interaction between LP and lignin (synthetic polymer dehydropolymer) was recently obtained with a resonant mirror biosensor by Johjima et al. (33Johjima T. Itoh N. Kabuto M. Tokimura F. Nakagawa T. Wariishi H. Tanaka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1894-1989Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interaction between the enzyme and dehydropolymer was only specific for LP; none was observed with laccase, MnP, or horseradish peroxidase. In addition to this spectroscopic evidence, these workers also obtained rate constants between LP compound I and the dehydropolymer. However, this study did not reveal the nature of the products or reveal the location of the substrate-binding site. Terminal phenolic groups may have served as the reducing agent for both compounds I and II in this study.Despite the finding that LP can directly interact with a large polymeric lignin substrate, we also investigated whether veratryl alcohol could enhance the oxidation. As found in the oxidation of many other substrates for LP, veratryl alcohol stimulated the oxidation of the tetrameric model. The stimulation was measured to be ∼20%, a result which neither supported nor refuted the mediation hypothesis. Past work has shown that facilitation of oxidation of secondary substrates can be explained by several mechanisms. Although our experiments were not designed to address the mediation issue, they are more consistent with veratryl alcohol not acting as a mediator. In incubations where veratryl alcohol acts as a mediator, a lag phase in its oxidation has been observed (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, a lag phase of veratraldehyde formation was not observed. On the contrary, both the tetramer and veratryl alcohol were oxidized simultaneously. Thus, it most probably acted to protect LP from inactivation. In the case of poor LP substrates, veratryl alcohol has been demonstrated to promote the completion of the enzymatic catalytic cycle, decreasing the inactivation of LP, and to consequently increase the oxidation rate of the other substrate. The mechanism of stimulation was not further investigated. Even if some mediation does occur with veratryl alcohol, these results do not refute our finding that LP is able to directly oxidize large lignin molecules.Our studies have also identified the location of the electron transfer for polymeric substrates. We have made mutations among the amino acids in the heme excess channel (24Ambert-Balay K. Fuchs S.M. Tien M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu146 at this site was further characterized in the present study. This amino acid residue was proposed to participate in veratryl alcohol binding and to be involved in pH dependence (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme mutated at the heme access channel was able to oxidize the tetrameric lignin model resulting in the same products as those by the wild type. Recently Trp171 of the surface-exposed potential binding site was mutated (28Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The involvement of this amino acid in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol was proposed. The W171S mutant, in contrast, was not able to oxidize the tetramer, and no products were found. These findings illustrate the significance of this site for electron transfer with veratryl alcohol and the polymeric lignin. The involvement of Trp171 in veratryl alcohol oxidation is supported by other studies (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The significance of Trp171 is also suggested from the results on bifunctional MnPs. Certain MnPs fromBjerkandera sp. and Pleurotus spp. oxidize veratryl alcohol (36Mester T. Field J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15412-15417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These enzymes also contain a Trp at the homologous site (37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Moreover, when MnP H4 was mutated to contain a Trp (Trp168) (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was able to oxidize veratryl alcohol.In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that LP can directly oxidize lignin. Therefore, LP may have important role in the degradation of phenolic and nonphenolic lignin. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the substrate-binding site is surface-exposed and that this site may accommodate both lignin and veratryl alcohol. However, other compounds such as ABTS and DFAD may bind at an alternate site. The presence of more than one binding site is supported by the fact that the mutation of Trp171 in LP did not affect the oxidation of certain dyes such as ABTS and DFAD (28Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). White rot fungi degrade the aromatic polymer lignin with extracellular oxidative enzymes. These enzymes include peroxidases and/or laccases (1Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 2Thurston C.F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 19-26Crossref Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The role of each enzyme in this complicated process is an active area of research and debate. The most studied white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, produces two types of peroxidases, manganese peroxidase (MnP),1 and lignin peroxidase (LP) (3Tien M. Kirk T.K. Science. 1983; 221: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 4Glenn J.K. Morgan M.A. Mayfield M.B. Kuwahara M. Gold M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), but no detectable laccase. The heme-containing peroxidases undergo the classical catalytic cycle, where H2O2 first oxidizes the native (ferric) enzyme, forming compound I (5Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Two reducing substrates then donate two electrons, one each, to complete the catalytic cycle via the formation of a compound II intermediate (5Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). MnP and LP are similar in structure (6Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold M.H. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Piontek K. Glumoff T. Winterhalter K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but distinguished and unique in the nature of their reducing substrates. MnP can oxidize phenolic substrates, but compound II exhibits specificity for complexed Mn2+, oxidizing it to Mn3+ (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Mn3+, in turn, is able to oxidize a wide range of phenolic substrates including phenolic lignin (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In contrast, LP oxidizes a variety of phenolic and nonphenolic aromatic compounds (10Kirk T.K. Tien M. Kersten P.J. Mozuch M.D. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Paszczynski A. Huynh V.-B. Crawford R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 750-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). How these two enzymes interact with their ultimate substrate, lignin, has been intensely investigated. Several studies have shown that the pore size of the plant cell wall does not allow for direct contact between the peroxidases and lignin (12Flourney D.S. Paul J.A. Kirk T.K. Highley T.L. Holzforschung. 1993; 47: 297-301Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Messner K. Srebotnik E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 351-364Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Paice M. Bourbonnais R. Reid I.D. Archibald F.S. Jurasek L. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1995; 27: J280-J284Google Scholar). For MnP, trivalent Mn is proposed to deliver the oxidizing equivalents of the heme active site to the aromatic substrate (9Glenn J.K. Akileswaran L. Gold M.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). For LP, the secondary metabolite, veratryl (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl) alcohol has been proposed to play a similar role (15Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This alcohol has been shown to facilitate the oxidation of many compounds in vitro (16Paszczynski A. Crawford R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Hammel K.E. Moen M.A. Enzyme Microbiol. Technol. 1991; 13: 15-18Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This observation led these investigators to speculate that the veratryl alcohol cation radical is the low molecular weight mediator in the case of LP. However, the life span of the veratryl alcohol cation radical is too short to permit diffusion to distant sites (19Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-66424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, LP may be involved in the oxidation of the soluble, partially degraded lignin fragments. However, the possibility that LP can directly oxidize lignin in the partially degraded cell wall cannot be excluded. The present study maps the site of electron transfer for LP in respect to substrate size. Two likely substrate-binding sites have been proposed. One is the so-called heme access channel (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which allows for direct interaction between the substrate and the heme. Residues Ile85, Val184, Gln222, Phe148, His82, Glu146, and Asp183 are located in this channel. This channel is sterically restricted and would not allow access to large bulky (lignin) substrates. The other site, Trp171, is located at the enzyme surface and would only allow for long range electron transfer (20Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have designed a tetrameric nonphenolic lignin model compound, which does not fit into the heme access channel (Fig.1), and determined the initial products of its oxidation. The product profile indicates that the site of electron transfer of LP is very exposed. Site-directed mutagenesis studies where Glu146 and Trp171 were altered indicate that the site of electron transfer is Trp171. DISCUSSIONResults from the present study help resolve the issue of whether LP can degrade polymeric lignin without redox mediators and have also identified the site of electron transfer for polymeric substrates. These results have relevance on the role of LP in lignin degradation, a question still debated after the discovery of LP 17 years ago. This debate is partly because of the finding that many lignin-degrading fungi apparently do not contain LP (29Orth A.B. Royse D.J. Tien M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 4017-4023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because of the relatively slow rate of this enzyme with the substrate lignin (30Sarkanen S. Razal R.A. Piccariello T. Yamamoto E. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3636-3643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because LP is proficient in oxidizing low molecular weight models of lignin, some have proposed that the role of LP in lignin degradation is solely for the oxidation of smaller lignin fragments (30Sarkanen S. Razal R.A. Piccariello T. Yamamoto E. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3636-3643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generated by MnP catalysis. The ability of LP to bind to its putative substrate, lignin, has also been questioned. Research from a number of laboratories has shown that the pores of the wood matrix are not large enough to allow access to enzyme (12Flourney D.S. Paul J.A. Kirk T.K. Highley T.L. Holzforschung. 1993; 47: 297-301Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Messner K. Srebotnik E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 351-364Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Paice M. Bourbonnais R. Reid I.D. Archibald F.S. Jurasek L. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1995; 27: J280-J284Google Scholar). However, similar to how MnP can degrade lignin through utilizing Mn2+/Mn3+ as a mediator, Harvey et al. (15Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) suggest that veratryl alcohol serves as a redox mediator for LP. In this mechanism, the oxidation to the cation radical, followed by diffusion into the wood matrix, delivers the oxidizing power of the heme active site to the distal substrate lignin. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitrostudies by Hammel et al. (31Hammel K.E. Jensen Jr., K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed maximal depolymerization of lignin by LP occurred only in the presence of veratryl alcohol. This hypothesis, however, has been questioned by kinetic studies (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by chemical studies showing the chemical instability of the veratryl alcohol cation radical (19Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-66424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Relevant to the question of the role of LP in lignin degradation is whether LP can directly interact with the lignin polymer. To date, crystallographic and spectroscopic data have yielded no information on the substrate-binding site. Based on mainly theoretical studies at least three substrate-binding sites have been proposed. Poulos et al. (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a binding site for veratryl alcohol is an access channel analogous to that found in CcP. This channel provides a hydrophobic environment near to the heme. This channel allows for direct interaction between the substrate and the heme. Modeling of substrates into this channel indicates that only monomeric substrates would bind or that larger linear polymers could bind through an “end-on” manner. The ability of LP to directly interact with lignin would not exclude this site, because the polymer could be envisioned to bind through an exo mechanism. In addition to the heme access channel, two long-range electron transfer routes have been proposed. Schoemaker and Piontek (32Schoemaker H.E. Piontek K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1996; 68: 2089-2096Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed residues 82–84 (His, Pro, Asn) of isozyme H8, whereas His82 was proposed also as the part of the heme access channel (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other site was proposed by Blodiget al. (20Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) involving residues Trp171 and Leu172. Both of these long range sites connect the heme to surface residues thus allowing for direct contact with lignin. Here, LP could be envisioned to interact in an endo manner with lignin.To gain insight into the nature of the binding site, we have synthesized a larger (tetrameric) model of lignin to map the size of the LP site of electron transfer. We utilized a tetrameric substrate, which is actually larger than a tetramer, because a benzyl group, rather than a methyl group, is attached to the terminal phenolic oxygen. The tetramer was designed such that if the site of electron transfer is the heme access channel, it could only gain access from an end-on manner. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 1 where the size of the tetramer is compared with that of LP and its heme access channel. Our studies clearly indicate, through time course studies and through single turnover studies, that LP is able to oxidize the tetramer to yield the dimer as the first product. In all incubations with the tetramer, the monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric aldehydes were detected. Of significance here is the finding that dimeric products are formed from single turnover studies. This clearly maps the site of electron transfer to be relatively unhindered and that LP can oxidize the lignin polymer directly. In accordance with this interpretation is our results from the chemical oxidation system. The single electron oxidant, Ce4+, yielded the same profile of products. Thus, LP can act as an endo lignin-degrading enzyme. This is consistent with LP being able to interact with lignin directly and catalyze Cα-Cβ cleavage anywhere along the polymer.Indirect evidence for interaction between LP and lignin (synthetic polymer dehydropolymer) was recently obtained with a resonant mirror biosensor by Johjima et al. (33Johjima T. Itoh N. Kabuto M. Tokimura F. Nakagawa T. Wariishi H. Tanaka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1894-1989Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interaction between the enzyme and dehydropolymer was only specific for LP; none was observed with laccase, MnP, or horseradish peroxidase. In addition to this spectroscopic evidence, these workers also obtained rate constants between LP compound I and the dehydropolymer. However, this study did not reveal the nature of the products or reveal the location of the substrate-binding site. Terminal phenolic groups may have served as the reducing agent for both compounds I and II in this study.Despite the finding that LP can directly interact with a large polymeric lignin substrate, we also investigated whether veratryl alcohol could enhance the oxidation. As found in the oxidation of many other substrates for LP, veratryl alcohol stimulated the oxidation of the tetrameric model. The stimulation was measured to be ∼20%, a result which neither supported nor refuted the mediation hypothesis. Past work has shown that facilitation of oxidation of secondary substrates can be explained by several mechanisms. Although our experiments were not designed to address the mediation issue, they are more consistent with veratryl alcohol not acting as a mediator. In incubations where veratryl alcohol acts as a mediator, a lag phase in its oxidation has been observed (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, a lag phase of veratraldehyde formation was not observed. On the contrary, both the tetramer and veratryl alcohol were oxidized simultaneously. Thus, it most probably acted to protect LP from inactivation. In the case of poor LP substrates, veratryl alcohol has been demonstrated to promote the completion of the enzymatic catalytic cycle, decreasing the inactivation of LP, and to consequently increase the oxidation rate of the other substrate. The mechanism of stimulation was not further investigated. Even if some mediation does occur with veratryl alcohol, these results do not refute our finding that LP is able to directly oxidize large lignin molecules.Our studies have also identified the location of the electron transfer for polymeric substrates. We have made mutations among the amino acids in the heme excess channel (24Ambert-Balay K. Fuchs S.M. Tien M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu146 at this site was further characterized in the present study. This amino acid residue was proposed to participate in veratryl alcohol binding and to be involved in pH dependence (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme mutated at the heme access channel was able to oxidize the tetrameric lignin model resulting in the same products as those by the wild type. Recently Trp171 of the surface-exposed potential binding site was mutated (28Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The involvement of this amino acid in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol was proposed. The W171S mutant, in contrast, was not able to oxidize the tetramer, and no products were found. These findings illustrate the significance of this site for electron transfer with veratryl alcohol and the polymeric lignin. The involvement of Trp171 in veratryl alcohol oxidation is supported by other studies (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The significance of Trp171 is also suggested from the results on bifunctional MnPs. Certain MnPs fromBjerkandera sp. and Pleurotus spp. oxidize veratryl alcohol (36Mester T. Field J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15412-15417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These enzymes also contain a Trp at the homologous site (37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J.

Moreover, when MnP H4 was mutated to contain a Trp (Trp168) (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Razal R.A. Piccariello T. Yamamoto E. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3636-3643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), generated by MnP catalysis. The ability of LP to bind to its putative substrate, lignin, has also been questioned. Research from a number of laboratories has shown that the pores of the wood matrix are not large enough to allow access to enzyme (12Flourney D.S. Paul J.A. Kirk T.K. Highley T.L. Holzforschung. 1993; 47: 297-301Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Messner K. Srebotnik E. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 351-364Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Paice M. Bourbonnais R. Reid I.D. Archibald F.S. Jurasek L. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1995; 27: J280-J284Google Scholar). However, similar to how MnP can degrade lignin through utilizing Mn2+/Mn3+ as a mediator, Harvey et al. (15Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) suggest that veratryl alcohol serves as a redox mediator for LP. In this mechanism, the oxidation to the cation radical, followed by diffusion into the wood matrix, delivers the oxidizing power of the heme active site to the distal substrate lignin. Consistent with this hypothesis, in vitrostudies by Hammel et al. (31Hammel K.E. Jensen Jr., K.A. Mozuch M.D. Landucci L.L. Tien M. Pease E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12274-12281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed maximal depolymerization of lignin by LP occurred only in the presence of veratryl alcohol. This hypothesis, however, has been questioned by kinetic studies (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and by chemical studies showing the chemical instability of the veratryl alcohol cation radical (19Khindaria A. Yamazaki I. Aust S.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6418-66424Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Relevant to the question of the role of LP in lignin degradation is whether LP can directly interact with the lignin polymer. To date, crystallographic and spectroscopic data have yielded no information on the substrate-binding site. Based on mainly theoretical studies at least three substrate-binding sites have been proposed. Poulos et al. (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol.

This channel provides a hydrophobic environment near to the heme. This channel allows for direct interaction between the substrate and the heme. Modeling of substrates into this channel indicates that only monomeric substrates would bind or that larger linear polymers could bind through an “end-on” manner. The ability of LP to directly interact with lignin would not exclude this site, because the polymer could be envisioned to bind through an exo mechanism. In addition to the heme access channel, two long-range electron transfer routes have been proposed. Schoemaker and Piontek (32Schoemaker H.E. Piontek K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1996; 68: 2089-2096Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed residues 82–84 (His, Pro, Asn) of isozyme H8, whereas His82 was proposed also as the part of the heme access channel (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other site was proposed by Blodiget al. (20Blodig W. Doyle W.A. Smith A.T. Winterhalter K. Choinowski T. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8832-8838Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) involving residues Trp171 and Leu172. Both of these long range sites connect the heme to surface residues thus allowing for direct contact with lignin. Here, LP could be envisioned to interact in an endo manner with lignin. To gain insight into the nature of the binding site, we have synthesized a larger (tetrameric) model of lignin to map the size of the LP site of electron transfer. We utilized a tetrameric substrate, which is actually larger than a tetramer, because a benzyl group, rather than a methyl group, is attached to the terminal phenolic oxygen. The tetramer was designed such that if the site of electron transfer is the heme access channel, it could only gain access from an end-on manner. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 1 where the size of the tetramer is compared with that of LP and its heme access channel. Our studies clearly indicate, through time course studies and through single turnover studies, that LP is able to oxidize the tetramer to yield the dimer as the first product. In all incubations with the tetramer, the monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric aldehydes were detected. Of significance here is the finding that dimeric products are formed from single turnover studies. This clearly maps the site of electron transfer to be relatively unhindered and that LP can oxidize the lignin polymer directly. In accordance with this interpretation is our results from the chemical oxidation system. The single electron oxidant, Ce4+, yielded the same profile of products. Thus, LP can act as an endo lignin-degrading enzyme. This is consistent with LP being able to interact with lignin directly and catalyze Cα-Cβ cleavage anywhere along the polymer. Indirect evidence for interaction between LP and lignin (synthetic polymer dehydropolymer) was recently obtained with a resonant mirror biosensor by Johjima et al. (33Johjima T. Itoh N. Kabuto M. Tokimura F. Nakagawa T. Wariishi H. Tanaka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1894-1989Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The interaction between the enzyme and dehydropolymer was only specific for LP; none was observed with laccase, MnP, or horseradish peroxidase. In addition to this spectroscopic evidence, these workers also obtained rate constants between LP compound I and the dehydropolymer. However, this study did not reveal the nature of the products or reveal the location of the substrate-binding site. Terminal phenolic groups may have served as the reducing agent for both compounds I and II in this study. Despite the finding that LP can directly interact with a large polymeric lignin substrate, we also investigated whether veratryl alcohol could enhance the oxidation. As found in the oxidation of many other substrates for LP, veratryl alcohol stimulated the oxidation of the tetrameric model. The stimulation was measured to be ∼20%, a result which neither supported nor refuted the mediation hypothesis. Past work has shown that facilitation of oxidation of secondary substrates can be explained by several mechanisms. Although our experiments were not designed to address the mediation issue, they are more consistent with veratryl alcohol not acting as a mediator. In incubations where veratryl alcohol acts as a mediator, a lag phase in its oxidation has been observed (18Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, a lag phase of veratraldehyde formation was not observed. On the contrary, both the tetramer and veratryl alcohol were oxidized simultaneously. Thus, it most probably acted to protect LP from inactivation. In the case of poor LP substrates, veratryl alcohol has been demonstrated to promote the completion of the enzymatic catalytic cycle, decreasing the inactivation of LP, and to consequently increase the oxidation rate of the other substrate. The mechanism of stimulation was not further investigated. Even if some mediation does occur with veratryl alcohol, these results do not refute our finding that LP is able to directly oxidize large lignin molecules. Our studies have also identified the location of the electron transfer for polymeric substrates. We have made mutations among the amino acids in the heme excess channel (24Ambert-Balay K. Fuchs S.M. Tien M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu146 at this site was further characterized in the present study. This amino acid residue was proposed to participate in veratryl alcohol binding and to be involved in pH dependence (8Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme mutated at the heme access channel was able to oxidize the tetrameric lignin model resulting in the same products as those by the wild type. Recently Trp171 of the surface-exposed potential binding site was mutated (28Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The involvement of this amino acid in the oxidation of veratryl alcohol was proposed. The W171S mutant, in contrast, was not able to oxidize the tetramer, and no products were found. These findings illustrate the significance of this site for electron transfer with veratryl alcohol and the polymeric lignin. The involvement of Trp171 in veratryl alcohol oxidation is supported by other studies (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The significance of Trp171 is also suggested from the results on bifunctional MnPs. Certain MnPs fromBjerkandera sp. and Pleurotus spp. oxidize veratryl alcohol (36Mester T. Field J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15412-15417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These enzymes also contain a Trp at the homologous site (37Camarero S. Sarkar S. Ruiz-Duenas F.J. Martinez M.J. Martinez A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10324-10330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Moreover, when MnP H4 was mutated to contain a Trp (Trp168) (34Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Timofeevski S.L. Nie G. Reading N.S. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was able to oxidize veratryl alcohol. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that LP can directly oxidize lignin. Therefore, LP may have important role in the degradation of phenolic and nonphenolic lignin. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that the substrate-binding site is surface-exposed and that this site may accommodate both lignin and veratryl alcohol. However, other compounds such as ABTS and DFAD may bind at an alternate site. The presence of more than one binding site is supported by the fact that the mutation of Trp171 in LP did not affect the oxidation of certain dyes such as ABTS and DFAD (28Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)."

Composed of a C-terminal regulatory domain and an N-terminal kinase domain, MST4 is most closely related to mammalian Ste20 kinase family member MST3. Both the kinase and C-terminal regulatory domains of MST4 are required for full activation of the kinase. Northern blot analysis indicates that MST4 is ubiquitously distributed, and the MST4 gene is localized to chromosome Xq26, a disease-rich region, by fluorescence in situhybridization. Although some members of the MST4 family function as upstream regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, expression of MST4 in 293 cells was not sufficient to activate or potentiate extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 kinase. An alternatively spliced isoform of MST4 (MST4a) was isolated by yeast two-hybrid interaction with the catalytic domain of Raf from a human fetal brain cDNA library and also found in a variety of human fetal and adult tissues. MST4a lacks an exon encoding kinase subdomains IX–XI that stabilizes substrate binding. The existence of both MST4 isoforms suggests that the MST4 kinase activity is highly regulated, and MST4a may function as a dominant-negative regulator of the MST4 kinase.

The core of the cascade consists of three sequentially acting protein kinases: a MAPK, a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK kinase kinase (1Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are five MAPK cascades that have pivotal roles in regulating sporulation, cell wall remodeling, osmolyte synthesis, filamentation, and mating (2Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 3Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, the most thoroughly studied MAPKs are ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK modules. The ERK1/2 cascade consists of Raf as the MAPK kinase kinase, MEK as the MAPK kinase, and ERK1/2 as the MAPK. This cascade is involved in regulation of cell growth and differentiation, whereas the JNK and p38 cascades have been implicated in several stress responses including apoptosis and inflammation (4Ip Y.T.

In budding yeast, the serine/threonine kinase Ste20 activates the MAPK kinase kinase Ste11, an upstream activator of the MAPK kinase Ste7. Ste7 in turn activates two MAPKs, FUS and KSS1, in the mating pathway of budding yeast (10Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Ramer S.W. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The homologous family of mammalian Ste20-like kinases can be divided into two subfamilies based on their regulation and structure and is rapidly growing. p21 Rac/Cdc42-activated kinases (PAKs) (12Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) represent the first subfamily of kinases, containing a C-terminal Ste20-like kinase domain and a N-terminal regulatory domain with Cdc42 and Rac binding regions. Like Ste20, PAKs can be activated by binding to the GTP-bound form of Rac/Cdc42 (12Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L.

In cotransfection experiments, constitutively active mutants of PAK1 or PAK3 can activate the JNK and p38 pathways (14Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

PAKs have also recently been shown to directly phosphorylate c-Raf at serine 338, enhancing Raf activity (17King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and to potentiate activation of ERKs (18Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Thus, PAKs can act as upstream activators of the MAPK cascades in mammalian cells. The second subfamily of Ste20-like kinases, in which germinal center kinase is the prototype (19Katz P. Whalen G. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

MST1, MST2, MST3, MST3b, and SOK1 have extensive homology in their C-terminal tail but have not been demonstrated to directly activate any of the known MAPK cascades (28Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, there are reports that MST1 can activate JNK and p38 (35Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M. Chernoff J. Clark E.A. Krebs E.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2224-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and MST3 can potentiate ERK activation under certain conditions (33Zhou T.H. Ling K. Guo J. Zhou H. Wu Y.L. Jing Q. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, using a screen for Raf-interacting proteins, we cloned and characterized MST4, a new member of the mammalian Ste20 family that has a strong homology to mammalian Ste20-like kinases MST1, MST2, MST3, and SOK1. The existence of a new member of the MST family, as well as an alternatively spliced, inactive isoform, suggests that these enzymes may play discrete and specific roles in regulating MAPK signaling pathways. The catalytic domain of Raf was amplified by PCR with primer 1 (5′-gacggatccgttcacagccgaaaacccccgtgcc-3′) and primer 2 (5′-cgaccatggctagaagacaggcagcctcgg-3′), digested with XhoI and BamHI, and subcloned into PEG202 to construct PEG202-c-Raf. MEK1 was amplified by PCR with primer 3 (5′-gcctcgagcccaagaagaagccgacg-3′) and primer 4 (5′-gcctcgagtcagatgctggcagcgtg-3′), digested with XhoI, and subcloned into PJG4–5 to construct PJG-4–5-MEK. The PEG202-Raf was transformed into Epicurian coli XL1-red cells (Stratagene), which are deficient in three of the primary DNA repair pathways. After recovery in SOC medium (GIBLO BRL) at 37 °C for 1 h, the culture was diluted to 10 ml of SOC for further incubation overnight. The next day, 200 μl of the culture was diluted with a fresh 10 ml of SOC and grown overnight, while the remaining culture was used for plasmid DNA preparation. The second overnight culture was further diluted for another overnight incubation and plasmid DNA preparation. A third overnight culture was also used for preparation of plasmid DNA. These three plasmid DNA preparations were pooled together as the mutated PEG202-c-Raf library, which was transformed into yeast EGY48 along with PJG-MEK in order to screen for a mutated PEG202-Raf protein that has a high affinity for MEK. A mutant construct was isolated (PEG202-Raf-M), and we confirmed that the mutant Raf protein had an enhanced affinity for MEK by retransforming the PEG202-c-Raf-M construct back into yeast EGY48 with PJG4–5-MEK and testing its interaction with MEK. Sequencing the c-Raf insertion in PEG202 revealed a mutation at residue Ser610 that introduced a new stop codon at this site, resulting in a truncated C-terminal Raf protein. The LexA yeast two-hybrid system was kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent. A human fetal library, made from a 22-week-old human fetal frontal cortex, was used to search for proteins interacting with the kinase domain of mutant PEG202-Raf-M (see above). Two clones showing strong interaction with Raf were obtained. Routine yeast work and yeast transformation were performed as described (36Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). cDNA from two human fetal brain libraries, a human testes library, and multiple human tissue cDNA panels from CLONTECH were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using primer MST-761 (5′-ctactaagattccgaatcagagccctc-3′) and primer MST-1 (5′-atggcccactcgccggtggctgtc-3′). A ∼1-kilobase pair DNA fragment was amplified by PCR, purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit, and labeled with 32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe was hybridized to a poly(A)+ RNA human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) following the user manual. COS and 293 cells were grown in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum was used for cell growth. Transfection of COS and 293 cells was performed using the TransITTM polyamine transfection reagent (Panvera, Madison, WI). For lysis, cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton-based lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate. A primer (5′-gtcgttgctattcgaatcatagac-3′) was used for unique site elimination site-directed mutagenesis of MST4a to generate the kinase inactive mutant MST4a-K53R. The critical lysine in the kinase domain (VAIKIID) was mutated to arginine. The mutagenesis was performed according to the manual for the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech U.S.E. mutagenesis kit. The smaller BamHI/BsmI DNA fragment from PCR3.1-MST4a-K53R was ligated into the largerBamHI/BsmI DNA fragment from PCR3.1-MST4 to construct PCR3.1-MST4-K53R. Primer FLAG-MST-5′ (5′-gccgccatggactacaaggacgacgatgacaaggcccactcgccggtggctg-3′) and primer MST-3′-1165 (5′-ccatcgatcatggagctcatgggttaag-3′) were used to clone the MST4a from PJG-MST4 by PCR and clone MST4 from Marathon-readyTM cDNA by PCR with aCLONTECH PCR Advantage 2 kit. The PCR products were purified by the Qiagen PCR purification kit and subcloned into the TA cloning vector PCR3.1 (Invitrogen) to construct PCR3.1-MST4a and PCR3.1-MST4. Primer FLAG-MST-5′ and primer MST-761 (5′-ctactaagattccgaatcagagccctc-3′) were used to clone the MST4-NT from Placenta Marathon-ready cDNA by PCR. The PCR products were ligated into the TA cloning vector PCR3.1 (Invitrogen) to construct the N-terminal construct PCR3.1-MST4-NT. The FLAG-MST-5′ primer contained the FLAG epitope right after the ATG code and the 19 nucleotides in the 5′-end of MST4. The plasmids were sequenced by the interdisciplinary center for biotechnology research sequencing core laboratory at the University of Florida or by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center DNA sequencing facility. For MST4, FLAG-MST4a, FLAG-MST4, FLAG-MST4-K53R, or FLAG-MST4-NT were transfected into cells, grown in regular medium for 24 h, and starved in serum-free medium or grown in regular medium for 48 h. Following lysis in 1% Triton X-100 buffer, the cell extracts were incubated with protein G beads coated with anti-FLAG M5 antibody for 3 h. The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4., 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmρ-nitrophenyl phosphate). 5 μg of MBP substrate was used per reaction in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was incubated for 25 min at 30 °C and then boiled with sample buffer for 5 min. The reaction products were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (37Abe M.K. Chao T.-S., O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For MAPK assays, either HA-ERK2, HA-JNK, or HA-p38 was expressed in cells along with FLAG-MST4 expression vectors and/or Myc-Raf-1 expression vectors as indicated and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies as above. Kinase activities were monitored by immunoblotting with the appropriate anti-phospho-pTXpY antibodies (New England Biolabs, Boston). Human metaphase cells were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The MST4 probe was a cDNA probe containing full-length MST4a. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (38Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. LeBeau M.M. Espinosa III, R. Vieira J.E. Halayko A.J. Willadsen S. Kurtz B. Ober C. Evans G.A. Thweatt R. Shapiro S. Niu Q. Qin Y. Padrid P.A. Solway J. Genomics. 1998; 49: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled probes were prepared by nick translation using Bio-16-dUTP (Enzo Diagnostics). Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories), and chromosomes were identified by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. A human fetal brain library was employed in a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with Raf. A modified Raf bait was created by mutagenizing the yeast plasmid PEG202 containing the catalytic domain of Raf and selecting for enhanced interaction with MEK1 (see “Materials and Methods”). Using the modified Raf bait plasmid, we obtained two cDNA clones that coded for the same previously uncharacterized cDNA. Sequence analysis showed that both clones encoded a polypeptide of 354 amino acids, which was later termed MST4a (Fig.1). Eukaryotic protein kinases have a common catalytic core structure in their kinase domain, which typically contains 11 conserved subdomains (39Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). Comparison of the MST4a protein sequence with that of MST family members revealed that MST4a lacked part of the kinase domain. In order to see if MST4a might be a splicing variant of a full-length MST cDNA, the kinase subdomains I–XI in MST4 cDNAs from three separate libraries were examined by PCR analysis. As shown in Fig.2 (left panel), two PCR products with different sizes were amplified from a fetal human brain (CLONTECH) cDNA library that was different from the human brain cDNA library used in the original yeast two-hybrid screen as well as from a testes and a placenta library. Sequence analysis indicated that the smaller PCR product had the same sequence as the kinase domain of MST4a, and the larger PCR product had an additional cDNA insert. Subcloning the full-length fragments into an expression vector and subsequent sequencing revealed that the larger PCR product corresponded to the full-length MST cDNA containing the missing IX, X, and XI kinase domains (MST4, Fig. 1). The deduced protein sequence of MST4, consisting of 416 amino acids (Fig. 3 A), has a kinase domain at the N terminus and a regulatory domain at the C terminus. Comparison of the protein sequence of MST4 with other enzyme sequences (Fig. 3 B) indicated that the kinase domain is most closely related to the catalytic domains of Mammalian Ste20-like kinases MST1 (51% identity), MST2 (54% identity), MST3 (65% identity), and SOK1 (63% identity). The C-terminal regulatory domain of MST4 is most similar to the C-terminal domains of MST3 and SOK1.Figure 3Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of human MST4 and sequence alignment between MST4 and other mammalian Ste20-like kinases. A, cDNA and predicted protein sequence of the full-length MST4. B, sequence comparison between MST4 and other members of the MST family.

Interestingly, there is a putative 186-base pair exon corresponding to kinase subdomains IX–XI that, if spliced out of the MST4 mRNA transcript, could account for the sequence found in the truncated MST4a variant. These results suggest that MST4a is likely to be an alternatively spliced form of MST4. When we did a more comprehensive analysis of the tissue distribution of MST4 and MST4a by PCR, we were able to detect both forms in cDNAs from a variety of other adult and fetal human tissues (CLONTECH) including kidney, lung, liver, and pancreas as well as fetal thymus, spleen, muscle, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2, right panel). In most tissues, the major expressed form is MST4, but it appears that MST4a is more highly expressed in the brain. A human multiple tissue Northern blot was used to identify the expression pattern of MST4. Only one mRNA band with a size of 3.6 kilobases was detected. The results showed that MST4is ubiquitously expressed, with strong expression in placenta, weak expression in skeletal muscle and pancreas, and moderate expression in brain, heart, lung, liver, muscle, and kidney. It was not possible to determine the difference in expression of MST4 versus MST4a by this approach, since the difference in size between the two mRNAs is too small to be detected by Northern analysis (Fig.4). To map the MST4 gene, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization using a biotin-labeled MST4 probe on normal human metaphase chromosomes. Hybridization of the MST4 cDNA probe resulted in specific labeling only of the X chromosome (Fig.5). Labeling of Xq25–27 was observed on four (eight cells), three (16 cells), or two (one cell) chromatids of the X chromosome homologues in 25 cells examined from mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from a healthy female. Of 82 signals observed, one signal (1.2%) was located at Xq25, 67 signals (82%) were located at Xq26, and 14 signals (17%) were located at Xq27. No background signals were observed at other chromosomal sites. We also observed a specific signal at Xq26 in an additional hybridization experiment using this probe (data not shown). These results indicate that the MST4 gene is localized to Xq26. This result was later verified by examination of the relative location of the MST4 gene in the X chromosome genomic map.Figure 5In situ hybridization of a biotin-labeled MST4 probe to human metaphase cells from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes.The X chromosome homologues are identified with arrows; specific labeling was observed at Xq26. The inset shows partial karyotypes of two X chromosome homologues illustrating specific labeling at Xq26 (arrows). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope coupled to a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.

To control for nonspecific kinase activity, a kinase-inactive mutant of MST4, MST4-K53R, was also transiently transfected into 293 cells. Following transfection, 293 cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6 B). The immunoprecipitates were then assayed for in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate. The results indicate that MST4 is an active kinase, whereas MST4a did not exhibit kinase activity (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, the kinase activity of MST4 isolated from cells grown in serum-free or serum-containing medium was comparable, indicating that MST4 possesses a high basal kinase activity (Fig. 6 C). Under the same conditions, a phosphoprotein with the same size as MST4 (46 kDa) was also detected in an in vitro kinase reaction when immunoprecipitates containing MST4 but not kinase-inactive MST4 (MST4-K53R) were used, suggesting that MST4 also functions as an autophosphorylating kinase (Fig. 6 C). Since MST4a was isolated by association with the Raf kinase domain in a yeast two-hybrid system, we determined whether MST4 or MST4a associate with c-Raf-1 in cells. Therefore, COS cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for Myc-Raf-1 and FLAG-MST4 or FLAG-MST4a. Raf was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody and analyzed for MST4 association by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Conversely, MST4 or MST4a was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed for Raf association with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 D, no association of c-Raf-1 with MST4 or MST4a was observed. We also determined whether co-expression of Myc-Raf-1 with FLAG-MST4 altered MST4 kinase activity. Consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results, no effect of Raf-1 on MST4 kinase activity was detected (data not shown). These results suggest that MST4 is not stably associated with or modulated by c-Raf-1. Removal of the C-terminal regulatory domain of MST1 and MST2 by caspases results in a significant increase in MST1 or MST2 kinase activity (35Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To address the function of the C-terminal tail of MST4, a cDNA encoding the N-terminal kinase domain of MST4 but lacking the C terminus of the protein (FLAG-MST4-NT) was transfected into COS cells. For comparison, COS cells were also transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-MST4 or FLAG-MST4-K53R. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies, the MST4 proteins were assayed for kinase activity using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 7, FLAG-MST4-NT has reduced kinase activity compared with MST4, indicating that the C-terminal domain acts to enhance MST4 activity. Interestingly, MST4-NT is no longer autophosphorylated, suggesting that the site of autophosphorylation may be in the C-terminal tail of the protein (Fig.7). MST4a was isolated by interaction with the Raf kinase domain and is most closely related to MST3, an enzyme that has been reported by one group to potentiate the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. To determine whether overexpression of MST4 might also activate ERK1 or ERK2, vectors expressing MST4, MST4-K53R or control vector were co-transfected with HA-ERK2 into 293 cells. The tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of transfected cells using an anti-HA antibody, and its kinase activity was assayed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-pTEpY MAPK antibody. A sample from each lysate was assayed directly by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody to confirm the expression of MST4 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8, overexpression of MST4 does not significantly affect the activation of ERK2 in cells grown either in serum or under serum-free conditions. Furthermore, we have also conducted similar experiments involving co-expression of MST4 (or MST4a or MST4-K53R), ERK2, and Myc-Raf-1 to determine whether MST4 can potentiate or inhibit Raf activation of ERK. Again, we could not detect a"

Its role as a ligand for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins is well established (1Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K.

Additionally, apoE interacts with lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase to modulate triglyceride hydrolysis (4Rensen P.C.N. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol.

Studies suggest that apoE directs the intracellular routing of internalized remnant lipoproteins, with smaller β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles routed to the perinuclear region of the mouse macrophage in a fashion similar to low density lipoproteins (LDL), whereas larger β-VLDL remain closer to the plasma membrane (6Tabas I.

ApoE is also linked to and may be a regulator of cholesterol efflux from macrophages (9Kinoshita M. Kawamura M. Maeda T. Fujimaki Y. Fujita M. Kojima K. Teramoto T. J. Atheroscler.

Finally, increasing evidence points to a role for apoE in hepatic lipoprotein assembly and the incorporation of triglycerides into newly forming VLDL (12Huang Y. Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Rall Jr., S.C.

Due to its critical role in a number of biological processes within the cell, apoE may follow unique pathways of secretion and internalization that maximize its impact on cellular functions.Wong (15Wong L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was among the first to suggest that apoE may be recirculated. He reported that 62–66% of the intrahepatic apoE, compared with 7–10% of the intrahepatic apoB, was derived from plasma. This suggested that internalized apoE may not undergo complete degradation and may therefore follow a unique intracellular routing pathway. We previously reported that a portion of the apoE component of internalized lipoproteins is spared degradation and routed through the Golgi apparatus (16Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After injection of radioiodinated moused < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins into C57BL/6 mice, radioactivity found in the Golgi apparatus-rich fractions from livers of the recipient mice was almost exclusively due to apoE, although the injected lipoproteins had less than 10% of their label associated with apoE. The ratio of apoE/apoB48 in the Golgi fraction increased 10-fold relative to serum, and only traces of apoB100 were detected. Furthermore, the apoE recovered in the Golgi fraction was part of ad 1.019–1.210 g/ml complex, indicating an association of recycled apoE with newly formed lipoproteins. Quantitatively, similar results were obtained when labeled VLDL was injected into mice deficient in either apoE or the LDL receptor, indicating that the phenomenon of apoE recycling is not influenced by the production of endogenous apoE and is not dependent on the presence of LDL receptors. Although our studies clearly demonstrated the presence of a mechanismin vivo by which apoE escapes degradation, the appearance of internalized apoE within the liver Golgi may have been influenced in part by the bolus delivery of apoE in this model.To address this issue and to explore hepatic apoE recycling in the steady state, we have completed experiments utilizing an in vivo model based on bone marrow transplantation. Reconstitution of lethally irradiated apoE−/− mice with wild type bone marrow results in a mouse model in which all apoE present in the mouse is derived from macrophages. Our laboratory (17Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) has shown that within 3 weeks of the introduction of normal macrophages into the apoE−/− mouse, serum apoE levels reach 10% of normal, resulting in complete normalization of plasma cholesterol levels by virtue of an active hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins. Since hepatocytes in this model do not produce endogenous apoE but internalize apoE on remnant lipoproteins, this approach provides an excellent model for investigating the routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway via the Golgi apparatus in the absence of endogenously produced apoE. The studies reported in this manuscript demonstrate clearly that internalized apoE undergoes a unique routing through the secretory pathway and is resecreted.DISCUSSIONThe present study explored the recycling of apoE in the livers of apoE−/− mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow. In this model all of the apoE derives from macrophages, and plasma apoE levels are at steady state, with the production of apoE by macrophages and its internalization and potential resecretion by the liver at equilibrium. Therefore any apoE appearing in the secretory pathway in the liver or recovered in the media of hepatocytes isolated from these mice is derived from internalized extrahepatic apoE. Using the BMT model we have demonstrated the presence of apoE within nascent hepatic Golgi lipoproteins, providing strong evidence that at least a portion of internalized extrahepatic apoE is routed to the secretory pathway. Additional studies using primary hepatocytes from the apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice not only confirmed the routing of internalized apoE to the secretory pathway but also demonstrated the resecretion of internalized apoE. These results coupled with our earlier in vivo studies (16Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) provide overwhelming support for the hypothesis that a portion of apoE that is internalized with lipoproteins is not completely degraded but is in fact resecreted. The physiologic relevance of the reutilization and recycling of apoE is unknown. Our studies show that introduction of apoE via BMT does not affect hepatic triglyceride production rates, but the lack of an effect may simply reflect suboptimal concentrations of intracellular recycling apoE. Alternatively, the functional role of recycling apoE may be linked to effects that are independent from or more subtle than the bulk secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.Our finding of apoE with nascent lipoproteins in Golgi apparatus-rich fractions from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice in the present study (Fig. 1) provides definitive evidence for the routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway under physiologic conditions. The finding of apoE within the Golgi fractions was not due to contamination of the preparations with elements of the endocytic compartment, as studies in our laboratory have established the purity of the hepatic Golgi fractions by this technique (18Swift L.L. Valyi-Nagy K. Rowland C. Harris C. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contamination of our fractions with Golgi from Kupffer cells, a possible source of apoE, is not expected to play a role here since engraftment of Kupffer cells in liver is less than 20% at 8 weeks and only ∼35% of total macrophages 6 months after transplantation (23Kennedy D.W. Abkowitz J.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is unlikely that Kupffer cell Golgi apparatus isolates with hepatocyte Golgi apparatus, as Kupffer cells do not produce triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that contribute to the buoyancy of the hepatocyte-derived organelle (24Ehrenreich J.H. Bergeron J.J. Siekevitz P. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 59: 45-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Therefore the appearance of apoE in the hepatic Golgi fractions of the apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice represents routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway.The resecretion of apoE from primary cultures of hepatocytes from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice provided additional evidence for apoE recycling. In contrast to the constitutive pattern of secretion of apoE from hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice, the majority of apoE recovered in the media of hepatocytes from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice was released in the last 24 h (Fig. 4). This release was not caused by cell death, as the cells from both control and transplanted animals appeared healthy after the 45-h culture period. Rensen et al. (25Rensen P.C.N. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), studying the retroendocytosis of apoE from HepG2 cells, report that the presence of high density lipoproteins or lipid emulsion in the media resulted in a significantly increased rate of secretion of intact protein compared with media with no acceptor. Heeren et al. (26Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also report that high density lipoprotein seemed to serve as an extracellular acceptor for the resecretion of apoE from fibroblasts. Although in our experiments the media did not contain an exogenous acceptor to stimulate the release of apoE, the hepatocytes do secrete apoE-deficient VLDL (Fig. 1), which may serve as acceptor for and stimulator of apoE release from hepatocytes. A threshold concentration of apoE-deficient VLDL, attainable only during the 24-h culture period, may be required to trigger the release of apoE. In this regard, it is important to note that apoE recovered in the media is found mainly with the d < 1.006 g/ml lipoproteins (Fig. 6).Although Kupffer cells in our hepatocyte cultures may contribute to the apoE recovered in the media, our data suggest that their contribution is minimal. Immunocytochemical staining using antibody to MOMA-2, an established marker for macrophages, indicates that less than 1–2% of the cells in culture is of macrophage origin. Dawson et al. (27Dawson P.A. Lukaszewski L.M. Ells P.F. Malbon C.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 403-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that Kupffer cells in rat liver account for less than 1% (0.7%) of the total liver apoE mRNA and that the level of apoE mRNA in Kupffer cells was approximately one-third that of hepatocytes. The total recovery of apoE in the media of the hepatocytes from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice is ∼5–6% of apoE recovered in the media from C57BL/6 hepatocytes. Assuming the secretion of apoE is proportional to the apoE mRNA content of the Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, the number of Kupffer cells in our preparation cannot account for the mass of apoE found in the media. In addition, the kinetics of appearance of apoE in the media is not consistent with what might be predicted for a constitutively secreted apoprotein as observed in the secretion of apoE from C57BL/6 hepatocytes, and as noted above, the engraftment of liver Kupffer cells in mice after BMT is less than 20% of total tissue macrophages 8 weeks after transplantation (23Kennedy D.W. Abkowitz J.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally and perhaps most importantly, newly synthesized apoE could not be detected in hepatocyte cultures from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice (Fig.5). Therefore, based on the mass of apoE found in the media, the number of cells identified as Kupffer cells using immunocytochemistry, the secretion kinetics, the kinetics of engraftment of liver Kupffer cells, and the absence of newly synthesized apoE in hepatocyte cultures from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice, we conclude that the apoE recovered in the media does not derive from Kupffer cells but represents recycled apoE.The content of apoE with nascent hepatic Golgi VLDL from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice was ∼6% that found with control Golgi VLDL, and the mass of apoE released from hepatocytes from apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice was ∼6% that of apoE secreted by hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice. Since serum apoE levels in the apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice are ∼10% of control levels (17Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), the results suggest that as much as 60% of the internalized apoE is reutilized. Under normal conditions, when the hepatocyte is faced with 10 times more apoE, the amount of apoE that is recycled may change. Heeren et al. (26Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) incubated radiolabeled apoE-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with Hep3b cells and fibroblasts and demonstrated that ∼60% of the labeled apoprotein internalized by the cell was released intact into the medium after a 90-min chase. The released apoproteins were primarily apoE and apoC. Rensen et al. (25Rensen P.C.N. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also report that as much as 26% of the apoE taken up on triglyceride-rich emulsions by HepG2 cells was released. Finally, Takahashi and Smith (28Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) estimate that as much as 30% of apoE internalized by the murine macrophage RAW 264 cell line was resecreted. It seems clear that the process of apoE sparing and reutilization may be variable among different cells but is not simply limited to the liver and is quantitatively important.The physiologic relevance of apoE reutilization and resecretion is unknown. Recycling may provide a mechanism whereby the impact of apoE on intracellular and extracellular functions can be maximized. Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for apoE in VLDL assembly. Hepatic VLDL triglyceride production is decreased by nearly 50% in the apoE−/− mice compared with C57BL/6 mice (13Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. van Eck M. Havinga R. Blocks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H.

Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 253-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies confirm that hepatic triglyceride production rates are decreased in apoE−/− mice compared with C57BL/6 mice (Fig.7). However, introduction of apoE via BMT did not alter this rate, suggesting that apoE is routed to a site in the secretory pathway distal to VLDL assembly or triglyceride production. Alternatively, introduction of apoE via BMT, an intervention that reconstitutes only 10% of the total serum apoE, may not provide intracellular concentrations of apoE needed to affect hepatic triglyceride production and VLDL secretion. Finally, it is plausible that recycling apoE may have other effects, such as increasing remnant uptake through the secretion-capture mechanism (30Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Further studies are needed to identify the functional correlates of this newly described cellular process. Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1is unique among the plasma lipoprotein apoproteins because of its many different functions in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. Its role as a ligand for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins is well established (1Beisiegel U. Weber W. Ihrke G. Herz J. Stanley K.K.

Additionally, apoE interacts with lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase to modulate triglyceride hydrolysis (4Rensen P.C.N. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14791-14799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E.H. van Gorp P.J.J. Breuer M.L. Mol M.J.T.M. van der Zee A. Frants R.R.

Studies suggest that apoE directs the intracellular routing of internalized remnant lipoproteins, with smaller β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) particles routed to the perinuclear region of the mouse macrophage in a fashion similar to low density lipoproteins (LDL), whereas larger β-VLDL remain closer to the plasma membrane (6Tabas I.

ApoE is also linked to and may be a regulator of cholesterol efflux from macrophages (9Kinoshita M. Kawamura M. Maeda T. Fujimaki Y. Fujita M. Kojima K. Teramoto T. J. Atheroscler.

Finally, increasing evidence points to a role for apoE in hepatic lipoprotein assembly and the incorporation of triglycerides into newly forming VLDL (12Huang Y. Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Rall Jr., S.C.

Due to its critical role in a number of biological processes within the cell, apoE may follow unique pathways of secretion and internalization that maximize its impact on cellular functions. Wong (15Wong L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was among the first to suggest that apoE may be recirculated. He reported that 62–66% of the intrahepatic apoE, compared with 7–10% of the intrahepatic apoB, was derived from plasma. This suggested that internalized apoE may not undergo complete degradation and may therefore follow a unique intracellular routing pathway. We previously reported that a portion of the apoE component of internalized lipoproteins is spared degradation and routed through the Golgi apparatus (16Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After injection of radioiodinated moused < 1.019 g/ml lipoproteins into C57BL/6 mice, radioactivity found in the Golgi apparatus-rich fractions from livers of the recipient mice was almost exclusively due to apoE, although the injected lipoproteins had less than 10% of their label associated with apoE. The ratio of apoE/apoB48 in the Golgi fraction increased 10-fold relative to serum, and only traces of apoB100 were detected. Furthermore, the apoE recovered in the Golgi fraction was part of ad 1.019–1.210 g/ml complex, indicating an association of recycled apoE with newly formed lipoproteins. Quantitatively, similar results were obtained when labeled VLDL was injected into mice deficient in either apoE or the LDL receptor, indicating that the phenomenon of apoE recycling is not influenced by the production of endogenous apoE and is not dependent on the presence of LDL receptors. Although our studies clearly demonstrated the presence of a mechanismin vivo by which apoE escapes degradation, the appearance of internalized apoE within the liver Golgi may have been influenced in part by the bolus delivery of apoE in this model. To address this issue and to explore hepatic apoE recycling in the steady state, we have completed experiments utilizing an in vivo model based on bone marrow transplantation. Reconstitution of lethally irradiated apoE−/− mice with wild type bone marrow results in a mouse model in which all apoE present in the mouse is derived from macrophages. Our laboratory (17Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) has shown that within 3 weeks of the introduction of normal macrophages into the apoE−/− mouse, serum apoE levels reach 10% of normal, resulting in complete normalization of plasma cholesterol levels by virtue of an active hepatic clearance of remnant lipoproteins. Since hepatocytes in this model do not produce endogenous apoE but internalize apoE on remnant lipoproteins, this approach provides an excellent model for investigating the routing of internalized apoE through the secretory pathway via the Golgi apparatus in the absence of endogenously produced apoE. The studies reported in this manuscript demonstrate clearly that internalized apoE undergoes a unique routing through the secretory pathway and is resecreted. DISCUSSIONThe present study explored the recycling of apoE in the livers of apoE−/− mice transplanted with wild type bone marrow. In this model all of the apoE derives from macrophages, and plasma apoE levels are at steady state, with the production of apoE by macrophages and its internalization and potential resecretion by the liver at equilibrium. Therefore any apoE appearing in the secretory pathway in the liver or recovered in the media of hepatocytes isolated from these mice is derived from internalized extrahepatic apoE. Using the BMT model we have demonstrated the presence of apoE within nascent hepatic Golgi lipoproteins, providing strong evidence that at least a portion of internalized extrahepatic apoE is routed to the secretory pathway. Additional studies using primary hepatocytes from the apoE+/+ → apoE−/− mice not only confirmed the routing of internalized apoE to the secretory pathway but also demonstrated the resecretion of internalized apoE. These results coupled with our earlier in vivo studies (16Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) provide overwhelming support for the hypothesis that a portion of apoE that is internalized with lipoproteins is not completely degraded but is in fact r"

Although many studies have correlated the function of HDAC inhibitors with the hyperacetylation of histones, few studies have specifically addressed whether the accumulation of acetylated histones, caused by HDAC inhibitor treatment, is responsible for growth inhibition. In the present study we show that HDAC inhibitors cause growth inhibition in normal and transformed keratinocytes but not in normal dermal fibroblasts. This was despite the observation that the HDAC inhibitor, suberic bishydroxamate (SBHA), caused a kinetically similar accumulation of hyperacetylated histones. This cell type-specific response to SBHA was not due to the inactivation of SBHA by fibroblasts, nor was it due to differences in the expression of specific HDAC family members. Remarkably, overexpression of HDACs 1, 4, and 6 in normal human fibroblasts resulted in cells that could be growth-inhibited by SBHA. These data suggest that, although histone acetylation is a major target for HDAC inhibitors, the accumulation of hyperacetylated histones is not sufficient to cause growth inhibition in all cell types. This suggests that growth inhibition, caused by HDAC inhibitors, may be the culmination of histone hyperacetylation acting in concert with other growth regulatory pathways.

These outcomes to a large extent are cell type-specific and have raised the potential that the HDAC inhibitors may represent a new and important class of anticancer therapeutic agents (4Saunders N.A. Popa C. Serewko M.M. Jones S.J. Dicker A.J. Dahler A.L. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1999; 8: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibitors comprise a diverse range of unrelated compounds that all induce an accumulation of hyperacetylated histones (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). The biological effects of these compounds (e.g. cell cycle arrest, cell death, or differentiation) are thought to result from the accumulation of acetylated histones and transcriptional activation that results from the use of these compounds. For instance, sodium butyrate (NaB), suberic bishydroxamate (SBHA), and trichostatin A (TSA) are all HDAC inhibitors that induce an accumulation of acetylated histone H4 (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar, 22Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3003-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). These agents are also able to induce growth inhibition, which has been shown to be associated causally with an induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in colon carcinoma cells (15Archer S.Y Meng S. Shel A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Although the data for the colon carcinoma cells used in the p21 studies appear compelling, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest that the biological outcomes, in response to the HDAC inhibitors in other cell types, may not be explained simply by an accumulation of acetylated histones. For instance, 1) it has been shown that certain cell types (human dermal fibroblasts or murine erythroleukemia cells) are able to grow in the presence of HDAC inhibitors and in the presence of hyperacetylated histones (6Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar, 18Qiu L. Kelso M.J. Hansen C. West M.L. Fairlie D.P.

Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). 3) Recently it has been suggested that the cell cycle regulator, Rb, mediates its growth inhibitory effects by associating with an HDAC and thus suppressing E2F activity (23Luo R.X. Postigigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 24Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Villain J.P.L.

Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Although this has been convincingly shown in vitro, it should be noted that the E2F activation caused by HDAC inhibitors (23Luo R.X. Postigigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 24Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Villain J.P.L. Troalen F. Trouche D.

Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) is inconsistent with the growth inhibition observed in cells following HDAC inhibitor treatment. 4) Recent studies have shown that nonhistone proteins such as E2F1 (26Martinez-Balbas M. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and p53 (27Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that biological effects of HDAC inhibitors may be, in part, mediated by events independent of the acetylation of histones (30Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). In the present study we wished to examine the relationship between the accumulation of acetylated histones in response to HDAC inhibitors and the induction of growth arrest in keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and SCC25 cells. We report that the induction of acetylated histones in fibroblasts is not associated with growth inhibition. Our data are consistent with a model in which growth inhibition in response to HDAC inhibitors is cell type-specific and dictated by the activity of pre-existing regulatory pathways in the cells.

Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, University of San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). To establish stably expressing HDF cell lines, 75-cm2 flasks of passage 2 HDFs (50% confluent) were transfected with 9 μg of HDAC expression vector + 3 μg of the pSV2neo neomycin expression vector followed by selection with 500 μg/ml G418 (31Jones S.J.

Estimates of apoptosis induced by NaB (3 mm), AAHA (3 μm), or SBHA (100 μm) were determined following a 24-h treatment with the compounds. Apoptosis was estimated using the TUNEL assay as per the manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Brisbane, Queensland (QLD), Australia). Briefly, cells were cultured in 25-cm2 flasks, trypsinized, and then subjected to cytospinning (100 ×g for 2 min) before being used in the TUNEL assay. An apoptotic index was then derived (apoptotic cells/total cells * 100/1). Protein expression and histone acetylation status were determined by immunoblotting. For Rb, p21, acetyllysine, or FLAG-tagged HDAC protein analysis, cells were trypsinized and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4). An aliquot was removed for protein determination, and the remaining protein solubilized in 2× sample buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, 5% glycerol, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Twentyfive micrograms of protein were then run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (16 cm × 18 cm), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies specific for Rb (sc-50; 1:1000), p107 (sc-318; 1:1000), p130 (sc-317; 1:1000), p21 (sc-397; 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia), acetyllysine (06-933; 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Parkville, Victoria, Australia), or anti-FLAG antibody (1 μg/ml; F-3165; Sigma, Sydney, NSW, Australia). To determine histone acetylation status, cells were harvested by trypsinization and histones isolated as described (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). Five micrograms of purified histones were then run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted to PVDF membrane and probed with either an antibody specific for acetylated histone H4 (06-598) or an antibody specific for acetylated lysines (06-933; Upstate Biotechnology Inc, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Purified H2A, H3, and H4 (Roche) were run in separate lanes to confirm the identity of the purified histones. All immunoblots were visualized using a primary antibody dilution of 1:1000 and chemiluminescent detection (ECL; Amersham, Sydney, NSW, Australia) as described (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of acetylation level was determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiographs as described (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells following disruption in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) using previously described protocols (38Dicker A.J. Popa C. Dahler A.L. Serewko M.M.

Enrichment for poly(A)+ RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA) chromatography was then performed as described (40Saunders N.A. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2016-2022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One microgram of poly(A)+ RNA (HEKs and HDFs) was then electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with probes specific for HDACs 1–6 and actin. Probes for specific HDACs were made from restriction digests of the expression plasmids using the following restriction enzymes; HDAC1 = NotI/EcoRI, HDAC2 =XhoI, HDAC3 = EcoRI, HDAC4 =SalI/SacI, HDAC5 =SacI/SacII, HDAC6 =SphI/AvrII. All inserts were gel-purified. Probe labeling with [32P]dCTP (Geneworks, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia), hybridizing, and washing were performed as described previously (41Saunders N.A. Bernacki S.H. Vollberg T.M. Jetten A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A probe against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to normalize for loading inequalities and has been described previously (42Saunders N.A. Smith R.J. Jetten A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 977-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All blots were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak XAR5 film. Images were then captured using a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sydney, NSW, Australia) and imported into Adobe Photoshop. Proliferation was measured directly either by assaying for [3H]thymidine incorporation (43Saunders N.A. Smith R.J. Jetten A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or by an analysis of the cell cycle in propidium iodide-stained cells as described (44Qiu L. Burgess A. Fairlie D.P. Leonard H. Parsons P.G. Gabrielli B.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2069-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Dose response analysis for proliferation suppression by histone deacetylase inhibitors was estimated by nonlinear regression analysis with the following equationP =P0e−k[I], whereP = DNA synthesis, P0 = DNA synthesis in the absence of inhibitor, k = rate constant defining the inhibition DNA synthesis, and [I] = the concentration of HDAC inhibitor (39Saunders N.A. Dicker A.J. Jones S.J. Dahler A.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1646-1649PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-response analysis for the accumulation of acetylated histones was estimated by nonlinear regression analysis using the following equation: Ac = (Acmax * EC50)/(EC50 + [I]) where Ac = the acetylation level, Acmax = the maximal amount of histone acetylation, EC50 = the concentration at which acetylation is half-maximal and [I] = the concentration of HDAC inhibitor. All data were fitted using GraphPad Prism software (Brisbane, QLD, Australia). We have shown previously that the histone deacetylase inhibitors NaB and TSA are able to inhibit DNA synthesis in keratinocytes and a number of keratinocyte-derived squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (21Saunders N. Dicker A. Popa C. Jones S. Dahler A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 399-404PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of keratinocytes and SCC25 cells with varying concentrations of NaB, R-PB, S-PB, AAHA, SBHA, or the hybrid polar compound, HMBA, indicated that only NaB, AAHA, and SBHA induced growth inhibition (Table I). Dose-response analysis indicated that NaB and AAHA were slightly more potent at inducing growth arrest in keratinocytes than in SCC25 cells (Table I). In contrast, the EC50 value for the inhibition of DNA synthesis by SBHA in HEKs and SCC25 cells was similar (Table I). A dose-response profile for the inhibition of DNA synthesis by R-PB or S-PB in HEKs and SCC25 cells was not possible despite analysis out to 6 mm. A modest inhibition of DNA synthesis with R-PB and S-PB was noted only at the 6 mm concentration in HEKs (R-PB, 40 ± 13%; and S-PB, 53 ± 24% that of untreated controls) and SCC25 cells (R-PB, 112 ± 14%; and S-PB, 122 ± 6% that of untreated controls). In contrast, these agents were not able to inhibit DNA synthesis in HDFs (Table II). In fact, NaB and AAHA, at high concentration, significantly increased DNA synthesis in the HDFs (Table II). However, growth inhibition of HDFs can eventually be induced by prolonged exposure (48 h) to high concentrations of SBHA (300 μm). Furthermore, the insensitivity of HDFs to SBHA could be altered by changing media composition (data not shown). Combined, these data clearly show that keratinocytes and the keratinocyte-derived carcinoma cell line are sensitive to the growth inhibitory properties of histone deacetylase inhibitors whereas fibroblasts remain insensitive under similar conditions.Table IIC50 values for various histone deacetylase inhibitors for the inhibition of growth in keratinocytes or SCC25 cellsHEKSCC25NaB0.26 ± 0.11 mm1.28 ± 0.24 mmR-PBS-PBAAHA0.68 ± 0.21 μm3.9 ± 3.8 μmSBHA11.7 ± 8.46 μm5.39 ± 5.6 μmHMBAProliferating keratinocytes (HEK) or squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCC25) were treated with varying concentrations of the indicated compounds for 24 h.

Cell cycle analysis of keratinocytes treated with varying concentrations of SBHA for 24 h indicated that the decrease in DNA synthesis observed in these cells (Table I) was associated with an accumulation in G0/G1 phase (TableIII). Consistent with the results of the DNA synthesis assay in HDFs, the cell cycle analysis did not reveal any specific blockade of the cell cycle (Table III). There was a decrease in the percentage of HDFs in G2/M phase following treatment with 100 μm SBHA, which suggests that SBHA may reduce transit time through G2/M phase and may be consistent with the modest increase in DNA synthesis observed in HDFs following SBHA treatment (Table II). Interestingly, the cell cycle profile observed in SCC25 cells treated with 100 μm SBHA showed an accumulation in the G2/M phase with a lesser, if any, accumulation of cells in G0/G1 (Table III). This contrasts with the findings observed in HEKs and suggests that different mechanisms of action may be invoked by SBHA treatment of keratinocytes and transformed keratinocytes. It should be noted that, following treatment with SBHA, ∼30–50% of SCC25 became detached, which is consistent with cell death. A similar result has been described previously for these cells (44Qiu L. Burgess A. Fairlie D.P. Leonard H. Parsons P.G. Gabrielli B.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2069-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, the findings in the SCC25 cells most likely represent a combination of a G2/M accumulation of SBHA-treated cells and the induction of cell death.Table IIICell cycle analysis on human dermal fibroblasts, SCC25 cells, and human epidermal keratinocytes treated with varying concentrations of SBHA[SBHA]G0/G1SG2/MHuman dermal fibroblasts0 μm49.9%20.9%29.2%1 μm49.0%23.3%27.7%3 μm47.6%22.3%30.1%10 μm45.7%24.2%30.0%30 μm53.3%20.2%26.4%100 μm56.6%24.1%19.3%Human epidermal keratinocytes0 μm60.5%21.9%17.6%1 μm56.1%29.6%14.3%3 μm57.1%27.8%15.1%10 μm64.0%16.1%20.0%30 μm64.6%14.5%20.9%100 μm71.4%7.2%21.4%SCC25 cells0 μm44.0%43.5%12.5%1 μm41.6%43.8%14.6%3 μm42.6%41.2%16.2%10 μm40.5%45.1%14.3%30 μm40.0%43.1%16.9%100 μm45.5%32.5%22.0%Proliferating cells were treated with varying concentrations of SBHA for 24 h.

The full-length SMRT (SMRTe) contains an N-terminal sequence that is highly conserved to the nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR. To date, little is known about the activity and function of the full-length SMRTe protein, despite extensive studies on separated receptor interaction and transcriptional repression domains. Here we show that SMRTe inhibits MEF2C transcriptional activation by targeting selective HDACs to unique subnuclear domains. Indirect immunofluorescence studies with anti-SMRTe antibody reveal discrete cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles, which contain RARα in an RA-sensitive manner. Formation of the SMRTe nuclear speckles results in recruitment of several class I and class II HDACs to these subnuclear domains in a process depending on HDAC enzymatic activity. Intriguingly, although HDAC4 is located primarily in the cytoplasm, coexpression of SMRTe dramatically translocates HDAC4 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where HDAC4 prevents MEF2C from activating muscle differentiation. SMRTe also translocates HDAC5 from diffusive nucleoplasm into discrete nuclear domains. Accordingly, SMRTe synergizes with HDAC4 and 5 to inhibit MEF2C transactivation of target promoter, suggesting that nuclear domain targeting of HDAC4/5 may be important in preventing muscle cell differentiation. These results highlight an unexpected new function of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRTe for its role in regulating cellular trafficking of nuclear receptor and selective HDACs that may play an important role in regulation of cell growth and differentiation.

The transcriptional activity of these receptors is regulated by interactions with coactivators and corepressors, depending on the presence or absence of ligands, respectively. In the absence of ligand, retinoic acid (RA)1 and thyroid hormone receptors (RARα and TRβ) interact with the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR (1Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, corepressors dissociate from the liganded receptors due to a conformational change in the receptors. The liganded receptors bind the coactivators through a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the receptor's ligand-binding domain (3Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Prominent among the coactivators is the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family that includes SRC-1, TIF2/GRIP1, and RAC3/ACTR/AIB1 (3Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It is believed that the exchange of corepressor with coactivator in response to ligand underlies a basic principle of transcriptional regulation by steroid/nuclear hormone receptors. SMRT and N-CoR are two distinct, but highly related proteins that share similar domain structure and function (1Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the cloning of a full-length SMRT, designated SMRTe (SMRT-extended). SMRTe contains an N-terminal sequence that is highly related to N-CoR, including a SANT domain (4Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Currently, the biological function of this N-terminal domain remains unknown. cSMRT represents a dominant negative mutant that contains only the receptor-interacting domain (5Chen J.D. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), similar to the dominant negative N-CoRi (6Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SMRT and N-CoR also interact with other transcriptional regulators, such as Pit-1 (7Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R.

HDACs can be subdivided into two classes based on size and sequence considerations (15Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The first class (I) contains HDAC1, 2, and 3, which are smaller in size and related in sequence to the yeast RPD3. The second class (II) contains HDAC4, 5, 6, and 7, which are larger in size and related in sequence to the yeast HDA1. HDAC catalyzes removal of acetyl-groups from hyperacetylated histone, and this deacetylation process leads to modification of nucleosome structure, resulting in transcriptional silencing (16Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). To understand the activity and function of the full-length SMRTe, we have analyzed the expression, cellular distribution, and in vivo association of SMRTe with RARα and HDACs. SMRTe is differentially expressed in cancer cells and appears to be down-regulated by all-trans-RA. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis reveals localization of SMRTe in discrete cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles. In contrast, the dominant negative cSMRT is diffusely located in the cytoplasm, partly explaining its dominant negative activity. Double-label immunofluorescence reveals in vivoassociation of SMRTe with RARα and HDAC1, 3, 4, and 5. We show that the association of SMRTe with RARα is atRA-sensitive, whereas the association with HDAC1 depends on HDAC enzymatic activity. Remarkably, SMRTe also mediates nuclear translocation of HDAC4 from the cytoplasm and nuclear domain targeting of both HDAC4 and HDAC5 to SMRTe nuclear speckles. Cotransfection experiments demonstrate a synergistic inhibition by SMRTe and HDAC4/5 on MEF2C-mediated transcriptional activation. Therefore, these data suggest a new function of SMRTe in cellular trafficking and a potentially novel mechanism for SMRTe-mediated transcriptional inhibition. The full-length human SMRTe was constructed by assembling the N-terminal-extended sequence (4Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The anti-FLAG M2 and the anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Kodak and/or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The fluorescein- or rhodamine-coupled goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Rockland and Chemicon. The in vitrotranscription/translation reactions were conducted by the T7-Quick reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Inc.). N-CoR, SMRT, SMRTe, and cSMRT are all in the pCMX vector under the regulation of T7 and cytomegalovirus promoters. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min according to the manufacturer's instruction. A Western blot was conducted using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-SMRTe monoclonal antibodies were provided by GeneTex (San Antonio, TX). Total cell lysate were prepared by lysing cells directly in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After blotting and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, the blot was developed by ECL reagents and subjected to autoradiography. For Northern blotting, the cancer cell Northern blot was purchased fromCLONTECH. The blot was hybridized with indicated32P-labeled DNA probes that were generated by random priming reactions (Ambion, Inc.). HeLa cells were seeded on coverglasses in 12-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were fixed in a methanol:acetic acid (1:1, v/v) mixture and processed for indirect immunofluorescence staining as previously described (19Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Cell nuclei were costained with the DNA dye DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride hydrate, Sigma Chemical Co.). Coverglasses were mounted with a ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Standard epifluorescence microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX-70 deconvolution microscope equipped with a back-illuminated cool charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Scientific Instruments), and the image was processed using the MetaMorph software (University Imaging Corp.). HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day prior to transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well plates, and transient transfection was performed using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Transfection was continued for 12 h, and the precipitates were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. After transfection, cells were grown for 38–40 h and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as previously described (20Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was determined with an MLX plate luminometer (Dynex) and normalized with the cotransfected β-galactosidase activity. The full-length human and mouse SMRTe (4Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) contains an N-terminal sequence of 1012 amino acids (aa) that is extended from the original SMRT sequence (1Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). This full-length human SMRTe was assembled and transcribed/translated in vitro, and the 35S-labeled product was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in relation to N-CoR, SMRT, and cSMRT (Fig.1 B). The largest polypeptide migrated as a 270-kDa protein (lane 3), which is very similar in size to N-CoR and is much larger than SMRT and cSMRT. Transfection of SMRTe in mammalian cells also produced similar protein as detected by Western blotting using anti-SMRTe antibody (lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, the endogenous SMRTe was readily detectable in cell lysate prepared from HeLa, MCF7, T47D, and CV-1 cells, as well as from HBL100, 293T, and SWI-3 cells, albeit at slightly lower levels (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, we found that SMRTe expression appeared to be down-regulated by all-trans-RA in NB4 leukemic cells (Fig.1 D). These data indicate that SMRTe encodes a full-length protein of 270 kDa that is differentially expressed in cancer cells and negatively regulated by RA. To analyze the SMRTe mRNA levels in cancer cells, we conducted Northern blotting of various cancer cells with three different regions of SMRTe as probes (Fig. 1 E). All probes detected a 9.5-kb band. This SMRTe message was expressed most abundantly in HeLa and SW480 cells, consistent with the Western blot data. Interestingly, the SMRTe probe covering the N-terminal conserved SNC-SANT domain detected an additional band of 7.5 kb. This 7.5-kb message was also expressed abundantly in HeLa and SW480 cells but was absent in MOLT-4 and A549 cells. By contrast, N-CoRwas expressed as an 8.5-kb message that migrated between these two SMRTe bands. N-CoR expression was also most abundant in HeLa and SW480 cells, suggesting coordinated regulation of SMRTe andN-CoR expression is possible. To help understand the function of SMRTe, we analyzed the subcellular localizations of full-length SMRTe and several SMRTe fragments in mammalian cells by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig.2). We found that a majority of full-length SMRTe-transfected cells (80–90%) displayed exclusive nuclear speckle staining (Fig. 2 a), whereas about 10–20% of transfected cells displayed overall speckle pattern in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments (Fig.3 A, a). Similarly, immunostaining of endogenous SMRTe also revealed nuclear speckle pattern, suggesting that such nuclear speckles are not an artifact of protein overexpression. The existence of endogenous cytoplasmic SMRTe is not conclusive due to high background of cytoplasmic staining with the available antibodies.Figure 3Ligand-independent colocalization of RAR α with SMRTe. A, SMRTe sequesters RARα in the cytoplasmic speckles in the absence (−) (a–c), but not the presence (+), of atRA (d–f). SMRTe and HA-tagged hRARα were double-labeled with rabbit anti-SMRTe and mouse anti-HA antibodies, followed by fluorescein (green) or rhodamine (red)-coupled secondary antibodies, respectively. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pCMX-hSMRTe and pCMX-hRARα followed by 1 μm atRA treatment for 24 h before immunostaining. B, cSMRT sequesters Gal4-RARα in the cytoplasm in an RA-sensitive manner. pCMX-cSMRT and pCMX-Gal4-RARα were cotransfected in HeLa cells. Gal4-RARα was detected by mouse anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain monoclonal antibodies (red) and the cSMRT with rabbit anti-SMRTe polyclonal antibodies (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then wished to determine the domain that determines SMRTe speckle localization by analyzing a series of SMRTe deletion mutants (Fig.1 A). The N-terminal extended domain between amino acids 1 and 1109 was located exclusively in the nucleus in a diffuse pattern, suggesting that this domain contains nuclear localization signal but lacks the speckle signal. Interestingly, the highly conserved SNC-SANT domain was located mainly in the cytoplasm, indicating that nuclear localization signal is located outside of the SNC-SANT region. The original SMRT protein without the N-terminal extended domain was distributed mainly in nuclear speckles in a manner that is similar to SMRTe and consistent with an intact corepressor function. Furthermore, the repression domain 3 (RD3, formally SRD1 (21Li H. Leo C. Schroen D.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) was located exclusively in the nucleus with speckles, indicating that this domain contains a separated nuclear localization signal and a potential speckle localization signal. In contrast, the RD4 domain (formally SRD2 (21Li H. Leo C. Schroen D.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) was located exclusively in the cytoplasm with a pronounced speckle pattern, suggesting that the RD4 contains a cytoplasmic speckle signal. Interestingly, the nuclear receptor interacting domain alone (cSMRT) displayed a diffuse, mostly cytoplasmic staining, indicating that it lacks a nuclear localization signal. The speckle localization pattern of SMRTe prompted us to investigate whether the SMRTe nuclear speckles correspond to any known nuclear structures. We found no evidence of colocalization between SMRTe and the splicing factor SC35, nor did SMRTe colocalize with the promyelocyte oncogenic domains revealed by anti-Daxx staining (19Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). SMRTe staining was also not observed in the nucleoli, condensed chromatin, or centromeres (data not shown), suggesting that these SMRTe nuclear speckles represent a novel class of nuclear structures. These data also suggest that SMRTe contains multiple sequences for regulating its precise subcellular localization. To provide evidence for a role of SMRTe in RA signaling, we examined the association of SMRTe with RARα in vivo in the absence or presence of RA (Fig. 3 A). As previously reported, RARα alone was distributed diffusely in nucleoplasm (data not shown). Interestingly, coexpression with SMRTe redistributed RARα into both the cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles in the absence of ligand (a–c), demonstrating an in vivo interaction between full-length SMRTe and unliganded RARα. Interestingly, atRA treatment abolished this colocalization, leading to exclusive nuclear staining of RARα without affecting the SMRTe localization (d–f). This observation is consistent with previous in vitro evidence that atRA induces dissociation of SMRT from the receptor (1Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). As a control, no cytoplasmic colocalization between SMRTe and RXRα was observed (data not shown), indicating specificity of this assay. The dominant negative mutant cSMRT, which only contains the nuclear receptor interaction domain, antagonizes transcriptional repression by Gal4-RARα fusion protein (1Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Because cSMRT is located primarily in the cytoplasm, we speculated that this cytoplasmic cSMRT might either sequester unliganded Gal4-RARα in the cytoplasm or be translocated into the nucleus by Gal4-RARα. This was tested by double immunofluorescence staining of cSMRT and Gal4-RARα (Fig.3 B). As previously reported, Gal4-RARα alone was located exclusively in the nucleus (data not shown). Remarkably, cSMRT sequestered the Gal4-RARα to the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand (a–c), and all-trans-RA treatment partially released this sequestration, rendering accumulated nuclear localization of Gal4-RARα (d–f). These data suggest that SMRTe can interact with unliganded RARα in vivo and that atRA can disrupt this interaction. These data also suggest that cellular compartmentalization may contribute to the dominant negative effect of cSMRT. Transcriptional repression by the unliganded nuclear receptors involves the recruitment of HDACs to target promoter by the corepressors. Biochemical evidence suggests that HDAC1 and 2 and mSin3A form a complex in vivo(22Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E.

Nonetheless, the purified complexes mSin3A·HDAC1 and mSin3A·HDAC2 do not contain SMRTe or N-CoR (24Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and SMRTe and N-CoR complexes contain only HDAC3 (25Li J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 26Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R.

A. 2000; 97: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To understand this complexity and also to characterize potential SMRTe interactions with class I HDACs, we analyzed their association in vivo (Fig.4 A). In the absence of SMRTe, HDACs 1, 2, and 3 were located diffusely in the nucleoplasm (a, e, i). Interestingly, coexpression of SMRTe caused a distribution of HDAC1 (b–d) and HDAC3 (j–l), but not HDAC2 (f–h) or mSin3A (n–p) to distinctive SMRTe nuclear speckles. We noted that HDAC3 coexpression appeared to partially distort the structure of the SMRTe nuclear speckles. Because SMRTe colocalizes with HDAC1 and HDAC3 in the absence of mSin3A, and because SMRTe does not colocalize with mSin3A, these data suggest a mSin3-independent mechanism of interaction between SMRTe and HDAC1 and 3 in vivo. To further analyze the interaction between HDAC1 and SMRTe, we tested this colocalization with three HDAC1 point mutants whose HDAC enzymatic activities have been disrupted to various degrees (15Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The HDAC enzymatic activity depends on conserved residues within the catalytic domain, and point mutation of these residues disrupts HDAC activity (15Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Three HDAC1 point mutants, H141A, H199A, and D176N that are either partially defective (H141A) or completely void (H199A and D176N) of HDAC activity were analyzed (Fig. 4 B). We found that only the partially defective mutant H141A remained associated with SMRTe nuclear speckles in this assay (a–c), whereas both H199A (d–f) and D176N (g–i) mutants, which lack HDAC activity completely, failed to interact with SMRTe. These data indicate that the enzymatic activity of HDAC1 may be critical in the recruitment of HDAC1 to SMRTe nuclear speckles. Recently, members of the class II HDACs were identified as proteins that also interact with SMRT (13Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to confirm these interactions in vivo in the double immunofluorescence assay (Fig.5 A). Consistent with a previous report (17Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), HDAC4 alone was located primarily in the cytoplasm (a). Strikingly, cotransfection with SMRTe enhanced translocation of HDAC4 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it colocalized precisely with the SMRTe nuclear speckles (b–d). We estimated that, in the absence of SMRTe, about 70% of the transfected cells contained dormant cytoplasmic HDAC4, and 30% contained approximately equal HDAC4 staining in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5 B). Strikingly, coexpression of SMRTe translocated 92% of HDAC4 into nuclear speckles, suggesting a mechanism of SMRTe-dependent nuclear import and nuclear domain targeting of HDAC4. This SMRTe-mediated nuclear import of the wild type HDAC4 was even more pronounced than the HDAC4 mutation S246A/S467A/S632A that abolishes 14-3-3 binding in the cytoplasm (17Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The HDAC4 S246A/S467A/S632A mutant also colocalized with SMRTe nuclear domain (data not shown), suggesting SMRTe may play a role in the cytoplasmic-nuclear domain trafficking of HDAC4. Similarly, we analyzed the colocalization of HDAC5 and SMRTe by double immunofluorescence assay. HDAC5 alone was located diffusely in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5 A, e). There were only about 4% of HDAC5-transfected cells that contained dominant cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5 C). Strikingly, coexpression of SMRTe translocated HDAC5 almost completely from diffuse nucleoplasm staining into nuclear speckles (Fig. 5 A, f–h, Fig.5 C), again suggesting a SMRTe-dependent nuclear domain targeting of HDAC5. We also tested the interaction of SMRTe with HDAC6 and found that HDAC6 was located exclusively in the cytoplasm and did not show interaction with SMRTe (Fig. 5 A,i–l). Overall, it can be concluded that SMRTe selectively interacts with certain members of class II HDACs, and it may play an important role in regulating nuclear import of HDAC4, as well as nuclear domain targeting of HDAC4 and 5. MEF2C-mediated transcriptional activation is required for muscle cell differentiation, and such transcriptional activation is inhibited by overexpression of HDAC4 and 5 (28Youn H.D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22563-22567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because SMRTe enhances translocation of cytoplasmic HDAC4 into the nucleus, where HDAC4 can interact with MEF2C and inhibit its transcriptional activity, we speculated that SMRTe might facilitate the ability of HDAC4 to inhibit MEF2C function by promoting nuclear localization of HDAC4. This possibility was tested by cotransfection of SMRTe and HDAC4 to determine their effects on MEF2C-dependent activation of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 6). Consistent with previous findings (18Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 30Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we found that MEF2C alone strongly activated reporter gene expression 40- to 100-fold and that HDAC4 and 5 inhibited this activation by 2- and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 did not have much effect on MEF2C function. On the other hand, SMRTe alone also had only minor effect on the MEF2C activity (Fig. 6 B). However, cotransfection of SMRTe and HDAC4 synergistically inhibited MEF2C activity by 20-fold. Similar effect was observed by coexpression of SMRTe and HDAC5, demonstrating that SMRTe may synergize with HDAC4 and 5 to inhibit MEF2C-dependent transcriptional activation of target promoter. Therefore, the inhibition of MEF2C transcriptional activation appears to correlate well with targeting of HDAC4 and 5 to SMRTe nuclear domains. The corepressors SMRT and N-CoR interact with DNA-bound nuclear receptors to mediate transcriptional repression by a mechanism involving histone deacetylation. In this study, we have analyzed the subcellular localization and expression of full-length SMRTe and characterized the association of SMRTe with RARα and HDACs in vivo. We found that SMRTe is localized within discrete cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles, and such localization results in recruitment of unliganded RARα and selective HDACs to these nuclear domains. Recruitment of HDAC1 to SMRTe speckles depends on its histone deacetylase activity, suggesting a potential role for SMRTe in regulating histone deacetylation. SMRTe actively translocates HDAC4 from cytoplasm into the nucleus, and HDAC5 from nucleoplasm into nuclear speckles. Accordingly, cotransfection of SMRTe with HDAC4 or 5 synergistically inhibits MEF2C transcriptional activation. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which SMRTe inhibits MEF2C transcriptional activity by recruiting HDAC4 and 5 to specific nuclear domains. SMRTe is a unique full-length corepressor that contains an extended N-terminal domain longer than the previously reported sequence (4Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SMRTe is almost identical to SMRTα (31Ordentlich P. Downes M. Xie W. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), except that it lacks a 17-aa insert at residue 721, it contains an extra 8-aa insert at residue 1016, and it has a correct reading frame for 5 aa starting from nucleotides 2360, as well as several single aa polymorphisms. Our assembled SMRTe vector encodes a full-length protein in vitro and in vivo that is similar in size to in vitro translated N-CoR and the endogenous SMRTe. We also identified a shorter SMRTe message that appears to contain the conserved SNC-SANT domain. However, it is currently unclear whether this message represents the reported SMRTβ (31Ordentlich P. Downes M. Xie W. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or other members of the SMRT/N-CoR family. Northern blot analysis reveals that the expression levels of SMRTe and N-CoR are coordinated in different cancer cells, suggesting that these two proteins may function together. Recent data also suggest that SMRTe is not sufficient to complement the function of N-CoR in mice, because “knock-out” of theN-CoR gene resulted in embryonic lethality (32Jepsen K. Hermanson O. Onami T.M. Gleiberman A.S. Lunyak V. McEvilly R.J. Kurokawa R. Kumar V. Liu F. Seto E. Hedrick S.M. Mandel G. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two corepressors are not functionally redundant. By indirect immunofluorescence analysis we show that the full-length SMRTe protein is localized at discrete cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles. The identity and biological function of these speckles remains unknown. We found that the N-terminal extended domain and the RD3 of SMRTe are localized exclusively in the nucleus, suggesting that multiple nuclear localization signals may be involved in nuclear localization of SMRTe. In addition to nuclear localization, RD3 also appears to contribute to speckled nuclear localization. In contrast, RD4 is responsible for speckled cytoplasmic localization, and cSMRT appears to lack both nuclear and speckle localization signals. Recently, phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinases has been shown to cause cytoplasmic localization of SMRT (33Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting a complex signaling pathway that regulates SMRTe localization. The colocalization of unliganded RARα with SMRTe in the cytoplasmic and nuclear speckles confirms the reported interaction of these two proteins in vivo. Because RARα alone is diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm, and because the speckled pattern of SMRTe is independent of RARα, these data suggest that SMRTe recruits RARα into these speckles. The dissociation of RARα from the SMRTe cytoplasmic speckles upon atRA treatment confirms the proposed theory of ligand-dependent dissociation of RARα from the corepressor. It appears that the presumed “SMRTe-free” RARα can be readily transported into the nucleus. However, it is not clear whether the presence of cytoplasmic RARα is due to nuclear export or regulated import by SMRTe. It is intriguing to note that TRβ also undergoes a thyroid hormone-enhanced nuclear translocation (34Zhu X.G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Based on these findings it is reasonable to speculate that SMRTe might be responsible for regulating nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of unliganded TRβ and RARα. In addition, we found that cSMRT is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it can block nuclear localization of Gal4-RARα, suggesting that cellular compartmentalization may in part contribute to the dominant negative activity of cSMRT. Transcriptional repression by DNA binding proteins involves a series of protein·protein interactions with corepressors such as SMRT, N-CoR, and HDACs. In this study, we have also confirmed the interactions of SMRTe with HDAC1, 3, 4, and 5; however, we have found that SMRTe does not colocalize with HDAC2, HDAC6, and mSin3A. Interestingly, SMRTe can recruit the interacting HDACs into discrete nuclear speckles. The colocalization of HDAC3, 4, and 5 with SMRTe is consistent with previous biochemical findings. In particular, HDAC3 has been shown to form a stable complex with SMRT and N-CoR (25Li J. Wang J. Nawaz Z. Liu J.M. Qin J. Wong J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 26Guenther M.G. Lane W.S. Fischle W. Verdin E. Lazar M.A. Shiekhattar R.

A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The colocalization of SMRTe with HDAC1, but not HDAC2 or mSin3A, is somewhat unexpected, because HDAC1 has been reported to form a complex with SMRT indirectly via interaction with mSin3A (10Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Therefore, we suggest that HDAC1 may interact with SMRTe in vivo in an mSin3A-independent manner. Perhaps protein modifications or a yet-to-be-identified protein/factor might stabilize this in vivo interaction between HDAC1 and SMRTe. Support for an active role of SMRTe in regulating histone deacetylation comes from observations that localization of HDAC1 to SMRTe nuclear speckles depends on the histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1. Similarly, it was recently reported that HDAC5 and 7 mutants, when lacking HDAC activity, as well as the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and sodium butyrate, can disrupt colocalization of HDAC5 and 7 with SMRTα (36Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest an important role for SMRTe/α in organizing a novel nuclear domain that may be implicated in histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression. Finally, we have revealed a functional interaction between HDAC4 and SMRTe, suggesting a new role for SMRTe in regulating cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking, which might be independent of its nuclear corepressor function. In the absence of SMRTe, HDAC4 is localized in the cytoplasm due to 14-3-3 binding (17Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). SMRTe induces a dramatic translocation of the cytoplasmic HDAC4 into the nucleus. In the nucleus, HDAC4 can interact with MEF2C and inhibit its transcriptional activity that is required for muscle cell differentiation (17Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Indeed, coexpression of SMRTe and HDAC4 abolishes MEF2C transcriptional activity. This synergistic inhibition is likely due to enhanced accumulation of HDAC4 in the nucleus. Contrasting to HDAC4, HDAC5 is distributed diffusely in the nucleoplasm in the absence of SMRTe, consistent with its stronger inhibitory effect on MEF2C activity. We have found that SMRTe also recruits HDAC5 into nuclear speckles, correlating with an enhancement of HDAC5-mediated transcriptional inhibition on MEF2C function by SMRTe. This observation suggests that HDAC5 localization to SMRTe nuclear domains might further suppress MEF2C activity. Because SMRTe also recruits HDAC4 into the nuclear speckles, it is conceivable that SMRTe nuclear domains may play an active role in antagonizing transcriptional activation. It was reported recently that HDAC4 and 5 are exported from the nucleus during muscle cell differentiation via a process controlled by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (37McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Thereby, phosphorylation of HDAC4 and 5 and/or SMRTe by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases might disrupt HDAC·SMRTe interaction, leading to segregation and subsequent export of HDAC4 and 5. Alternatively, this signal-dependent phosphorylation event might trigger nuclear export of the entire SMRTe·HDAC complex. Although it is clear that nuclear export of HDAC4 and 5 accompanies MEF2C activation and muscle cell differentiation, little is known about how HDAC4 and 5 are imported and maintained in the nucleus. Our data suggest, for the first time, a mechanism of SMRTe-mediated nuclear import of HDAC4 and nuclear domain targeting of HDAC4 and 5. We believe that this mechanism may provide an important piece of the puzzle for understanding signal-dependent muscle cell differentiation. Consistently, N-CoR interacts with MyoD and inhibits muscle cell differentiation (38Bailey P. Downes M. Lau P. Harris J. Chen S.L. Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1155-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that nuclear receptor corepressors may enhance transcriptional repression by targeting selective HDACs to specific nuclear domains, leading to long-term repression of muscle-specific genes. We speculate that this strategy may be prototypic for regulating the activity of other SMRTe-interacting proteins, and it now poses the challenge to further define the exact mechanism of gene regulation by the SMRTe nuclear domains.

The purified wild type proteins and a version of HPV11 E1 lacking the N-terminal 71 amino acids, which was better expressed, were found to be hexameric over a wide range of concentrations and to have helicase and ATPase activities with relatively low values for Km(ATP) of 12 μm for HPV6 E1 and 6 μm for HPV11 E1. Interestingly, the value of Km(ATP) was increased 7-fold in the presence of the E2 transactivation domain. In turn, ATP was found to perturb the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to DNA. Mutant and truncated versions of in vitro translated E1 were used to identify a minimal ATPase domain composed of the C-terminal 297 amino acids.

There are over 100 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), which cause conditions ranging from plantar warts (HPV1) and genital warts (HPV6 and -11) to cervical cancer (HPV16, -18, and -31). HPV6 and -11 are also responsible for laryngeal papillomatosis, a rare but very serious infection of the respiratory tract (1Shah K.V. Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2077-2109Google Scholar). Antiviral agents capable of specifically inhibiting PV replication could play an important role in the treatment of these diseases, but none exist at this time. Despite their host and tissue specificity, all of the PV types share a common genomic organization. The closed, circular genome of ∼8000 base pairs codes for only 10 proteins: eight early proteins termed E1–E8 and two late proteins, L1 and L2, that make up the viral coat (2Howley P.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2045-2076Google Scholar). E1 and E2 are the only viral proteins required for HPV DNA replication (3Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 4Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). E2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that serves to regulate both transcription and DNA replication. E1, a DNA helicase, is the only PV protein that possesses enzymatic activity (5Yang L. Mohr I. Fouts E. Lim D.A. Nohaile M. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5086-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and is also the most highly conserved of the PV proteins. For these reasons, E1 has been considered as the most attractive molecular target for the development of antiviral agents (6Phelps W.C. Barnes J.A. Lobe D.C. Antiviral. Chem. Chemother. 1998; 9: 359-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During the initiation of PV DNA replication, E2 serves as a specificity factor to enhance binding of E1 monomers to the origin, which by themselves bind to double-stranded DNA with little sequence specificity (4Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 7Frattini M.G. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E2 dimers bind with high specificity to DNA sequences within the origin and recruit to it E1 monomers, through direct protein-protein interactions (12Blitz I.L. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 649-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lusky M. Fontane E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6363-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon binding to DNA, E1 monomers assemble into hexamers (14Liu J.S. Kuo S.R. Makhov A.M. Cyr D.M. Griffith J.D. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30704-30712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Fouts E.T., Yu, X. Egelman E.H. Botchan M.R. J. Biol.

Thus, the role of E2 is to catalyze the assembly of hexameric E1 complexes specifically at the origin. ATP hydrolysis is also required for E1 hexamers to distort the origin and encircle single strands of DNA (18Gillette T.G. Lusky M. Borowiec J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using in vitro translated HPV11 proteins, we have previously shown that ATP binding stimulates the E2-dependent association of E1 with the origin (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP binding does not affect the E2 binding step or the E1-E2 interaction but rather a subsequent process, either oligomerization and binding of E1 to DNA or the stability of the assembled E1-origin DNA complex (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Titolo S. Pelletier A. Pulichino A.M.

ATP hydrolysis is not required in this case, since the nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS and ADP have similar effects. For BPV, it has been demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis is required for displacement of E2 from the origin during assembly of E1 multimeric complexes (17Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7044-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Either concurrent with or after formation of E1 oligomers, the host polymerase α primase (21Park P. Copeland W. Yang L. Wang T.

We and others have identified subdomains of E1 as well as conserved amino acids that are required for a number of its DNA replication activities. We have recently shown that amino acids 166–649 of E1 efficiently support DNA replication in a cell-free system and thus must encode for all necessary binding and enzymatic activities requiredin vitro (25Amin A.A. Titolo S. Pelletier A. Fink D. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. Virology. 2000; 272: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In vivo, additional sequences spanning amino acids 82–128 (HPV11 E1) are required; these contain an extended nuclear localization sequence (27Lentz M.R. Pak D. Mohr I. Botchan M.R. J.

Pelletier A. Pulichino A.M. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7349-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Sun Y. Han H. McCance D.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An HPV11 E1 truncation consisting of the C-terminal amino acids 353–649 retains the ability to bind to E2 or the p70 subunit of polymerase α primase and to oligomerize into hexamers (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Titolo S. Pelletier A. Pulichino A.M.

Archambault J. Virology. 2000; 272: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Within this C-terminal fragment of E1 are four conserved regions termed A, B, C, and D (see Fig. 1), which are highly similar to the functionally related T antigens of SV40 and polyomaviruses (37Clertant P. Seif I. Nature. 1984; 311: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The conserved region A lies in a minimal E1 oligomerization sequence located within amino acids 353–416 (see Fig. 1). Three motifs characteristic of superfamily 3 of NTP-binding proteins are located between amino acids 478 and 525 of HPV11 E1 (see Fig. 1) (38Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Two of these motifs (motifs a and b) correspond to the Walker A and B boxes involved in binding the substrate nucleotide triphosphate-magnesium complex (39Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar), while the exact function of the third motif (motif c) remains unclear. Mutations of conserved residues in all three motifs have been shown to significantly decrease the ATPase activity of the superfamily 3 helicase Rep68, encoded by the adeno-associated virus (40Walker S.L. Wonderling R.S. Owens R.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6996-7004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of a highly conserved lysine in motif a (Lys484 in HPV11 E1) has been shown to abrogate the ATPase activity of BPV E1 (41MacPherson P. Thorner L. Parker L.M. Botchan M. Virology. 1994; 204: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and HPV11 E1 (42Rocque W.J. Porter D.J.T. Barnes J.A. Dixon E.P. Lobe D.C. Su J.L. Willard D.H. Gaillard R. Condreay J.P.

Although the HPV E1 proteins are 40–50% identical in primary sequence to BPV E1 and presumably have very similar structures and mechanisms of action, it has proven very difficult to isolate sufficient quantities of purified HPV enzymes to characterize their enzymatic activities.

In this report, we present our characterization of the enzymatic activities of HPV11 and -6 E1 helicases. We have made extensive use of an N-terminal truncated form of E1, composed of amino acids 72–649, which we have shown previously is as active as wild type E1 in supporting HPV DNA replication in vitro. We report here that this truncated E1 is expressed in significantly greater yield than full-length E1 and has improved biophysical properties. We show that, in contrast to previous reports (41MacPherson P. Thorner L. Parker L.M. Botchan M. Virology. 1994; 204: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 42Rocque W.J. Porter D.J.T.

Virol. 1996; 77: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), our purified E1 preparations have a relatively low value of Km(ATP), well below the physiological concentration of ATP. We show that high concentrations of the E2 transactivation domain raise the apparent value of Km(ATP) and also demonstrate that the binding of ATP-Mg to E1 weakens its interaction with E2. The perturbation of E1-E2 binding by physiological concentrations of ATP suggests a mechanism by which some of the energy gained by tight binding of ATP is used to destabilize the E1-E2 complex, which forms transiently during the initiation of viral DNA replication. We also show that E1-(353–649), which encodes motifs for enzymatic activity but lacks the previously identified minimal origin-DNA binding region, is fully active in ATPase, helicase, and ssDNA binding assays. Thus, while the N-terminal half of E1 is necessary for replication from the HPV origin, all sequences necessary for proper folding, oligomerization, and enzymatic catalysis are within the C terminus. The complete E1 open reading frame from HPV11 was amplified from plasmid pCR3-E1 (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J.

Similarly, E1-(72–649) and E1-(353–649) were amplified from plasmid pTM1-E1 (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the same reverse primer but with the following forward primers, respectively: 5′-CGC GGA TCC AGG ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC GCG GAT GCT CAT TAT GCG ACT GTG CAG GAC-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC AGG ATG CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC GAC AGT CAA TTT AAA TTA ACT GAA ATG GTG C-3′. To express the corresponding catalytically inactive mutant E1 proteins, similar PCR amplifications were performed on the appropriate mutant E1 template (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR products were then cut with BamHI and EcoRI, subcloned between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transposed into the baculovirus genome according to the manufacturer's instructions. E1-containing recombinant baculovirus genomes were transfected into SF9 insect cells, and baculovirus-containing supernatants were amplified for large scale protein production. The gene for HPV6 E1 was amplified by PCR from a clinical condyloma sample and subcloned into pCR3.1. PCR primers used were 5′-CAA CGA TGG CGG ACG ATT CAG GTA CAG-3′ (forward, nt 827–853) and 5′-TGC TTC GGA CAC CT-3′ (reverse, nt 2923–2910). The baculovirus expression construct was made by the same procedure as for HPV11 E1, using the same forward and reverse primers for PCR. The DNA sequence matched that reported for HPV6a E1 (GenBankTM accession number L41216) except for eight silent mutations (nt 1297 C to A, nt 1495 T to A, nt 1540 C to T, nt 2170 C to T, nt 2363 T to C, nt 2396 T to C, nt 2530 G to A, and nt 2548 T to C) and two mutations encoding conservative changes (nt 1670 G to T, changing Val280 to Leu, and nt 1741 C to A, changing Asp303 to Glu). 2L. Bourgon and L. Doyon, personal communication. The amino acid sequence for HPV6a E1 is 88% identical to that for HPV11 E1. SF21 cells were maintained in SFM-900 medium (Life Technologies) at cell densities between 1 and 2 × 106/ml. Infections were carried out for 48–72 h using a multiplicity of infection of 5. Cells were harvested and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen before being stored at −80 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. For nuclear extraction, frozen cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in one volume of cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Pefabloc (Pentapharm Ltd.), 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml antipain) for 15 min and then broken with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes for 40 ml, pestle B) followed by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 20 min. Supernatant (cytosol) was discarded, and nuclei were resuspended to 1.4 volumes with extraction buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml antipain), followed by the addition of an equal volume of extraction buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100 for full-length E1 or the same buffer supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 450 mm for truncated proteins). The nuclei were incubated with rocking for 30 min before ultracentrifugation at 148,000 × g for 45 min. Glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10%, and the extract was frozen rapidly on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. All steps were performed at 4 °C. A 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating column was charged with NiSO4according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then washed with equilibration buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mmNaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol). Nuclear extracts from 5 liters of culture were thawed rapidly, the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 500 mm for full-length E1 that was initially extracted in low salt, and the material was loaded onto the Hi-Trap column. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 10 volumes of washing buffer (equilibration buffer with 50 mm imidazole). His-tagged E1 was eluted in 1-ml fractions with equilibration buffer containing 180 mmimidazole and dialyzed in 20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol before being frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. E1 truncations were eluted with 250 mm(E1-(72–649)) or 350 mm (E1-(353–649)) imidazole and were not dialyzed prior to freezing, since dilution of the protein into assay buffers was found to give insignificant residual imidazole concentrations. E1 preparations were tested for the presence of DNA using the fluorescent dye PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), according to published procedures (51Singer V.L. Jones L.J. Yue S.T. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified proteins were determined using the Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin serving as a standard. Bismaleimidohexane cross-linking of purified HPV11 E1-(72–649) and subsequent analysis on Weber-Osborn polyacrylamide gels (52Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described previously forin vitro translated protein (20Titolo S. Pelletier A. Pulichino A.M. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7349-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A velocity run for HPV11 E1-(72–649) was carried out using the XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter), in an An-60 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm and 11 °C. E1-(72–649) was exchanged into a buffer composed of 20 mmTris, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, using a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein was diluted to ∼40 μg/ml (600 nm) and analyzed using a 1.2-cm double sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece and quartz windows pretreated with Sigmacoat silconizing agent (Sigma). Data were acquired at 230 nm and at 0.005-cm intervals, with five replicate readings taken at each point. Scans were spaced as closely as the absorbance optics would allow, approximately every 2 min. E1-(72–649) was found to be stable over the time required to acquire velocity data, although it began to lose activity after several hours at 4–11 °C. Buffer density was determined to be 1.05659 ± 0.00007 g/ml at 22 °C using a pyknometer and corrected to a value of 1.05851 g/ml at 11 °C (53Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.

The partial specific volume for E1-(72–649) (0.7285 cm3/g) and the solvent viscosity (1.810 centipoise) at 11 °C were calculated using the program Sednterp (53Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M.

E2-dependent binding of E1 to the HPV11 origin was measured using a modification of the procedure previously used for in vitro translated proteins (19Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions (80 μl) contained ∼0.4 ng of probe DNA, 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and the indicated amounts of E1 and E2. Radiolabeled probe DNA was obtained by PCR amplification of the HPV11 origin from plasmid pN9. HPV11 E2 was expressed in SF21 insect cells infected with baculovirus Ac11E2 (obtained from R. Rose, University of Rochester) and purified by DNA affinity chromatography in a procedure similar to that of Seo et al. (57Seo Y.S. Muller F. Lusky M. Gibbs E. Kim H.Y. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). After 1-h binding reactions, detection was performed by a modification of the previously described procedure in which protein A scintillation proximity assay beads (SPA beads) were used in place of protein A-Sepharose. Anti-E1-coated SPA beads were added to binding reactions, and after an additional 1 h, plates were spun briefly to pellet beads and counted using a TopCount NXT microplate scintillation counter (Packard Instruments). Blanks were subtracted before calculating relative activities. M13mp18 ssDNA was obtained by infection of E. coli according to standard procedures (58Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T.

Substrate oligonucleotides were synthesized (trityl-off) on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer and purified by gel electrophoresis (58Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T.

To synthesize the substrate used for most of the work in this report, 125 pmol of the purified oligonucleotide 5′-TTC CCA GTC ACG TTG T-3′ was mixed with an equimolar amount of M13mp18 in 500 μl of TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), heated in a water bath to 95 °C, and then allowed to cool slowly overnight. dCTP was then added (to give 230 μm), together with [α-33P]dATP (125 pmol or 250 μCi) and unlabeled dATP (400 pmol), to give a final volume of 700 μl, and the oligonucleotide sequence was extended with the Klenow fragment at 30 °C to give the final sequence 5′-TTC CCA GTC ACG ACG TTG TAA AAC-3′ (radiolabeled residues in boldface). The labeled partial duplex was purified using a freshly packed 50-ml column of Sepharose 4B equilibrated in TEN buffer.

In Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts (IIC9) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK regulate α-thrombin-induced G1 transit by their effects on cyclin D1 protein accumulation (Phillips-Mason, P. J., Raben, D. M., and Baldassare, J. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18046–18053). Here, we show that ERK also affects CDK2-cyclin E activation by regulating the subcellular localization of CDK2. Ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues the inhibition of α-thrombin-induced activation of CDK2-cyclin E and transit into S phase brought about by treatment of IIC9 cells with LY29004, a selective inhibitor of mitogen stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. However, cyclin E expression is ineffectual in rescuing these effects when ERK activation is blocked by treatment with PD98059, a selective inhibitor of MEK activation of ERK. Investigation into the mechanistic reasons for this difference found the following. 1) Although treatment with LY29004 inhibits α-thrombin-stimulated nuclear localization, ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues CDK2 translocation. 2) In contrast to treatment with LY29004, ectopic expression of cyclin E fails to restore α-thrombin-stimulated nuclear CDK2 translocation in IIC9 cells treated with PD98059. 3) CDK2-cyclin E complexes are not affected by treatment with either inhibitor. These data indicate that, in addition to its effects on cyclin D1 expression, ERK activity is an important controller of the translocation of CDK2 into the nucleus where it is activated.

Although the only known substrate for CDK4-cyclin D is pRb, CDK2-cyclin E affects G1progression by phosphorylating substrates other than pRb. For example, in cells in which pRb is inactivated by expression of SV40 large T antigen, inactivation of CDK2-cyclin E still results in G1arrest (14Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). However, inactivation of CDK4-cyclin D is without effect. In addition, although mice in which the coding sequences of the cyclin D1 gene are deleted show several developmental abnormalities, including hypoplastic retinas, replacement of the missing cyclin D1 coding sequences with cyclin E rescues the wild type phenotypes (15Geng Y.

In these mice expression of cyclin E is under control of the cyclin D1 promoter and, therefore, independent of regulation by Rb phosphorylation. Furthermore, protein lysates from the developing retinas of the cyclin E “knockin” mice show only 20% of the levels of Rb phosphorylation when compared with wild type (15Geng Y. Whoriskey W.

These data indicate that ectopic expression of cyclin E can rescue the wild type phenotype without the need for full inactivation of pRb (15Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H.

Furthermore, passage of pRb−/− cells through G1 still requires CDK2-cyclinE activation suggesting CDK2-cyclin E phosphorylates targets other than pRb, and these are essential for progression through G1 into S (14Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Activation of CDK2 is regulated by dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 by cdc25A (16Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of Thr160 by CDK-activating enzyme (CAK) (17Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 18Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of cdc25A shortens the time of G1 by dephosphorylating CDK2-cyclin E (19Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because both cdc25A and CAK are localized to the nucleus, translocation of CDK2-cyclin E to the nucleus is important for interaction of the CDK2-cyclin E complex with these regulatory factors. The mechanism responsible for CDK2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is still poorly understood. α-Thrombin, a potent mitogen of IIC9 cells, is a serine protease that activates a G-protein-coupled receptor known as PAR-1 (protease-activatedreceptor) (20Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Receptor activation and subsequent dissociation of the α-GTP subunit from the βγ subunits results in coordinate stimulation of several mitogenic signaling pathways, cell cycle re-entry, and progression through the cell cycle (21Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrate a role for ERK and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activities in cell growth. Interestingly, both ERK and PI 3-kinase regulate the expression of cyclin D1 and activation of CDK4-cyclin D1 activity in Chinese hamster embryonic fibroblasts (IIC9). In this study we show ERK activity regulates CDK2-cyclin E activity independent of its effect on cyclin D1 expression and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity. Both ERK and PI 3-kinase are essential for cyclin E expression by their effects on the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4-cyclin D1 activation (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although transient expression of cyclin E rescues α-thrombin-induced CDK2-cyclin E activity and G1 progression in IIC9 cells treated with LY294002, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activation, transient expression of cyclin E is without effect in IIC9 cells treated with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK activation of ERK. We also provide evidence that the ectopically expressed cyclin E associates with CDK2 in cells treated with PD98059, but the complex does not translocate into the nucleus. These data clearly demonstrate that in addition to its ability to control cyclin D1 expression, ERK also regulates CDK2-cyclin E nucleocytoplasmic translocation. IIC9 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (all from Sigma). Growth-arrested (Go) cells were established by washing subconfluent (80%) cells once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by a 48-h incubation with α-MEM medium containing 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (basal medium). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were stimulated with 1 unit/ml of human α-thrombin and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. PD98059 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used at 15 μm. LY294002 (Calbiochem) was used at 10 μm. IIC9 cells were grown to subconfluency (80%) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and 2 mml-glutamine (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). The cells were transfected with a solution containing 5 μl/ml PlusTM, 4 μl/ml LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 μg/ml DNA in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. 5 h post-transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with calf serum (final serum concentration of 0.1% v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin were added. After 12 h the cells were growth-arrested for 24 h prior to stimulation. Transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfecting the cells with BiogreenTM pRK5 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and quantitating the number of transfected cells using a fluorescence microscope. Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 units/ml α-thrombin after pretreatment in the presence or absence of 10 μm LY294002 or 15 μm PD98059 for 30 min.

The lysates were sonicated briefly, and insoluble material was pelleted by microfugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie®Plus (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein lysates (15–20 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Boston, MA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies to cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and cyclin E (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer.

Cell lysates (50 μg protein) were incubated with 2 mg of polyclonal CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 2 h. The CDK2 immune complexes were then immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with protein G-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The CDK2 immune complexes were pelleted by microfugation at 14,000 × g and washed four times with cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 2 μm sodium vanadate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin and further washed twice with cold wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmMgCl2). The CDK2 immune complexes were resuspended in 30 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10 μm β-glycerolphosphate, and 20 μm ATP) and incubated with 4 μg of histone H1 (Calbiochem) and 0.5 μCi of [32P-γ]ATP at 30 °C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried, and CDK2-cyclin E activity was quantified using a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics). Growth-arrested IIC9 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 units/ml α-thrombin after preincubation in the absence or presence of 10 μmLY294002 or 15 μm PD98059 for 30 min, and CDK4-cyclin D1 was assayed as previously reported (22Weber J.D.

Following the 17 h incubation, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the cells for an additional 3-h incubation.3H-Labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and the DNA was precipitated by incubating the cells in 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C.

Subsequent to activation, the cells were fixed in a 3.7% Formalin (Sigma) solution for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 6-min incubation in ice-cold methanol at −20 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and then blocked in 1 ml of blocking buffer (0.8 g of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Polyclonal CDK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added at a 1:35 dilution (antibody:blocking buffer) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS.

Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. In IIC9 cells ERK and PI 3-kinase activities are essential for α-thrombin-induced cyclin D1 expression, CDK4-cyclin D kinase activity, and cell growth (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because pRb, which is the only known substrate of CDK4-cyclin D, binds to and represses the E2F family of transcription factors (9Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), and the cyclin E gene promoter is under E2F regulation, we expect that cyclin E expression and CDK2-cyclin E activity will be blocked in cells treated with either PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK activation of ERK, or LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1). We initially examined by Western blot analysis the time course of cyclin E protein expression (Fig. 1 A). Cyclin E protein increases ∼8 h after α-thrombin addition reaching maximal protein levels after 24 h (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with the observed increases in cyclin E protein, CDK2-cyclin E activity does not increase until 10 to 12 h (Fig. 1 A). We next examined the effects of the inhibition of ERK and PI 3-kinase activities on cyclin E expression and CDK2-cyclin E activity. As found previously (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), pretreatment with either PD98059 or LY294002 dramatically prevents α-thrombin-mediated cyclin D1 expression and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity (data not shown). Consistent with the prevailing notion that the phosphorylation of pRb by CDK4-cyclin D is essential for cyclin E expression, pretreatment with PD98059 or LY294002 blocks α-thrombin-stimulated cyclin E expression (Fig. 1 B). As expected, treatment with either inhibitor prevents α-thrombin-induced CDK2-cyclin E stimulation (Fig.1 B). Because the synthesis of cyclin E is essential for CDK2-cyclin E activity, we reasoned that ectopic expression of cyclin E would rescue the inhibition of CDK2-cyclin E activity that is seen with treatment with either LY294002 or PD98059 (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with this hypothesis, replacing the cyclin D1 gene with cyclin E gene restores the wild type phenotype in animals deficient in cyclin D1 expression (15Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We next examined whether the lack of CDK2-cyclin E activity is rescued by ectopic cyclin E expression and, therefore, is dependent on the decrease in cyclin E protein levels that we observed in the presence of either LY294002 or PD98059. In IIC9 cells transient expression of cyclin E results in marked increases in the amounts of cyclin E protein in the presence or absence of either PD98059 or LY294002 (Fig. 2). Ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues the LY294002-induced decrease in CDK2-cyclin E activity (Fig. 2) as determined by in vitrohistone phosphorylation. Surprisingly, expression of cyclin E does not rescue the inhibition of CDK2-cyclin E activity by PD98059 (Fig. 2), although the levels of cyclin E are similar to those in cells treated with LY294002 (Fig. 2). These data suggest that ERK activity has an additional role in regulating CDK2-cyclin E activity, in addition to controlling cyclin E expression via its effect on cyclin D1 levels (22Weber J.D.

Ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues CDK2-cyclin E activity in cells in which cyclin D expression and CDK4-cyclin D1 activity are repressed. To address the effects of the activation of CDK2-cyclin E in the absence of CDK4-cyclin D1 activity on cell cycle progression, we examined the ability of expression of cyclin E to rescue cell cycle re-entry and G1 progression in cells treated with the PI 3-kinase or ERK inhibitors (Fig.3). As previously shown (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), treatment of IIC9 cells with either PD98059 or LY294002 blocks growth as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 3). Although ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues α-thrombin-stimulated growth in IIC9 cells treated with LY294002, it is ineffective in cells in which ERK activity is blocked by pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with the observation that in mice in which the coding sequences of the cyclin E gene replace those of cyclin D1 the mice appear to be normal (15Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results suggest that ERK activation controls CDK2-cyclin E activity independent of its effects in regulating cyclin D1 expression and CDK4-cyclin D1 activation. Subcellular compartmentalization of protein complexes is an underlying regulatory process that affects many cellular events. The subcellular distribution of CDKs and their regulatory cyclins is an important factor for regulating their activities and their ability to control cell cycle progression. The nucleocytoplasmic redistribution of CDK2 is essential for activation, and indeed both the regulatory CAK required for Thr160 phosphorylation and cdc25A, the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15, are constitutively located in the nucleus (26Tassan J.P. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 27Girard F. Strausfeld U. Cavadore J.C. Russell P. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inability of ectopically expressed cyclin E to rescue α-thrombin-induced CDK2-cyclin E activation in the presence of PD98059 is a result of the failure of CDK2 to translocate to the nucleus, we examined the effects of both PD98059 and LY294002 on CDK2 redistribution in α-thrombin-stimulated IIC cells transiently transfected with cyclin E (Fig. 4). In serum-arrested IIC9 cells CDK2 is detected in the cytoplasm (Fig.4 A). We next asked whether translocation of significant amounts of CDK2 is seen in cells stimulated with α-thrombin for 17 h. We selected 17 h, because significant CDK2-cyclin E activity is found at this time (Fig. 1 A). After 17 h significant amounts of CDK2 are found in the nucleus (Fig.4 B). In IIC9 cells stimulated with α-thrombin but pretreated with either PD98059 or LY294002, CDK2 is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, C and E). In agreement with the ability of ectopic expression of cyclin E to rescue CDK2-cyclin E activity in IIC9 cells treated with LY294002, ectopic expression of cyclin E induces significant nuclear localization of CDK2 in α-thrombin-stimulated cells treated with LY294002 (Fig.4 D). However, ectopic cyclin E expression is ineffective in rescuing CDK2 translocation in cells preincubated with PD98059 (Fig.4 F). Thus, ERK promotes CDK2-cyclin E activation by two mechanisms, the regulation of CDK4-cyclin D1 activity, which in turn controls the synthesis of cyclin E, and the translocation of the CDK2-cyclin E complex into the nucleus. The association of CDK2 with the regulatory subunit, cyclin E, is a rate-limiting step in the formation of active CDK2-cyclin E complexes (28Sherr C.J. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 29Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar), indicating that formation of these complexes with cyclin E in late G1 are essential for activation. At present little is known concerning the formation of CDK2-cyclin E complexes in vivo. A possible explanation for the ability of expression of cyclin E to rescue CDK2-cyclin E activity in cells in which PI 3-kinase activity is blocked, but is ineffectual when ERK activation is prevented, is that ERK plays an important role in complex formation in vivo. We investigated this possibility by determining whether endogenous CDK2 associates with ectopically expressed cyclin E (Fig. 5). Cyclin E immunoprecipitates from α-thrombin-stimulated IIC9 cells overexpressing cyclin E contain CDK2 as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, lane 2). To ensure the selectivity of the association of ectopically expressed cyclin E with CDK2, we examined the ability of overexpressed cyclin E to bring down endogenous CDK4. Although IIC9 cells contain levels of endogenous CDK4 comparable with endogenous CDK2 (data not shown), CDK4 is undetectable in cyclin E immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). Furthermore, in cells ectopically expressing cyclin D1, cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates contain CDK4 but not CDK2 (Fig. 5, lane 1). We next asked whether in cells stimulated with α-thrombin treatment with either LY294002 or PD98059 affects the association of ectopically expressed cyclin E with CDK2. In the presence of LY294002 and PD98059 cyclin E immunoprecipitates contain levels of CDK2 comparable with that found in the absence of the inhibitors (Fig. 5, compare lane 2 withlanes 3 and 4). Taken together these data indicate that in the presence of α-thrombin these inhibitors do not affect the association of CDK2 with cyclin E. Activation of CDK2-cyclin E in late G1 enables cells to progress into S phase and replicate cellular DNA (14Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 30Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 31Lew D.J. Marini N.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1993; 72: 488-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because cyclin E expression depends on CDK4-cyclin D1 activity, CDK2-cyclin E activity is downstream of CDK4-cyclin D1 (1Phillips-Mason P.J. Raben D.M. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18046-18053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cyclin D1 is controlled by both ERK (23Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Phillips P.J.

Furthermore, these pathways have similar effects on pRb inactivation, cyclin E expression, and CDK2-cyclin E activation. Because of their similar effects on cyclin E expression, we expected that ectopic expression of cyclin E would rescue the inhibition of α-thrombin-induced CDK2-cyclin E activity observed with pretreatment with either inhibitor. However, whereas the ectopic expression of cyclin E rescues the effects of the inhibition of PI 3-kinase on growth and CDK2-cyclin E activity, it is ineffectual in rescuing the inhibition of CDK2-cyclin E seen when ERK activation is blocked. These data suggest an additional role for ERK in the regulation of translocation of CDK2-cyclin E into the nucleus where it is activated by dephosphorylation by cdc25A and phosphorylation by CAK (34Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is likely that the effect of ERK on CDK2-cyclin E translocation to the nucleus is not solely a direct effect as has recently been proposed (35Blanchard D.A. Mouhamad S. Auffredou M.T. Pesty A. Bertoglio J. Leca G. Vazquez A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4184-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These investigators put forward that nuclear translocation of CDK2 is associated with complexes containing active ERK. In this scheme CDK2-cyclin E associates with active ERK and is carried into the nucleus along with ERK, which acts as a nuclear transport factor. In IIC9 cells CDK2 translocation occurs several hours after the addition of α-thrombin. However, mitogens including α-thrombin (36Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) activate ERK and induce ERK translocation to the nucleus within 10 to 15 min. Importantly, in cells in which cyclin E is ectopically expressed prior to α-thrombin addition, the earliest we are able to detect CDK2 translocation is ∼12 h after α-thrombin stimulation (data not shown). This suggests that CDK2 translocation is dependent on some other function of ERK, possibly its effect on Elk-1-dependent transcriptional activation. Therefore, we propose it likely that ERK activation results indirectly in the translocation of CDK2-cyclin E. Although the mechanism of CDK2 nuclear translocation awaits further investigation, the data in this paper clearly show that there is a role for ERK activity, in addition to regulation of cyclin E expression."

In the present study, we show that human monocytic U937 cells express truncated forms of IRF-2 containing the DNA binding domain but lacking much of the C-terminal regulatory domain. U937 cells are shown to respond to phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to induce expression of histone acetylases p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). In addition, TPA treatment led to the appearance of full-length IRF-2, along with a reduction of the truncated protein. Interestingly, full-length IRF-2 in TPA-treated U937 cells occurred as a complex with p300 as well as PCAF and was itself acetylated. Consistent with these results, recombinant IRF-2 was acetylated by p300 and to a lesser degree by PCAF in vitro. Another IRF member, IRF-1, an activator of interferon-mediated transcription, was also acetylated in vitro by these acetylases. Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of IRF-2 but not IRF-1 inhibits core histone acetylation by p300 in vitro. The addition of IRF-2 also inhibited acetylation of nucleosomal histones in TPA-treated U937 cells. Acetylated IRF-2 may affect local chromatin structure in vivo by inhibiting core histone acetylation and may serve as a mechanism by which IRF-2 negatively regulates interferon-inducible transcription.

High levels of histone acetylation have been linked to the transcriptionally active region of chromatin, while low histone acetylation is associated with the transcriptionally repressed regions (3Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistent with a link between histone acetylation and transcriptional activation, several histone acetylases are recruited to transcriptionally active promoters by interacting with sequence-specific transcription factors (4Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar, 5Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Histone acetylases are classified into several groups including the conserved Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase family and the p300/CBP, Myst, TAF, and nuclear receptor co-activator families (6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors associate with p300/CBP,1 originally known as the global co-activators, and with PCAF and GCN5 belonging to the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase family. Recruitment of these histone acetylases is thought to alter chromatin structures, required as an integral part of transcriptional activation. As a result of interaction with histone acetylases, some transcription factors become themselves acetylated, which often results in enhanced transcriptional activity (7Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Some non-DNA-binding regulatory factors are also acetylated by histone acetylases (6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In support of a link between histone modification and cell growth, histone acetylation is under control of growth and differentiation signals. For example, it has been shown that treatment of human tissue culture cells with epidermal growth factor increases phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 (15Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In addition, p300/CBP, by virtue of the interaction with a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins, affects proliferation and differentiation of some cells (16Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Ait-Si-Ali S. Harel-Bellan A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Activity of p300/CBP is also regulated during the cell cycle, peaking at G1/S transition (17Ait-Si-Ali S. Ramirez S. Barre F.X. Dkhissi F. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Girault J.A. Robin P. Knibiehler M. Pritchard L.L. Ducommun B. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 396: 184-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).Proteins of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family regulate type I interferon (IFN)-mediated transcription of many genes (18Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Ritha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Some members regulate IFN gene expression as well. All IRF proteins carry the conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of ∼110 amino acids in the N-terminal region, through which they bind to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) present in IFN-inducible genes. They have a less conserved C-terminal regulatory domain with variable lengths. IRF-1 and IRF-2 are founding members of the family, which have opposing activities. While IRF-1 activates transcription from promoters carrying the ISRE, IRF-2 represses transcription of these promoters. IRF-2, however, has a cryptic activation domain and can activate transcription from some promoters (19Vaughan P.S. van der Meijden C. Aziz F. Harada H. Taniguchi T. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 194-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Xi H. Eason D.D. Ghosh D. Dovhey S. Wright K. Blanck G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5889-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, IRF-1 can act as a tumor suppressor, while IRF-2 can act as an oncogenic factor (21Taniguchi T. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M9-M17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Some IRF members are shown to interact with histone acetylases. IRF-3, upon viral infection, interacts with p300/CBP, and this interaction is a necessary step for its functional activation (22Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara M. Fukuda E. Nishida E. Fujita T.

IRF-1 associates with p300/CBP and PCAF to form a part of multiprotein complexes that assemble on the IFN-β promoter (25Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that v-IRF of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus that acts as a repressor of interferon inducible promoters also interacts with p300 (26Burysek L. Yeow W.-S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8254-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Previously, we have demonstrated that IRF-1 and IRF-2 both interact with PCAF in vivo and in vitro and that this interaction plays an important role in transcription from relevant promoters (29Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also observed that expression of histone acetylases PCAF and p300/CBP was induced in response to phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in human monocytic U937 cells (29Masumi A. Wang I.-M. Lefebvre B. Yang X.-J. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TPA has been shown to activate protein kinase C and stimulate U937 cells to differentiate into macrophage-like cells (30Ways K. Riddle R. Ways M. Cook P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1258-1264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we show that IRF-2 is truncated at the C-terminal domain in untreated U937 cells, and TPA treatment induces expression of full-length IRF-2. Coinciding with increased expression of p300/CBP and PCAF following TPA treatment, full-length IRF-2 became associated with these histone acetylases. As a result, IRF-2 was acetylated in vivo in TPA-treated U937 cells. Last, we demonstrate that acetylated IRF-2 inhibits p300-mediated acetylation of core histones. This inhibition may be a part of mechanisms by which IRF-2 represses transcription from some target genes and regulates cell growth.DISCUSSIONWe show here that TPA treatment of U937 cells induces expression of p300 and PCAF, leading to increased acetylation of histones in U937 cells. It has been shown that TPA activates protein kinase C and stimulates differentiation of U937 cells toward macrophage-like cells (31Carey J.O. Posekany K.J. deVente J.E. Pettit G.R. Ways D.K. Blood. 1996; 87: 4316-4324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supporting the importance of protein kinase C activation in histone acetylation, the inhibitor GF109203X greatly inhibited histone acetylase induction and blocked increased histone acetylation in TPA-treated U937 cells. These results imply that TPA (and perhaps other differentiation signals) influence the overall levels of core histone acetylation in the cells by regulating histone acetylase expression. Consistent with the idea that histone acetylation is subject to growth and differentiation signals, Cheung et al. (15Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) showed that epidermal growth factor triggers phosphorylation and acetylation of histone H3 in tissue culture cells. Several lines of evidence support a link between increased histone acetylation and differentiation. First, various histone deacetylase inhibitors are shown to cause differentiation in many types of cancer cells (13Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Second, quinidine-induced differentiation of breast cancer cells is reported to coincide with histone H4 hyperacetylation (14Zhou Q. Melkoumain K. Lucktong A. Moniwa M. Davie J.R. Strobl J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35256-35263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Along with changes in histone acetylase expression, truncated forms of IRF-2 predominantly expressed in untreated U937 cells were largely replaced by full-length IRF-2 after TPA treatment. Since there was no evidence for alternative splicing of IRF-2 mRNA, it is likely that in untreated U937 cells IRF-2 is cleaved by an endogenous protease(s). Although the protease(s) that specifically cleaves IRF-2 has not been identified, a previous report demonstrated that full-length IRF-2 was cleaved in some cells upon viral infection (35Palombella V.J. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3325-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, like the truncated IRF-2 seen in U937 cells, the IRF-2 cleaved after viral infection is shown to lack the C-terminal domain, while retaining the intact DBD. The truncated IRF-2 in virus-infected cells acts as a negative regulator of intact IRF-2. The emergence of full-length IRF-2 after TPA treatment is likely to be accounted for by newly synthesized IRF-2, since there was a significant increase in the levels of IRF-2 mRNA expression after TPA treatment. In addition, it is possible that increased stability of IRF-2 may have also contributed to the appearance of full-length IRF-2.In the present work, we have demonstrated that IRF-2 in TPA-treated U937 cells was acetylated and occurred as a complex with p300 and PCAF (See Fig. 8 for a diagram). Since PCAF is shown to directly interact with p300 (39Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), IRF-2 may be part of a large PCAF-p300 complex. Recently, PCAF and GCN5 have been shown to occur as a large stable complex containing many other factors (40Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 41Vassilev A. Yamauchi J. Kotani T. Prives C. Avantaggiati M.L. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 869-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, neither IRF-2 nor p300 is shown to be a component of a stable PCAF complex. It is likely that the IRF-2-containing complex we detected by co-immunoprecipitation is a subset of heterogeneous PCAF complexes that may be less stable than other complexes analyzed in the previous studies. Although we do not have conclusive data, it seems likely that only full-length IRF-2 is acetylated by p300 and PCAFin vivo, based on the results that FLAG-tagged PCAF was not co-precipitated with truncated IRF-2 in untreated U937 cells. Furthermore, the paucity of histone acetylases expressed in untreated cells would also make it less likely to cause acetylation of truncated IRF-2, although in vitro acetylation experiments showed that the IRF-2 DBD can be acetylated by p300. Interestingly, although both IRF-1 and IRF-2 were acetylated in vitro, the level of acetylation was significantly higher for IRF-2 than IRF-1. Sengeret al. (42Senger K. Merika M. Agalioti T. Yie J. Escalante C.R. Chen G. Aggarwal A.K. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 931-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) recently reported that IRF-2 inhibits the recruitment of CBP to IFN-β gene. Although our results are seemingly contradictory with this report, it is important to stress that in the present study we examined IRF-2 that was not bound to a specific element, while Senger et al. focused on the IFN-β gene, suggesting that action of IRF-2 may be dependent on the context of the promoter. We note that among nine mammalian IRF members, IRF-2 possesses the highest number of lysine residues. Furthermore, the DBD contains more lysines than the C-terminal domains in both IRF-1 and IRF-2. It is reasonable to assume that the greater number of acetylatable lysines present in IRF-2 accounts for greater levels of acetylation for this protein. Our study places IRF-2 among the growing list of DNA-binding transcription factors that are acetylated by p300/CBP or PCAF/GCN5. The current list of acetylated proteins includes P53, Myb, GATA-1, Sp1, MyoD, and others (6Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 7Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 8Sakaguchi K.

Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Most of these factors are reported to gain increased DNA binding activity and enhanced transcriptional activity upon acetylation. For IRF-2, we did not observe increased DNA binding activity after acetylation by 300 or PCAF. Nevertheless, considering that the DNA binding domain is acetylated, it may be reasonable to anticipate that the mode with which IRF-2 interacts with a target DNA element is modified by acetylation in the native, chromatinized promoters.Acetylation of IRF-2 may have a significant functional consequence in transcription. We showed that the addition of recombinant IRF-2 but not IRF-1 inhibited core histone acetylation by p300 in vitro as well as nucleosomal acetylation of U937 cells after TPA treatment. We noted that inhibition was more prominent for histone H-2A and H-2B than histones H3 and H4, suggesting that IRF-2 inhibited histone acetylase activity of p300 more strongly than PCAF, since p300 is capable of acetylating all four histones, while PCAF/GCN5 acetylates predominantly H3 and H4 (46Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A simple interpretation of the observed inhibition would be that IRF-2, by acting as a substrate for histone acetylases, competitively inhibits histone acetylation. Consistent with this interpretation, appreciable inhibition of histone acetylation was not observed by IRF-1 and ICSBP, a weaker substrate for the acetylases. Together, it is attractive to assume that IRF-2 inhibition of histone acetylation is relevant to transcriptional repression of IFN-responsive genes by IRF-2 (47Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 48Taniguchi T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is of note that although for many factors acetylation leads to enhanced transcriptional activity, it can have a negative regulatory effect, as reported for T-cell factor inDrosophila (49Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another IRF member, v-IRF, derived from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, also interacts with p300 and inhibits core histone acetylation, resulting in repressed transcription of interferon-responsive genes (28Li M. Damania B. Alvarez X. Ogryzko V. Ozato K. Jung J.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8254-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 50Li M. Lee H. Guo J. Neipel F. Fleckenstein B. Ozato K. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5433-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would be of interest to determine whether v-IRF inhibits core histone acetylation by acting as a competitor. Among several transcriptional activators involved in IFN-β enhancer element, IRF-2 acts on CBP recruitment negatively. In contrast, IRF-2 binds to p300 directly and inhibits its histone acetylation in our study. It is important to note that since IRF-2 can act as an activator for certain genes (19Vaughan P.S. van der Meijden C. Aziz F. Harada H. Taniguchi T. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13957-13965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the effect of reduced local histone acetylation is likely to be dependent on the promoter context. Nucleosomal histones are post-translationally modified by various mechanisms including acetylation, deaceylation, phosphorylation, and methylation (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar, 2Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). High levels of histone acetylation have been linked to the transcriptionally active region of chromatin, while low histone acetylation is associated with the transcriptionally repressed regions (3Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistent with a link between histone acetylation and transcriptional activation, several histone acetylases are recruited to transcriptionally active promoters by interacting with sequence-specific transcription factors (4Grunstein M.

Histone acetylases are classified into several groups including the conserved Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase family and the p300/CBP, Myst, TAF, and nuclear receptor co-activator families (6Sterner D.E.

They have a less conserved C-terminal regulatory domain with variable lengths. IRF-1 and IRF-2 are founding members of the family, which have opposing activities. While IRF-1 activates transcription from promoters carrying the ISRE, IRF-2 represses transcription of these promoters. IRF-2, however, has a cryptic activation domain and can activate transcription from some promoters (19Vaughan P.S. van der Meijden C. Aziz F. Harada H. Taniguchi T. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L.

IRF-3, upon viral infection, interacts with p300/CBP, and this interaction is a necessary step for its functional activation (22Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2038724757,"The chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) consists of an evolutionarily conserved 54-kDa subunit (cpSRP54) and a dimer of a unique 43-kDa subunit (cpSRP43). cpSRP binds light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins (LHCPs) to form a cpSRP/LHCP transit complex, which targets LHCP to the thylakoid membrane. Previous studies showed that transit complex formation is mediated through the binding of the L18 domain of LHCP to cpSRP43. cpSRP43 is characterized by a four-ankyrin repeat domain at the N terminus and two chromodomains at the C terminus. In the present study we used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays to analyze the function of different domains of cpSRP43 in protein complex formation. We report here that the first ankyrin repeat binds to the 18-amino acid domain on LHCP that binds to cpSRP43, whereas the third and fourth ankyrin repeats are involved in the dimerization of cpSRP43. We show further that the interaction of cpSRP43 with cpSRP54 is mediated via binding of the methionine-rich domain of cpSRP54 to the C-terminally located chromodomains of cpSRP43. Both chromodomains contain essential elements for binding cpSRP54, indicating that the closely spaced chromodomains together create a single binding site for cpSRP54. In addition, our data demonstrate that the interaction of cpSRP54 with the chromodomains of cpSRP43 is enhanced indirectly by the dimerization motif of cpSRP43.

The particle binds to the signal sequence of proteins as they emerge from the translating ribosome and mediates targeting to the membrane. SRP54 is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain encoding a GTP-binding site (G domain) and a C-terminal domain characterized by an unusually high content of methionine (M domain) (3Römisch K.

It was shown that cpSRP is required for the post-translational targeting of members of the light-harvesting chlorophyll protein (LHCP) family to the thylakoid membrane (5Schuenemann D. Gupta S.

After import, the nuclear-encoded LHCP is bound by cpSRP to form the soluble targeting intermediate of LHCP, which is designated “transit complex” (12Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Along with cpSRP, the insertion of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane requires GTP (13Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E.

Studies on the subunit stoichiometry and structure of cpSRP have demonstrated that cpSRP is a trimer composed of one cpSRP43 dimer and one cpSRP54 monomer (15Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Analysis of the post-translational interaction between cpSRP and LHCP have shown that this interaction is mediated through binding between cpSRP43 and the L18 domain of LHCP, an 18-amino acid peptide located between the second and third transmembrane domains (17DeLille J.

The cpSRP43 sequence is characterized by the presence of two types of motifs mediating protein-protein interactions (9Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of cpSRP43 contains four ankyrin repeats, and the C-terminal region contains two closely spaced chromodomains (9Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ankyrin repeat, an ∼33-amino acid-long motif, is found in a very large number of proteins (reviewed in Refs. 19Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar and 20Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The diversity of biological roles of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins indicates that the ankyrin repeat serves as a versatile module generating the dimerization interface for a variety of different protein substrates. The chromodomain is a 30–70-amino acid motif that was identified first in the Drosophila chromatin-binding proteins polycomb and heterochromatin protein (21Paro R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22Paro R. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Subsequently, chromodomains were found in various proteins involved in the regulation of chromatin structure by protein-protein interactions (23Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cpSRP43 is the first example of a nonnuclear chromoprotein. In the present work, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze the function of the ankyrin repeats and the chromodomains of cpSRP43 in self-dimerization and heterodimerization with cpSRP54 and LHCP. The binding properties of the minimal interaction domains identified by the yeast two-hybrid system were confirmed using an in vitrobinding assay. Plasmid pAS2 (CLONTECH) was used to construct the bait plasmids encoding the Gal4 DNA binding domain hybrid protein. Plasmid pACT2 (CLONTECH) was used to construct the prey plasmids encoding the Gal4 activation domain hybrid protein. All constructs encode an additional hemagglutinin epitope tag. All cDNAs encoding the L33 domain of LHCP (LHCP-(189–222)), the mature form or truncations of cpSRP43 and cpSRP54, were obtained by PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) orPwo polymerase (Peqlab) using the plasmids pAB80 (25Cline K.

The cDNA encoding mature cpSRP54 (residues 76–564), the G domain (residues 76–370), and M domain (residues 371–564) of cpSRP54 were obtained by using the primer combinations 1/15, 1/16, and 2/15, respectively. For the amplification of a 33-amino acid-long region of LHCP (residues 189–222) containing the L18 segment (17DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI or PagI and BamHI and cloned into the NcoI-BamHI site of pAS2 or pACT2. For each construct, the correct insert orientation and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing. Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the indicated combinations of the pAS2 and pACT2 constructs according to Ref. 26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. One half of the cells was plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan, and the other half was plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (−Leu/−Trp/−His) and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. Yeast cells were incubated for 6 days. Activation of the −his/lacZ reporter was scored by measuring the growth and assessing the β-galactosidase activity by using the filter-lift assay (27Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Growth was classified in (+++), (++), (+), and (−), where (+++) means that most colonies have a diameter of >1.5 mm and (−) indicates normal background growth (white-ish colonies <0.6 mm). The filter lifts were incubated for at least 1.5 h to develop a blue color ((+++), strong blue color; (++), medium blue color; (+), slight blue color; (−), no blue color development). As a positive control we cotransformed yeast cells with the control vectors pVA3 and pTD1 (CLONTECH). These cells showed strong growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His medium and developed a strong blue color after a 1.5-h incubation. As negative controls, each protein hybrid construct was cotransformed with either pAS2 or pACT2. Yeast cells cotransformed with pAS2 and the constructs cloned into pACT2 showed only background growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His plates and had no β-galactosidase activity even after 24 h of color development. Constructs encoding either deletions of cpSRP43 or mature cpSRP43 and cloned into pAS2 showed slight self-activation of the −his reporter, which led to some cell growth (+) on −Leu/−Trp/−His medium. However, all of these yeast clones showed no blue color development after 1.5 h. Yeast cells cotransformed with pACT2 and the pAS2 constructs encoding mature or deletions of cpSRP54 showed only background growth on −Leu/−Trp/−His plates and had no β-galactosidase activity even after 24 h of color development. LHCP-(189–222) cloned into pAS2 showed strong self-activation of the −his-lacZ reporter, such that only the pACT2 version of this construct was used. For fusion proteins that showed only weak or no interaction in the yeast two-hybrid experiments, an expression level comparable with full-length cpSRP43 or cpSRP54 was verified by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the hemagglutinin tag (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The cDNAs coding for cpSRP43-(190–258), cpSRP43-(259–350), cpSRP43-(61–159), and the M domain of cpSRP54 (residues 371–564) were obtained by PCR amplification as described above. Primer combinations 12/26 and 7/27 were used to yield cpSRP43-(190–258)/1 and cpSRP43-(190–258)/2, 13/28 to yield cpSRP43-(259–350), 14/29 to yield cpSRP43-(61–159), and 2/30 to yield cpSRP54-(371–564) (Table I). The reverse primer for the amplification of cpSRP43-(190–258)/2 was designed to introduce two additional methionine residues at the C terminus. The PCR products encoding cpSRP43-(190–258)/1, cpSRP43(259–350), and cpSRP43-(61–159) were digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and ClaI and cloned into the vector fragment from the in vitro translation vector pSPUTK-GST-chaos (15Tu C.J.

The resulting constructs encode cpSRP43-(190–258), cpSRP43-(259–350), and cpSRP43-(61–159) as GST fusion proteins. The in vitro translation vector pSPUTK-GST was created by a blunt-end ligation of the vector fragment from pSPUTK-GST-chaos (15Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol.

The PCR products encoding cpSRP43-(190–258)/2 and cpSRP54-(371–564) were digested with NcoI and HindIII and cloned into the NcoI-HindIII site of the in vitro translation vector pGem4SS6.5Nco1 (7Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each construct the correct insert orientation and reading frame were confirmed by sequencing. The translation vector encoding the L18 domain of LHCP (LHCP-(189–206)) as a preprolactin fusion was described by DeLilleet al. (17DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc.

To test if GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) dimerizes with cpSRP43-(190–258), both proteins were cotranslated in a wheat germ extract (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Control samples included a cotranslation of GST with cpSRP43-(190–258) and single translations of GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) and cpSRP43 (190). 50 μl of the two cotranslation reactions and 25 μl of in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43-(190–258) were diluted into an incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KOAc, and 10 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 120 μl. The precipitation of the GST fusion proteins with glutathione-Sepharose was done as described by Tu et al. (18Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol.

The eluted samples were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager. Radiolabeled in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43, GST-cpSRP43-(259–350), GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), and GST were separated on a 13% acrylamide gel, and radioactivity was quantitated by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager. Equal picomoles of in vitro translated GST-cpSRP43, GST-cpSRP43-(259–350), GST-cpSRP43-(61–159), and GST were incubated with 20 μl of radiolabeled in vitro translated cpSRP54-(371–564) or LHCP-(189–206) as indicated. All binding reactions contained equal amounts of wheat germ extract. The proteins were diluted into an incubation buffer as described above, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min.

The eluted samples were analyzed by 15% acrylamide gels and detected by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that cpSRP43 occurs as a homodimer (15Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This result was based on the observation that cpSRP43, from the stroma of an Arabidopsis mutant that lacks cpSRP54 (ffc1–2), elutes from a gel filtration column at 70 kDa, which is twice the predicted monomer molecular mass. In addition, homodimerization of cpSRP43 was shown by cross-linking experiments with highly purified recombinant cpSRP43 (15Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of cpSRP43 has shown that the protein contains four ankyrin repeats at the N terminus and two chromodomains at the C terminus (9Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A schematic presentation of the exact location of these sequence motifs is shown in Fig. 1. To determine which domains of cpSRP43 mediate its dimerization, we cloned the mature protein and various deletion constructs (Fig.2) into the bait plasmid pAS2 and the prey plasmid pACT2. Yeast cells were cotransformed with the indicated plasmid combinations. The ability of the cotransformed yeast cells to grow on medium lacking histidine (−His) and to express β-galactosidase indicates an interaction of the tested proteins. Table II shows that bait cpSRP43 interacts with prey cpSRP43, confirming our previous conclusion that cpSRP43 forms a homodimer (15Tu C.J. Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27219-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a first step toward analyzing which domain of cpSRP43 mediates dimerization, the interaction between mature cpSRP43 and the ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43A-(61–258)) versus the chromodomains-containing C-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43C-(259–376)) was tested. Table II shows that mature cpSRP43 interacts with cpSRP43A-(61–258) but not with cpSRP43C-(259–376). The notion that the self-dimerization of cpSRP43 is mediated via the ankyrin repeat domain was further confirmed by the observation that bait and prey cpSRP43A-(61–258) interact but that no interaction was seen between the two cpSRP43C-(259–376) constructs.Figure 2Schematic representation of the constructs of cpSRP43, cpSRP54, and LHCP used in the yeast two-hybrid assay.

Open table in a new tab Mature cpSRP43 or the indicated deletions of cpSRP43 were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid plasmids pAS2 and pACT2. Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the indicated combinations of bait and prey plasmids, and the activation of the −his-lacZreporter was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A schematic presentation of the used constructs is given in Fig. 2. /; not measured. To define more clearly the region of the ankyrin repeat domain involved in dimerization, a series of truncations of cpSRP43, removing the N-terminal region outside the ankyrin repeats (cpSRP43-(125–376)), followed by successive removal of three ankyrin repeats (cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), and cpSRP43-(223–376)), was constructed (Fig. 2). Table II shows that mature cpSRP43 and cpSRP43-(125–376) both dimerized with cpSRP43-(125–376), cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), and cpSRP43-(223–376) without any obvious loss of interaction strength. These data suggest that the fourth ankyrin repeat by itself is sufficient to mediate dimerization. This result was corroborated by the finding that cpSRP43-(223–376) interacts strongly with its corresponding prey construct. The third ankyrin repeat is also capable of mediating dimerization as evidenced by the strong interaction of cpSRP43-(61–227), lacking the fourth ankyrin repeat, with cpSRP43 (Table II). When the third ankyrin repeat is also removed (cpSRP43-(61–193)), dimerization is essentially abolished. No binding was detected between cpSRP43 and cpSRP43-(61–159) containing the first ankyrin repeat only. These data together with the results from Table II indicate that the third and fourth ankyrin repeats each are capable of mediating the dimerization of cpSRP43. Like cytoplasmic SRP54, chloroplast SRP54 is also composed of an N-terminal G domain (residues 76–370) and a C-terminal M domain (residues 371–564). To analyze which domain of cpSRP54 mediates binding to cpSRP43, mature cpSRP54 and its G and M domain were cloned in pAS2, and the interaction with cpSRP43 as prey was tested. The results show that cpSRP54 interacts strongly with cpSRP43 in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the same strength of interaction is obtained between the M domain of cpSRP54 and cpSRP43 (TableIII). No binding was observed between the G domain of cpSRP54 and cpSRP43. These data show clearly that the interaction between cpSRP43 and cpSRP54 is mediated via the M domain of cpSRP54.Table IIIThe M domain of cpSRP54 binds cpSRP43Bait (pAS2)Prey (pACT2)Growth on −HisActivity of β-galactosidase43Empty4354+++−+++54-M+++−+++54-G−−−Empty−−−Mature cpSRP54, its M and G domain (54-M, 54-G), and mature cpSRP43 were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid plasmids pAS2 and pACT2, respectively.

Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the indicated combination of bait and prey plasmids, and the activation of the −his-lacZ reporter was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To characterize the binding site of cpSRP43 for cpSRP54, we tested the binding of cpSRP54 to a series of N-terminal deletion constructs of cpSRP43. No obvious change in binding intensity was observed between cpSRP54 and mature cpSRP43, cpSRP43-(125–376), cpSRP43-(156–376), cpSRP43-(190–376), or cpSRP43-(223–376) (TableIV). A pronounced lesser, but still significant, binding was detected between cpSRP54 and the chromodomains-containing C-terminal part of cpSRP43 (cpSRP43C-(259–376)) (Table IV). If the loss of binding activity between cpSRP54 and cpSRP43C-(259–376) versus cpSRP54 and cpSRP43-(223–376) is caused by a direct interaction of cpSRP54 with the fourth ankyrin repeat, we reasoned that cpSRP54 should interact with the ankyrin repeat-containing N-terminal part of cpSRP43.

The Swi2/Snf2 and Snf6 subunits of SWI/SNF were efficiently cross-linked at several positions in the nucleosome, whereas only Snf6 was efficiently cross-linked when SWI/SNF was bound to free DNA. DNA photoaffinity labeling of RSC showed that the Rsc4 subunit is in close proximity to nucleosomal DNA and not when RSC is bound to free DNA. After remodeling, the Swi2/Snf2 and Rsc4 subunits are no longer detected near the nucleosomal DNA and are evidently displaced from the surface of the nucleosome, indicating significant changes in SWI/SNF and RSC contacts with DNA after remodeling.

An important element of eukaryotic gene regulation is the dynamic nature of chromatin because of the ability of various protein complexes to alter the structure of chromatin. Chromatin is altered by chemical modification of the core histone proteins through acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination. Acetylation of the N-terminal tails has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of gene expression (1Grant P.A. Berger S.L. Semin. Cell Dev.

Another approach to alter chromatin structure uses the mechanical energy provided by hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of ATP without covalent modification of the nucleosome. ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes have been purified from yeast, fly, frog, and human and can range in subunit complexity from 2 to 15 different subunits/complex (5Tong J.K. Hassig C.A.

These chromatin-remodeling machines have been shown in vitro to 1) enhance accessibility of nucleosomal DNA without the loss of the nucleosome, 2) alter the path of DNA in the nucleosome, 3) cause sliding of the nucleosome along DNA, and 4) promote octamer transfer to another DNA (14Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 15Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). As of now, little is known about how these enzymes interact with the nucleosome and how their contacts with the nucleosome change upon the binding and hydrolysis of ATP.The first of these complexes to be extensively purified and characterized was the SWI/SNF complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 16Cairns B.R. Kim Y.J. Sayre M.H. Laurent B.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The yeast SWI/SNF complex has 11 different subunits and a total molecular mass of ∼2 MDa. The largest subunit of this complex, Swi2/Snf2, is a 194-kDa protein containing seven highly conserved subdomains corresponding to the DNA-dependent ATPase domain and a bromodomain located toward the C terminus. Single amino acid changes in the DNA-dependent ATPase domain eliminate both the ATPase activity of Swi2/Snf2 and the chromatin-remodeling activity of SWI/SNF (13Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Richmond E. Peterson C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3685-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The next largest subunit of SWI/SNF, Swi1 (148 kDa), had been shown to interact with DNA by UV cross-linking of SWI/SNF bound to naked DNA and contains an AT-rich interactive domain DNA-binding domain that may be involved in SWI/SNF binding of DNA (18Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The RSC complex is another ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex found in yeast that is closely related to SWI/SNF. The Sth1 subunit of RSC is 72% identical over 661 amino acid residues of Swi2/Snf2 (11Cairns B.R. Lorch Y. Li Y. Zhang M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Du J. Laurent B. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Three subunits of SWI/SNF, Swi3, Snf5, and Swp73, are also paralogs of RSC components; similar subunits are also found in the human and Drosophila SWI/SNF complexes (14Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Two subunits of SWI/SNF are shared with the RSC complex and are the actin-related proteins Arp7 and Arp9 (19Peterson C.L. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23641-23644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Cairns B.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Winston F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The ability of Arp7 and Arp9 to bind or hydrolyze ATP appears not to be important for their role in chromatin remodeling (20Cairns B.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Winston F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 639-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Direct correlation of the ATPase activity of the Swi2/Snf2 subunit with the chromatin-remodeling activity of SWI/SNF through mutational analysis indicates that the Swi2/Snf2 subunit is the catalytic core of SWI/SNF. These observations are also reflected in the mutational analysis of Swi2/Snf2 homologs in other SWI/SNF-like complexes. Purified recombinant Swi2-like proteins, human BRG1 and hBRM, and the Drosophila ISWI proteins possess some or essentially complete chromatin-remodeling activity characteristic of their respective intact multi-subunit complexes (9Corona D.F.

Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Although the mechanical energy for chromatin remodeling is provided through the ATP hydrolysis of Swi2/Snf2 or its homologs, there is no data showing the direct interaction of the Swi2/Snf2 subunit with the nucleosome or DNA. The ATPase activity of SWI/SNF and RSC is equally stimulated by naked DNA or nucleosomes. UV cross-linking of SWI/SNF bound to naked DNA did not show any Swi2/Snf2 cross-linking but instead cross-linked a protein with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to the Swi1 subunit with lesser amounts of two proteins, p68 and p78 (18Quinn J. Fyrberg A.M. Ganster R.W. Schmidt M.C. Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Swi2/Snf2 does not appear to make extensive contact with DNA as evident by its inability to be cross-linked to DNA. Indirect evidence suggests that the Swi2/Snf2 subunit may be able to interact with the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. A bromodomain, similar to that found in the C terminus of Swi2/Snf2, has been shown in vitroto bind selectively to the tails of H3 and H4 but not to the tails of H2A and H2B (24Ornaghi P. Ballario P. Lena A.M. Gonzalez A. Filetici P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Using a photochemical approach with site-specific modified photoreactive DNAs, we have investigated the interactions of yeast SWI/SNF with the nucleosome and present evidence for the direct interaction of Swi2/Snf2 in the SWI/SNF complex and Rsc4 in the RSC complex with DNA in a nucleosome-dependent manner. The 5 S rDNA template was chosen for these studies, because it has been well characterized to help phase the nucleosome on DNA and to cause tight rotational positioning of the nucleosome (25Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Sengupta S.M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Peterson C.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although rotationally positioned, the 5 S rDNA nucleosome has more than one translational position (25Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the several translational positions of the 5 S rDNA to scan for the interactions of SWI/SNF with nucleosomal DNA and to compare that with its interactions with naked DNA. Another important outcome of our results is the data showing significant changes in the interface between the nucleosome and the chromatin-remodeling complex after hydrolysis of ATP, which is indicative of key conformational changes of SWI/SNF or changes in the sites of DNA bound in the nucleosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of SWI/SNF ComplexThe SWI/SNF complex was purified from S. cerevisiae strain CY396 containing HA 1The abbreviations used are:HAhemagglutininTBE90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTAbpbase pair(s)ATPγSadenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateAMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate-tagged and His6-tagged Swi2. The purification involved nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose, DNA cellulose, MonoQ column chromatography, and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (29Logie C. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The concentration of the SWI/SNF was determined by quantitative Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-Snf5 or anti-Swp73 antibody.DNA Probe SynthesisA 214-bpEcoRI-DdeI fragment of DNA derived from plasmid pXP-10 (30Wolffe A.P. Brown D.D. Cell. 1986; 47: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which includes the Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene, was used to construct DNA photoaffinity probes. Each probe had photoreactive nucleotide analogs AB-dUMP (5-[N-(4-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]dUMP) and/or AB-dCMP (4-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-2-aminoethyl]dCMP) incorporated adjacent to radiolabeled nucleotides at specific sites in the DNA (31Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Four DNA probes, designated as 47/55, 1/5, −13/−14, and −27/−30, were synthesized as described previously (26Sengupta S.M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Peterson C.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The numbers indicate the base pair position or range within which a modified nucleotide is incorporated with +1 being the start site of transcription. In addition, an unmodified DNA probe containing only a single radiolabeled nucleotide at bp −70 and no photoreactive nucleotides was synthesized. Probes 47/55, 1/5, and −27/−30 were on the transcribed strand, whereas probes −13/−14 and −70 were on the nontranscribed strand.Reconstitution of NucleosomesNucleosomes were reconstituted by transferring histone octamers from HeLa oligonucleosomes onto probe DNA by the octamer transfer method as described previously (26Sengupta S.M. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Peterson C.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). H1-depleted oligonucleosomes from HeLa cells were prepared as described previously. Mock nucleosomal/naked DNA was prepared by carrying out octamer transfer in the absence of probe DNA. Probe DNA was added after the final step of octamer transfer.Photoaffinity LabelingA binding reaction was set up containing ∼30–40 nm SWI/SNF and 30 nmnucleosomes in buffer A (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Tween 20, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. ATP, ATPγS, ADP, AMP, GTP, CTP, and UTP were included optionally in the binding reaction at a final concentration of 100 μm. For competitor experiments, 1.8 μg (20-fold excess) of cold oligonucleosomes was added to the reaction after the binding reaction and incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C.For photoaffinity labeling with RSC, the binding reactions contained 20 nm RSC and were in buffer B (20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 4 mm MgCl2, 30 mm potassium acetate, and 75 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). ATP was included optionally in the binding reaction at a final concentration of 500 μm. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min as before.After the incubation, 4 μl of the binding reaction was loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C (acrylamide:bisacrylamide of 38.9:1.1). Alternatively, a 5 or 6% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide: bisacrylamide of 60:1) in 0.2× TBE was used to resolve the different translational positions of the nucleosome. Of the RSC binding reaction, 4 μl was loaded on a 3.2% native polyacrylamide gel in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA).The remainder of the sample was irradiated with ultraviolet light as described previously (31Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The samples were treated with DNase I and S1 nuclease and analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was analyzed using a Cyclone phosphorimaging device from Packard Instruments.Western Blot AnalysisSWI/SNF was separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electroblotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane and the blocking of membrane, several antibodies were used to probe the membrane (32Renart J. Sandoval I.V. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Swi3, Swp82, Swp73, Arp7, Arp9, Snf6, and Tfg3/Taf30 were provided by Bradley Cairns, and antibodies to Swi1 and Snf5 were provided by Craig Peterson. High affinity anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the detection of the Swi2/Snf2 subunit.Restriction Endonuclease Cleavage AssayA 50 μl-binding reaction, as described for photoaffinity labeling, was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Eighty units of EcoRV were added to each reaction followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. The cleavage reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA. The aqueous layer was extracted first with a phenol/chloroform mixture (1:1) and then with chloroform. The DNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10 m LiCl and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. 10 μg of plasmid DNA was added as a carrier for the precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of TE containing 0.05% Tween 20 and analyzed on a 9% native polyacrylamide gel.ImmunoprecipitationA 67-μl photoaffinity labeling reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Four microliters of the sample was loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The remainder of the sample was irradiated with ultraviolet light. After irradiation, one-third of the reaction mixture was treated with DNase I and S1 nuclease as before. The remaining two-thirds of the sample were immunoprecipitated essentially as described previously (16Cairns B.R. Kim Y.J. Sayre M.H. Laurent B.C. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose 4B resin (40 μl, Sigma) was equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 m potassium acetate). Anti-Swp73 antibody (7 μl) was bound to 20 μl of equilibrated resin for 30 min at 4 °C with mixing at 1300 rpm every 2 min. Unbound antibody was removed by washing the resin with 500 μl of buffer C.The sample was pre-cleared by adding it to 20 μl of equilibrated resin. The supernatant was added to the antibody-bound protein A-Sepharose resin and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with mixing as described earlier. The supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed three times with 500 μl of buffer D (20 mmK-Hepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.6 m potassium acetate) and once with buffer A. The resin was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer A, and the digestion of the DNA with DNase I and S1 nuclease was carried out as described earlier. The samples were analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gel was subjected to phosphorimaging.RESULTSThe Swi2/Snf2 and Snf6 Subunits of Yeast SWI/SNF Are in Close Proximity to DNA in the SWI/SNF-Nucleosome ComplexSite-specific DNA photoaffinity labeling was used to understand how SWI/SNF interacts with the 5 S rDNA nucleosome before and after remodeling. Nucleosomes were reconstituted using a 214-bp fragment of DNA that included the X. borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene. Nucleosomes reconstituted with this DNA are highly positioned rotationally and occupy several well defined translational positions (25Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Panetta G. Buttinelli M. Flaus A. Richmond T.J. Rhodes D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Four major dyad axes have been mapped on this DNA to base pairs −44, −24, −3 and +7 with +1 being the start site of transcription for the 5 S rRNA gene. Four photoreactive DNA probes were found that efficiently cross-linked SWI/SNF and that are distributed at varied positions in the 5 S rDNA (Fig.1 A). One of the modified regions was located in the nontranscribed strand from bp −13 to −14 (referred to as −13/−14), and the other three DNA probes were in the transcribed strand from bp −27 to −30 (−27/−30), bp +1 to +5 (1/5), and bp +47 to +55 (47/55).To ascertain the effect of this kind of DNA modification on the ability of SWI/SNF to remodel the modified nucleosome, a restriction endonuclease accessibility assay was used with the most modified DNA probe, probe 47/55. Unmodified DNA was synthesized with a single radioactive label incorporated at bp −70. Nucleosomes reconstituted with the unmodified or modified DNA probes were cleaved withEcoRV in the presence or absence of SWI/SNF. The cleavage site for EcoRV is ∼105 bp from either end of the DNA and is well occluded within the nucleosome. In the absence of SWI/SNF, 24% of the unmodified nucleosomal DNA was accessible to the enzyme (Fig.1 B, lane 2). This finding is consistent with the efficiency of nucleosome formation being ∼80% as assayed by gel shift (data not shown). The extent to which the nucleosomal probe is cleaved increases as the amount of SWI/SNF added is increased. At a molar ratio of 1:3 of SWI/SNF to nucleosome, almost 90% of the nucleosomes are accessible toEcoRV cleavage (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9 and10).A similar effect was seen with probe 47/55 (Fig. 1 C). The efficiency of nucleosome formation with probe 47/55 was better (95%) than that of the unmodified DNA (data not shown); therefore, only 6% of the DNA was accessible to the enzyme in the absence of SWI/SNF (lane 2). At lower amounts of SWI/SNF, the modified DNA was cleaved to a slightly higher extent (Fig. 1, B andC, compare lanes 4, 6, and 8) than the unmodified nucleosome. As with unmodified DNA, the extent of cleavage increased as the amount of SWI/SNF added was increased until it reached a molar ratio of 1:3, when almost 90% of the DNA was cleaved (Fig.1 C, lanes 9 and 10). These results show that DNA modification does not interfere with the interaction of SWI/SNF with the 5 S nucleosome.The formation of discrete SWI/SNF·nucleosome complexes was detected by gel shift assay with all four modified nucleosomes (Fig.2 A, lanes 3, 6, 9,and 12). The efficiency of nucleosome formation with all four probe DNAs was comparable with between 87 and 93% of the DNA being assembled as assayed by gel shift analysis. The amount of SWI/SNF required for quantitative binding was empirically determined by titrating SWI/SNF with a fixed amount of nucleosomal probe and assaying by gel shift (data not shown). The addition of ATP to the SWI/SNF·nucleosome complex caused a further reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of the complex, resulting in the complex not migrating into the gel (lanes 4, 7, 10, and 13). The binding of SWI/SNF to free DNA also formed a complex that does not migrate into the gel (lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). The electrophoretic properties of the SWI/SNF:DNA complex suggest that several SWI/SNF molecules may be bound per DNA. The SWI/SNF·nucleosome complexes were photocross-linked at the four different regions in the nucleosome by irradiating the complexes and then digesting away most of the cross-linked DNA with DNase I and S1 nuclease. The short labeled DNA fragment left covalently attached to either histones or SWI/SNF serves as a radioactive tag to identify the components of the complex cross-linked at the various sites on the 5 S rDNA. DNA probe 47/55 most efficiently cross-linked histones and a ∼205-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The electrophoretic mobility of the 205-kDa protein was shown to be similar to that of the Swi2/Snf2 protein by Western blotting analysis with anti-HA antibody detection of the Swi2/Snf2-HA-His6 (data not shown). Minor cross-linking of several other proteins was also observed. These polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 127, 92, 76, 63, and 50 kDa were found by Western blot analysis to have electrophoretic mobilities similar to that of Swi3/Snf5, Swp82, Swp73, Arp7/Arp9, and Snf6, respectively.Figure 2The Swi2/Snf2 and Swi6 subunits of SWI/SNF are positioned near nucleosomal DNA in the SWI/SNF·nucleosome complex. A, gel shift analysis. Probe DNAs were reconstituted into nucleosomes by the octamer transfer method and analyzed by gel shift assay on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. Mock nucleosome reconstitutions were performed also using the octamer transfer method, except that the probe DNA was added last after doing the final dilution of the donor nucleosomes to 100 mmNaCl (lanes 5, 8, 11, and 14). These samples are referred to as free DNA because no octamer transfer occurs under these conditions. The amount of SWI/SNF added in lanes 3–14 was stoichiometric and was shown empirically by titrating with different amounts of SWI/SNF in a gel shift binding assay with a fixed amount of nucleosomes. Remodeling reactions in lanes 4, 7, 10, and13 contained 100 μm ATP. B, DNA photoaffinity labeling. A large portion of the same samples fromA were irradiated and digested with DNase I and S1 nuclease leaving a radiolabeled DNA tag cross-linked to protein. The samples were analyzed by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging analysis. The electrophoretic mobilities of the SWI/SNF subunits were determined by Western blotting using subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies and are indicated on the left. Samples in lanes 4–15 were immunoprecipitated using an anti-SWP73 antibody before degradation of the DNA probe and subsequent analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cross-linking of the 205-kDa polypeptide was dramatically reduced by the addition of ATP (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). These results indicate that the Swi2/Snf2 subunit is located close to nucleosomal DNA upon binding to the nucleosome but after chromatin remodeling is displaced from the nucleosome so that it cannot be cross-linked to DNA. In the experiment with cross-linking of SWI/SNF bound to naked DNA, the Swi2/Snf2 subunit is not cross-linked at base pairs 47/55 in the 5 S rDNA (lane 3). Thus, these data indicate that the association of Swi2/Snf2 near DNA is nucleosome-dependent. Proteins with relative mobilities similar to that of Swi1, Arp7 or Arp9, and Snf6 are most readily cross-linked in the SWI/SNF bound to naked DNA in the absence of ATP. Similarly, these same proteins are cross-linked when SWI/SNF is associated with the nucleosome in the presence of ATP, with the exception of the ∼60- and ∼63-kDa protein (Arp7 and Arp9). Other positions on the 5 S rDNA, some near the ends of the DNA, were also probed but did not efficiently cross-link SWI/SNF (data not shown).The photoaffinity-labeled SWI/SNF complex was purified away from labeled histones and other proteins by immunoprecipitation using an anti-Swp73 antibody. Swp73 is a highly conserved subunit of SWI/SNF that is tightly associated with the complex, thus making it possible to immunoaffinity purify complete SWI/SNF complexes (33Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2131-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF is dissociated from the nucleosome under the salt concentrations used in the immunoprecipitation. After extensive washing of the beads with SWI/SNF still bound to the protein A-Sepharose, the sample is digested with DNase I and S1 nuclease, and the protein is eluted by adding a sample loading buffer. Six of the proteins cross-linked with probe 47/55 were immunoprecipitated and correspond by relative molecular mass to the Swi2/Snf2, Swi3, Swp82, Swp73, Arp7/Arp9, and Snf6 subunits of the SWI/SNF complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Swi2/Snf2 was the most intensely cross-linked subunit, suggesting again that it makes close contact with nucleosomal DNA. The 161-, 103-, and 35-kDa polypeptides (compare lane 1 withlane 4, *) did not immunoprecipitate and are probably contaminants present in SWI/SNF. The histone proteins were also removed by immunoprecipitation and facilitated in identifying whether the Snf11 subunit of SWI/SNF was cross-linked.Immunoprecipitation of the SWI/SNF·nucleosome complex after remodeling showed that the interactions of SWI/SNF with the nucleosome were greatly altered (lane 5). The Swi2/Snf2 subunit was no longer cross-linked efficiently, suggesting that it does not make close contact with DNA at this position in the remodeled nucleosome. The most efficiently cross-linked subunit of SWI/SNF after remodeling is Snf6. Although much less efficiently cross-linked in the initial complex, the contacts of the Swp82 and Arp7 or Arp9 subunits were also lost upon the addition of ATP. On the other hand, the contacts of Swp73 and Snf6 were increased, and in addition, Swi1, Snf5, and Tfg3/Taf30 were cross-linked to DNA, although weakly only after the addition of ATP. These altered contacts of SWI/SNF with the nucleosome after remodeling bear great similarit"

Vitamin A metabolites, such as all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)1 and 9-cis-RA, are important regulators for gene transcription as the ligands for various transcriptional factors of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) families (for review, see Ref. 8Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Extensive progress has been made in determining the specificity of these RA metabolites with the interactions with these RARs and RXRs (8Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar, 9Allenby G. Bocquel M.T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J.F. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). As compared with these RA metabolites, retinol is not as potent as those RAs in terms of the interactions with these receptors and in terms of transcriptional regulation (10Connor M.J. Smit M.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Kurlandsky S.B. Xiao J.H. Duell E.A. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32821-32827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that retinol has to be metabolized to various RAs to exert its biological activity (11Kurlandsky S.B. Xiao J.H. Duell E.A. Voorhees J.J. Fisher G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32821-32827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which vitamin A and its metabolites exert this activity to regulate airway development and the maintenance of mucociliary functions in epithelium is unknown. As lipid soluble compounds, retinoids can readily cross the membrane into any cell in the body from the plasma circulation. The major form of retinoid in plasma circulation is all-trans-retinol at about 1.5–2.0 μm (12Ribaya-Mercado J.D. Mazariegos M. Tang G. Romero-Abal M.E. Mena I. Solomons N.W. Russell R.M. Am. J. Clin.

Nutr. 1997; 127: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the level of RA in the plasma is around 4–14 nm (14De Leenheer A.P. Lambert W.E. Claeys I. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1362-1367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Eckhoff C. Nau H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be insufficient to supply the needed cellular RA level for its biological activity in vitamin A target tissues and cells. In addition, in some vitamin A target tissues and cells, such as skin and keratinocytes (16Jurukovski V. Markova N.G. Karaman-Jurukovska N. Randolph R.K. Su J. Napoli J.L. Simon M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the access to blood vessels can be quite limited. Thus, there is a need in these vitamin A target cells for an efficient machinery to transport and to metabolize plasma retinol into various RA metabolites. The production of RA from retinol can take place within the cell if the cell contains enzymes that can sequentially oxidize retinol to retinaldehyde and retinaldehyde to RA. The reversible oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of retinol to retinoic acid and therefore the step most likely to be tightly regulated by the cell (17Chai X. Boerman M.H. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Napoli J.L. Posch K.P. Fiorella P.D. Boerman M.H. Biomed.

Of particular interest, at least one of these retinaldehyde dehydrogenases is specifically expressed in tracheal epithelial cells in rat, with a putative role in the conversion of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid in these cells. However, the critical enzyme that converts retinol to retinaldehyde is still unknown in airway epithelial cells. In this communication, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel airway epithelial cell-specific SDR gene from a cDNA library derived from primary human tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cells, using a differential hybridization approach on a high density cDNA microarray membrane. Five independently selected RA responsive cDNA clones encoded the same novel gene. The conceptual translation of the novel cDNA sequence encodes a protein that contains amino acid motifs that are conserved in the SDR family of genes. Within the SDR superfamily, the novel gene is most homologous to the retinol dehydrogenases. We provide evidence suggesting that this novel gene represents a new member of the SDR family that may play a critical role in retinoid metabolism in airway epithelia. Human airway tissues were obtained from the University of California at Davis Medical Center with donor consent. The protocol for obtaining human tissues has been approved and periodically reviewed by the campus Human Subject Review Committee. TBE cells were isolated from these tissues by a protease dissociation procedure and cultured in a serum-free hormone-supplemented medium as previously described (39Robinson C.B. Wu R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1991; 13: 95-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture plates either without additional substratum (TC) or with collagen gel substratum (Cg) or in air-liquid biphasic culture insert chambers (Transwell™ chamber, Corning/Costar 3450, Corning, NY) without (Bi) or with collagen gel substratum (Bi-Cg). The serum-free hormone-supplemented medium was slightly modified from that described in Ref. 39Robinson C.B. Wu R. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1991; 13: 95-102Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar; the modified medium contained the supplements insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), cholera toxin (20 ng/ml), dexamethasone (0.1 μm), bovine hypothalamus extract (15 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and all-trans-RA (30 nm, Fluka, Milwaukee, WI) in a nutrient medium containing 1:1 of Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. This modified culture medium allows airway epithelial cells to better grow and express mucociliary differentiation than before in culture, especially under the Bi-Cg condition. For both Bi and Bi-Cg culture conditions, cells were immersed in the culture medium for 7 days and then the Transwell™ chambers were lifted up in between the air and liquid interface for the remaining days in culture. For dose response and time course experiments, cultures were maintained for 7 to 10 days without all-trans-RA supplementation and then RA at 30 nm or at various concentrations (1–1000 nm) was added accordingly as described in the experiments. After various lengths of time in culture, total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by a single step acid guanidium thiocyanate extraction method (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63225) Google Scholar). COS cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technology, Grand Island, NY). Thirty thousand cDNA clones were derived from primary human TBE cells that had been cultured for more than 30 days under an air-liquid interface culture condition in the completed medium containing both the hormonal supplements and all-trans-RA. Under such an in vitro culture system, the human TBE cells differentiated into a mucociliary epithelium resembling that seen in vivo. The cDNA clones were packaged using a pBK CMV phagemid packaging system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). From the 30,000 cDNA clones, we developed a high density microarray membrane (3.1 × 4.6 cm, Nytran N+ nylon membrane, Schleicher&Schuell, Keene, NH). This 30,000 cDNA high density microarray membrane was hybridized simultaneously with two-color cDNA probes, magenta- and cyan-based, derived from all-trans-RA-treated and untreated cultures of primary human TBE cells, respectively, as described before (41Chen J.J.W. Wu R. Yang P.C. Huang J.Y. Sher Y.P. Han M.H. Kao W.C. Lee P.J. Chiu T.F. Chang F. Chu Y.W. Wu C.W. Peck K. Genomics. 1998; 51: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Based on a quantitative ratio of cyan/magenta either greater than 5 or less than 0.2, clones were selected for further characterization. These characterizations included the use of Northern blot hybridization to further confirm the differentially expressed nature of the corresponding messages in these clones, DNA sequencing to allow searches for homologous genes of known function to provide clues as to the function of a novel gene, and, in some cases, in situhybridization to elucidate cell type-specific gene expression. DNA sequencing was carried out at the DBS Automated DNA Sequencing Facility, UC-Davis. DNA sequence data was analyzed with Lasergene software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and with the online GCG Software package SeqWeb (Madison, WI). Sequence homology to published sequences in public databases was determined by the BLASTn or BLASTp program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) through Internet services. The phylogenetic tree was compiled by the GCG program GrowTree with the following parameters: Kimura distance correction method, UPGMA tree construction method, scoring matrix blossum 62, 8-residue-gap creation penalty, 2-residue-gap extension penalty, 1000-residue maximum sequence input range, 6000-residue maximum gap character insertion allowed, with all branches of the same length (a cladogram). All five cDNAs that represent the novel gene are in the vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene) with the 5′-end at the T3 side of the multiple cloning site. PCR using any of these cDNAs as template, with insert-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-TGAGCAAGTCCACCAACAGT-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GCACGATCTAAATGAGTCCA-3′) generated a fragment of the cDNA containing mostly coding sequence; this PCR product was used to probe Northern blots. For FLAG tagging, the entire coding region of the novel cDNA was fused in frame 3′ to a FLAG tag in the vector pFLAG CMV2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). This was done by introducing a unique EcoRI site just upstream of the presumed translational start codon (see Fig.1 C). The EcoRI site was introduced during PCR; the forward primer (5′-GGGAATTCAATGCTCTTTTGGGTGCTAG) altered five bases of the novel gene's 5′-UTR (the underlined bases), whereas the reverse primer was a commercially available T7 primer. The resulting amplicon was digested with EcoRI andKpnI and inserted into pFLAG-CMV2, which had been cut with the same enzymes. The vector/insert junction was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Twenty micrograms of total RNA were fractionated on a 0.66 m formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel and transferred overnight to a Nytran N+ nylon membrane. RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene). The PCR product derived from the novel cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) to a specific activity of ∼2 × 109 dpm/μg with a Ready-To-Go random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Life Sciences, Arlington Heights, IL). The membranes were prehybridized in hybridization solution (6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.01m EDTA, 0.5% disodium pyrophosphate, 5× Denhardt's solution) at 68 °C for a minimum of 4 h followed by hybridization in the same solution plus specific probe at 68 °C for 16–20 h (overnight). Hybridized membranes were washed once with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and twice with 1.0× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 68 °C. Following the second wash, membranes were checked for excessive radioactivity, and, if necessary, washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for various times at 68 °C. PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Life Sciences) and/or X-Omat film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) were exposed to hybridized membranes for various times. To study the novel gene's expression patterns in normal tissues, Northern blots containing 20 μg of total RNA from various adult primate tissues were prepared, and Northern analysis was carried out as described above. Monkey tissues were obtained from necropsies done at the California Regional Primate Research Center of UC Davis. The sequence of the full-length cDNA was determined by 5′ extension on RNA from human TBE cultured under the Bi-Cg condition with 30 nm all-trans-RA, using an endlabeled antisense primer (5′-AGGAGGGTGAGGCTGGTGATAGAG-3′) and the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). A genomic PCR chromosome walking fragment from the promoter region of the gene was sequenced in parallel with the 5′extension product using the same endlabeled primer and the TaqtrackTM sequencing kit (Promega). Clones obtained from the original phage library screening were converted to phagemids according to the manufacturer's protocol (Strategene). The recombinant plasmids were linearized with EcoRI or XhoI to generate antisense and sense templates, respectively. The linearized templates were transcribed in vitro with T7 and T3 RNA polymerases using MAXIscriptTM according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) to produce35S-UTP-labeled antisense and sense probes, respectively.In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (42Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). A 15-mer oligopeptide antigen was synthesized (Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL) using deduced amino acid sequence 244–258 of hRDH-TBE (see Fig. 1 C). The peptide was conjugated to multiple antigen peptide to increase its antigenicity, and rabbit-based polyclonal antibodies were generated as described before (1Huang T.H. Ann D.K. Zhang Y.J. Chang A.T. Crabb J.W. Wu R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The specificity of the polyclonal antiserum was determined by ELISA and Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, cultured cells were harvested as described (43Huang T.H. St. George J.A. Plopper C.G. Wu R. Differentiation. 1989; 41: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Wu Y.J. Parker L.M. Binder N.E. Beckett M.A. Sinard J.H. Griffiths C.T. Rheinwald J.G.

Supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry using the Bio-Rad Dc assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equal protein amounts were subjected to discontinous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto PVDF or Nytran membranes according to the manufacturer's recommendations with a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Schleicher&Schuell) at 120 mA/45 min/10 cm2 gel surface area. Western hybridization was done using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. TBE cells were grown in air-liquid interface (Bi) without or with 100 nmall-trans-RA. After 21 days, some of the cells were harvested for total RNA and protein isolation. The remaining cells were incubated with either 3 μm all-trans retinol (Fluka) or the equivalent volume of the Me2SO vehicle for 2 h. Alternatively, COS cells were transiently transfected with vector alone or FLAG·hRDH-TBE fusion constructs using FuGENE 6 reagent, following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). Two days post-transfection, one dish from each transfection group was harvested for protein isolation. The remaining COS cells were exposed to 2 μmall-trans retinol or an equivalent volume of the Me2SO vehicle for 5 h. After incubation, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested by scraping into 1–2 ml of 0.002% (v/v) SDS. Cell suspensions were stored frozen at −80 °C. Cell suspensions were thawed in a 37 °C bath. The suspensions were sonicated on ice to complete cell lysis. A small aliquot of each lysate was reserved for protein concentration determination by the Bio-Rad Dc assay. An internal standard was added to the remaining lysate. Retinoids were then extracted by sequential additions of 1.5 volumes of acetonitrile/butanol (1:1 v/v), 0.5 volumes of hexane/chloroform (2:1 v/v), followed by 0.2 volumes of saturated K2HPO4 and were mixed vigorously. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the organic phase was transferred to an amber tube and dried in the dark, under vacuum. The resultant sample residue was reconstituted in 150 μl of methanol/acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (3:1:1 v/v) and analyzed using HPLC for the identification and quantitation of retinoids. Retinoid analysis and quantitation were performed using a reverse phase Nova-Pak C18 (8.0 cm × 10 cm) 4-μm pore size analytical column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Reconstituted cell extracts were analyzed for retinoids under isocratic conditions using an elution solvent mobile phase of methanol/tetrahydrofuran-acetonitrile-isopropyl alcohol (TAI)/0.005 m ammonium acetate (67:10:23 v/v). The TAI solution was comprised of tetrahydrofuran/acetonitrile/2-propanol (3:1:0.02 v/v). Retinoids were detected by UV absorbance at 350 nm. Under these conditions, the system has a lower limit of detection for RA of ∼1.3 pmol at a signal-to-noise ratio of 2.5; detection limits for retinol are ∼3.1 pmol. Cell-associated retinoids are expressed as pmol per mg protein. The retinoid per sample was calculated from each peak area normalized to the peak area of the internal standard and from the amount of protein. All HPLC analyzed groups are from duplicate samples. The amount of all-trans-RA is an indirect measure of retinol dehydrogenase activity because the immediate product of dehydrogenase activity is retinaldehyde, which is irreversibly further oxidized to RA. For calibrations and standards, pure retinoids were made in methanol and their concentrations determined by UV absorbance using published maximal absorbance wavelengths and corresponding molar extinction coefficients (47Furr H.C. Barua A.B. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine.in: Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 179-209Google Scholar). The elution position of matching retinoid standards was used to identify specific retinoid peaks that were then quantified by computer integration of the areas under the respective peaks. The purity of the retinoids was verified by determining the absorption spectra of isolated peaks. Accuracy of the method and calibration conditions were further verified using authenticated samples containing known quantities of retinoids (National Bureau of Standards). Based on differential hybridization results, 79 cDNA clones were selected as RA-responsive clones for further study. 2J. Chen, Y. P. Di, M. M. Chang, K. Chmiel, J. Zhou, M. Juarez, R. W. Harper, Y. Chen, P. C. Yang, C. M. Soref, K. Peck, and R. Wu, manuscript in preparation. Northern blot hybridization confirmed that the corresponding messages of 76 clones were differentially regulated by all-trans-RA. Of the remaining three clones, one was a false positive and the other two were unable to be characterized by Northern blot because of extremely low abundance message levels. Among the 76 differentially expressed clones, 14 encoded novel cDNA sequences. Five of the 14 novel clones, DD13, DD18, DD90, DD91, and DD95, had identical Northern profiles and identical cDNA sequences at the 3′-end of a novel gene. A complete nucleotide sequencing of these clones further confirmed their identical nature. The full-length cDNA sequence of this novel DD13/18/90/91/95 gene was determined by 5′ primer extension (Fig.1). The cDNA contains a 557 bp 5′-UTR, a predicted open reading frame of 960 bp, which is presumably the coding sequence, and a 403 bp 3′-UTR. The conceptual translation of the open reading frame encodes a peptide of 319 amino acids with a predicted molecular size of 35 kDa. All five selected cDNA clones have the same 3′-UTR, coding sequence, and partial 5′-UTR; the clones differ only in how far the 5′-UTR extends upstream of the translational start site (Fig.1 A). Primer extension experiments generated only one product band, indicating a single transcriptional start site (Fig.1 B). These observations suggest that the five clones are incomplete cDNAs generated from a unique template during the creation of the cDNA library. Searches of the GenBankTM non-redundant (nr) database using various incomplete fragments of the novel cDNA sequence as query revealed homology at the DNA level to members of the SDR gene family. A BLAST search of the GenBankTM nr database with the completed cDNA sequence revealed an almost complete identity to three clones identified as retinol dehydrogenase isoforms-1 and -2, and retinol dehydrogenase homolog (GenBankTM accession numbersAF240698, AF240697, and AF067174). No information other than the sequences has been provided for these clones. Alignment of the homologous sequences with the DD13/18/90/91/95 clones indicates that the clones were short in sequence at the 5′-end of the novel gene (Fig.1 A). There are gaps in the alignment of two of the homologous clones, which may represent alternative splicing events. In addition to the close homology to clones AF240698, AF240697, andAF067174, the newly i"

Administration of farnesol, a catabolite within the isoprenoid/cholesterol pathway, also induces apoptosis. The mechanism by which farnesol induces apoptosis is currently believed to be by direct competitive inhibition with diacylglycerol for cholinephosphotransferase, the final step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway. Our recent isolation of the first mammalian cholinephosphotransferase cDNA has enabled us to more precisely assess how farnesol affects phosphatidylcholine synthesis and the induction of apoptosis. Induced over-expression of cholinephosphotransferase in Chinese hamster ovary cells prevented the block in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis associated with exposure to farnesol. However, induced over-expression of cholinephosphotransferase was not sufficient for the prevention of farnesol-induced apoptosis. In addition, exogenous administration of diacylglycerol prevented farnesol-induced apoptosis but did not relieve the farnesol-induced block in phosphatidylcholine synthesis. We also developed an in vitro lipid mixed micelle cholinephosphotransferase enzyme assay, as opposed to the delivery of the diacylglycerol substrate in a detergent emulsion, and demonstrated that there was no direct inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase by farnesol or its phosphorylated metabolites.

Apoptosis occurs naturally during the development process and for the removal of damaged cells or normal cells that have reached the end of their life span. Misregulation of the apoptotic process is believed to be a major means by which cells can become cancerous (3Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 3: 485-495Crossref Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 4Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and conversely many chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer do so by preferential induction of apoptosis in cancer cells (5Kaufmann S.H.

In a recent study, 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to study alterations in cellular metabolites upon treatment with a variety of apoptosis inducing drugs as a means of identifying a marker associated with the induction of apoptosis (7Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the agents tested resulted in an increase in the level of CDP-choline suggesting an inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 synthesis at the cholinephosphotransferase step (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands1996: 153-182Google Scholar). PC is synthesized almost exclusively via the three step Kennedy pathway in most eukaryotic cells types (11Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

In this pathway, choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase to produce phosphocholine which is subsequently converted to CDP-choline by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase with the final step catalyzed by cholinephosphotransferase through the transfer of phosphocholine from CDP-choline to diacylglycerol to produce an intact PC molecule. Genetic inactivation of PC synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by shifting a cell line containing a temperature-sensitive allele of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase to the non-permissive temperature resulted in cell death by apoptosis, and this was prevented by expression of a wild type CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase cDNA (15Cui Z.

Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Farnesol is especially interesting in that it has been demonstrated to preferentially induce apoptosis in several transformed cells versus untransformed cells (17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Rioja A. Pizzey A.R. Marson C.M. Thomas N.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Metabolic analyses using labeled choline determined that the addition of farnesol to several cell types in culture resulted in a rapid and dramatic inhibition of PC synthesis, and the metabolic block was due to inhibition at the cholinephosphotransferase step (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Farnesol-induced apoptosis could be specifically rescued by exogenous PC or diacylglycerol administration, whereas the addition of other phospholipids was ineffective (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Melnykovych G Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An in vitroenzymatic analysis of cholinephosphotransferase activity present in cell membranes indicated that farnesol inhibited PC synthesis by directly competing with diacylglycerol for binding to the active site of cholinephosphotransferase (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it was concluded that farnesol directly competed with diacylglycerol for binding to the cholinephosphotransferase active site resulting in a dramatic inhibition of PC synthesis that directly led to apoptosis (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Our recent isolation of the first mammalian cholinephosphotransferase cDNA (21Henneberry A.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) has allowed us to more precisely determine how farnesol induces apoptosis. Our major findings include the observation that over-expression of human cholinephosphotransferase in CHO cells prevented farnesol-induced inhibition of PC synthesis; however, it did not prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis. In addition, exogenous administration of diacylglycerol significantly reduced farnesol-induced apoptosis but did not rescue PC synthesis. Thus we have uncoupled the inhibition of PC synthesis by farnesol from the ability of farnesol to induce apoptosis. To further this conclusion, a mixed micelle assay was developed for the determination of cholinephosphotransferase activity, and it did not reveal significant inhibition of the enzyme by farnesol or its phosphorylated derivatives. Farnesol-induced apoptosis is notvia inhibition of PC synthesis through direct competition with diacylglycerol for the cholinephosphotransferase active site, but is instead likely through a diacylglycerol-directed mechanism that is downstream of PC synthesis.DISCUSSIONFarnesol is a catabolite of the cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway whose administration preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed versus untransformed cells (16Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G.

The intracellular phosphorylation of farnesol results in the synthesis of farnesol pyrophosphate, which allows for the incorporation of farnesol directly into proteins most notably small G proteins including Ras (29Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Park H.W. Beese L.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein prenylation event is an essential process for oncogenic Ras to affect cellular transformation, and the farnesyl:protein transferase step is the target of several new anticancer drugs (31Law B.

Over-expression of CEPT1 prevented farnesol-induced inhibition of PC synthesis but did not prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis. This was the first demonstration that CEPT1 could synthesize PC in mammalian cells and also implied that inhibition of de novo PC synthesis may not be the mechanism by which farnesol causes apoptosis. We demonstrated that the addition of diacylglycerol, one of the substrates of the cholinephosphotransferase enzyme, prevented farnesol-induced apoptosis (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but most notably exogenous diacylglycerol administration did not reconstitute PC synthesis. The most likely explanation for the inability of diacylglycerol to restore PC synthesis, yet prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis, is that farnesol causes apoptosis by inhibiting a diacylglycerol-mediated process that is produced at an intracellular site distinct from the diacylglycerol pool used for PC synthesis.To further study the mechanism by which farnesol affected PC synthesis we devised a mixed micelle method for the determination of CEPT1 cholinephosphotransferase enzyme activity (27Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This was in contrast to the assays used previously to demonstrate the inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase activity by farnesol, which delivered lipids as an emulsion or did not include lipid-solubilizing detergents in the assay mixture (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mixed micelle method solubilizes the membrane used as enzyme source such that the addition of exogenous lipid substrates or activators/inhibitors does not alter the physical parameters of the micelle containing the cholinephosphotransferase enzyme (27Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This is not the case for the assay in which farnesol was delivered as in emulsion using a small amount of detergent or without the aid of detergents (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using the mixed micelle assay neither farnesol nor its phosphorylated derivatives inhibited CEPT1 cholinephosphotransferase activity. We conclude from this study that farnesol likely does not directly inhibit cholinephosphotransferase activity in vitro but instead alters the physical properties of the membrane such that when farnesol is delivered in the absence of excess detergent cholinephosphotransferase is progressively inactivated. However, the issue of precisely how farnesol inhibits cholinephosphotransferase remains to be resolved. Acidification of the cytosol is associated with most forms of apoptosis and Anthony et al. (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that farnesol rapidly acidified the cytosol in a time dependent manner consistent with inactivation of cholinephosphotransferase activity, especially because the active site of cholinephosphotransferase is known to face the cytoplasm. However, our over-expression of CEPT1 rescued PC synthesis when cells were challenged with farnesol, and acidification should inactivate an enzyme regardless of its expression level. The same explanation could be used to discount the possibility that farnesol physically perturbs the biological membrane resulting in an inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase activity. However, there are few other known effectors of cholinephosphotransferase activity that could be overcome by an increase in CEPT1 expression. One of these is a decrease in cellular diacylglycerol mass, which has been demonstrated to result in the cholinephosphotransferase step becoming rate-limiting for PC synthesis (33Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34O K-M. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the other is a strong in vitroinhibition of cholinephosphotransferase by Ca2+ (35Taniguchi S. Morikawa S. Hayashi H. Fujii K. Mori H. Fujiwara M. Fujiwara M. J. Biochem. 1986; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Neither of these parameters has been measured subsequent to farnesol addition, but both are dependent on a molar amount to alter cholinephosphotransferase activity and could be overcome by increased expression of CEPT1.The ability of diacylglycerol and PC but not other lipids to prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), together with the data presented in our study, leads one to speculate that farnesol or one of its metabolites prevents a diacylglycerol-mediated event that is derived from PC and required for cell survival. If true, a farnesol-mediated process could either interfere with the generation of diacylglycerol produced from PC and/or affect a diacylglycerol target molecule that produces a cell survival signal. Indeed, the diacylglycerol regulated protein kinase Cα and protein kinase Cβ isoforms have been demonstrated to translocate from their active membrane-bound forms to their storage cytosolic forms upon farnesol administration (36Voziyan P.A. Haug J.S. Melnykovych G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 212: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,37Yazlovitskaya E.M. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1995; 88: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The precise pathway by which farnesol causes apoptosis needs to be determined in further detail to delineate how farnesol preferentially targets transformed cells versus those that are untransformed for cell death (17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our study has clarified some of the mechanisms of cross-talk between various lipid metabolic pathways and has highlighted their importance in the balance between the generation of cell survival and apoptotic messages. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a means by which organisms rid themselves of unwanted cells without the induction of an inflammatory response (1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 2Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 9: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Apoptosis occurs naturally during the development process and for the removal of damaged cells or normal cells that have reached the end of their life span. Misregulation of the apoptotic process is believed to be a major means by which cells can become cancerous (3Lowe S.W. Lin A.W. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 3: 485-495Crossref Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 4Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and conversely many chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer do so by preferential induction of apoptosis in cancer cells (5Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 6Sellers W.R. Fisher D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In a recent study, 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to study alterations in cellular metabolites upon treatment with a variety of apoptosis inducing drugs as a means of identifying a marker associated with the induction of apoptosis (7Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the agents tested resulted in an increase in the level of CDP-choline suggesting an inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 synthesis at the cholinephosphotransferase step (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PC is the most abundant lipid present in eukaryotic cell membranes comprising ∼50% of cellular phospholipid mass (10Vance D.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands1996: 153-182Google Scholar). PC is synthesized almost exclusively via the three step Kennedy pathway in most eukaryotic cells types (11Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this pathway, choline is phosphorylated by choline kinase to produce phosphocholine which is subsequently converted to CDP-choline by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase with the final step catalyzed by cholinephosphotransferase through the transfer of phosphocholine from CDP-choline to diacylglycerol to produce an intact PC molecule. Genetic inactivation of PC synthesis in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by shifting a cell line containing a temperature-sensitive allele of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase to the non-permissive temperature resulted in cell death by apoptosis, and this was prevented by expression of a wild type CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase cDNA (15Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Tercé F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). One of the compounds used in the search for alterations in cellular metabolites using 31P NMR spectroscopy during the induction of apoptosis was farnesol, a catabolite of the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (16Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Farnesol is especially interesting in that it has been demonstrated to preferentially induce apoptosis in several transformed cells versus untransformed cells (17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Rioja A. Pizzey A.R. Marson C.M. Thomas N.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Metabolic analyses using labeled choline determined that the addition of farnesol to several cell types in culture resulted in a rapid and dramatic inhibition of PC synthesis, and the metabolic block was due to inhibition at the cholinephosphotransferase step (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 295: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Farnesol-induced apoptosis could be specifically rescued by exogenous PC or diacylglycerol administration, whereas the addition of other phospholipids was ineffective (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Melnykovych G Haug J.S. Goldner C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An in vitroenzymatic analysis of cholinephosphotransferase activity present in cell membranes indicated that farnesol inhibited PC synthesis by directly competing with diacylglycerol for binding to the active site of cholinephosphotransferase (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it was concluded that farnesol directly competed with diacylglycerol for binding to the cholinephosphotransferase active site resulting in a dramatic inhibition of PC synthesis that directly led to apoptosis (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our recent isolation of the first mammalian cholinephosphotransferase cDNA (21Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Henneberry A.L. Wistow G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) has allowed us to more precisely determine how farnesol induces apoptosis. Our major findings include the observation that over-expression of human cholinephosphotransferase in CHO cells prevented farnesol-induced inhibition of PC synthesis; however, it did not prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis. In addition, exogenous administration of diacylglycerol significantly reduced farnesol-induced apoptosis but did not rescue PC synthesis. Thus we have uncoupled the inhibition of PC synthesis by farnesol from the ability of farnesol to induce apoptosis. To further this conclusion, a mixed micelle assay was developed for the determination of cholinephosphotransferase activity, and it did not reveal significant inhibition of the enzyme by farnesol or its phosphorylated derivatives. Farnesol-induced apoptosis is notvia inhibition of PC synthesis through direct competition with diacylglycerol for the cholinephosphotransferase active site, but is instead likely through a diacylglycerol-directed mechanism that is downstream of PC synthesis. DISCUSSIONFarnesol is a catabolite of the cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway whose administration preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed versus untransformed cells (16Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G.

The intracellular phosphorylation of farnesol results in the synthesis of farnesol pyrophosphate, which allows for the incorporation of farnesol directly into proteins most notably small G proteins including Ras (29Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Park H.W. Beese L.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein prenylation event is an essential process for oncogenic Ras to affect cellular transformation, and the farnesyl:protein transferase step is the target of several new anticancer drugs (31Law B. Norgaard P. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10796-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Mangues R. Corral T. Kohl N.E. Symmans W.F. Lu S. Malumbres M. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Pellicer A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1253-1259PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of farnesol administration to alter the prenylation of the small G proteins Ras and Rap1A was tested and neither the prenylation event nor the ability of the G proteins to associate with the membrane was altered (9Miquel K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Using the mixed micelle assay neither farnesol nor its phosphorylated derivatives inhibited CEPT1 cholinephosphotransferase activity. We conclude from this study that farnesol likely does not directly inhibit cholinephosphotransferase activity in vitro but instead alters the physical properties of the membrane such that when farnesol is delivered in the absence of excess detergent cholinephosphotransferase is progressively inactivated. However, the issue of precisely how farnesol inhibits cholinephosphotransferase remains to be resolved. Acidification of the cytosol is associated with most forms of apoptosis and Anthony et al. (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) demonstrated that farnesol rapidly acidified the cytosol in a time dependent manner consistent with inactivation of cholinephosphotransferase activity, especially because the active site of cholinephosphotransferase is known to face the cytoplasm. However, our over-expression of CEPT1 rescued PC synthesis when cells were challenged with farnesol, and acidification should inactivate an enzyme regardless of its expression level. The same explanation could be used to discount the possibility that farnesol physically perturbs the biological membrane resulting in an inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase activity. However, there are few other known effectors of cholinephosphotransferase activity that could be overcome by an increase in CEPT1 expression. One of these is a decrease in cellular diacylglycerol mass, which has been demonstrated to result in the cholinephosphotransferase step becoming rate-limiting for PC synthesis (33Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34O K-M. Choy P.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the other is a strong in vitroinhibition of cholinephosphotransferase by Ca2+ (35Taniguchi S. Morikawa S. Hayashi H. Fujii K. Mori H. Fujiwara M. Fujiwara M. J. Biochem. 1986; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Neither of these parameters has been measured subsequent to farnesol addition, but both are dependent on a molar amount to alter cholinephosphotransferase activity and could be overcome by increased expression of CEPT1.The ability of diacylglycerol and PC but not other lipids to prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis (8Anthony M.L.

If true, a farnesol-mediated process could either interfere with the generation of diacylglycerol produced from PC and/or affect a diacylglycerol target molecule that produces a cell survival signal. Indeed, the diacylglycerol regulated protein kinase Cα and protein kinase Cβ isoforms have been demonstrated to translocate from their active membrane-bound forms to their storage cytosolic forms upon farnesol administration (36Voziyan P.A. Haug J.S. Melnykovych G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 212: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,37Yazlovitskaya E.M. Melnykovych G. Cancer Lett. 1995; 88: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The precise pathway by which farnesol causes apoptosis needs to be determined in further detail to delineate how farnesol preferentially targets transformed cells versus those that are untransformed for cell death (17Adany I.

Our study has clarified some of the mechanisms of cross-talk between various lipid metabolic pathways and has highlighted their importance in the balance between the generation of cell survival and apoptotic messages. Farnesol is a catabolite of the cholesterol/isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway whose administration preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed versus untransformed cells (16Edwards P.A. Ericsson J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 17Adany I. Yazlovitskaya E.M. Haug J.S. Voziyan P.A. Melnykovych G.

The intracellular phosphorylation of farnesol results in the synthesis of farnesol pyrophosphate, which allows for the incorporation of farnesol directly into proteins most notably small G proteins including Ras (29Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Park H.W. Beese L.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein prenylation event is an essential process for oncogenic Ras to affect cellular transformation, and the farnesyl:protein transferase step is the target of several new anticancer drugs (31Law B. Norgaard P. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10796-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Mangues R. Corral T. Kohl N.E. Symmans W.F. Lu S. Malumbres M. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Pellicer A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1253-1259PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of farnesol administration to alter the prenylation of the small G proteins Ras and Rap1A was tested and neither the prenylation event nor the ability of the G proteins to associate with the membrane was altered (9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that farnesol administration preferentially kills transformed cells by a mechanism independent of protein prenylation events. The addition of farnesol and several other compounds that induce apoptosis resulted in the preferential accumulation of the metabolite CDP-choline as monitored by NMR spectroscopy (7Williams S.N.O. Anthony M.L. Brindle K.M. Magn. Reson. Med. 1998; 40: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CDP-choline is used in conjunction with diacylglycerol to synthesize PC by the enzyme cholinephosphotransferase. As genetic inactivation of PC synthesis in CHO cells resulted in apoptosis (15Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Tercé F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it was postulated that farnesol induced apoptosis through its repression of PC synthesis by direct inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase. Evidence gathered in support of this hypothesis has been substantial and includes the observations that (i) metabolic labeling of cells in culture resulted in a dramatic decrease in PC labeling with a corresponding increase in CDP-choline labeling (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and (iii) farnesol inhibited cholinephosphotransferase enzyme activity in vitro (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To further examine the precise interaction between farnesol-induced apoptosis and the inhibition of PC synthesis at the cholinephosphotransferase step we constructed CHO cell lines capable of inducible over-expression of CEPT1, a dual specificity human choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase capable of synthesizing PC and PE in vitro and in vivo (21Henneberry A.L. McMaster C.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Henneberry A.L. Wistow G. McMaster C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29808-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Over-expression of CEPT1 prevented farnesol-induced inhibition of PC synthesis but did not prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis. This was the first demonstration that CEPT1 could synthesize PC in mammalian cells and also implied that inhibition of de novo PC synthesis may not be the mechanism by which farnesol causes apoptosis. We demonstrated that the addition of diacylglycerol, one of the substrates of the cholinephosphotransferase enzyme, prevented farnesol-induced apoptosis (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol.

Comm. 1992; 196: 543-548Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but most notably exogenous diacylglycerol administration did not reconstitute PC synthesis. The most likely explanation for the inability of diacylglycerol to restore PC synthesis, yet prevent farnesol-induced apoptosis, is that farnesol causes apoptosis by inhibiting a diacylglycerol-mediated process that is produced at an intracellular site distinct from the diacylglycerol pool used for PC synthesis. To further study the mechanism by which farnesol affected PC synthesis we devised a mixed micelle method for the determination of CEPT1 cholinephosphotransferase enzyme activity (27Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This was in contrast to the assays used previously to demonstrate the inhibition of cholinephosphotransferase activity by farnesol, which delivered lipids as an emulsion or did not include lipid-solubilizing detergents in the assay mixture (8Anthony M.L. Zhao M. Brindle K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19686-19692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Miquel K. Pradines A. Tercé F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mixed micelle method solubilizes the membrane used as enzyme source such that the addition of exogenous lipid substrates or activators/inhibitors does not alter the physical parameters of the micelle containing the cholinephosphotransferase enzyme (27Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).

R−C≡NNitrile R−N+≡C−IsonitrileIsocyanideEquation 1 Like nitrile, isonitrile is generally highly toxic, and some organisms produce isocyano compounds that probably have a self-defensive function (15Edenborough M.S.

For example, Penicillium notatum synthesizes an isocyanide metabolite, xanthocillin, that exhibits a wide spectrum of antibiotic activity (17Hagedorn I. Tönjes H. Pharmazie. 1957; 12: 567-580PubMed Google Scholar). A marine sponge,Axinella cannabina, produces a sesquiterpenoid compound containing the isocyanide structure, axisonitrile-1 (18Cafieri F.

However, the details of their synthetic and degradative pathways remain unknown, and no enzyme involved in the metabolism of such isocyano-compounds has yet been reported. Among so far known enzymes, only nitrogenase has been reported to act on an isonitrile; it reduces methyl isocyanide to give dimethylamine (by four electrons transfer) or methane plus methylamine (by six electrons transfer) (20Kelly M. Postgate J.R. Richards R.L. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 1c-3cCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Rubinson J.F. Corbin J.L. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, methyl isocyanide is just an alternative substrate for nitrogenase. The enzymes metabolizing isonitriles as its physiological substrate remain unknown.We are interested in how C–N hydrolases evolved. Because isonitrile contains a nitrogen-carbon bond in its structure, an isonitrile-hydrating enzyme (which has not been discovered) would also belong to the category of C–N hydrolases. A search for such an enzyme and its functional analysis would probably provide us with new knowledge about C–N hydrolases, which might serve as clues for elucidating the pathways of their functional and structural evolution. In the present paper, we describe the isolation of an isonitrile-degrading microorganism, Pseudomonas putidaN19-2, from soil and the purification and characterization of an enzyme named isonitrile hydratase that catalyzes the hydration of isonitrile to the corresponding N-substituted formamide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCyclohexyl isocyanide and N-cyclohexylformamide were purchased from Fluka Chemical Co. (Buchs, Switzerland) and Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. DEAE-Sephacel and a low molecular weight standard kit were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. TSK gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M was purchased from Tosoh Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Cellulofine GCL-2000 superfine was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Marker proteins for molecular mass determination by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)1 were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co. (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals used were from commercial sources and were of reagent grade.Isolation of Isonitrile-degrading BacteriaIsonitrile-degrading bacteria were isolated from soil samples as follows. A spoonful of a soil sample was added to a test tube containing 10 ml of medium (pH 7.0) consisting of 10 g of glycerol, 0.5 g of K2HPO4, 0.5 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.005 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 1 ml of a vitamin mixture (0.4 g of thiamine hydrochloride, 0.2 g of riboflavin, 0.4 g of pyridoxime hydrochloride, 0.4 g of nicotinic acid, 10 mg of folic acid, 0.4 g of calcium pantothenate, 2 mg of biotin, 2 g of inositol, and 0.2 g of p-aminobenzoic acid in 1 liter of distilled water), and cyclohexyl isocyanide at a final concentration of 0.01% (v/v)/liter of tap water. Cultivation was performed with shaking at 28 °C for 1 week. Once a week, 1 ml of the culture was inoculated into 10 ml of fresh medium. After 3 weeks of cultivation, the concentration of cyclohexyl isocyanide was increased to 0.02% (v/v). After a month of further cultivation, the microorganisms were spread on agar plates and isolated.Assaying of the Isonitrile-degrading Abilities of the Isolated StrainsEach of the isolated strains was inoculated into a test tube containing 10 ml of 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl/liter of distilled water) supplemented with cyclohexyl isocyanide at a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v) and then incubated at 28 °C for 48 h with reciprocal shaking. Then the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and suspended in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).The isonitrile-degrading abilities of the isolated strains were assayed by means of the resting cell reaction. The reaction mixture (400 μl) was composed of 40 μmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 4 μmol of cyclohexyl isocyanide, 20 μl of methanol, and an appropriate amount of cell suspension. Methanol was added to enhance the solubility of the substrate. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C for 30 min and stopped by placing the reaction mixture on ice water and then rapidly removing the cells by centrifugation at 0–4 °C. The residual amount of cyclohexyl isocyanide in the reaction mixture was determined by HPLC with a Shimadzu LC-6A system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II column (reversed-phase; 4.6 by 150 mm: Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and a refractive index detector (RID-6A, Shimadzu), instead of the UV spectrophotometric detector (SPD-6A) of the original system. The following solvent system was used: 5 mmKH2PO4-H3PO4 buffer (pH 2.9), acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min.Identification of the Compound Produced from Cyclohexyl Isocyanide by P. putida N19-2The product in the reaction mixture with cells of P. putida (which was identified as described under “Results”) was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), concentrated, and then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. GC-MS was performed with a Shimadzu GCMS-QP5050 equipped with an FFS ULBON HR-1 capillary column (0.25 × 50 m; Shinwa Chemical Industries, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The initial column temperature of 50 °C was raised at 5 °C/min to 120 °C. The injection and detector temperatures were 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 28 ml/min.Culture Conditions for P. putida N19-2P. putida N19-2 was collected from an agar plate and then inoculated for the first subculture. The first subculture was carried out at 28 °C for 24 h with reciprocal shaking in a test tube containing 10 ml of 2× YT medium supplemented with cyclohexyl isocyanide at a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v). Then 1 ml of the first subculture was inoculated into a 500-ml shaking flask containing 90 ml of the second subculture medium (pH 7.0) consisting of 10 g of glycerol, 1 g of (NH4)2SO4, 13.4 g of K2HPO4, 6.5 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g of FeSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 1 ml of a vitamin mixture, and cyclohexyl isocyanide at a final concentration of 0.02% (v/v)/liter of tap water. The second subculture was also performed at 28 °C for 24 h with reciprocal shaking. Then 5 ml of the culture was inoculated into a 2-liter shaking flask containing 500 ml of the same medium as used for the second subculture, followed by incubation at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by continuous flow centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C and then washed twice with 0.01m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol.Purification of Isonitrile HydrataseAll purification steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol was used throughout the purification steps. Centrifugation was carried out for 30 min at 18,000 × g.Step 1: Preparation of a Cell-free ExtractWashed cells (40 g) from 12 liters of culture broth were suspended in 150 ml of 0.1m buffer and then disrupted by sonication at 9 kHz for 30 min with an Insonator model 201M (Kubota, Tokyo, Japan). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation.Step 2: Ammonium Sulfate FractionationThe resulting supernatant solution was fractionated with ammonium sulfate (45–60% saturation), followed by dialysis against 10 mm buffer.Step 3: DEAE-Sephacel Column ChromatographyThe dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer. Protein was eluted from the column with 1 liter of the same buffer by increasing the concentration of KCl linearly from 0 to 1 m. The active fractions were pooled, and then ammonium sulfate was added to give 70% saturation. After centrifugation of the suspension, the precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 m buffer and then dialyzed against 10 mmbuffer.Step 4: TSK Gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M Column ChromatographyThe enzyme solution from step 3 was mixed with an equal amount of 50 mm buffer containing 40% saturated ammonium sulfate and then placed on a TSK gel Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (2.6 × 22 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm buffer containing 20% saturated ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted by lowering the concentration of ammonium sulfate (20 to 0% saturation) in 1 liter of the same buffer. The active fractions were combined and precipitated with ammonium sulfate to bring 70% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 0.1m buffer, and then dialyzed against 10 mmbuffer.Step 5: Cellulofine GCL-2000sf Column ChromatographyThe enzyme solution from step 4 was concentrated with a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) to 0.7 ml, and then placed on a Cellulofine GCL-2000sf column (2.6 × 108 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm buffer. The rates of sample loading and column elution were kept at 15 ml/h. The active fractions were combined and then precipitated with ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 70%. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then dissolved in 0.1 m buffer. The enzyme solution was dialyzed against 10 mm buffer and then preserved in 10 mm buffer containing 50% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C.Enzyme AssayIsonitrile hydratase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (400 μl) consisting of 40 μmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 4 μmol of cyclohexyl isocyanide, 20 μl of methanol, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. Methanol was added to enhance the solubility of the substrate. The enzyme activity was not inhibited even in the presence of 10% (v/v) methanol (data not shown). The reaction was carried out at 20 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 400 μl of cold acetonitrile to the reaction mixture. The amount ofN-cyclohexylformamide formed was determined by HPLC, which was performed with the same system as used for the measurement of cyclohexyl isocyanide under “Assaying of the Isonitrile-degrading Abilities of the Isolated Strains,” except that a UV spectrophotometric detector (SPD-6A) was used. The wavelength of 198 nm was used for the monitoring.One unit of isonitrile hydratase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmolN-cyclohexylformamide/min from cyclohexyl isocyanide under the above conditions.Protein was determined by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye binding method of Bradford (22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar), using dye reagent supplied by Bio-Rad. The specific activity is expressed as units/mg protein.ElectrophoresisSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed in a 12.5% polyacrylamide slab gel according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The relative molecular mass of the enzyme subunit was determined from the relative mobilities of marker proteins, phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa).Molecular Mass DeterminationThe enzyme sample (20.4 μg) was subjected to HPLC on a TSK G-3000SW column (0.75 × 60 cm; Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) and then eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 280 nm. The molecular mass of the enzyme was calculated from the mobilities of the standard proteins, glutamate dehydrogenase (290 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (142 kDa), enolase (67 kDa), adenylate kinase (32 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa).Metal AnalysisAll glassware was soaked in 2 m HCl overnight and then exhaustively rinsed with distilled water before use. Prior to analysis, the enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The dialysis caused no effect on the enzyme activity (16.5 units/mg). The enzyme sample containing 0.9 mg protein/ml was analyzed with an inductively coupled radiofrequency plasma spectrophotometer, Shimadzu ICPS-8000 (27.120 MHz; Kyoto, Japan). The metal contents of the enzyme sample were determined from the calibration curves for standard solutions.NH2-terminal Sequence AnalysisThe purified enzyme sample (20.4 μg) was subjected to an Applied Biosystems model 476A protein sequencer (Foster City, CA), and the NH2-terminal sequence was analyzed by automated Edman degradation.Substrate SpecificityThe following isonitrile, nitrile, and amide compounds were tested as to the substrate specificity: (a) isonitriles: cyclohexyl isocyanide, benzyl isocyanide, methyl isocyanoacetate, ethyl isocyanoacetate, and isocyanomethyl phosphonic acid diethyl ether; (b) nitriles: propionitrile,n-butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile,n-valeronitrile, cyclohexyl cyanide, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, crotononitrile, benzonitrile, benzyl cyanide, and 4-cyanopyridine; and (c) amides: propionamide,n-butyramide, isobutyramide, n-valeramide, cyclohexanecarboxamide, acrylamide, methacrylamide, crotonamide, benzamide, phenylacetamide, and isonicotinamide.The assaying of substrate specificity was carried out in a reaction mixture (400 μl) consisting of 40 μmol of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 4 μmol of substrate, 20 μl of methanol, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. However, when propionitrile,n-butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile,n-valeronitrile, propionamide, n-butyramide, isobutyramide, and n-valeramide were used as substrates, their final concentrations were 100 mm. Methanol was added to enhance the solubility of the substrate. The reaction was carried out at 20 °C for 30 min (unless otherwise specified) and stopped by adding 400 μl of cold acetonitrile (when isonitriles were used as substrates) or 100 μl of 1 m HCl (when nitriles or amides were used as substrates) to the reaction mixture.The levels of substrate consumption were determined with the same HPLC system as used under “Enzyme Assay.” The following wavelengths were used for monitoring: 194 nm for benzyl isocyanide, 195 nm for methyl isocyanoacetate and ethyl isocyanoacetate, 198 nm for cyclohexanecarboxamide, 200 nm for methacrylonitrile, 205 nm for crotononitrile and benzyl cyanide, 220 nm for acrylonitrile, and 230 nm for the others. Isocyanomethyl phosphonic acid diethyl ether, propionitrile, n-butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile,n-valeronitrile, and cyclohexyl cyanide were measured by HPLC with a refractive index detector (RID-6A) instead of a UV spectrophotometric detector (SPD-6A).DISCUSSIONIsonitriles are unique in that they form the only class of organic compounds that contain a stable, formally mono-coordinated carbon (15Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isocyano group exhibits a dual nucleophilic/electrophilic character, which is often exploited for synthetic applications:e.g. α-addition reactions, multi-component condensation reactions, in the synthesis of peptides, in coordination chemistry, organometallic reactions, and carbohydrate chemistry (15Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).On the other hand, there have been many reports of naturally occurring isonitriles (15Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Scheuer P.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992; 25: 433-439Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, no enzyme involved in the metabolism of isonitriles has been found. Among so far known enzymes, only nitrogenase is known to act on an isonitrile; it converts methyl isocyanide to the corresponding amine (20Kelly M. Postgate J.R. Richards R.L. Biochem. J. 1967; 102: 1c-3cCrossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Rubinson J.F. Corbin J.L. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 6260-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). But isonitriles are not physiological substrates of the enzyme. Although it might be possible that isonitrile-metabolizing organisms produce and utilize nitrogenase to degrade isonitriles, it remains unclear whether it is the case or not. In this work, we isolated an isonitrile-degrading bacterium, which has been identified as P. putida, from soil and purified isonitrile hydratase from the cells. This enzyme has been found to act only on isonitriles, leading to formation of the corresponding N-substituted formamides. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is quite distinct from that of nitrogenase; the former is hydration, and the latter is reduction.The enzyme consists of two identical subunits and contains no metal. Isonitrile hydratase is different from nitrilase (which catalyzes the direct hydrolysis of nitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid and ammonia; Refs. 32Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9000-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 33Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nitrile hydratase (which catalyzes the hydration of nitrile to the corresponding amide; Refs. 1Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 11Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, and 34Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). With respect to the noninvolvement of a metal in isonitrile hydratase, however, the enzyme is similar to nitrilase of R. rhodochrous J1 (5Kobayashi M. Komeda H. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20746-20751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) rather than to the metal-containing nitrile hydratases of Brevibacterium, Pseudomonas, andR. rhodochrous J1 (1Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 2Yamada H. Kobayashi M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1391-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 27Nagasawa T. Nanba H. Ryuno K. Takeuchi K. Yamada H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 28Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Kobayashi M. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2465-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nagasawa T. Ryuno K. Yamada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Sugiura Y. Kuwahara J. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5848-5850Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar), although the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is hydration and not hydrolysis. The enzyme is also like the R. rhodochrous J1 nitrilase as to the sensitivity to various compounds. It is sensitive to thiol reagents and oxidizing reagents, whereas it is not influenced by chelators or reducing reagents. This suggests that isonitrile hydratase may have an active cysteine residue in its catalytic center, like the R. rhodochrous J1 nitrilase (5Kobayashi M. Komeda H. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20746-20751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, experiments on the substrate specificity of this enzyme have revealed that it does not attack nitriles or amides as substrates. On the other hand, both the purified nitrilase from R. rhodochrous J1 and the purified high molecular mass nitrile hydratase from R. rhodochrous J1 did not act on isonitriles, which were substrates for isonitrile hydratase (data not shown). Further studies are required to clarify the reaction mechanism of isonitrile hydratase.The main physiological role of isonitrile hydratase for P. putida N19-2 seems to be detoxification. We intended to isolate an isonitrile-assimilating microorganism through acclimatization culture utilizing cyclohexyl isocyanide as a nitrogen source in the culture medium. However, the resting cells of P. putida N19-2 released almost all of the consumed cyclohexyl isocyanide to the reaction mixture as N-cyclohexylformamide, suggesting that P. putida N19-2 has little or no ability to assimilate the formamide produced from cyclohexyl isocyanide. Therefore, isonitrile hydratase would likely be a detoxification enzyme rather than the first participant in the pathway for isonitrile assimilation.Some organisms produce isocyano-compounds that are probably used to protect them from their enemies (15Edenborough M.S. Herbert R.B. Natl. Prod. Rep. 1988; 5: 229-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Scheuer P.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1992; 25: 433-439Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Hagedorn I. Tönjes H.

Scheuer P.J. Finer J. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 4763-4764Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To elucidate the metabolic pathways for such isonitriles, a few incorporation experiments have been carried out in vivo (36Hagadone M.R. Scheuer P.J. Holm A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2447-2448Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Achenbach H. Grisebach H. Z. Naturforsch. 1965; 20B: 137-140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Achenbach H. König F. Chem. Ber. 1972; 105: 784-793Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), e.g. the compounds that were supposed to be involved in the metabolism of naturally occurring isonitriles were labeled with a radioisotope and then fed to the isonitrile-producing organisms, and then the metabolites were isolated and assayed for radioactivity. These experiments revealed some of the isonitrile metabolic pathways. For example, it has clearly been demonstrated that 2-isocyanopupukeanane is transformed to the corresponding N-substituted formamide and isothiocyanate in a Hymeniacidon species, whereas the reverse reaction does not occur (36Hagadone M.R. Scheuer P.J. Holm A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2447-2448Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The experiments involvingP. notatum have indicated that tyrosine could act as the precursor of xanthocillin; both the nitrogen atoms of the isocyano groups and the carbon framework were derived from tyrosine (37Achenbach H. Grisebach H. Z. Naturforsch. 1965; 20B: 137-140Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Achenbach H. König F. Chem. Ber. 1972; 105: 784-793Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the origin of the carbon atoms of the isocyano groups remains a mystery, there has been one report suggesting that xanthocillin might be synthesized from the corresponding diformamide (39Pfeifer S. Bär H. Zarnack J. Pharmazie. 1972; 27: 536-542PubMed Google Scholar); this is contrary to the case of 2-isocyanopupukeanane. However, all of the experiments were in vivo and not in vitro. As described above, no research at the protein or gene level has been done. Our work on the isonitrile degradation in P. putidaN19-2 is the first at the protein level, and now molecular cloning of the gene is in progress. It is expected that isonitrile-producing organisms may also have isonitrile-degrading enzymes, as indicated forHymeniacidon sp. If such enzymes exhibit similarity to our isonitrile hydratase in the primary structure, the cloned gene of isonitrile hydratase could possibly serve as a probe for obtaining these enzyme genes. Moreover, it might enable one to clone the genes of the isonitrile-synthetic enzymes if the genes involved in the metabolism of isonitrile are closely located, forming gene clusters.In conclusion, this report is about an enzyme responsible for the degradation of isonitrile; we discovered an enzyme involved in the N≡C triple bond hydration reaction. Further characterization of this enzyme could provide new clues for elucidating the synthetic and metabolic pathways for naturally occurring isonitriles. Moreover, it would also provide us with novel knowledge about C–N hydrolases and lead to a better understanding of their evolutionary pathways. Nitriles are very toxic and"

To investigate the signaling mechanism whereby α and βγ subunits of Gq activate p38 MAPK, we introduced kinase-deficient mutants of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3), MKK4, and MKK6 into human embryonal kidney 293 cells. The activation of p38 MAPK by Gαq and Gβγ was blocked by kinase-deficient MKK3 and MKK6 but not by kinase-deficient MKK4. In addition, Gαq and Gβγ stimulated MKK3 and MKK6 activities. The MKK3 and MKK6 activations by Gαq, but not by Gβγ, were dependent on phospholipase C and c-Src. Gαqstimulated MKK3 in a Rac- and Cdc42-dependent manner and MKK6 in a Rho-dependent manner. On the other hand, Gβγ activated MKK3 in a Rac- and Cdc42-dependent manner and MKK6 in a Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-dependent manner.

ERK phosphorylates many transcription factors, translation factors, and other kinases (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar,2Robinson M.J.

ERK is activated by MEK1 and MEK2, which are activated by Raf (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). On the other hand, JNK and p38 MAPK were originally identified as cellular stress-activated protein kinases. Recently, these kinases were shown to be cooperatively and independently involved in various biological functions such as cytoskeletal regulation, cell movement, and development (1Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

JNK phosphorylates transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2, whereas p38 MAPK phosphorylates many transcription factors including ATF2 and MEF2C and other kinases (3Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

MKK4/SEK1/JNKK1/SKK1 phosphorylates and activates both JNK and p38 MAPK, whereas MKK7/JNKK2/SKK4 specifically phosphorylates and activates JNK (3Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are commonly used to transduce the signals across seven-transmembrane receptors. G proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits (Gα, Gβ, and Gγ) and activated by the G protein-coupled receptors, which respond to sensory signals, hormones, neurotransmitters, and chemokines in mammalian cells (5Gilman A.G.

Ras mediates the activation of c-Raf, which in turn activates MEK1 and MEK2. It is likely that MEK1 and MEK2 equally activate ERK. Some types of G protein-coupled receptors have been reported to stimulate the activity of JNK (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.P. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it has been shown that Gβγ stimulates JNK activity mainly through MKK4 dependent on a tyrosine kinase not in the Src family and Rho family small GTPases Rho and Cdc42 and to a lesser extent through MKK7 dependent on Rho family small GTPase Rac (15Yamauchi J.

In previous study, we found that m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulates the activity of p38 MAPK, and its activation is mediated by both Gαq and Gβγ (18Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how G protein-coupled receptors and G protein subunits activate p38 MAPK. Here we demonstrate that m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor induces p38 MAPK activation mediated by MKK3 and MKK6, but not by MKK4. Furthermore, we show that Gαq and Gβγ differentially regulate MKK3 and MKK6 through parallel signaling pathways.

A recombinant hexahistidine-tagged KD-p38 MAPK was purified from the transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. E. coli cells treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in extraction buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc.), and the resin was washed with column buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 mm NaCl) with 20 mmimidazole.

GST-ATF2-(1–96) was purified as described previously (18Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol.

Human embryonal kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Plasmid DNAs were transfected into HEK 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The final amount of the transfected DNA for a 60-mm dish was adjusted to 25 μg by empty vector, pCMV. Three μg of pCMV-HA-p38 MAPK, pCMV-GST-MKK3, or pCMV-GST-MKK6 was cotransfected with 0.3 μg of pCMV-m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, 10 μg of plasmids encoding Gαq wild type or mutants, 5 μg of pCMV-Gβ1 or pCMV-Gβ1T143A and 5 μg of pCMV-Gγ2, 10 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK3K64R, 10 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK4K95R, 10 μg of pCMV-FLAG-MKK6K82R, 10 μg of plasmids encoding dominant negative Ras and Rho family small GTPases, 10 μg of pEFBOS-C3 exoenzyme, 10 μg of pCMV-Myc-Pak1CRIB, 10 μg of plasmids encoding constitutively activated Rho family small GTPases, 3 μg of pCMV-Csk, or 10 μg of pEFBOS-v-Src. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin 24 h after transfection, and the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h. The transfected cells were lysed in 600 μl of lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For the p38 MAPK assay, aliquots (50 μg of protein) of the supernatants were mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preabsorbed with a mouse anti-HA antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer A and twice with reaction buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 μmNa3VO4, and 2 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The immobilized p38 MAPK was incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer A containing 1 μg of GST-ATF2-(1–96), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. For MKK3 and MKK6 assays, aliquots (500 μg of protein) of the supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged. The precipitates were washed with lysis buffer A and with reaction buffer A and incubated in 30 μl of reaction buffer A containing 4 μg of KD-p38 MAPK, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. After they were boiled, the samples were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactivities incorporated into GST-ATF2-(1–96) or KD-p38 MAPK were measured by an imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS 2000) and detected by autoradiography using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The cells transfected with the plasmids encoding Myc-Pak1CRIB were lysed in lysis buffer A. Aliquots (500 μg of protein) of the cell lysates were mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B preabsorbed with a mouse anti-Myc antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer A. Aliquots of the cell lysates and immune complexes were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The boiled samples were separated by 8 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, the membranes were subjected to immunoblotting with various antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected using Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. To examine a signal transduction pathway linking m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to p38 MAPK, we transfected plasmids encoding HA-tagged p38 MAPK with various cDNAs into human embryonal kidney 293 cells. Using an anti-HA antibody, the epitope-tagged p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate, and the in vitro kinase activity was assessed as the radioactivity incorporated into recombinant ATF2. The expression level of HA-p38 MAPK was confirmed by immunoblotting in each experiment to compare each transfection efficiency (see Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The p38 MAPK activation by stimulating m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor with an agonist, carbachol, was specifically blocked by co-transfection of MKK3K64R or MKK6K82R but not by that of MKK4K95R (Fig. 1, A–C). MKK3K64R, MKK4K95R, and MKK6K82R are kinase-deficient constructs and act as dominant negative mutants by sequestering upstream components (25Molnar A. Theodoras A.M. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

The cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GST-MKK3 or GST-MKK6, which are tagged with GST at the N terminus. GST-MKK3 and GST-MKK6 were precipitated from the cell lysate using glutathione-resin, and the kinase activities were assessed as the radioactivity incorporated into recombinant kinase-deficient p38 MAPK (KD-p38 MAPK). In each experiment, we examined the expression level of GST-MKK3 or GST-MKK6 to monitor each transfection efficiency (see Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11). As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulated the activities of MKK3 and MKK6. These results indicate that m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulates the activity of p38 MAPK through two p38 MAPK kinases, MKK3 and MKK6.Figure 5Differential regulation of the pathways from Gαq and Gβγ to MKK3 and MKK6 by Rho family small GTPases.

https://openalex.org/W2060683048,"The active elements of the β-globin locus control region (LCR) are located within domains of unique chromatin structure. These nuclease hypersensitive sites (HSs) are characterized by high DNase I sensitivity, erythroid specificity, similar nucleosomal structure, and evolutionarily conserved clusters ofcis-acting elements that are required for the formation and function of the core elements. To determine the requirements for HS core formation in the setting of nuclear chromatin, we constructed a series of artificial HS cores containing binding sites for GATA-1, NF-E2, and Sp1. In contrast to the results of previous in vitro experiments, we found that when constructs were stably integrated in mouse erythroleukemia cells the binding sites for NF-E2, GATA-1, or Sp1 alone or in any combination were unable to form core HS structures. We subsequently identified two new cis-acting elements from the LCR HS4 core that, when combined with the NF-E2, Sp1, and tandem inverted GATA elements, result in core structure formation. Both new cis-acting elements bind Sp1, and one binds erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF). We conclude that in vivo β-globin LCR HS core formation is more complex than previously thought and that several factors are required for this process to occur. The active elements of the β-globin locus control region (LCR) are located within domains of unique chromatin structure. These nuclease hypersensitive sites (HSs) are characterized by high DNase I sensitivity, erythroid specificity, similar nucleosomal structure, and evolutionarily conserved clusters ofcis-acting elements that are required for the formation and function of the core elements. To determine the requirements for HS core formation in the setting of nuclear chromatin, we constructed a series of artificial HS cores containing binding sites for GATA-1, NF-E2, and Sp1. In contrast to the results of previous in vitro experiments, we found that when constructs were stably integrated in mouse erythroleukemia cells the binding sites for NF-E2, GATA-1, or Sp1 alone or in any combination were unable to form core HS structures.

The genes of the locus are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion (reviewed in Ref. 1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P.W. Perlmutter R.M. Varmus H. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 135-182Google Scholar). The embryonic ε-globin gene is expressed in the fetal yolk sac, the γ-globin genes are expressed in the fetal liver, and the adult δ- and β-globin genes are expressed in adult bone marrow. Because of this complicated pattern of transcriptional regulation, the β-like globin genes have served as an important model for understanding the regulation of complex, multi-gene, eukaryotic loci. Since the original description of the β-globin locus control region (LCR)1 more than 10 years ago, this ∼25-kb region has been a primary focus of efforts to understand the mechanisms of regulated globin gene expression. Although significant advances have been made, the functions attributable to the LCR, its mechanisms of action, and its physical structure remain to be determined (2Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Bulger M. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 13: 2465-2477Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 4Engel J.D. Tanimoto K. Cell. 2000; 100: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Most of the transcriptional activity of the LCR has been localized to specific core elements that are a few hundred base pairs in size (5Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 6Talbot D. Philipsen S. Fraser P. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2169-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 7Philipsen S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These LCR core elements share several common structural and functional properties. Each is closely associated with one of the five nuclease HSs currently considered to comprise the LCR (5′ HS1–5). These HSs are developmentally stable, and LCR HSs 1–4 are erythroid-specific (9Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 10Forrester W.C. Takegawa S. Papayannopoulou T. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Groudine M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10159-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In contrast to the promoter-associated HSs of the locus, the β-globin LCR HSs are ∼10–20-fold more sensitive to DNase I digestion (9Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 13Dhar V. Nandi A. Schildkraut C.L. Skoultchi A.I. Mol. Cell.

At the nucleosomal level, the LCR cores are characterized by regions of nucleosome disruption or displacement spanning ∼200 bp (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 15Pomerantz O. Goodwin A.J. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5684-5691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the DNA level, each LCR HS core sequence is highly conserved between species (16Hardison R. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Goodman M. Stojanovic N. Miller W. Gene. 1997; 205: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Structural similarities are also present between the different LCR cores within the same species. We have previously observed that the cores of LCR HSs 1–4 contain tandem, inverted GATA-binding elements located ∼50 bp downstream from AP-1/NF-E2-binding elements (also known as maf response elements) (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These binding sites are located within the nucleosome-free regions of the HS cores; when these sites are mutated, loss of the normal chromatin structure of the HS and of appropriate expression from linked transgenes in transgenic mice occurs (8Philipsen S. Pruzina S. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H.

Recent experiments in β-globin yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice have emphasized the importance of the HS core elements to the function of the LCR, because deletion of a 280-bp element containing the HS4 core or a 225-bp element containing the HS3 core both result in dramatic changes in gene expression despite the presence of otherwise intact β-globin yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) (19Navas P.A. Peterson K.R. Li Q. Skarpidi E. Rohde A. Shaw S.E. Clegg C.H. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 188-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bungert J. Dave U. Lim K.C. Lieuw K.H. Shavit J.A. Liu Q. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3083-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). One interpretation of this data is that the LCR core elements are required for the formation of an LCR holocomplex that incorporates each of the individual LCR elements. In an effort to better understand the structure and function of the LCR core elements, we have studied the requirements for formation of the unique chromatin structures associated with these elements. In previous experiments we found that a 1.1-kb fragment from the region of LCR HS4 is able to autonomously form the characteristic core structure in fetal liver cells of transgenic mice (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar results have been found for human LCR HS2 (22Pawlik K.M. Townes T.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and for the endogenous mouse LCR elements (23Bender M.A. Mehaffey M.G. Telling A. Hug B. Ley T.J. Groudine M. Fiering S. Blood. 2000; 95: 3600-3604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation experiments localized this activity to a 101-bp element that is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of LCR HS4 (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have termed this the HS-forming element or HSFE (see Fig.1 A). Researchers in our laboratory (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Pruzina et al. (24Pruzina S. Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have used in vitro DNA-protein binding assays to show that several binding sites are present within this element. These include binding sites for the ubiquitous factors AP-1 and Sp1 and the hematopoietic factors NF-E2 and GATA-1 (see Fig. 1 A). The GATA elements are present as tandem, inverted repeats and are located ∼50 bp 3′ of the AP-1/NF-E2 site. We have also shown that mutation of the NF-E2 site or the GATA binding sites reduces the sensitivity of HS4 so that it becomes equivalent to the promoter-associated HSs (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Mutation of both NF-E2 and GATA sites within the same construct results in almost complete loss of the HS. Examination of DNA sequences from the other human LCR HS cores revealed that NF-E2 and tandem, inverted GATA binding sites, separated by ∼50 bp, were common to each HS (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These sites are conserved in the β-globin LCR HS cores of chickens, rabbits, goats, mice, and galagos (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Hardison R. Elnitski L. ElSherbini A. Goldstrohm A. Jackson J. Peck J. Riemer C. Schwartz S. Stojanovic N. Miller W.

Stegman L. Hardison R. Miller W. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Goodman M. Gumucio D.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 3457-3469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that mutation of these conserved NF-E2- and GATA-binding elements within HS2 and HS3 of the human LCR also results in the loss of normal HS formation (2Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Boyes and Felsenfeld (27Boyes J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), using an experimental design that also involved plasmid integration, obtained similar results with the chicken β-globin enhancer. These investigators compared chromatin accessibility between single and multi-copy integrants and found little difference, except that some single copy clones exhibited position effects. These findings have led us to hypothesize that there is a common core structure, located near the center of each of the LCR HSs, that is necessary for the formation and normal functioning of each of the elements. The data also lead us to propose that the NF-E2-binding element and tandem, inverted GATA-binding elements found within each LCR HS core are not only necessary, but also sufficient, to establish the active chromatin structures of the β-globin LCR HSsin vivo. Although previously published results studying LCR HS formation in vitro or in unintegrated vector systems have implicated NF-E2, GATA-1, and EKLF in globin locus DNase I HS formation (28Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gong Q. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30McDowell J.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the roles of these factors in native chromatin have not been determined. To test our hypothesis that GATA-1- and/or NF-E2-binding elements are necessary and sufficient for LCR HS core formation in the native chromatin of erythroid cells, we constructed a series of artificial HS-forming elements based on the LCR HS4 HSFE, in which consensus binding sites for NF-E2, GATA, Sp1, and two previously unidentified binding elements were incorporated into a portion of the firefly luciferase cDNA. We have determined that neither the NF-E2 or GATA binding sites, alone or in combination, are sufficient for the formation of an LCR core HS in nuclear chromatin and that additional factor binding sites, including those for Sp1 and/or EKLF, are also required. A 1.6-kbXbaI/XbaI fragment of the firefly luciferase cDNA was subcloned into the XbaI site of a previously described pUC-based plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene and a 1.9-kb HindIII/HindIII fragment from the region of the β-globin LCR HS3 (see Fig. 1 B) (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The 5′XbaI site is internal to the cDNA, whereas the 3′XbaI site is derived from a polylinker sequence. Control HS4 sequences were isolated from previously described plasmids (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), blunted, and cloned into a unique HincII site within the luciferase cDNA (see Fig. 1 B). Site-directed mutagenesis (Chameleon method; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to create consensus NF-E2-, GATA-, and Sp1-binding motifs within the luciferase cDNA. The following oligonucleotides, containing the factor binding sites flanked by 8–16 bp of luciferase cDNA sequence, were used in the mutagenesis procedure (see Fig. 3) (specific factor-binding motifs are underlined): NF-E2 site oligonucleotide, 5′-ACAAAGGATATGCTGAGTCACCCGCTGAAT-3′; tandem, inverted GATA site oligonucleotide, 5′-ACCCCAACTGATAGCACTATCTCGTGGCAG-3′; Sp1 site oligonucleotide, 5′-CCCGCTGAATTGGAATGGGCAGGGTTACAACACCCC-3′. The following oligonucleotides containing the 5′ and 3′ ends of the HS4 HSFE were also used in the mutagenesis procedure. Sequences derived from the HSFE are underlined. The 5′ HSFE sequence is 5′-CATATGGCTTGCCCTGCCTCTCTACTAGGCTCAGGTGGCCCCCGCTG-3′, and the 3′ HSFE sequence is 5′-GCAGAGCCAGGGCCGGGACGATGACGCCGGTGAAC-3′. Multiple rounds of mutagenesis were performed to obtain constructs with multiple factor binding sites. The HS4-derived matrix attachment region (MAR) is a 691-bp BamHI/AccI fragment from the 5′ end of the 1.4-kb BamHI/SphI HS4 region (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Test constructs were stably transfected into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and clones selected in G418 as previously described (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vivo DNase I sensitivity assays were performed on nuclei isolated from pools of 25 clones as previously described (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For most experiments nuclei (200 µg of DNA/reaction) were digested in a volume of 200 µl with DNase I at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 µg/ml. Not all DNase I concentrations are shown for all experiments. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 10 min. Following DNase I treatment, genomic DNA was isolated and digested to completion with XhoI for Southern blotting (see Fig. 1 B). A 547-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment from the 5′ end of the luciferase fragment served as an indirect end-labeling probe for Southern blotting (see Fig. 1 B). Nuclear extracts from MEL cells were prepared, and gel shift assays were performed as previously described (32Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 33Bresnick E.H. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Double-stranded versions of the nucleotides used to form the artificial factor binding sites for NF-E2, GATA-1, and Sp1 were used as gel shift probes. Control HS4 GATA and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) NF-E2 gel shift oligonucleotides have been previously described (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The control Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ was from the α-2(I) collagen gene promoter (35Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Harti C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The HS4 HSFE Sp1 binding site oligonucleotide was 5′-TCCAAGGCCCAGCAATGGGCAGGGCTCTGTCAGGGC-3′ (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Anti-Sp1 antibody used in super-shift and competition experiments was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-59-G). The oligonucleotides used for gel shifts with the 5′ HSFE and 3′ HSFE were 5′-ATGGCTTGCCTGCCTCTCTACTAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGAGCCAGGGCCGGACCGCTTGAAG-3′, respectively. The oligonucleotide used for the EKLF binding site was 5′-AGCTAGCCACACCCTGAAGCT-3′, which is the consensus site from the β-globin promoter (36Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The EKLF antibody used in the competition experiment was a kind gift from Dr. James Bieker (37Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that NF-E2 and tandem, inverted GATA sites, separated by ∼50 bp, are sufficient for HS formation in nuclear chromatin, we constructed the test plasmid shown in Fig.1 B. When stably transfected into MEL cells, the construct is able to direct DNase I HS formation (14Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1989; 86: 5439-5443Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This plasmid contains a neomycin resistance gene (neoR) for the selection of stable transfectants and a 1.9-kb HS3 fragment, which serves as an internal control for LCR HS formation. The HS3 fragment forms two HSs, primary HS3 (1° HS3) and secondary HS3 (2° HS3). The 1° HS3 contains the functional core of HS3 and forms the typical “super” LCR HS, whereas the 2° HS3 is a much weaker HS with a DNase I sensitivity approximately equal to that of the globin promoter-associated HSs. The presence of these two internal control HSs allows for semiquantitative determination of the DNase sensitivity of artificial or mutant HSs. The neoR gene also serves as a control for HS formation, because a strong HS is formed in the region of the gene promoter. This element contains portions of the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene promoter and an enhancer from the polyoma virus (39Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). The MEL cell line has an adult erythroid phenotype, because it expresses the murine adult β-globin gene. GATA-1 is the only GATA family member expressed in these cells (40Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 41Zon L.I. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. Mather C. Reynolds D.S. Austen K.F. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22948-22953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-E2 and AP-1 are the two major NF-E2 consensus sequence-binding factors in MEL cells (32Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6011-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 42Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The test construct also contains a portion of the firefly luciferase cDNA. This 1.6-kb XbaI/XbaI DNA fragment was chosen to serve as a “neutral” or non-HS-forming fragment of DNA because it contains no known regulatory elements and is non-mammalian in origin. We used site-directed mutagenesis to create consensus factor binding sites within this fragment of DNA (Fig. 1) or subcloned portions of LCR HS4 into the HincII site of the luciferase cDNA to serve as positive control sequences for HS formation. Test plasmids were stably transfected into MEL cells, and following selection in G418, pools of 25 individual clones were analyzed for the ability of the inserted sequences to direct HS formation. For our assay system to work, the luciferase cDNA fragment should not form any DNase I HSs itself; nor should it inhibit HS formation. To determine whether our model met these criteria, we first tested the wild-type luciferase sequence alone. As shown in Fig. 2, this construct formed each of the expected internal control HSs including theneoR-associated HS and both 1° and 2° HS3. No DNase I HS is formed within the luciferase cDNA sequence. We next placed a full-length, 1.1-kb HS4 fragment into theHincII site of the luciferase cDNA. This resulted in the formation of a typical super DNase HS, which is much more sensitive than 2° HS3. Finally, we placed the previously described 101-bp HS4 HSFE into the HincII site. This construct also formed a strong DNase I HS. These results indicated that in the context of the luciferase cDNA all the cis-acting sequences necessary for forming a globin LCR HS are present within the HSFE and that the luciferase cDNA does not inhibit HS formation. The next step in testing our hypothesis was to use site-directed mutagenesis to place consensus NF-E2 and tandem, inverted GATA sites into the luciferase cDNA. These sites were inserted near the ClaI restriction site (Figs. 1 and3). We utilized the NF-E2-binding sequence from the PBGD promoter as our model NF-E2 site. NF-E2 binding to this sequence has been well characterized (32Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W.

Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The tandem GATA sequences from the HS4 HSFE were used in the test construct. Factor binding to these sites has also been well characterized (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The spacing between the NF-E2- and GATA-binding elements was the same as in the HS4 HSFE (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig.4 A, the presence of either the NF-E2 site (artificial HS construct 1, AH1) or tandem, inverted GATA binding sites, alone (AH2) or in combination (AH3), was insufficient for the formation of a DNase I HS. The open arrows in Fig. 4 A indicate the locations of the inserted factor-binding sequences. In each case the internal control HSs formed normally. One possible explanation for these results was that our artificial binding sites were, due to surrounding nucleotide sequences, unable to interact with NF-E2 and/or GATA proteins. To assess this possibility we performed gel mobility shift assays. In each case, oligonucleotides containing the artificial binding sites and their flanking luciferase cDNA sequences were compared with previously characterized oligonucleotides containing the naturally occurring binding sites. Nuclear extracts from MEL cells were used for these experiments. These are the same cells used in our DNase I HS assays and in previously published binding studies. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 B. Using the artificial GATA-binding sequences we saw two bands (Fig. 4 B). These bands comigrate with the two bands seen with the wild-type tandem GATA sites from HS4. These bands are due to single and double occupancy of the two sites (21Lowrey C.H. Bodine D.M. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Pruzina S. Hanscombe O. Whyatt D. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both gel shift bands are competed by 200-fold excess unlabeled self- and wild-type HS4 GATA sequences. An unrelated (NF-E2) oligonucleotide did not compete. Similarly, the artificial GATA sites are able to compete for binding to the wild-type HS4 sites. Because GATA-1 is the only GATA protein present at appreciable levels in MEL cells (40Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In Fig. 4 B the results of gel shift assays using the artificial NF-E2 site are shown. Here the control binding site is a previously characterized oligonucleotide derived from the PBGD promoter (43Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.-H.

A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These two oligonucleotides differ only in the sequences flanking the consensus NF-E2-binding element. Our results with the control binding site are equivalent to those published using the same oligonucleotide with extracts from MEL cells (32Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W.

The lower band is due to NF-E2 binding, and the middle band is due to AP-1 binding. The upper band has not, to our knowledge, been specifically identified. The artificial binding site exhibits three gel shift bands that comigrate with the control bands. The one significant difference appears to be a relative increase in the upper band relative to"

We have constructed and validated recombinant structural mimics of the heterodimeric αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic domain. The mimics elicited polyclonal antibodies that recognize a combinatorial epitope(s) formed in mixtures of the αIIband β3 cytoplasmic domains but not present in either isolated tail. This epitope(s) is present within intact αIIbβ3, indicating that interaction between the tails can occur in the native integrin. Furthermore, the combinatorial epitope(s) is also formed by introducing the activation-blocking β3(Y747A) mutation into the β3 tail. A membrane-distal heptapeptide sequence in the αIIb tail (997RPPLEED) is responsible for this effect on β3. Membrane-permeant palmitoylated peptides, containing this αIIb sequence, specifically blocked αIIbβ3 activation in platelets. Thus, this region of the αIIb tail causes the β3 tail to resemble that of β3(Y747A) and suppresses activation of the integrin.

Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Integrin-mediated adhesion is rapidly and precisely regulated, a process that is often central to integrin functions (2Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). One important regulatory mechanism is cellular modulation of integrin affinity for ligand (activation). These affinity changes arise from both changes in the conformation of the extracellular domain and lateral clustering of integrins in the plane of the membrane (3Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Integrin activation has been widely documented among members of this receptor family and controls cell adhesion, migration, and the assembly of the extracellular matrix (4Hughes P.E. Pfaff M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Thus, integrin activation plays an important role in mediating integrin functions. Integrins are noncovalent heterodimers of type I transmembrane protein subunits termed α and β. Each subunit has a large (>700 residues) N-terminal extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a generally short (13–70 residues) cytoplasmic domain (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). In general, integrin α and β subunits contain a remarkably conserved 7–10-residue motif near the junction of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (membrane-proximal segment) (6Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The remainders of the cytoplasmic domain sequences are generally less well conserved. Integrin β cytoplasmic domains are required for activation because mutations or truncations of specific membrane-distal sequences in β cytoplasmic tails can disrupt activation (7O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 8Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A particularly sensitive site is a highly conserved NPX(Y/F) motif in the β cytoplasmic domain where substitution of the Tyr with Ala (e.g. β3(Y747A)) blocks activation (11O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This region of the β tail is important for binding to cytoskeletal proteins, such as talin because a Tyr → Ala substitution in the NPX(Y/F) motif also disrupts talin binding to β tailsin vitro (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Kaapa A. Peter K. Ylanne J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of an integrin-binding fragment of talin in cells activates integrin αIIbβ3 (14Calderwood D.A.

Thus, interactions of membrane distal portions of the β cytoplasmic domain with proteins such as talin appear to be important in integrin activation. In addition to a role for the membrane-distal portion of the β cytoplasmic domain, interactions between integrin α and β subunit cytoplasmic tails may regulate activation. Deletion of the membrane-proximal region of either α or β tail activates integrins (7O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

In addition, specific point mutations in this segment of both the α and β subunits promote constitutive bidirectional signaling in integrin αIIbβ3 (18Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and other integrins (19Lu C.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary mutations in the α and β subunits suggest that these activating mutations disrupt an interaction between the highly conserved membrane-proximal portions of the α and β cytoplasmic tails (18Hughes P.E.

In vitro integrin α and β cytoplasmic domain interactions have been reported by surface plasmon resonance analysis (20Vallar L. Melchior C. Plancon S. Drobecq H. Lippens G. Regnault V. Kieffer N. J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1167-1176PubMed Google Scholar) and by alterations in circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence (22Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6017-6026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of the α and β cytoplasmic domains with acidic and basic peptides that form an α-helical coiled-coil caused inactivation of integrin αLβ2 (23Lu C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, replacement of these cytoplasmic domains with two basic peptides that do not form an α-helical coiled-coil activated αLβ2. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that an interaction between integrin α and β tails regulates activation. We previously used a synthetic strategy to produce a model of the cytoplasmic domain of integrin αIIbβ3 (24Muir T.W. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. Kent S.B.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The integrin cytoplasmic domains are tethered at their N termini to membrane spanning presumptive α-helices. Moreover, they are laterally constrained because the subunits interact with each other. More importantly, they have vertical constraints, because they are initially parallel to each other and are in a specific vertical stagger as they exit the membrane. The model protein was made by the covalent ligation of two synthetic polypeptides (called “minisubunits”) consisting of an integrin cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus, connected to a 28-residue stretch comprised of four heptad repeats derived from tropomyosin. The parallel orientation and stagger of the two tails is defined by the formation of the covalent linkage and by a noncovalent helical coiled-coil structure between heptad repeats on each minisubunit. We now describe a completely recombinant model of the αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic domain. By using recombinant proteins, we avoided limitations of polypeptide length and modest yield encountered in the initial synthetic approaches. Moreover, we modified the design of the model protein to contain four heptad repeats derived from the GCN4 transcription factor in place of those derived from tropomyosin. We used two variant sequences that preferentially heterodimerize (25John M. Briand J.-P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16247-16253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to obviate an inherent 50% loss in yield of heterodimer. In the present work, we utilized these model proteins as a tool to probe the potential role of integrin αβ tail interaction in regulating activation. Antibodies raised against these model proteins revealed the presence of combinatorial epitopes formed by a mixture of the αIIb and β3 tails but not present in either isolated tail. These combinatorial epitopes were present in intact integrin αIIbβ3 isolated from platelets, suggesting that the αIIb and β3tail can interact in the intact receptor. Moreover, the same set of epitopes was present in the β3 tail bearing a Tyr747 → Ala mutation, even in the absence of the αIIb tail. This result indicates that αIIbcytoplasmic domain causes the β3 tail to resemble the activation-defective β3(Y747A) mutant. Furthermore, we mapped the αIIb residues required for this interaction into a minimal heptapeptide sequence and found that palmitoylated peptides containing this sequence specifically blocked the agonist-induced activation of integrin αIIbβ3 in platelets. Thus, our data provide evidence that the αIIb and β3 tails can interact in the native integrin and indicate that the interaction opposes integrin activation by altering the structure of the β3 cytoplasmic domain. Polymerase chain reaction as described (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) was used to create a cDNA encoding the modified GCN4 heptad repeat protein sequences reported by John et al. (25John M. Briand J.-P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16247-16253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs were ligated into aNdeI-HindIII-restricted modified pET15b vector (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) (Novagen). αIIb and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domain cDNAs were generated by polymerase chain reaction from appropriate cDNAs using forward oligonucleotides introducing a 5′-HindIII site and reverse oligonucleotide creating a 3′-BamHI site directly after the stop codon. Integrin cytoplasmic domains were joined to the helix as HindIII-BamHI fragments and verified by sequencing. Recombinant expression in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and purification of the recombinant products was performed as described with an additional final purification step on a reverse phase HPLC1 column (Vydac) (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Typical yields were ∼10 mg/liter of bacterial culture. To form heterodimers, a mixture of 45 μm β3 and 90 μm αIIb cytoplasmic tail model proteins were denatured for 20 min at 100 °C in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. The dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration through a PD 10 column (Bio-Rad), and the mixture was then air-oxidized by stirring overnight. The disulfide-bonded products were purified by reverse phase C18 HPLC. The products were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using an API-III quadrupole spectrometer (Sciex). Typically we recovered ∼30 mg of heterodimer/preparation. The identity of each model protein is specified by the nature of the GCN4 helix (Jun-like = J, Fos-like = F), the number of Gly spacers (G0–G4), and the identity of the integrin tail (αIIb and β3), e.g. JG3αIIb. Synthetic peptides were prepared by the Scripps Microchemistry Core using a Gilson AMS 422 or ABI 430A Peptide Synthesizers. One β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide (β3(Ile719–Thr762)) was a generous gift of Drs. Ed Plow and Tom Haas (Cleveland Clinic). The peptides were routinely >90% homogeneous as judged by reverse phase HPLC using an analytical Vydac C-18 column. Their mass varied by less than 0.1% from that predicted from their sequence as judged by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. Peptides were desalted prior to use, and peptide concentrations were verified by quantitative amino acid analysis. Antibodies to the αIIbβ3 cytoplasmic domain heterodimer model protein (see Fig. 1) (anti-αIIbβ3-Cyt) were raised in 2.5-kg New Zealand White rabbits. Antibodies were also produced against the β3(Y747A) model protein (anti-β3(Y747A)). 100 μl of a water solution containing 1 mg/ml of the model protein was emulsified in 1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant and administered subcutaneously to the rabbits. Two additional injections at 2-week intervals were followed by bleeding (∼50mls) at monthly intervals until the rabbits were sacrificed. The blood was permitted to clot at room temperature, and the serum was recovered by centrifugation. Serum was heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and stored at −20 °C. A preimmune serum, obtained prior to immunization, was used as a control.

The final product was greater than 95% homogenous as judged by SDS-PAGE. In the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the αIIbβ3 was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in a coating buffer containing 0.1m NaHCO3 and 0.05% NaN3. 50 μl/well was used to coat Immulon II microtiter wells at 4 °C overnight. After removal of the coating solution, 150 μl of blocking buffer (coating buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin) was added. After an additional 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the blocking buffer was removed, and the plates were washed three times with wash buffer (0.01m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% thimerisol, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Preliminary titration experiments established a dilution of anti-model protein antibody resulting in 75% maximal binding. 25 μl of the competitor was added to each well followed by 25 μl of this dilution of the anti-model protein antibody. Following mixing, the plate was covered for 1 h at 37 °C and washed four times with wash buffer. To quantify bound antibody, 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was diluted to a concentration of 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. These plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. After four washes, bound antibody was assayed by measuring peroxidase activity with O-phenylenediamine as a substrate and quantifying reaction product by its optical density at 490 nm. The data were expressed as B/B0 whereB = A490 in the presence of competitor and B0 = A490in its absence. In some experiments, varying concentrations of αIIb peptides were added to a fixed, saturating quantity of the β3 model protein (10–50 nm). Competition was again expressed asB/B0; however,B0 was A490 in the presence of the β3 protein and no added αIIb peptide. EC50 was defined as the dose of αIIb resulting in B/B0= 0.5. The generation of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant integrins αIIbβ3 and αIIbΔ996β3Δ717 has been described (10Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were cell surface-labeled with sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in an immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine HCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After clarification by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, cell lysate was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with antibody overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the immunoprecipitation buffer four times, and the precipitated polypeptides were extracted with SDS sample buffer. Precipitated cell surface biotin-labeled polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and detected with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Backbone assignment has been described previously, and 3 JHNα coupling constants for the tails have been reported previously2 and were determined now for the coiled-coil region from the same data set as described previously. Fibrinogen binding to platelets was performed as described previously (30Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, 100 nm125I-labeled fibrinogen and the indicated concentration of peptide inhibitor were preincubated for 30 min at 22 °C with a suspension of washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) in Tyrode's solution containing added 10 mm Hepes, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml glucose, and 2 mm CaCl2. 20 μm ADP and 20 μm epinephrine were added to this suspension, and the resulting mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min. Bound125I-labeled fibrinogen was separated from free by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion and was quantified by γ scintillation spectrometry. To test potential interactions between the αIIb and β3cytoplasmic tails, we first produced model proteins designed to mimic their normal arrangement in integrin αIIbβ3. Recombinant α-helical coiled-coils were previously used to model dimerized integrin β cytoplasmic domains (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Heptad repeats of identical length derived from GCN4 were used to form the nearly symmetrical, parallel coiled-coil. To favor heterodimer formation, Lys residues were placed in the in the g1 and e2 positions of the first and second heptad repeats to make a “Jun-like” helix (25John M. Briand J.-P. Granger-Schnarr M.

These complementary helices produce preferentially heterodimerizing parallel coiled-coils (25John M. Briand J.-P. Granger-Schnarr M. Schnarr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16247-16253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also introduced a unique Cys residue N-terminal of each helix so that the formation of a cystine bridge would ensure parallel orientation and correct stagger of the coiled-coil. (Fig.1 A). A dimer was formed in which the Jun-like helix was fused to the αIIb cytoplasmic domain and a Fos-like helix was fused to the β3 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1 B) (JG3αIIb-FG3β3) model protein. A three-Gly spacer was inserted between the helices and the integrin α or β cytoplasmic domains to prevent the propagation of helical structure into the integrin tails (12Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).2 The mass of the heterodimer differed by less than 0.1% from that predicted for the desired covalent structure (Fig. 1 C), and SDS-PAGE confirmed that disulfide bonds covalently linked the heterodimers (Fig.1 D). Furthermore, NMR analysis confirmed formation of the symmetrical, parallel coiled-coil domain by the heptad repeats and that the helical structure of this domain did not propagate into the β3 tail as will be discussed in full detail elsewhere.2 In particular, the coiled-coil behaved as a rigid, folded unit, whereas the motions of the β3 tail residues appear largely uncoupled from each other as judged from NMR signal intensities of the FG3β3 subunit of JG3αIIb-FG3β3 (Fig. 1 E). Because of the symmetry of the coiled-coil all properties of the Fos-like heptad-repeats can be inferred to be present the Jun-like heptad repeats. The value of the 3 JHNαcoupling constant reflects the backbone conformation (ranging from helical to extended conformations) at the residue in question (31Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). For the Fos-like heptad repeats, values below 5.5 Hz show distinctly helical (and folded) conformations. Thus, the recombinant JG3αIIb-FG3β3 model protein had the expected properties. As noted above, there is substantial mutational and in vitro data to suggest that integrin αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains interact with each other. An immunochemical approach was used to determine whether such interactions could occur within the intact receptor. Antibodies were raised against JG3αIIb-FG3β3 protein (anti-αIIbβ3-Cyt). As expected, those antibodies reacted with native αIIbβ3as judged by immunoprecipitation of the intact receptor. Furthermore, the capacity of these antibodies to immunoprecipitate the receptor depended on the presence of the cytoplasmic domains, because deletion of both cytoplasmic domains abolished reactivity (Fig.2 A). Having established that antibodies raised against JG3αIIb-FG3β3 reacted with the cytoplasmic domain of the native receptor, we sought to analyze potential interactions between the tails. We reasoned (Fig. 2 B) that if the α and β cytoplasmic domains interact with each other, then this interaction could create novel, combinatorial epitopes. To detect potential combinatorial epitopes, we assayed the effect of linear peptides comprising the αIIb or β3cytoplasmic domains on the binding of anti-αIIbβ3-Cyt to integrin αIIbβ3 purified from human platelets. A full-length αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide produced negligible inhibition (Fig. 2 C). The β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide competed to a maximum of 63 ± 0.7%. Thus, antibodies reactive with intact integrin αIIbβ3 were resistant to competition by either of the linear peptides (Fig. 2 C). These residual antibodies, however, could be competed by a mixture of the αIIb and β3 peptides (Fig. 2 C). Consequently, these antibodies recognize epitopes expressed in the native αIIbβ3 and formed by the interaction of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains. To exclude potential solubility artifacts, we examined the binding of an antibody against a linear β3 cytoplasmic domain peptide to the native αIIbβ3 integrin (Fig.2 D). In contrast to the result with anti-αIIbβ3-Cyt, the β3peptide could completely inhibit antibody binding. Furthermore, an αIIb peptide completely inhibited the binding of an anti-αIIb cytoplasmic domain to αIIbβ3 (data not shown). These combinatorial antibodies were produced by only two of the four New Zealand White rabbits immunized with JG3αIIb-FG3β3. They may represent an unusual specificity because immunization of several strains of inbred mice (e.g. Balb C, C57Bl 6) failed to elicit such antibodies (data not shown). Thus, these immunochemical results indicate that the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic domains can form a combinatorial epitope(s) in the intact integrin. In the presence of the αIIb tail there is reduced targeting of β3-containing integrins to cytoskeletal structures and a suppression of bidirectional signaling (15O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J.

These functional similarities prompted us to test the capacity of the β3(Y747A) mutant to compete for the set of antibodies recognizing combinatorial epitopes in the cytoplasmic domain of αIIbβ3. The β3(Y747A) mutant competed nearly completely for the binding of anti-αIIbβ3-Cyt to integrin αIIbβ3 (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, addition of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide to the β3(Y747A) produced little increase in competition. In contrast, as noted previously, a population of antibodies was resistant to inhibition by the wild type β3 cytoplasmic domain. Thus, a point mutation in the β3 tail that disrupts its signaling function and its capacity to interact with the cytoskeleton causes the β3 tail to exhibit combinatorial epitopes formed in the presence of the αIIb tail. The foregoing result suggested that the αIIb cytoplasmic domain causes the β3 tail to resemble the β3(Y747A) mutant. To test this idea, we raised polyclonal antibodies against the FG3β3(Y747A) model protein and tested the reactivity of those antibodies with native αIIbβ3. The capacity of those antibodies to bind αIIbβ3 was completely inhibited by the immunogen, FG3β3(Y747A) (Fig. 3 B). No significant increase in competition was observed in the presence of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide (data not shown). In sharp contrast, the wild type FG3β3 failed to compete completely (Fib. 3B). The addition of an αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide to FG3β3 resulted in complete competition. Thus, the presence of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain caused the antigenicity of the β3 cytoplasmic domain to resemble that of β3(Y747A). The foregoing studies suggested that the αIIb cytop"
https://openalex.org/W2065556782,"The Smads are a family of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that modulate transcription in response to transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) by recruiting transcriptional activators like the histone acetyltransferase, p300/CBP, or repressors like the histone deacetylase, HDAC1, to TGFβ target genes. The association of Smads and HDAC1 is mediated in part by direct binding of Smads to the HDAC1-associated proteins, TG-interacting factor, c-ski, and SnoN. Although ectopic expression of these proteins inhibits Smad-activated transcription, the contribution of histone deacetylase enzymatic activity to transcriptional repression by TGFβ is unknown. Here, the biological requirements for the interaction between Smads and endogenous histone deacetylase activity are investigated. We identify residues in Mad homology domain 1 of Smad3 that are required for association with histone deacetylase activity. An amino acid change at one of these critical residues does not disrupt the association of Smad3 with c-ski, SnoN, and transforming growth-interacting factor but does abrogate the ability of Smad3 to repress transcription. These findings indicate that the association of Smad3 and histone deacetylase activity relies on additional protein mediators that make contact with Smad3 at its amino terminus. Moreover, these data suggest that the suppressive effect of Smad3 on transcription is dependent upon its association with histone deacetylase enzymatic activity."

The proportion between these two forms is regulated by other proteins such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar). The function of EF-Tu·GTP is to bind aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to form a stable ternary complex that interacts with the A site of the mRNA-programmed ribosome. Upon codon recognition, rapid GTP hydrolysis takes place. As a consequence, EF-Tu switches into the GDP conformation, releases the aa-tRNA into the A site, and dissociates from the ribosome. Active EF-Tu·GTP then is regenerated by the GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by another elongation factor, EF-Ts. The structures of GTPase family members reveal a common structural GDP/GTP-binding core (the G domain) and several consensus sequence elements defining the guanine nucleotide-binding site (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar, 2Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The switch between the active and the inactive forms of the proteins involves conformational changes in two common parts of the G domain: the switch I region, which is usually positioned between helix α1 and strand β2 and varies in length, sequence, and structure among different GTPases, and the more conserved switch II region, which consists of helix α2 and the flanking loops. The N-terminal flanking loop contains the consensus element DXXG, which is involved in binding of the γ-phosphate, the Mg2+ ion, and a water molecule in the vicinity of the γ-phosphate. Many of the family members, e.g. EF-Tu, Gαi1, and small Ras-like GTPases, also contain one or more glycines located in the C-terminal loop flanking the switch II region. The conformational transitions that take place in EF-Tu upon switching between its GTP and GDP states have been elucidated from the x-ray structures of EF-Tu·GDP from Escherichia coli (3Kjeldgaard M.

It was suggested that the hydrolysis of GTP and the release of the γ-phosphate induces the transition starting from Gly83(E. coli numbering) at the N terminus of helix α2 by breaking the hydrogen bond between the main chain amide nitrogen and the γ-phosphate. As a consequence, the peptide bond between Pro82 and Gly83 flips by 150°, thereby causing a rotation of helix α2 by 42°. Additionally, the position of the helix is shifted from spanning residues 87–97 in the GTP form to residues 83–93 in the GDP form. The switch II region is coupled to the switch I region, which during the conformational switch undergoes a remarkable structural change causing an α to β rearrangement in the conserved part of the region (residues 53–59) (4Polekhina G.

The movements in the two switch regions create a new surface of the G domain, which, in turn, leads to a reorientation of domains 2 and 3, which rotate by 90° and become separated from the G domain. Similar structural transitions have been observed for helix α2 of other G proteins, such as Ras (9Schlichting I. Almo S.C. Rapp G. Wilson K. Petratos K. Lentfer A. Wittinghofer A. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Nature. 1990; 345: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and Gαi1 (10Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 270: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The structure-function relations of the two glycines, Gly83and Gly94, flanking helix α2 of EF-Tu, were previously investigated by mutation to alanines either separately or in combination, with the aim of restricting the flexibility of helix α2. The mutant proteins were subjected to in vitrocharacterization under steady-state conditions with respect to their interactions with GTP, GDP, aa-tRNA, and nonprogrammed ribosomes. Overall, the restriction of the flexibility at position 83 appeared to cause a severe defect in the ability of the factor to interact productively with the ribosome (11Kjærsgård I.V. Knudsen C.R. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although the substitution of glycine with alanine at position 94 resulted in a conformation that favored the binding of GTP (12Knudsen C.R. Kjaersgard I.V. Wiborg O. Clark B.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to study the interaction between the ternary complexes formed with these mutants and the ribosome using pre-steady-state kinetic methods. The results allow the identification of the partial reactions of EF-Tu on the ribosome that are affected by the mutations. Ribosomes from E. coli MRE600 and tRNAs were prepared as described (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 14Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Wild type EF-Tu with a C-terminal Ser(His)6 tag and EF-Tu mutants were purified as described (11Kjærsgård I.V. Knudsen C.R. Wiborg O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Knudsen C.R. Kjaersgard I.V. Wiborg O. Clark B.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ribosome complexes with blocked P sites were prepared by incubating the ribosomes with a 1.3-fold excess of AcPhe-tRNAPhe and 0.5 mg/ml of poly(U) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. EF-Tu·GDP (20 pmol) were activated by incubation with 1 mm GTP, 3 mm P-enolpyruvate, 200 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 50 mmNH4Cl) supplemented with MgCl2 (0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Purified [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe (15 pmol; 1000 dpm/pmol) were added in 5 μl of the appropriate buffer. Poly(U)-programmed ribosomes (10 pmol) were added in 25 μl of buffer, and the reaction was carried out for 3 min at 37 °C. The background was determined in the absence of EF-Tu and was subtracted. Ribosome-bound [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe was determined by filtering the reaction through nitrocellulose filters that had been soaked in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNH4Cl, 7 mm MgCl4). The filters were washed with 3 ml of buffer C and dissolved in scintillation mixture QS361 (Zinsser Analytics) before determining the amount of radioactivity retained on the filter in a scintillation counter. Fluorescence stopped flow measurements were carried out at 20 °C as described previously (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) using an SX-18MV Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). The fluorescence of proflavin was exited at 436 nm and detected after passing a KV 500 filter (Schott), whereas the fluorescence of the mant-group was exited at 349 nm and measured after passing a KV 408 filter (Schott). The experiments were initiated by rapid mixing of equal volumes (60 μl each) of the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA and the ribosome complex at the concentrations given in the figure legends. Ternary complexes were formed from EF-Tu·GTP and Phe-tRNAPhe charged in situ and were not purified further, because the ternary complexes with EF-Tu mutants were unstable and dissociated during gel filtration. The extent of tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) charging was found to be ∼75%. The ratio between EF-Tu and aa-tRNA was optimized to ensure the best possible signal-to-noise ratio, which was found when either EF-Tu or aa-tRNA was present in 4-fold excess. The same amount of ternary complex was formed independently of whether EF-Tu or aa-tRNA is present in excess. The unpurified system gave results similar to those obtained previously with ternary complex purified by gel filtration containing wild type EF-Tu with a C-terminal Ser(His)6 tag (23Vorstenbosch E. Pape T. Rodnina M.V. Kraal B. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6766-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with respect to both rates and fluorescence effects. When the fluorescence signal originating from the proflavin label was followed, the ternary complex was prepared by incubating 2.4 μm EF-Tu, 16 μm GTP, 3 mm ATP, 3 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.6 μmtRNAPhe (Prf16/17), 1% phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, 1 mm phenylalanine, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 0.05 μm EF-Ts in buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C. When mant-GTP fluorescence was to be monitored, 2.4 μm EF-Tu was incubated in buffer A with 1.2 μm EF-Ts and 2.4 μm mant-GTP for 15 min at 37 °C. Then 0.6 μm purified Phe-tRNAPhe was added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min at room temperature. Where indicated, the ratio between EF-Tu and Phe-tRNAPhe was reverted without affecting the total amount of ternary complex formed. mant-GTP was always present in the same molar amount as EF-Tu, whereas EF-Ts was always present in half the molar amount as EF-Tu. When EF-Tu·mant-GTP was present in excess over Phe-tRNAPhe, that is under the conditions used to study the conformational changes of Phe-tRNAPhe, the fluorescence change obtained was small or absent because of the strong fluorescence background of uncomplexed EF-Tu·mant-GTP. In the cases of wild type EF-Tu and the mutant EF-Tu(G94A) where a fluorescence change could be detected, the resulting data were used in numerical integration. The data obtained with the excess of Phe-tRNAPhe over EF-Tu·mant-GTP were only used for a qualitative evaluation of the reaction steps. In the cases where apparent rates could be derived, these appeared to be comparable irrespective of which component, EF-Tu·mant-GTP or Phe-tRNAPhe, was in excess. For quench-flow experiments, a KinTek quench-flow apparatus was used. Equal amounts (16 μl each) of ribosome complex and ternary complex were rapidly mixed at 20 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of the appropriate quenching solution (see below). To measure the rates of GTP hydrolysis, the ternary complex was prepared by incubating 0.6 μm EF-Tu, 4 μm[γ32P]GTP (1300–1900 dpm/pmol), 3 mmP-enolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.4 μmpurified Phe-tRNAPhe, and 0.05 μm EF-Ts in buffer A for 5 min at 37 °C. The GTPase reaction was terminated with 1 m HClO4, 3 mm potassium phosphate, and the liberated inorganic phosphate was extracted as described (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The background caused by Pi contamination in GTP and intrinsic GTPase activity of EF-Tu was measured both before and after the quench-flow experiment and subtracted. To measure the rates of dipeptide formation, the ternary complexes were formed by the incubation of 2.4 μm EF-Tu, 16 μm GTP, 3 mm P-enolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.6 μm purified [3H]Phe-tRNAPhe (4800–5300 dpm/pmol), and 0.05 μm EF-Ts in buffer A for 5 min at 37 °C. After mixing with poly(U)-programmed ribosomes containing AcPhe-tRNAPhe in the P site, the reaction was terminated by quenching with 1 m KOH, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then neutralized with acetic acid. The peptides formed were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Also in the absence of the factor, Phe-tRNAPhe was able to slowly bind to the free A site (not shown). The background level of dipeptide formation caused in this way was measured in the absence of EF-Tu, and the respective correction was made. Apparent rate constants were determined by exponential fitting, using one, two, or three exponential terms (characterized by variable time constants,kapp, and respective amplitudes) and a variable for the final signal. Codon-independent initial binding of the ternary complex to ribosomes was measured at a fixed concentration of EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) (0.3 μmin the reaction) and different concentrations of nonprogrammed ribosomes (0.3–1.0 μm). Apparent rate constants (kapp) were obtained by a single exponential fitting, and rate constants k1 andk−1 were determined from the linear concentration dependence of kapp.k−2 was assumed to be unaffected by the mutations studied, and a value of 0.2 s−1 was taken from previous experiments with wild type EF-Tu. The rate constantsk2–k6 were calculated by global fitting of the combined sets of time courses measured by monitoring proflavin fluorescence at five different ribosome concentrations, mant-dGTP fluorescence, GTP hydrolysis, and dipeptide formation. Fitting was performed by numerical integration using Scientist for Windows software (MicroMath Scientific Software) as described (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The fit yielded a unique solution for the rate constants k2–k6 as well as for the fluorescence factors, provided the values fork1, k−1, andk−2 and for the relative fluorescence of aa-tRNA in the initial binding complex were fixed. For values that were measured directly, standard deviations were calculated from the variation of several experiments. For values calculated by global fitting, the standard deviation for one parameter was determined for the case when all other parameters, except the ones measured directly, were allowed to change. That is, if a given parameter was set to a value outside the range of standard deviation, no fit satisfying all data sets could be obtained. During the binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A site, eight steps can be distinguished by biochemical and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques (Fig.1; for references, see Ref. 13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the first step, the ternary complex forms a labile initial binding complex with the ribosome (rate constants of the forward and backward reactions are defined as k1 andk−1, respectively). The subsequent codon recognition (k2 and k−2) triggers the activation of the GTPase of EF-Tu (k3), which is followed by instantaneous GTP hydrolysis (kGTP). Subsequent release of Pi induces the conformational transition of EF-Tu from the GTP form to the GDP form (k4), whereby the factor loses the affinity for aa-tRNA. As a result, the 3′ end of the aa-tRNA is free to accommodate in the 50 S A site (k5) and takes part in rapid peptide bond formation (kpep). In a parallel reaction, EF-Tu·GDP dissociates from the ribosome (k6). A fluorescent tRNA derivative, tRNAPhe (Prf16/17), was used to monitor the steps of initial binding, codon recognition, and A site accommodation of aa-tRNA (13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas a fluorescent GTP analog, mant-GTP, was used to monitor the rearrangement of EF-Tu to the GTPase-activated state and dissociation of EF-Tu·GDP from the ribosome (15Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); time courses were measured using the stopped flow technique. The rates of GTP hydrolysis and peptide bond formation were determined by the quench-flow technique. Ternary complexes were formed from EF-Tu·GTP and Phe-tRNAPhe charged in situwith either tRNA or the factor added in 4-fold excess (see “Experimental Procedures”) and were used without subsequent purification. The labile binding of the ternary complex to the ribosomes in the absence of mRNA or in the presence of a nonmatching codon in the A site reflects the initial codon-independent step of A site binding that precedes codon recognition (16Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rate constants of the reaction,k1 and k−1, were determined by stopped flow fluorescence measurements in which the ternary complex formed from Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17) and EF-Tu was rapidly mixed with nonprogrammed ribosomes, and the resulting fluorescence change was recorded. The initial binding of the ternary complex, EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe(Prf16/17), to the ribosome gives rise to a rapid fluorescence increase (16Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The apparent rate constant of the reaction, kapp, increased linearly with ribosome concentration for all three mutants as with wild type EF-Tu (Fig. 2), yielding the values ofk1 and k−1 summarized in Table I. The G94A mutation had no influence on initial complex formation, whereas the mutation at position 83 lowered the association rate constant,k1, about 20-fold. Additionally,k−1 was increased for the double mutant, G83A/G94A, indicating a lower stability of this complex.Table IEffect of the G94A and G83A mutations in EF-Tu on the elemental rate constants of factor-dependent A site binding of aa-tRNAStep 1-aAccording to the model of Fig. 1.Rate constant, s−1Wild typeG94AG83AG83A/G94AInitial bindingk1100 ± 101-bμm−1s−1.120 ± 101-bμm−1s−1.6 ± 11-bμm−1s−1.15 ± 11-bμm−1s−1.k−113 ± 710 ± 410 ± 130 ± 1Codon recognition1-cThe value of the dissociation rate constant of codon recognition complex, k−2, was not determined but is probably small, because a stable complex with the ribosome was found by nitrocellulose filtration.k2140 ± 5040 ± 5+1-d+, rapid reaction limited by preceding initial binding step; +/−, rapid reaction with reduced fluorescence change; −, essentially no reaction.+1-d+, rapid reaction limited by preceding initial binding step; +/−, rapid reaction with reduced fluorescence change; −, essentially no reaction.GTPase activation andk3>500330 ± 30±±GTP hydrolysis1-eGrouped for kinetic analysis, because the former reaction is rate-limiting.++−−GTP-GDP conformation changek425 ± 100.075 ± 0.005NO1-fNO, not observed.NOaa-tRNA accommodation and peptide bond formation 1-eGrouped for kinetic analysis, because the former reaction is rate-limiting.k51.5 ± 1.02.5 ± 0.50.18 ± 0.021-gApparent rate constants at saturating ribosome concentration.0.06 ± 0.011-gApparent rate constants at saturating ribosome concentration.Dissociation of EF-Tuk63 ± 10.16 ± 0.06NONO1-a According to the model of Fig. 1.1-b μm−1s−1.1-c The value of the dissociation rate constant of codon recognition complex, k−2, was not determined but is probably small, because a stable complex with the ribosome was found by nitrocellulose filtration.1-d +, rapid reaction limited by preceding initial binding step; +/−, rapid reaction with reduced fluorescence change; −, essentially no reaction.1-e Grouped for kinetic analysis, because the former reaction is rate-limiting.1-f NO, not observed.1-g Apparent rate constants at saturating ribosome concentration. Open table in a new tab The extent of stable, codon-dependent binding of EF-Tu·GTP·Phe-tRNAPhe was measured with poly(U)-programmed ribosomes using nitrocellulose filtration. EF-Tu mutations at positions 83 and 94 slightly destabilized the complex, such that the mutants required 7 mm Mg2+ for maximum binding of Phe-tRNAPhe compared with 5 mm for the wild type (data not shown). At 10 mmMg2+, the conditions of kinetic experiments, stable ribosome binding was obtained with wild type and all EF-Tu mutants. The structural transitions of aa-tRNA during ternary complex binding to the A site were monitored by following the fluorescence changes of tRNAPhe(Prf16/17). In the case of the wild type ternary complex, the time course of A site binding comprised a fast increase of fluorescence followed by a slower decrease (Fig.3 A), as observed previously with purified ternary complexes (14Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, the assignment of fluorescence changes to particular steps of A site binding was taken from the previous data (Ref. 13Pape T. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar and references cited therein). The fluorescence increase reflects both the initial binding of the ternary complex to the ribosome and the codon recognition step (Fig. 1 and Refs. 14Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar and 16Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The subsequent steps of GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis do not change the fluorescence of proflavin. Rather, the observed fluorescence decrease reflects the conformational change of the aa-tRNA that is coupled to the transition of the factor from the GTP to the GDP form and the release of aa-tRNA from EF-Tu·GDP. The effect is partially masked by the fluorescence increase because of the accommodation of aa-tRNA in the 50 S A site (14Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Wintermeyer W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12267-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Rodnina M.V. Pape T. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 646-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The fluorescence changes observed with wild type EF-Tu and the mutant EF-Tu(G94A) are qualitatively similar (Fig. 3 A), although the consumption of the high fluorescence state is extremely slow with the G94A mutant, about 0.07/s, and is only observed upon prolonged incubation (Fig.3 B). The time courses obtained with the mutants with substitutions at position 83 are different (Fig.4 A). A biphasic rapid increase of fluorescence was observed, whereas no decay could be detected. The first step reflected in the fluorescence increase is comparable with that of the wild type. The apparent rate of the first step increased linearly with ribosome concentration (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the rate of binding of the ternary complexes was limited by the second order initial binding step (Fig. 1). Neither EF-Tu(G83A) nor EF-Tu(G83/94A) promote the formation of the high fluorescent intermediate observed for both the wild type and the mutant EF-Tu(G94A) (compare Figs. 3 and 4). Most likely, the high fluorescence intermediate is not accumulated because the rate of initial complex formation with the 83 mutants is slow compared with the wild type and is rate-limiting for the subsequent steps. The second step observed in the time courses with the 83 mutants was very slow and independent of the ribosome concentration and was essentially identical to the rate of dipeptide formation (see below). In the presence of deacylated tRNA in the P site, where there is no peptide bond formation, similar time courses were observed (data not shown), indicating that the fluorescence change is caused by a conformational change of the aa-tRNA that limits the dipeptide bond formation rather than by the chemistry step. Thus, the slow step in the time courses of A site binding observed for the two 83 mutants is assigned to the rearrangement of aa-tRNA during the accommodation in the A site that precedes the peptidyl-transfer reaction. The formation of the GTPase-activated conformation of EF-Tu was monitored by measuring the fluorescence changes of a fluorescent GTP derivative, mant-GTP, upon ternary complex binding to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes. In the case of the wild type factor, the resulting time course showed a fast fluorescence increase followed by a slower decrease (Fig. 5), as observed earlier (15Rodnina M.V. Fricke R. Kuhn L. Wintermeyer W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The increase reflects the structural rearrangement of EF-Tu, which brings the factor into the state competent for GTP hydrolysis. Subsequent GTP cleavage initiates the conformational change of EF-Tu from the GTP- to the GDP-bound state, followed by release of aa-tRNA and dissociation of EF-Tu·GDP from the ribosome. The latter step is reflected in the decrease of the fluorescence signal, whereas GTP hydrolysis itself is not reported. Reliable measurements of the change in mant fluorescence required a reversion of the ratio of Phe-tRNAPhe and EF-Tu·mant-GTP in the experiment such that EF-Tu·mant-GTP was present in substoichiometric amounts relative to aa-tRNA (1:4; “Experimental Procedures”). With both wild type EF-Tu and mutant EF-Tu(G94A) a similar fluorescence increase reporting the GTPase activation was observed (Fig. 5 A). The mutant EF-Tu(G94A) also showed the subsequent consumption of the high fluorescence state that is characteristic for the wild type factor, although the signal decrease was much slower for the mutant (Fig. 5 B). With mutant EF-Tu(G83A), the mant-GTP fluorescence increase was very small, indicating that either only part of the molecules were activated or that the environment of the mant group in the activated state is different in EF-Tu(G83A) and the wild type factor. The additional mutation of Gly94 partly restores the activation, so that the fluorescence increase of about 20% observed with EF-Tu(G83A/G94A) is comparable with that observed with wild type EF-Tu (Fig.5 C). With both EF-Tu(G83A) and EF-Tu(G83/94A), the rate of GTPase activation was slower than with the wild type EF-Tu, because of a lower rate of binding to the ribosome (Table I). Kinetics of GTP hydrolysis were measured by quench-flow (“Experimental Procedures”) at two different concentrations of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes, 0.5 and 1.0 μm. The data could be fitted with a single exponential function (Fig. 6 A). The rates of GTP hydrolysis are similar for the wild type and the mutant EF-Tu(G94A), although the extent of GTP hydrolysis was somewhat less with the latter. In contrast, essentially no"

They contain many components that have been implicated in thrombosis and atherosclerosis, including adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, soluble mediators of inflammation, and growth factors (1Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill-Livingston, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that mediate the release of these components are not well defined. This secretory process is tightly controlled to prevent unregulated release of thrombogenic factors. In many respects, platelets represent a unique secretory system. They are anucleate, contain an open canalicular system that undergoes eversion following platelet activation (2White J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2422-2425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and demonstrate homotypic granule fusion (3Ginsberg M.H. Taylor L. Painter R.G. Blood. 1980; 55: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultrastructural studies have shown that the α-granules of platelets are secreted primarily via fusion with the surface-connected open canalicular system (1Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill-Livingston, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar) following apparent centralization of granules and microtubule reorganization. Such observations have lead to speculation that cytoskeletal reorganization is responsible for α-granule release. However, inhibition of actin polymerization (4Lefebvre P. White J.G.

Furthermore, granule secretion and shape change can be dissociated under several experimental conditions (7Wheeler-Jones C.P. Saermark T. Kakkar V.V. Authi K.S. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2000; 267: 875-880Google Scholar). Purified SNARE proteins are capable of fusing lipid membranes in vitro (16Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, permeabilized cell systems require molecules other than SNARE proteins to secrete granules. Furthermore, regulated secretion necessitates that the SNARE protein apparatus respond to activation-dependent signals (18Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of platelet granule secretion requires the identification of molecules that are both modified upon platelet activation and capable of interacting directly with the secretory machinery. Phospholipid metabolism has long been regarded as an essential component of regulated secretion in platelets. Initial studies performed in intact (19Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6701-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and electropermeabilized (20Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) platelets indicated a role for the products of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, in stimulating granule secretion (21Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill-Livingston, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). However, both dense and α-granule secretion can be stimulated in the absence of PLC activation, suggesting that PLC activity is not essential to platelet granule secretion (22Lapetina E.G. Silio J. Ruggiero M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7078-7083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coorssen J.R. Haslam R.J.

Subsequent studies in Ca2+-independent permeabilized secretory systems showed that the generation of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D correlates closely with secretion (23Coorssen J.R. Haslam R.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Haslam R.J. Coorssen J.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 344: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibition of phospholipase D, however, fails to block Ca2+-independent dense granule secretion, and phosphatidic acid itself cannot stimulate dense granule secretion (25Coorssen J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1153-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations support a modulatory role of phospholipase D in platelet granule secretion. Thus, no product of phospholipid metabolism has been demonstrated to be fusogenic in platelets (25Coorssen J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1153-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the role of phospholipid metabolism in platelet membrane fusion remains to be defined. Phosphoinositide phosphorylation has been invoked in vesicle fusion models and shown to mediate granule secretion. Initial observations in chromaffin cells demonstrated that the maintenance of polyphosphoinositides is crucial for vesicle secretion (26Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed a PtdIns 4-kinase activity associated with granules in chromaffin, mast, and pancreatic β-cells (27Pike L.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 692-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, this PtdIns 4-kinase activity correlates with granule secretion (28Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein was determined to be one of three cytosolic factors required to restore Ca2+-induced secretion from semi-intact PC12 cells (29Hay J.C. Martin T.F. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Type I PIPK is a second cytosolic factor necessary to reconstitute secretion (30Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Subsequent to these studies, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein was found to reconstitute Ca2+-induced, GTPγS-dependent granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized HL-60 cells (31Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S. Tan S.K. Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RBL-2H3 mast cells, ADP-ribosylation factor-1 was demonstrated to stimulate exocytosis via PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis (32Way G. O'luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochemistry. 2000; 346: 63-70Crossref Google Scholar). These data suggest a central role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 in regulated secretion. Although the role of PtdIns(4,5)P2 itself in platelet granule secretion has not previously been evaluated, PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism has been studied in platelets, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to mediate several other platelet processes. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is involved in uncapping of F-actin barbed ends, thereby contributing to platelet shape change (33Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also thought to mediate platelet spreading (34Heraud J.M. Racaud-Sultan C. Gironcel D.

Upon platelet activation with thrombin (35Lassing I. Lindberg U. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Racaud-Sultan C. Mauco G. Guinebault C. Plantavid M.

The generation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is presumed to be mediated by up-regulation of PtdIns kinases. However, the synthetic pathway by which PtdIns(4,5)P2 is synthesized in platelets is not well established. Synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 via progressive phosphorylation of PtdIns by PtdIns 4-kinase followed by PtdIns-4-phosphate 5-kinase represents the dominant pathway in most cell types. However, platelet PtdIns 5-phosphate levels increase upon exposure to thrombin (37Morris J.B. Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, type II PIPK is abundant in platelets (38Divecha N. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and undergoes aggregation-dependent translocation to the platelet cytoskeleton (39Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that PtdIns(4,5)P2 can be synthesized via a PtdIns-5-phosphate 4-kinase-dependent pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that PtdIns(4,5)P2mediates platelet α-granule secretion and that PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis required for α-granule secretion involves the type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase-dependent pathway.

Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-P-selectin antibody AC1.2 was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Silica Gel G TLC plates were obtained from Whatman Ltd. (Kent, England). GST-tagged type II PIPK was generously provided by Dr. Lucia Rameh. All solutions were prepared using water purified by reverse-phase osmosis on a Millipore Milli-Q purification water system. Affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibodies to PtdIns 3-kinase p85α (clone 8–2D-4D) were obtained from Lab Vision (Fremont, CA). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies to type II PIPK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-amino-terminal end antibody was raised against a peptide consisting of the 19 amino-terminal amino acids of type IIα PIPK. The anti-carboxyl-terminal end antibody was raised against a peptide consisting of the 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of type IIα PIPK. Blood from healthy donors who had not ingested aspirin in the 2 weeks prior to donation was collected by venipuncture into 0.4% sodium citrate. Citrate-anticoagulated blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 20 min to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were then purified from platelet-rich plasma by gel filtration using a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated in PIPES/EGTA buffer (25 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 137 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, and 0.1% glucose, pH 6.4). Final gel-filtered platelet concentrations were 1–2 × 108 platelets/ml. Platelets were permeabilized using reduced SL-O. The ability of each batch of SL-O to permeabilize platelets was tested by analyzing for incorporation of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran sulfates by flow cytometry as described previously (12Flaumenhaft R.

Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18424-18431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gel-filtered platelets (20 μl) were incubated with 25 μm fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran sulfate of various molecular masses in the presence or absence of SL-O for 15 min. Platelets were subsequently analyzed for fluorescence by flow cytometry. An increase in fluorescence in the samples exposed to SL-O compared with non-permeabilized samples confirmed permeabilization. For analysis of P-selectin surface expression from permeabilized platelets, 20 μl of gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 108/ml) in the indicated concentration of MgATP were incubated with the concentrations of reduced SL-O indicated in the figure legends. Samples were adjusted to pH 6.9 immediately following permeabilization. The timing of addition of inhibitors varied according to the inhibitor that was being evaluated and is indicated in the figure legends. Following the incubation with inhibitor, CaCl2 was added to the reaction mixture. The amount of CaCl2 required to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm in the presence of 2 mm EGTA at pH 6.9 was calculated for each condition using a computer program (gift from Dr. P. J. Padfield) based on the algorithms described by Fabiato and Fabiato (41Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). Following an additional incubation after the addition of Ca2+, 10 μl of reaction mixture were transferred to 5 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-P-selectin antibody AC1.2. Phosphate-buffered saline (500 μl) was added to the sample after a 20-min incubation, and the platelets were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry as described below. Gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 107/ml) or GST-tagged PIPK was diluted in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-type II PIPK antibodies directed against the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the α-isoform of human type II PIPK and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Gel-filtered platelets (350 μl/sample) were incubated in the presence of 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid at 37 °C for 2 h. Unbound 32P was separated from platelets by sequential centrifugation. Platelets were then permeabilized with the indicated concentrations of SL-O in the presence or absence of ATP. Samples were adjusted to pH 6.9 immediately following permeabilization. The timing of addition of inhibitors varied according to the inhibitor and is indicated in the figure legends. Platelets were subsequently solubilized in 250 μl of a 20:40:1 solution of chloroform, methanol, and 12 n HCl and mixed vigorously. Chloroform (75 μl) was added to this solution. The solution was mixed vigorously, and its phases were separated at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper phase was discarded, and the lower phase was washed three times with 625 μl of the 20:40:1 solution of chloroform, methanol, and 12 n HCl. Each extract (5 μl) was applied to one lane of a 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel G plate previously soaked in 1% potassium oxalate for 30 min and then baked for 5 min at 100 °C. Phospholipids were separated by chromatography in 1-propanol and 2 m acetic acid (65:35). The location of PtdIns 4-phosphate and PtdIns(4,5)P2 was determined by applying 5 μg of known standards to each lane. Standards were detected by staining in a saturated iodine tank. The radioactivity on the plates was detected using a Bio-Rad GS-525 molecular imaging system. Phosphoinositide levels were quantified both by calculating the pixel density of bands comigrating with PtdIns standards using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad) and by extracting the radioactivity comigrating with the PtdIns standards from the plate and quantifying radioactivity using a Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Under the conditions of our assay, a pixel density of 1 corresponds to 10 cpm. Flow cytometry was performed on gel-filtered platelet samples using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Fluorescent channels were set at logarithmic gain. 10,000 particles were acquired for each sample. A 530/30-nm band-pass filter was used for FL-2 fluorescence. Phycoerythrin was measured in the FL-2 channel. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software on a Macintosh Power PC. To study the molecular mechanisms of platelet α-granule secretion, we have developed and characterized an SL-O-permeabilized, Ca2+-induced α-granule secretory system (12Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this system, exposure of platelets to SL-O permits the entry of molecules as large as 260 kDa (12Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm ATP, 96 ± 1% of platelets exposed to SL-O expressed P-selectin on their surface in response to 10 μm Ca2+. In contrast, non-permeabilized platelets expressed almost no P-selectin on their surface in response to ATP and Ca2+ (Fig. 1) (12Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that >95% of platelets were permeabilized following incubation with SL-O. Multiple Ca2+-induced permeabilized secretory systems, including permeabilized platelet models (42Sanchez A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 43Patel S. Scrutton M.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), have demonstrated a requirement for ATP exposure prior to Ca2+-induced triggering of granule secretion. Many permeabilized secretory systems also require cytosol to reconstitute significant secretion (44Avery J. Jahn R. Edwardson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis in PC12 cell granule secretion was demonstrated when type I PIPK and PtdIns transfer protein were identified as proteins within cytosol responsible for reconstituting ATP-mediated priming of granule secretion (29Hay J.C. Martin T.F. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 30Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In contrast, cytosol is not required for Ca2+-mediated secretion of α-granules from SL-O-permeabilized platelets (12Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets remained ATP-dependent (Fig. 1). ATP did not support α-granule secretion from non-permeabilized platelets or under conditions in which the free Ca2+ concentration was maintained atpCa2+ < 8 with 2 mm EGTA (Fig.1 B). The ability of ATP to support α-granule secretion was dose-dependent with an EC50 of ∼1 mm. ADP neither supported α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets nor augmented Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion in the presence of submaximal concentrations of ATP (Fig. 1 C). These data demonstrate that Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion in this system requires permeabilization with SL-O and exposure to ATP. The observation that ATP, but not platelet cytosol, is required for Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion raises the question of whether SL-O-permeabilized platelets are able to synthesize PtdIns(4,5)P2 upon exposure to ATP in the absence of added cytosol. To address this question, platelets were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, incubated in the presence or absence of ATP, and analyzed for PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels by TLC. PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels were markedly increased in SL-O-permeabilized platelets incubated in the presence of ATP compared with levels in platelets incubated in the absence of ATP (Fig.2 A). The contribution of radioactivity from the 4 ± 1% of platelets that were not permeabilized upon exposure to SL-O was calculated to constitute ∼1% of the total radioactivity in the PtdIns(4,5)P2 band. We next performed a time course study to determine whether the ability to secrete α-granules in response to Ca2+ exposure is temporally correlated with PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis. PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and the degree of α-granule secretion in response to Ca2+ increased in parallel in SL-O-permeabilized platelets over the first 30 min following exposure to ATP (Fig. 2 B). Thus, SL-O-permeabilized platelets are capable of synthesizing PtdIns(4,5)P2 in response to ATP without the addition of cytosol, and PtdIns(4,5)P2synthesis correlates temporally with the ability to secrete α-granules in response to Ca2+ exposure. To determine whether PtdIns(4,5)P2 mediates Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets, we hydrolyzed endogenous platelet PtdIns(4,5)P2 using PtdIns-specific PLC. PtdIns-specific PLC reduced endogenous PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels in the SL-O-permeabilized platelets by ∼75% (Fig.3 A). However, the use of PtdIns-specific PLC in secretory assays is complicated by the fact that the by-products of PtdIns-specific PLC activity, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, are themselves capable of influencing secretion from permeabilized platelets (19Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6701-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol acts primarily via activation of protein kinase C (21Brass L.F. Hoffman R. Benz E.J. Shattil S. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill-Livingston, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). Sloan and Haslam (45Sloan D.C. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that protein kinase C diffuses out of platelets following exposure to SL-O. Consistent with these observations, we found that stimulation of P-selectin surface expression by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was reduced by >90% in SL-O-permeabilized platelets compared with non-permeabilized platelets (data not shown). Thus, permeabilized platelets are relatively insensitive to diacylglycerol because of protein kinase C leakage. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is not likely to stimulate secretion in this system because Ca2+ chelation by EGTA blocks the increase in [Ca2+]i that is elicited by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in unchelated systems. In the secretion experiments, platelets were permeabilized with SL-O for 15 min prior to exposure to PtdIns-specific PLC. Platelets were then incubated in the presence or absence of PtdIns-specific PLC for 15 min prior to Ca2+ exposure. Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion was inhibited in permeabilized platelets exposed to PtdIns-specific PLC (Fig. 3 B). Platelets incubated with PtdIns-specific PLC in the absence of Ca2+ exposure demonstrated a small degree of secretion under these conditions (8 ± 2% P-selectin expression compared with samples incubated with buffer and subsequently exposed to Ca2+) that might result from the generation of diacylglycerol. Heat-denatured PtdIns-specific PLC had no effect on Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion. PtdIns-specific PLC had no effect on intact platelets since the amount of SFLLR-induced P-selectin surface expression from intact platelets exposed to 5 units/ml PtdIns-specific PLC was 97 ± 3% of that from intact platelets not exposed to PtdIns-specific PLC. Similarly, PtdIns-specific PLC failed to inhibit Ca2+-induced P-selectin expression from platelets permeabilized with α-toxin. α-Toxin creates pores that restrict the entry of molecules greater than ∼4.4 kDa (46Flaumenhaft R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ca2+-induced P-selectin expression from platelets permeabilized with α-toxin and subsequently exposed to 5 units/ml PtdIns-specific PLC was 101 ± 9% of that from α-toxin-permeabilized platelets not exposed to PtdIns-specific PLC. Thus, the effects of PtdIns-specific PLC on α-granule secretion require entry into the platelet cytosol. Inhibition of Ca2+-induced α-granule secretion by PtdIns-specific PLC occurred in a dose-depende"

The CE gene was previously cloned from the long-finned squid, Loligo pealei, and the gene product was shown to bind GTP and modulate K+ channels and ryanodine receptors in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We cloned a new gene from L. pealei, which encodes a CE-like protein, here named calexcitin B (CEB). CEB has 95% amino acid identity to the original form. Our sequence analyses indicate that CEs are homologous to the sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein subfamily of the EF-hand superfamily. Far and near UV circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrate that CEB binds Ca2+ and undergoes a conformational change. CEB is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, but not by casein kinase II. CEB does not bind GTP. Western blot experiments using polyclonal antibodies generated against CEB showed that CEB is expressed in theL. pealei optic lobe.

Many Ca2+-dependent cellular processes are mediated by Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs),1 which share a common Ca2+ binding motif, termed “EF-hand” (1Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-hand proteins can be subdivided into two types. A “Ca2+ sensor” regulates downstream target proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner and a “Ca2+buffer” contributes to maintaining the intracellular Ca2+level (2Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Calmodulin, troponin C, S100 proteins, frequenin, and neurocalcin are examples of Ca2+ sensors, whereas sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins (SCPs), parvalbumin, and calbindin D9k are thought to function as Ca2+ buffers (2Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).Recently, a new CaBP called calexcitin (CE) has been identified in squid and implicated to play a role in associative learning through inhibition of K+ channels in a Ca2+-dependent manner (3Nelson T.J.

Alkon D.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 423-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that CE binds and activates ryanodine receptors, which are also involved in associative learning (7Cavallaro S. Meiri N.

CE has been shown to possess GTP binding and GTPase activities (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R.

The gene encoding CE was cloned, and the recombinant protein was shown to bind Ca2+ and to be a high affinity substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D.

To date, in addition to ryanodine receptor activation (6Nelson T.J. Zhao W.Q. Yuan S. Favit A. Pozzo-Miller L. Alkon D.L. Biochem.

Although the mechanisms underlying these multiple functions are not well understood, most of the proposed functions appear to be mediated by Ca2+ (5Alkon D.L. Nelson T.J. Zhao W. Cavallaro S. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 529-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).In this paper, we describe a new homologue of CE, termed CEB (the original form of CE (Ref. 4Nelson T.J.

This new gene differs in nucleotide sequence from the CEA gene, containing an insertion near its 3′ end, leading to a longer open reading frame. Our sequence analyses indicate that CEs are members of the SCP subfamily of the EF-hand superfamily. The recombinant CEB has been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and characterized using biochemical and biophysical techniques.RESULTSThe nucleotide sequence of the L. pealeiCEB (Fig. 1 A) is 99% identical to that of CEA, with the major difference being a single nucleotide insertion near the 3′ end of the sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of CEB (Fig. 1 B) shows 95% identity to CEA (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another homologous protein (here referred to as CET; accession no. AF078951) from the Japanese common squid, Todarodes pacificus, has been identified through a BLAST search. CET shows 93% amino acid identity to CEB (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, we found that CEB shows 28% amino acid identity to ASCP (19Takagi T. Cox J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is higher than the identity score (15–20%) reported among various members of the SCP subfamily (20Cox J.A. Luan-Rilliet Y. Takagi T. Heizmann C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins: Fundamentals and Clinical Implications. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 447-463Crossref Google Scholar). CEB also shows 45% amino acid identity to a neuronal SCP from Drosophila melanogaster (dSCP2) and 18% identity to a muscle SCP fromD. melanogaster (21Kelly L.E. Phillips A.M. Delbridge M. Stewart R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (dSCP1; Fig. 1 B). CEB also shares 34% (F56D1.6, accession no. Q10131) and 28% (T09A5.1, accession no. P54961) amino acid identity to putative proteins predicted from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome (22The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, Science, 282, 1998, 2012, 2018.Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B).The sequence alignment of CEB with ASCP indicates that CEB has four putative EF-hand motifs, each motif containing a Ca2+ binding loop and flanking α helices. There is a high sequence similarity within the EF-hand motifs, with the exception of the fourth motif. This is due to the low sequence conservation of Ca2+ coordinating residues Asp150(X), Leu152 (Y), Asp154(Z), Gly156 (−Y), Thr158(−X), and Thr161 (−Z) in CEB (Fig. 1 B). In a typical EF-hand theX position is Asp and the Z position is Asn, Asp, or Ser. The −Z position is always Asp or Glu, whereas the−Y position is rarely Gly, which may render the EF-hand non-functional (23Vijay-Kumar S. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 343-517PubMed Google Scholar). The important hydrophobic residue between−Y and −X is lacking in CEB(Lys157; Fig. 1 B). Based on this sequence alignment and the three-dimensional structure of ASCP (12Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Cox J.A. Vijay-Kumar S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), CEB most likely contains four helix-loop-helix structural elements, with the fourth EF-hand incapable of binding Ca2+. This contrasts with data for CEA, which was shown to bind only two Ca2+. This may be due to the condition used for the experiment, in which 5 mmMgCl2 was present. SCPs have at least one Ca2+/Mg2+ binding site (20Cox J.A. Luan-Rilliet Y. Takagi T. Heizmann C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins: Fundamentals and Clinical Implications. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 447-463Crossref Google Scholar); hence, one of the EF-hand sites in CEA may have been occupied with Mg2+.GTP-binding proteins, including ARF (25Greasley S.E. Jhoti H.

In all these proteins, the GTP binding site is defined by three sequence motifs in the strict order: GXXXXGK(S/T) (Σ1), DXXG (Σ2), and NKXD (Σ3) (29Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These motifs are completely conserved among all GTPases (30Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are referred to as the fingerprint of GTPase (31Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In small GTPases, the Σ1 and Σ2 motifs are separated by about 40 residues and the Σ2 and Σ3 motifs by about 50–80 residues (31Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity of CEs to GTP-binding proteins is very low (e.g., 11% amino acid identity to D. melanogaster ADP-ribosylation factor; Ref. 32Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J.

A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that CEA contains GTP binding motifs, which are also present in CEB. However, in both CEA and CEB, only the putative Σ2 GTP binding motif is fully conserved. The Lys residue in the Σ3 motif is replaced with Ile and the first Gly residue in the Σ1 motif is replaced with Thr (Fig. 1 B). The order of the three motifs in the primary sequence of CEA and CEB (Σ2, Σ3, and Σ1) also differs from that of all other GTP-binding proteins (Σ1, Σ2, and Σ3) (29Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Σ2 and Σ3 motifs are separated by only a single residue (Fig. 1 B), which is in disagreement with the motif spacing in small GTPases as presented above (31Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Nelson et al. (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G.

This Mg2+inhibition of GTP binding contrasts with structural studies of various GTPases in which Mg2+ is critical in the coordination of the phosphate group of GTP (25Greasley S.E. Jhoti H. Teahan C.

A. 1994; 91: 9287-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggested that the protein forms a homodimer, most likely due to the formation of disulfide bonds between two CEA molecules via exposed Cys residues, in the absence of a reducing agent. Our E. coli expressed and purified CEB showed a single band of 23 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). In addition, our analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that CEBis monomeric in both the presence and the absence of Ca2+(data not shown). This is consistent with earlier studies on SCPs, which are generally found as monomers, with the exception of crustacean and sandworm SCPs (20Cox J.A. Luan-Rilliet Y. Takagi T. Heizmann C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins: Fundamentals and Clinical Implications. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 447-463Crossref Google Scholar). In sandworm, Ca2+ modulates dimerization (34Durussel I. Luan-Rilliet Y. Petrova T. Takagi T. Cox J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2394-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with no disulfide bond involvement (23Vijay-Kumar S. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ overlay blot of purified CEB (Fig.2 B) showed that the protein readily bound45Ca2+. No extra band was seen, including that corresponding to a homodimer. A polyclonal antibody that was raised against the recombinant CEB cross-reacted with a 23-kDa protein (Fig. 2 C). The CEB antibody also cross-reacted with a protein in the squid optic lobe (Fig.2 D). The single band found in the squid optic lobe (∼22 kDa) is slightly smaller than the recombinant CEB, which is probably due to the lack of the N-terminal addition of eight amino acids from the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. When the antibody was preincubated with CEB prior to incubation with the filter, no cross-reaction was observed on the Western blot either with CEB or squid optic lobe tissue (data not shown), indicating that the antibodies are specific to CEB.Figure 2A, SDS-PAGE of CEB, showing a single band of about 23 kDa.

Since PKC requires the presence of Ca2+, only the Ca2+-bound CEB was used in this experiment. In contrast, although putative CKII phosphorylation consensus sequences are found in CEB, CKII did not phosphorylate either Ca2+-bound or Ca2+-free CEB (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported (4Nelson T.J.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2350-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that CEA is a high affinity substrate for PKC and has a single PKC phosphorylation site (Thr61). We found that CEB was also a substrate for PKC in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 E). There are two putative PKC phosphorylation sites in CEB(Thr61 and Thr188; Fig. 1 B). Since CEA possesses Thr61 (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13808-13813Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) but lacks Thr188, Thr61 may be a common phosphorylation site in CEs. Our mass spectrometry data indicate that about 80% of the protein was phosphorylated at both Thr61 and Thr188 and the remaining 20% at one of the two sites. There is no detectable amount of unphosphorylated CEB in the mass spectrum (data not shown). Whether or not the phosphorylation of these sites is functionally important remains unclear.Previous far UV CD spectroscopy on CEA (36Ascoli G.A. Luu K.X. Olds J.L. Nelson T.J. Gusev P.A. Bertucci C. Bramanti E. Raffaelli A. Salvadori P. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has shown that the Ca2+-free protein is composed of 28% α helix and 23% β sheet and the Ca2+-bound protein is composed of 33% α helix and 18% β sheet. However, as indicated above, the multiple sequence alignment suggested that CEB is an α-helical protein. In order to characterize the secondary structure of CEB, we performed far UV CD spectroscopy (Fig.3). Deconvolution of the CD data using a neural network algorithm (37Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) showed that Ca2+-free CEB contains 46% α helix and 11% β sheet, whereas Ca2+-bound CEB contains 57% α helix and 6% β sheet. Interestingly, the [Θ]208 value is more negative than the [Θ]222 value, atypical of the canonical α-helical protein (38Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these data indicate that CEB is highly α-helical, consistent with the sequence analysis indicating that CEB is an EF-hand protein. Hence, we believe that the content of β sheet reported for CEA (36Ascoli G.A. Luu K.X. Olds J.L. Nelson T.J. Gusev P.A. Bertucci C. Bramanti E. Raffaelli A. Salvadori P. Alkon D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and even those obtained for CEB are overestimated. We also suggest that the difference in α helix content between Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound states may reflect changes in the orientation of preexisting α helices upon Ca2+ binding (39Williams T.C. Corson D.C. Oikawa K. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1835-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the far UV CD data indicate that CEB is folded even in the absence of Ca2+.Figure 3Far UV circular dichroism spectra of Ca2+-bound (solid line) and Ca2+-free CEB (dotted line). There is a spectral change upon addition of Ca2+. Deconvolution of the data suggests that the Ca2+-bound spectrum contains 57% α helix and 6% β sheet. The Ca2+-free spectrum is estimated to contain 46% α helix and 11% β sheet. The [Θ]208 value is more negative than the [Θ]222 value, atypical of the canonical α-helical protein (38Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar), but consistent with other SCPs (56Cox J.A. Kretsinger R.H. Stein E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In the region spanning 255 to 310 nm, there are approximately nine peaks in both Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free CEB, due to a number of aromatic residues (10 Phe, 7 Trp, and 7 Tyr) in CEB (Fig.1 B). All nine peaks change in magnitude upon Ca2+ binding, suggesting that many of the aromatic residues undergo at least minor changes in their electronic environment. The largest change within this spectral region occurs between the wavelengths of 275 and 300 nm, corresponding to absorbance of Trp residues. Upon Ca2+ binding, the maximum at 280 nm decreases in signal intensity and a minimum at 293 nm becomes apparent, suggesting that Trp residues undergo a change in their environment. Contribution of Phe residues is also visible in the spectra. The minima at 261 and 267 nm are likely due to Phe residues. Minima at 263 and 268 nm are believed to be markers for the native fold (40Pain R. Coligan J.E. Dunn B. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Toronto1996: 761-823Google Scholar). Furthermore, the existence of these minima suggests that at least some of the Phe residues are buried in specific and tightly packed environments (41Strickland E.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 2: 113-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). CEB contains 10 Phe residues: four in the N-terminal half (residues 9, 18, 21, and 35) and six in the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 113, 115, 149, 165, 173, and 186; Fig.1 B). Residues 113, 165, 173, and 186 are well conserved among neuronal SCPs (Phe165 is Lys in F56D1.6 and Phe186 is Leu in CEA, due to the shorter C terminus of CEA). In contrast, Phe residues 9, 18, 21, 35, 115, and 149 in CEB are well conserved across both neuronal and muscle SCPs (residue 18 is Val and residue 21 is Met in dSCP1, and residue 149 is Tyr in ASCPIII). Furthermore, based on the three-dimensional structure of ASCP (12Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Cox J.A. Vijay-Kumar S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1 B), the ASCP residues corresponding to the CEB Phe residues 18, 21, 35, and 115 have solvent accessibilities of less than 3%. This suggests that these four Phe residues are part of the hydrophobic core of CEB and contribute to the minima around 263 and 268 nm of the near UV CD spectra of CEB.Figure 4Near UV circular dichroism spectra of Ca2+-bound (solid line) and Ca2+-free (dotted line) CEB. There are approximately nine peaks in both Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free CEBspectra, due to an abundance of aromatic residues in the primary sequence. The spectrum indicates that the protein undergoes a Ca2+-induced conformational change.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CEB contains seven Trp residues: five in the N-terminal half (residues 32, 48, 66, 86, and 90) and two in the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 106 and 169). Most of these Trp residues are well conserved, and Trp66 is completely conserved among the SCP proteins (Fig. 1 B). As presented above, the near UV CD data indicated that the Ca2+-induced conformational change of CEB involves Trp residues. To confirm that the Trp residues undergo a change in their environment, we measured the change of fluorescence of Trp residues upon Ca2+ addition. The intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp indole ring showed a large decrease of fluorescence intensity (40%) upon Ca2+ addition (Fig.5 A). However, the change in the intensity was not accompanied by a significant shift of the maximum (λmax). This result is in agreement with the aforementioned near UV CD data (Fig. 4) and NMR data (see below). It is interesting to note that, in agreement with data presented above for Phe residues, Trp residues that are well conserved among SCPs (residues 66, 86, 90, and 106 in CEB) have low surface accessibilities (<7%) and hence are proposed to be part of the hydrophobic core of the proteins.Figure 5Ca2+ binding measurements of CEB using fluorescence spectroscopy. A, tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of CEB at different Ca2+ concentrations. There is a 40% decrease in the fluorescence intensity upon Ca2+ binding, suggesting that CEB undergoes a Ca2+-induced conformational change involving the chemical environment of some, if not all, Trp residues. B, the change in fluorescence intensity integrated over the wavelength range of 305–400 nm is plotted as a function of free Ca2+ concentration. The binding curve indicates that the Kd of CEB for Ca2+ is 1 μm.C, the change in fluorescence intensity integrated over the spectrum of 305 to 400 nm is plotted as a function of total Ca2+ concentration divided by the concentration of CEB. The Ca2+ titration curve indicates that 3 mol of Ca2+ bind per mol of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The change in fluorescence intensity plotted against Ca2+concentration (Fig. 5 B) shows that the midpoint of the titration occurs near 1 μm. This value is comparable to the Kd of 0.4 μm observed for CEA (4Nelson T.J. Cavallaro S. Yi C.L. McPhie D. Schreurs B.G. Gusev P.A. Favit A. Zohar O. Kim J. Beushausen S. Ascoli G. Olds J. Neve R.

Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the apparent Kd of Ca2+ binding to CEB is larger than the Kd observed for Ca2+ binding to SCPs, which ranges from 0.l to 0.01 μm ("

We found that hHb1-ΔN transcription is initiated at an unusual cryptic promoter within the fourth intron of the hHb1 gene and is dependent on two proximal Sp1 binding sites for its baseline activity. Moreover, hHb1-ΔN transcription is increased in response to DNA demethylation by the 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine drug. This induction is dependent on protein neosynthesis, indicating that an additional factor is required.

Two types of keratin, the acidic type I and the basic type II, combine in a stoichiometric fashion to form the fundamental unit. Keratin heterodimers further associate to form the 10-nm intermediate filament network (1Bloemendal H. Pieper F.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Simple or stratified epithelia differentially express pairs of “soft” or cytokeratins, whereas hard epithelia such as hair or nails express specific pairs of “hard” or hair keratins. It has been assumed from biochemical data that hair follicles express four different pairs of keratins. However, nine human acidic hair keratin genes have been identified and classified into three subgroups according to gene structure and sequence conservation (2Rogers M.A. Winter H. Wolf C. Heck M.

Aberrant forms of soft keratins have been shown to be responsible for several epidermal genetic diseases (6Fuchs E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, abnormal cytokeratin expression patterns have been widely used as tumor markers, because they correlate with different types of epithelial differentiation and function (7Nathrath W.B. Lane E.B. Schmitt M. Kindermann G. Prospects in Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Cancer. Elsevier Science, New York1994: 57-62Google Scholar). Some recent data have revealed point mutations in the hHb1 and hHb6 hair keratins in monilethrix, a rare inherited hair disorder (8Winter H. Rogers M.A. Gebhardt M. Wollina U. Boxall L. Chitayat D.

In addition, hHb1 expression has been observed in pilomatricomas, epidermal tumors exhibiting follicular differentiation (11Regnier C.H. Asch P.H. Grosshans E. Rio M.C. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 12Cribier B. Asch P.H. Regnier C. Rio M.C. Grosshans E. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). hHb1-ΔN is, however, the first hair keratin whose expression is detected in carcinomas derived from a tissue different from the epidermis. Several studies have demonstrated that amino- or carboxyl-terminal-truncated cytokeratins can be incorporated into the intermediate filament network. Keratin proteins bearing small deletions are incorporated without evident modification of the cytoskeleton, whereas larger deletions can lead to the complete collapse of the intermediate filament network (13Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 791-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Intermediate filaments are likewise physiologically composed of obligatory heterodimers of specific cytokeratins or hair keratins. Forced expression of a foreign keratin through transient transfection showed that it can still efficiently incorporate into the pre-existing network as newly formed intermediate filaments (13Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 791-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The expression of a truncated keratin could thus have significant relevance for cancer progression, because it could lead to severe disturbances of the intermediate filament network itself and of its interaction with desmosomal or hemidesmosomal proteins, which are essential for the maintenance of cell integrity (6Fuchs E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Hair is a complex specialized epithelial structure, and hair keratin gene expression patterns are precisely controlled. However, the mechanisms by which hair keratin genes are regulated are poorly understood. Few human hair keratin gene promoters have been studied so far. Comparison of gene promoters of hair keratin and hair keratin-associated proteins of human, mouse, and sheep origin have allowed for the identification of conserved putative regulatory elements (15Rogers G.E. Powell B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 50S-55SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several promoters share consensus binding sites for the Sp1, AP1, AP2, and NF-1 transcription factors. Nevertheless, a prominent motif is recognized as a binding site for lymphoid enhancer factor 1, originally identified as a pre-B and T cell-specific protein (16van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). A central role for this factor in hair keratin gene transcription and hair follicle patterning has been demonstrated by various mouse transgenesis experiments (17Zhou P. Byrne C. Jacobs J. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 700-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 18DasGupta R. Fuchs E. Development. 1999; 126: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the mechanisms leading to the ectopic expression of the truncated hHb1 hair keratin in breast carcinomas. hHb1-ΔN expression does not result from a translocation or rearrangement of the hHb1 locus. We actually demonstrated that its transcription is controlled by a cryptic promoter present in the 4th intron of the hHb1 gene. In addition, we studied the subcellular localization of the hHb1-ΔN protein in cancer cells. The HBL100 breast-immortalized cell line, the MCF7, SKBR3, and T47D breast cancer cell lines, and the HeLa cervix cancer cell line were maintained in culture with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.6 μg/ml insulin (for MCF7 and T47D). When the cells were treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-2′dC, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 4 × 105 MCF7, 2 × 106 SKBR3, and 8 × 105 T47D cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (day 0). 5-Aza-2′dC was added to the growth medium (at 0.5, 2, or 10 μg/ml) in two (or three, as indicated) 24-h pulses on days 2 and 5 (and day 8). Cells were used 24 h after treatment for RNA isolation. In experiments using cycloheximide (Sigma), 2 μg/ml 5-Aza-2′dC was first added to the medium for 5 days and cells were additionally treated with 2, 10, or 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for the last 72 or 24 h. The hHb1 5′- and 3′-specific cDNA probes and the 36B4 (acidic ribosomal protein, GenBank™ accession number M17885) cDNA probe have already been described (5Regnier C.H. Boulay A. Asch P.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. Br J Cancer. 1998; 78: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Exon 9 of hHb6 gene was amplified by PCR from SKBR3 genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-GAGAGAATTCCACTACTGCCCCTGTTGTCTC and 5′-GAGAGAATTCCTACAGAGAGAGACCATGGCG (EcoRI sites are underlined), cloned into pBluescript and used as a specific probe. All probes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow enzyme (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HBL100, MCF7, SKBR3, and T47D cells were plated in 15-cm dishes. At confluency, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m EDTA, 20 μg/ml boiled pancreatic RNase, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostic Corp., Berkeley, CA)) for 16 h at 42 °C. Genomic DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 1 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA. 20 μg of MCF7, SKBR3, and T47D genomic DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes under conditions recommended by the supplier (New England BioLabs), separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization with the hHb1 3′-cDNA probe was performed in the same conditions except for the Northern blot (see below). Cell cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and RNA extraction was carried out by the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol/chloroform procedure as previously described (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar). Northern blot was processed as previously described (4Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde, prior to transfer onto a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Northern blot was hybridized with the appropriate probes for 24 h at 42 °C. Primer extension was performed according to the protocol described in a previous study (20Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Two picomoles of antisense oligonucleotides complementary to hHb1-ΔN cDNA (either 5′-CGGCAATGATGCAGTCCATGT or 5′-GACAATGTCGTCATACTGTGC) were labeled at the 5′ terminus with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). The probe (106cpm) was co-precipitated with 40 μg of SKBR3 total RNA, or liver total RNA as a negative control, and resuspended in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). After heat denaturation, hybridization was performed overnight at 37 °C. After ethanol precipitation, cDNA was elongated by 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in 25 μl of elongation buffer containing 3.5 μl of dNTP (4 mm each), 5 μl of reverse transcriptase buffer, 1.25 μl of RNAsin for 90 min at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 μl of EDTA 0.5 m, and RNA was digested 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μg of RNase A. The elongated cDNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 6 μl of loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol blue, 0.025% bromphenol blue). The single-stranded cDNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel containing 8 m urea. hHb1 cDNA sequencing reactions were performed using the same antisense oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Cleveland, OH) and run in parallel to localize the initiation sites of transcription. The gel was vacuum-dried and exposed 24–36 h for autoradiography. RACE-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer (Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit,CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, 2 μg of SKBR3 poly(A)+ RNA (5Regnier C.H. Boulay A. Asch P.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. Br J Cancer. 1998; 78: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were reverse-transcribed by 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Double-stranded cDNA was ligated to the Marathon cDNA Adaptor by 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase. The 5′-end of the hHb1-ΔN cDNA was first amplified by PCR using 5 units ofTaq polymerase (Sigma Chemical Co.) in the presence of the sense adaptor primer (AP1) and the antisense primer 5′-GACTGAGCCACCGCGGCCTCCAGCTTG (designed in exon 6) specific of the hHb1-ΔN cDNA. The hHb1-ΔN cDNA was further amplified using internal primer 5′-GATCTCCTCCTTGGTGCGGCG (designed in the exon 5) and cloned into the pTAdv vector (CLONTECH Laboratories). Thirty hHb1-ΔN clones were sequenced. The hHb1 gene was PCR-amplified from SKBR3 and HBL100 genomic DNA using standard conditions with 5 units of Deep Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs) in the presence of 200 μm of each dNTP and 50 pmol of each of the following primers: 5′-primer, 5′-GAGAGAATTCACCCAAACGTCCAGGAGGATCATCATG and 3′-primer, 5′-GAGAGAATTCGTAGCTGAGCACTTGCTCCAGGCG (EcoRI restriction sites are underlined). The hHb1 gene was cloned into the EcoRI-digested pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence was verified from independently amplified genes. Luciferase constructs containing varying lengths of the hHb1-ΔN promoter were generated by PCR and inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene into SacI/XhoI-digested pGL3basic vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The following primers were used, their positions are referred relative to the most upstream transcription initiation site of hHb1-ΔN: the sense primers are 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCACCTGCGGATCAGGATTT (−3311/+22), 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCGATGTGGACTGCGCCTAC (A; −305/+22), 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCACTTCCTGAGGCGGCTGT (B; −235/+22), 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCGGGAGTGTTGGACAGGAT (C; −150/+22), 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCGGACCAGAGAAAGCCTGA (D; −85/+22), 5′-ATTTCTCTATCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCCCTGTGTTCTCAACTAAA (E; −38/+22), and the antisense primer is 5′-AAGCTTACTTAGATCGCAGATCTCGAGTTGACAACCACGGAGGTG for all the constructs (SacI and XhoI restriction sites are, respectively, underlined). Potential positive regulatory fragments of the hHb1-ΔN promoter were PCR-amplified and inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter into the pGL3promoter vector using the sense primers 5′-GAGACTCGAGACTTCCTGAGGCGGCTGTATG (position B; −235/−214), 5′-GAGACTCGAGGGGAGTGTTGGACAGGATGTG (position C; −150/−129), and the antisense primers 5′-GAGACTCGAGACCCCCAACTCTCCTCTCTGC (position C; −172/−151), 5′-GAGACTCGAGCCAACCCTGCCCCCTCACACA (position D; −107/−86), 5′-GAGACTCGAGCCAACCCACCATGTCCTGACT (position E; −60/−39). A double-stranded oligonucleotide (DE; −85/−39) corresponding to the annealed oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGGAATTCGGACCAGAGAAAGCCTGAGGAGGTGGAGTCAGGACATGGTGGGTTGGC, and 5′-TCGAGCCAACCCACCATGTCCTGACTCCACCTCCTCAGGCTTTCTCTGGTCCGAATTCC, was inserted into the pGL3promoter plasmid. Mutation of Sp1 and GT box binding sites was performed by site-directed mutagenesis (21Noel A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22866-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in the −85/+22 construct using the primers 5′-TGTCCTGACTGG AATTCCTCAGGCT and 5′-GAGAACACAGCCCCATATG CCATGTCCTGACTC (mutated nucleotides (underlined) generate EcoRI andNdeI restriction sites (italics)). All the constructs were verified by sequencing. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected in 10-cm dishes using the calcium phosphate procedure with 5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 μg of pCH110 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as an internal control for normalization and 5 μg of pBluescribe plasmid. After an overnight incubation, cells were washed and further incubated for 24–36 h. The cells were washed and scrapped in PBS, transferred in an Eppendorf tube, and lysed with 150 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation. 50 μl of cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity in an EG&G Berthold luminometer as outlined by the manufacturer (Promega Corp.). The results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were performed in duplicates or triplicates and repeated three times. Nuclear extracts were performed as previously described (20Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent cell cultures were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.8 ml of low salt buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (including pepstatin, antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin at 2.5 μg/ml each, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN)). After 10 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer C (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 26% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclei were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay. Footprinting was performed as previously described (20Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The −305/+22 promoter deletion fragment was cloned into pBluecript SK+ and released by EcoRI andEagI digestion. The resulting fragment was isolated and purified to label the coding and non-coding strands by incorporating either [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP (filling in the EagI and EcoRI overhangs, respectively) with the Klenow enzyme. The purified labeled probes (20,000 cpm) were mixed with 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)], 50 μg of nuclear extract, and 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), in the presence of 60 mm KCl in a final volume of 100 μl. Binding was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. DNA was digested for 2 min by DNase I (grade I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) at 15 milliunits/μl for naked DNA, and 1–4 units/μl DNase I in the presence of protein extract. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of stop solution (1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 40 μg/ml tRNA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K) 15 min at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated and resuspended in 5 μl of denaturing loading buffer. Digested DNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gel containing 8 m urea. Sequencing reactions of known sequences were run in parallel to define the protected nucleotides. The gel was vacuum-dried and exposed 24–36 h for autoradiography. Double-stranded oligonucleotides with 5′-overhangs (20Luo D. Guerin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar): Sp1, 5′-GTCTGAGGAGGTGGAGTCA and 5′-GACTCCTCCACCTCAGTTG; mutated Sp1, 5′-GTCTGATGAGGTTGAGTCA and 5′-GACTACTCCAACTCAGTTG; GT box, 5′-GTTCAGGACATGGTGGGTGGGGCTGTGTTCTCA and 5′-AGTCCTGTACCACCCACCCCGACACAAGAGTTG; mutated GT box, 5′-GTTCAGGACATGGCATACGGGGCTGTGTTCTCA and 5′-AGTCCTGTACCGTATGCCCCGACACAAGAGTTG (core binding site or the mutated nucleotides are underlined) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP using Klenow polymerase. Labeled probes (20,000 cpm) were added to 20 μl of binding reaction containing 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), 0.8 μg of poly[d(I·C)] and 60 mm KCl and incubated with 6 μg of nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature. Competition and supershift assays were performed by adding to the binding reaction a 100× excess of cold oligonucleotide and 0.4 μg of anti-Sp1 and/or anti- Sp3 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The protein-DNA and protein-DNA-antibody complexes were separated from the free probe by electrophoresis through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and exposed for autoradiography. The rabbit polyclonal antiserum 1622 was obtained by immunization with the synthetic peptide GISSLGVGSCGSSCRKC corresponding to the last carboxyl-terminal residues of hHb1 coupled to ovalbumin using them-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linking reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL), as previously described (22Muller D.

Polytronized mouse back skin and cell lines were twice sonicated in (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.6 m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) to prepare soluble and insoluble protein-enriched fractions. The protein extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The hHb1-ΔN protein was revealed with the rabbit anti-hHb1 antiserum purified against the synthetic peptide. The pan-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody C-11 (Sigma Chemical Co.) recognizes simple- and stratified-epithelial cytokeratins. hHb1-ΔN in fusion with the GFP was recognized by the 1622 antiserum directed against hHb1. hHb1-ΔN cDNA (GenBank™ accession number X80197) was fused with the green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag in the EcoRI-digested pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.), and hHb1-ΔN protein was localized using GFP fluorescence. Immunofluorescence detection of the intermediate filaments was performed using the pan-cytokeratins C-11 antibody. Isolated HeLa cells were seeded on 12-mm coverslips in 24-well dishes and transfected with the pEGFP-N2-hHb1-ΔN vector using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and permeabilized by two washes of 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with the pan-cytokeratin C-11 antibody for 1 h, washed, and then incubated for 30 min with a mouse-specific antibody coupled to the Cy-3 fluorochrome. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Labeled cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Having previously identified the ectopic expression of the truncated hHb1 mRNA, hHb1-ΔN, in breast cancers (4Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P.

The truncated mRNA is expressed at various levels in the different cell lines tested. hHb1-ΔN is expressed in the MCF7 cell line at basal levels, whereas high mRNA expression was found in the SKBR3 cell line (Fig. 1). The T47D cell line did not synthesize hHb1-ΔN at a detectable level. According to previous data (5Regnier C.H. Boulay A. Asch P.H. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. Br J Cancer. 1998; 78: 1640-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), hHb1-ΔN expression was also not detected in normal hairy skin (Fig. 1). So far, hHb1-ΔN was only detected in mammary cancer tissues and cell lines. We decided to evaluate the mechanism responsible for the expression of hHb1-ΔN in breast cancer cells. Expression of tumor cell-specific truncated mRNA can result from gene alterations occurring during cell transformation such as gene deletion, rearrangement, and chromosomal translocation. In addition, the hHb1 gene maps to 12q11-13 (23Bowden P.E. Hainey S.D. Parker G. Jones D.O. Zimonjic D. Popescu N. Hodgins M.B. J. Invest.

To find out whether hHb1-ΔN results from a genomic deletion or rearrangement, we digested genomic DNA isolated from breast cancer cell lines with five different restriction enzymes and analyzed the restriction patterns of the hHb1 gene locus by Southern blotting (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The restriction pattern was identical between DNA from cell lines that transcribed the hHb1-ΔN (MCF7 and SKBR3) and the one that did not (T47D). Thus, its expression does not arise from a translocation or an obvious rearrangement event occurring in the hHb1 locus. We next cloned the hHb1 gene by PCR from genomic DNA of the SKBR3 cells and of the HBL100 immortalized breast cancer cells that expresses hHb1-ΔN at a low level (data not shown). Up to 500 bp upstream of exon 1 of independently amplified genes from each cell line was sequenced and showed the absence of a minor rearrangement event over the promoter and gene sequences (GenBank™ accession numbersY19206 and Y13621) (23Bowden P.E.

Taken together, these data show that hHb1-ΔN expression is not due to a genomic alteration occurring in thehHb1 locus. Another mechanism leading to the expression of truncated mRNAs is the use of alternative promoters and/or alternative splicing. To define a putative transcriptional regulatory region, we first mapped the hHb1-ΔN transcriptional start site by primer extension (Fig. 3). An oligonucleotide complementary to the hHb1-ΔN mRNA was hybridized to total RNA isolated from SKBR3 cells, which express high level of hHb1-ΔN, or control liver RNA. Extension of the cDNA resulted in six intense SKBR3-specific cDNA bands, each differing in length by only one nucleotide (92–97 bp), indicating that six adjacent sites located around the hHb1 intron 4-exon 5 junction (n"
