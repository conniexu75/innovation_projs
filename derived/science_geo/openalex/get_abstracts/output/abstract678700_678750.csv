Zeng et al . developed a multilayer metafabric composed of a titanium oxide polylactic acid composite laminated with a polytetrafluoroethylene layer. This combination creates a textile that has passive radiative cooling properties with good mechanical properties and scalability. The textile can be made into clothes or car covers and keeps a person or a car much cooler than other fabrics. —BG"
https://openalex.org/W3189525949,"We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation."
https://openalex.org/W3188079964,"Direct, amplification-free detection of RNA has the potential to transform molecular diagnostics by enabling simple on-site analysis of human or environmental samples. CRISPR-Cas nucleases offer programmable RNA-guided RNA recognition that triggers cleavage and release of a fluorescent reporter molecule, but long reaction times hamper their detection sensitivity and speed. Here, we show that unrelated CRISPR nucleases can be deployed in tandem to provide both direct RNA sensing and rapid signal generation, thus enabling robust detection of ~30 molecules per µl of RNA in 20 min. Combining RNA-guided Cas13 and Csm6 with a chemically stabilized activator creates a one-step assay that can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA extracted from respiratory swab samples with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)-derived cycle threshold (Ct) values up to 33, using a compact detector. This Fast Integrated Nuclease Detection In Tandem (FIND-IT) approach enables sensitive, direct RNA detection in a format that is amenable to point-of-care infection diagnosis as well as to a wide range of other diagnostic or research applications."

Robin et al . studied an aqueous electrolyte confined into a pseudo two-dimensional gap between two graphite layers (see the Perspective by Hou and Hou). The authors observed a current–voltage relation that exhibits hysteresis, and the conductance depends on the history of the system, also known as the memresistor effect. Using simulations of their system, they can model the emission of voltage spikes characteristic of neuromorphic activity. —MSL"
https://openalex.org/W3193174973,"Over 15 million patients with epilepsy worldwide do not respond to drugs. Successful surgical treatment requires complete removal or disconnection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), brain region(s) where seizures originate. Unfortunately, surgical success rates vary between 30 and 70% because no clinically validated biological marker of the SOZ exists. We develop and retrospectively validate a new electroencephalogram (EEG) marker-neural fragility-in a retrospective analysis of 91 patients by using neural fragility of the annotated SOZ as a metric to predict surgical outcomes. Fragility predicts 43 out of 47 surgical failures, with an overall prediction accuracy of 76% compared with the accuracy of clinicians at 48% (successful outcomes). In failed outcomes, we identify fragile regions that were untreated. When compared to 20 EEG features proposed as SOZ markers, fragility outperformed in predictive power and interpretability, which suggests neural fragility as an EEG biomarker of the SOZ."

https://openalex.org/W3191354189,"Gag, the primary structural protein of HIV-1, is recruited to the plasma membrane for virus assembly by its matrix (MA) domain. Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains, causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry. We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV-1 through cryo-electron tomography. We found that MA rearranges between two different hexameric lattices upon maturation. In mature HIV-1, a lipid extends out of the membrane to bind with a pocket in MA. Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV-1 not only assembles the viral capsid surrounding the genome but also repurposes the membrane-bound MA lattice for an entry or postentry function and results in the partial removal of up to 2500 lipids from the viral membrane."

Unfortunately, this is not always straightforward because the disease-causing mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase vary between patients and affect the severity of the phenotype, such that some patients’ symptoms do not fully respond to the available interventions. Li et al . identified two long noncoding RNAs, one in mice and one in humans, that interact with phenylalanine hydroxylase and modulate its function (see the Perspective by Ben-Tov Perry and Ulitsky). Administration of modified RNAs mimicking their effects ameliorated the disease phenotype in mouse models of phenylketonuria. —YN"
https://openalex.org/W3189091039,"Pioneer transcription factors such as OCT4 can target silent genes embedded in nucleosome-dense regions. How nucleosome interaction enables transcription factors to target chromatin and determine cell identity remains elusive. Here, we systematically dissect OCT4 to show that nucleosome binding is encoded within the DNA-binding domain and yet can be uncoupled from free-DNA binding. Furthermore, accelerating the binding kinetics of OCT4 to DNA enhances nucleosome binding. In cells, uncoupling nucleosome binding diminishes the ability of OCT4 to individually access closed chromatin, while more dynamic nucleosome binding results in expansive genome scanning within closed chromatin. However, both uncoupling and enhancing nucleosome binding are detrimental to inducing pluripotency from differentiated cells. Remarkably, stable interactions between OCT4 and nucleosomes are continuously required for maintaining the accessibility of pluripotency enhancers in stem cells. Our findings reveal how the affinity and residence time of OCT4-nucleosome complexes modulate chromatin accessibility during cell fate changes and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3188916154,"Heterochromatin, typically marked by histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) or lysine 27 (H3K27me3), represses different protein-coding genes in different cells, as well as repetitive elements. The basis for locus specificity is unclear. Previously, we identified 172 proteins that are embedded in sonication-resistant heterochromatin (srHC) harbouring H3K9me3. Here, we investigate in humans how 97 of the H3K9me3-srHC proteins repress heterochromatic genes. We reveal four groups of srHC proteins that each repress many common genes and repeat elements. Two groups repress H3K9me3-embedded genes with different extents of flanking srHC, one group is specific for srHC genes with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, and one group is specific for genes with srHC as the primary feature. We find that the enhancer of rudimentary homologue (ERH) is conserved from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in repressing meiotic genes and, in humans, now represses other lineage-specific genes and repeat elements. The study greatly expands our understanding of H3K9me3-based gene repression in vertebrates. McCarthy, Kaeding et al. identify H3K9me3-heterochromatin proteins that repress heterochromatic genes with implications in hepatic reprogramming and show that ERH is key to global H3K9me3 maintenance in human cells."

No personal or identifying information was obtained.Of 505 doctors, 446 (87.3%) had experienced hospital violence in the previous 6 months. Doctors reported that patients were responsible for 95 (21.3%) instances of violence, patient family or relatives for 322 (72.4%), police or military personnel for 19 (4.3%), and other sources for 9 (2%). The proportion of violent events reported did not differ between male and female doctors, although characteristics varied. There were 415 of the 505 doctors who reported that violence had increased since the beginning of the pandemic, and many felt the situation would only get worse. COVID-19 has heightened tensions in an already violent health workplace, further increasing risks to patients and health providers.During the COVID-19 epidemic in Iraq an already violent hospital environment in Baghdad has only worsened. The physical and emotional toll on health workers is high which further threatens patient care and hospital productivity. While more security measures can be taken, reducing health workplace violence requires other measures such as improved communication, and addressing issues of patient care."

Their direct experimental observation is a long-standing challenge, with only one successful previous attempt. Using a combination of infrared activation spectroscopy and an ultraviolet laser–induced fluorescence detection method, Hansen et al . directly characterized the vibrational structure of a •QOOH intermediate in isobutane oxidation, collisionally stabilized and isolated, and followed its dissociative evolution under infrared activation with time and energy resolution.

Squirrels navigate remarkably complex and unpredictable environments as they leap from branch to branch, and mistakes can be fatal. These feats require a complex combination of evolved biomechanical adaptations and learned behaviors. Hunt et al . characterized the integration of these features in a series of experiments with free-living fox squirrels (see the Perspective by Adolph and Young). They found that the squirrels’ remarkable and consistent success was due to a combination of learned impulse generation when assessing the balance between distance and branch flexibility and the addition of innovative leaps and landings in the face of increasingly difficult challenges. —SNV"

https://openalex.org/W3192464013,"Water being a vital part of cell protoplasm plays a significant role in sustaining life on earth; however, drastic changes in climatic conditions lead to limiting the availability of water and causing other environmental adversities. α-tocopherol being a powerful antioxidant, protects lipid membranes from the drastic effects of oxidative stress by deactivating singlet oxygen, reducing superoxide radicals, and terminating lipid peroxidation by reducing fatty acyl peroxy radicals under drought stress conditions. A pot experiment was conducted and two groups of lentil cultivar (Punjab-2009) were exposed to 20 and 25 days of drought induced stress by restricting the availability of water after 60 th day of germination. Both of the groups were sprinkled with α-tocopherol 100, 200 and 300 mg/L. Induced water deficit stress conditions caused a pronounced decline in growth parameters including absolute growth rate (AGR), leaf area index (LAI), leaf area ratio (LAR), root shoot ratio (RSR), relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll a, b, total chlorophyll content, carotenoids, and soluble protein content (SPC) which were significantly enhanced by exogenously applied α-tocopherol. Moreover, a significant increase was reported in total proline content (TPC), soluble sugar content (SSC), glycine betaine (GB) content, endogenous tocopherol levels, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. On the contrary, exogenously applied α-tocopherol significantly reduced the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). In conclusion, it was confirmed that exogenous application of α-tocopherol under drought induced stress regimes resulted in membrane protection by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, enhancing the activities of antioxidative enzymes (APX, CAT, POD, and SOD) and accumulation of osmolytes such as glycine betaine, proline and sugar. Consequently, modulating different growth, physiological and biochemical attributes."

https://openalex.org/W3188236002,"Epilepsy is a complex neurological condition characterized by repeated spontaneous seizures and can be induced by initiating seizures known as status epilepticus (SE). Elaborating the critical molecular mechanisms following SE are central to understanding the establishment of chronic seizures. Here, we identify a transient program of molecular and metabolic signaling in the early epileptogenic period, centered on day five following SE in the pre-clinical kainate or pilocarpine models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Our work now elaborates a new molecular mechanism centered around Wnt signaling and a growing network comprised of metabolic reprogramming and mTOR activation. Biochemical, metabolomic, confocal microscopy and mouse genetics experiments all demonstrate coordinated activation of Wnt signaling, predominantly in neurons, and the ensuing induction of an overall aerobic glycolysis (Warburg-like phenomenon) and an altered TCA cycle in early epileptogenesis. A centerpiece of the mechanism is the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) through its kinase and Wnt target genes PDK4. Intriguingly, PDH is a central gene in certain genetic epilepsies, underscoring the relevance of our elaborated mechanisms. While sharing some features with cancers, the Warburg-like metabolism in early epileptogenesis is uniquely split between neurons and astrocytes to achieve an overall novel metabolic reprogramming. This split Warburg metabolic reprogramming triggers an inhibition of AMPK and subsequent activation of mTOR, which is a signature event of epileptogenesis. Interrogation of the mechanism with the metabolic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose surprisingly demonstrated that Wnt signaling and the resulting metabolic reprogramming lies upstream of mTOR activation in epileptogenesis. To augment the pre-clinical pilocarpine and kainate models, aspects of the proposed mechanisms were also investigated and correlated in a genetic model of constitutive Wnt signaling (deletion of the transcriptional repressor and Wnt pathway inhibitor HBP1). The results from the HBP1 -/- mice provide a genetic evidence that Wnt signaling may set the threshold of acquired seizure susceptibility with a similar molecular framework. Using biochemistry and genetics, this paper outlines a new molecular framework of early epileptogenesis and advances a potential molecular platform for refining therapeutic strategies in attenuating recurrent seizures."

https://openalex.org/W3188346225,"Ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) releases Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells to initiate muscle contraction. Multiple endogenous and exogenous effectors regulate RyR1, such as ATP, Ca2+, caffeine (Caf), and ryanodine. Cryo-EM identified binding sites for the three coactivators Ca2+, ATP, and Caf. However, the mechanism of coregulation and synergy between these activators remains to be determined. Here, we used [3H]ryanodine ligand-binding assays and molecular dynamics simulations to test the hypothesis that both the ATP- and Caf-binding sites communicate with the Ca2+-binding site to sensitize RyR1 to Ca2+. We report that either phosphomethylphosphonic acid adenylate ester (AMPPCP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, or Caf can activate RyR1 in the absence or the presence of Ca2+. However, enhanced RyR1 activation occurred in the presence of Ca2+, AMPPCP, and Caf. In the absence of Ca2+, Na+ inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding without impairing RyR1 activation by AMPPCP and Caf. Computational analysis suggested that Ca2+-, ATP-, and Caf-binding sites modulate RyR1 protein stability through interactions with the carboxyterminal domain and other domains in the activation core. In the presence of ATP and Caf but the absence of Ca2+, Na+ is predicted to inhibit RyR1 by interacting with the Ca2+-binding site. Our data suggested that ATP and Caf binding affected the conformation of the Ca2+-binding site, and conversely, Ca2+ binding affected the conformation of the ATP- and Caf-binding sites. We conclude that Ca2+, ATP, and Caf regulate RyR1 through a network of allosteric interactions involving the Ca2+-, ATP-, and Caf-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W3189265206,"A large body of empirical evidence suggests that humans are willing to engage in costly punishment of defectors in public goods games. Based on such pieces of evidence, it is suggested that punishment serves an important role in promoting cooperation in humans, and possibly other species. Nevertheless, theoretical work has been unable to show how this is possible. The problem originates from the fact that punishment, being costly, is an altruistic act and its evolution is subject to the same problem that it tries to address. To suppress this so-called second-order free-rider problem, known theoretical models on the evolution of punishment resort to one of the few established mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation. This leaves the question that whether altruistic punishment can evolve and give rise to the evolution of cooperation, unaddressed. Here, by considering a population of individuals who play a public goods game, followed by a public punishing game, introduced here, we show that altruistic punishment indeed evolves and promotes cooperation, in a general environment and in the absence of a cooperation favoring mechanism. Besides, our analysis shows, being close to a physical phase transition facilitates the evolution of altruistic punishment."
https://openalex.org/W3190645830,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is characterized by a high morbidity and mortality, highlighting a great need for a better understanding of biological mechanisms that affect OC progression and improving its early detection methods. This study investigates effects of prolactin (PRL) on ovarian cancer cells, analyzes PRL receptors (PRLR) in tissue micro arrays and relates PRLR expression to survival of ovarian cancer. A database, composed of transcript profiles from OC, was searched for PRLR expression and results were put in relation to survival. Expression of PRLR in OC tissue sections and OC cell lines SKOV3, OV2008 and OVSAHO was assessed using immunohistochemistry, western blots and quantitative real-time PCR. The biological function of PRLR was evaluated by proliferation, colony formation and wound healing assays. Levels of PRLR mRNA are related to survival; in epithelial OC a high PRLR mRNA expression is related to a shorter survival. Analysis of a tissue micro array consisting of 84 OC showed that 72% were positive for PRLR immuno-staining. PRLR staining tended to be higher in OC of high grade tumors compared to lower grades. PRLR mRNA and protein can further be detected in OC cell lines. Moreover, in vitro treatment with PRL significantly activated the JAK/STAT pathway. PRLR expression is associated with OC survivals. PRL and its receptor may play an onco-modulatory role and promote tumor aggressiveness in OC. Alternatively, increased PRLR levels may form a base for the development of PRLR antagonist or PRLR antagonist-drug conjugate to increase selective uptake of anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3187560926,"The Sine-Cosine algorithm (SCA) is a population-based metaheuristic algorithm utilizing sine and cosine functions to perform search. To enable the search process, SCA incorporates several search parameters. But sometimes, these parameters make the search in SCA vulnerable to local minima/maxima. To overcome this problem, a new Multi Sine-Cosine algorithm (MSCA) is proposed in this paper. MSCA utilizes multiple swarm clusters to diversify & intensify the search in-order to avoid the local minima/maxima problem. Secondly, during update MSCA also checks for better search clusters that offer convergence to global minima effectively. To assess its performance, we tested the MSCA on unimodal, multimodal and composite benchmark functions taken from the literature. Experimental results reveal that the MSCA is statistically superior with regards to convergence as compared to recent state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, including the original SCA."
https://openalex.org/W3190751434,"In recent years, the issues related to carbon emissions and environment have attracted extensive attentions. Considering four scenarios (the energy conversion, energy capital savings and loans, energy exports and cement production carbon emissions), this paper adopts the energy consumption method and input-output method to analyze China’s carbon emissions structure on the supply-side and demand-side of energy, and finally provides policy recommendations for China’s structural emission reduction. The results show that, if the four influencing factors were not considered, the measurement of carbon emissions from the final demand was 44.91% higher than the baseline scenario, 12.36% lower than the baseline scenario from intermediate demand, and 10.23% lower than the baseline scenario from the total. For China’s carbon emissions structure on the supply-side of energy, the carbon emissions from high-carbon energy, represented by raw coal, accounted for 66.805% of the total energy-related carbon emissions, while the carbon emissions from low-carbon energy, represented by natural gas, only accounted for 2.485%. For China’s carbon emissions structure on the demand-side of energy, the carbon emissions from intermediate demand (enterprise production) accounted for more than 95% of total energy-related carbon emissions, while the carbon emissions from final demand (residents and government use) accounted for less than 5%. For each specific industry in intermediate demand for energy, the heavy industry, electric power, fossil energy, and chemical industry have high carbon emissions and low carbon emissions efficiency. However, the agriculture, construction, light industry, and service are the opposite. Finally, we provide policy recommendations for improving the accuracy of carbon emissions measurement and carbon emissions efficiency."

A total of 249 participants were included in the study, with a balanced population proportional representation by age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region of New Zealand. An online questionnaire was used to identify participants’ decision-making process, and what factors and barriers for participants to seek dental treatment. Cross-tabulations, Spearman correlation analysis and Pearson Chi-Square analysis were used for the statistical analyses. Three most common reasons for visit were check-up (77%), clean (57%) and relief of pain 36%). A desire to treat a perceived problem was the most common encouraging factor to seek dental care. Cost was the most common barrier to seeking dental services. The majority of participants attended a private practice (84%), with convenience of location and referral from professionals the most likely to influence their choice. Participants felt the most important trait a dental practitioner could demonstrate was to discuss treatment options with them before any treatment. Dental check-up, teeth cleaning and relief of pain were the most common reasons for patients to choose dental services.

https://openalex.org/W3193121389,"Statistical models for outcome prediction are central to traumatic brain injury research and critical to baseline risk adjustment. Glasgow coma score (GCS) and pupil reactivity are crucial covariates in all such models but may be measured at multiple time points between the time of injury and hospital and are subject to a variable degree of unreliability and/or missingness. Imputation of missing data may be undertaken using full multiple imputation or by simple substitution of measurements from other time points. However, it is unknown which strategy is best or which time points are more predictive. We evaluated the pseudo- R 2 of logistic regression models (dichotomous survival) and proportional odds models (Glasgow Outcome Score—extended) using different imputation strategies on the The Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study dataset. Substitution strategies were easy to implement, achieved low levels of missingness (&lt;&lt; 10%) and could outperform multiple imputation without the need for computationally costly calculations and pooling multiple final models. While model performance was sensitive to imputation strategy, this effect was small in absolute terms and clinical relevance. A strategy of using the emergency department discharge assessments and working back in time when these were missing generally performed well. Full multiple imputation had the advantage of preserving time-dependence in the models: the pre-hospital assessments were found to be relatively unreliable predictors of survival or outcome. The predictive performance of later assessments was model-dependent. In conclusion, simple substitution strategies for imputing baseline GCS and pupil response can perform well and may be a simple alternative to full multiple imputation in many cases."
https://openalex.org/W3187078321,"Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in the closure of businesses and schools, the remote provision of services and the disruption of the services of professional childminders. These disruptions resulted in a significant increase in parental responsibility for childcare. Such a substantial increase in time requirements for childcare domestically has potential mental health consequences. We therefore ascertained the relationship between childcare and depression in South Africa during the pandemic. Methods Data came from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, a longitudinal telephonic survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. The outcome was a depression index obtained from the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire while the main covariate was the average number of hours spent in taking care of children per weekday. We employed the ordered logit model. Findings We found a positive relationship between spending more hours on childcare and worse depressive health for caregivers in both periods analyzed. Childcare responsibilities preventing/mitigating the ability of caregivers to work as well as preventing caregivers from searching for jobs moderated the depression-childcare relationship. Conclusion These findings highlight the need to carefully consider policy responses aimed at containing the pandemic. We advocate a multi-stakeholder approach to mitigating the mental health impact of COVID-19 by encouraging more collaboration between government, school authorities, employers and parents/guardians."

Magnetization prepared 2 rapid gradient echo (MP2RAGE) sequence offers superior gray (GM) and white matter (WM) contrast. This study aimed to quantitatively assess the agreement of whole brain tissue and deep GM (DGM) volumes obtained from MP2RAGE compared to the widely used MP-RAGE sequence. Methods Twenty-nine healthy participants were included in this study. All subjects underwent a 3T MRI scan acquiring high-resolution 3D MP-RAGE and MP2RAGE images. Twelve participants were re-scanned after one year. The whole brain, as well as DGM segmentation, was performed using CAT12, volBrain, and FSL-FAST automatic segmentation tools based on the acquired images. Finally, contrast-to-noise ratio between WM and GM (CNR WG ), the agreement between the obtained tissue volumes, as well as scan-rescan variability of both sequences were explored. Results Significantly higher CNR WG was detected in MP2RAGE vs. MP-RAGE (Mean ± SD = 0.97 ± 0.04 vs . 0.8 ± 0.1 respectively; p &lt;0.0001). Significantly higher total brain GM, and lower cerebrospinal fluid‏ volumes were obtained from MP2RAGE vs. MP-RAGE based on all segmentation methods ( p &lt;0.05 in all cases). Whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons revealed higher GM tissue probability in the thalamus, putamen, caudate, lingual gyrus, and precentral gyrus based on MP2RAGE compared with MP-RAGE. Moreover, significantly higher WM probability was observed in the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and frontal-and-temporal regions in MP2RAGE vs. MP-RAGE. Finally, MP2RAGE showed a higher mean percentage of change in total brain GM compared to MP-RAGE. On the other hand, MP-RAGE demonstrated a higher overtime percentage of change in WM and DGM volumes compared to MP2RAGE. Conclusions Due to its higher CNR, MP2RAGE resulted in reproducible brain tissue segmentation, and thus is a recommended method for volumetric imaging biomarkers for the monitoring of neurological diseases."

One of the key steps in the design and fine-tuning of such arrays during the development process is finding the default driving phases for individual coil elements providing the best possible homogeneity of the combined B 1 + -field that is achievable without (or before) subject-specific B 1 + -adjustment in the scanner. This task is often solved by time-consuming (brute-force) or by limited efficiency optimization methods. In this work, we propose a robust technique to find phase vectors providing optimization of the B 1 -homogeneity in the default setup of multiple-element transceiver arrays. The key point of the described method is the pre-selection of starting vectors for the iterative solver-based search to maximize the probability of finding a global extremum for a cost function optimizing the homogeneity of a shaped B 1 + -field. This strategy allows for (i) drastic reduction of the computation time in comparison to a brute-force method and (ii) finding phase vectors providing a combined B 1 + -field with homogeneity characteristics superior to the one provided by the random-multi-start optimization approach. The method was efficiently used for optimizing the default phase settings in the in-house-built 8Tx/16Rx arrays designed for cMRI in pigs at 7T."
https://openalex.org/W3192903047,"Background The endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is an efficient minimally invasive procedure for removal of pituitary tumors that can be accomplished through a one-hand or two-hand approach. The one-hand procedure through one nostril is more intuitive for surgeons, but maneuvering the instruments can be restrictive. The two-hand procedure using a one-and-half nostril approach provides more precise manipulation. This study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of one-hand/mono-nostril and two-hand/one-and-half nostril surgeries for resection of large pituitary tumors by a single neurosurgeon. Materials and methods The surgical data of 78 consecutive cases with pituitary macroadenoma (diameter &gt;1 cm) were reviewed retrospectively. Altogether, 30 cases received one-hand/mono-nostril surgery, while 48 cases received two-hand/one-and-half nostril surgery. Postoperative outcomes of the two operations were compared. Results The operative time, hospital stay, residual rate of pituitary macroadenoma, visual field, surgical complications, and re-operative rates were slightly improved in the two-hand/one-and-half nostril surgery group compared with that in the one-hand/mono-nostril surgery group (all p &gt;0.05). However, postoperative hypopituitarism was less frequent (1/48; 2.0%) with the two-hand/one-and-half nostril approach than with the mono-nostril approach ( p = 0.004). Similar surgical outcomes were found in all patients with either small or large pituitary tumors, except that the difference in postoperative improvement in visual field change reached statistical significance ( p = 0.044). Conclusion A single-surgeon endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery with two-hand/one-and-half nostril approach is an effective and safe procedure for removal of large pituitary tumors."

The models were applied to Uganda Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment 2016/2017 data with auxiliary information from the 2016 Lot Quality Assurance Sampling survey and antenatal care data from district health information system datasets for unit-level and area-level models, respectively. Results Estimates from the model-based and the direct survey methods were similar. However, direct survey estimates were unstable compared with the model-based estimates. Area-level model estimates were more stable than unit-level model estimates. The correlation between unit-level and direct survey estimates was ( β 1 = 0.66, r 2 = 0.862), and correlation between area-level model and direct survey estimates was ( β 1 = 0.44, r 2 = 0.698). The error associated with the estimates decreased by 37.5% and 33.1% for the unit-level and area-level models, respectively, compared to the direct survey estimates. Conclusions Although the unit-level model estimates were less precise than the area-level model estimates, they were highly correlated with the direct survey estimates and had less standard error associated with estimates than the area-level model. Unit-level models provide more accurate and reliable data to support local decision-making when unit-level auxiliary information is available."
https://openalex.org/W3188431308,"Perceptions of the alcohol environment may influence alcohol consumption patterns. The purpose of this study was to describe changes in perceptions of the urban alcohol environment as experienced by residents of two districts with different socio-economic status after taking part in a Photovoice study. The study was conducted in Madrid, Spain, in a district with a high socio-economic status (HSES) and another district with a low socio-economic status (LSES). A Photovoice project was conducted with 26 participants divided into four groups based on sex and district. Groups met over five sessions in which they discussed photographs taken by the participants themselves on the subject of alcohol in their neighbourhood. A qualitative, descriptive and thematic analysis of participants’ discourses was performed to explore changes in their perceptions of the alcohol environment over the project sessions. Changes in perceptions of the alcohol environment were observed in all groups over the project. The process of change varied by districts’ socio-economic characteristics and gender. Greater changes in perceptions of the alcohol environment were observed in HSES, especially among women, as the participants had a much more positive initial view of their alcohol environment. In LSES, participants showed a more critical perception of the alcohol environment from the beginning of the study, and this broadened and intensified over the course of the sessions. Changes in perceptions also varied by thematic categories, including some categories that were discussed from the start (e.g. socialising and alcohol consumption) and categories that only emerged in later sessions (e.g. alcohol advertising). Involvement in a Photovoice project has favoured a shift in the participant’s perceptions of their alcohol environment towards more critical positions, widening their scope of perceived elements and raising their awareness of specific problems, such as alcohol advertising and social role of alcohol consumption in relation to alcohol exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3192773171,"The global incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing. Types 1 and 2 DM are associated with declining β-cell function. Verapamil (50% S-verapamil and 50% R-verapamil) can treat DM by downregulating thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), which induces islet β-cell apoptosis. However, it may also induce cardiovascular side effects as S-verapamil is negatively inotropic. In contrast, R-verapamil only weakly induces adverse cardiac effects. In this study, we aimed to determine the antidiabetic efficacy and cardiovascular safety of R-verapamil. We examined R- and S-verapamil binding through in vitro studies. Streptozotocin-induced type 1 and db / db type 2 DM mouse models were used to assess the antidiabetic efficacy of verapamil. IL-6, blood glucose (BG), Txnip expression, and β-cells were evaluated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, while body weight, BG, and serum insulin were measured in the db / db mice. In the type 1 DM study, 100 mg/kg/day R-verapamil and racemic verapamil lowered BG, downregulated Txnip expression, and reduced β-cell apoptosis. In the type 2 DM study, the optimal R-verapamil dosage was 60 mg/kg/day and it lowered BG and raised serum insulin. However, efficacy did not increase with R-verapamil dosage. R-verapamil combined with metformin/acarbose improved BG and serum insulin more effectively than metformin/acarbose alone or verapamil combined with acarbose. R-verapamil had weaker cardiovascular side effects than S-verapamil. R-verapamil was 9.0× and 3.4× less effective than S-verapamil at inhibiting atrial inotropy and ileal contractility, respectively. It was also 8.7× weaker than S-verapamil as an agonist of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), inhibiting ileal neurogenic contraction. Hence, R-verapamil may be an optimal DM treatment as it is safe, improves glycemic control, and preserves β-cell function both as monotherapy and in combination with metformin or acarbose. R-Verapamil has potential for delaying or arresting DM progression and improving patients’ quality of life."

https://openalex.org/W3188325817,"It remains unclear how the seemingly ubiquitous use of the internet impacts user’s offline personal relationships, particularly those that are romantic or sexual. Therefore, we conducted a national online survey to better understand the associations among internet use, sexual behavior, and adjustment called the Sexual Behaviors, Internet Use, and Psychological Adjustment Survey (SIPS). Here, we report patterns of sexual behavior in a sample of adults ( N = 1987; ages 18–70) in the United States to establish its representativeness and consistency with similar recent surveys. We found age- and sex-related trends in oral, vaginal, and anal sex in terms of prevalence, frequency, number of partners, and age of initiation consistent with prior studies. We also detected differences in sexual behaviors based on relationship status and sexual orientation, but small and relatively few significant differences across racial and ethnic groups. The results confirm and expand upon trends identified in prior national surveys of sexual behavior, establishing the representativeness of the SIPS sample for use in future research examining the links among sexual behaviors and romantic relationships, internet use, and adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W3189917397,"Background Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potential cure for certain life-threatening malignant and nonmalignant diseases. However, experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that pre-transplant myeloablative conditioning damages the gut leading to translocation of intestinal bacteria and the development of acute graft vs. host disease (aGVHD). The overall objective of this study was to determine whether administration of broad spectrum antibiotics (Abx) affects the onset and/or severity of aGVHD in lymphopenic mice that were not subjected to toxic, pre-transplant conditioning. Results We found that treatment of NK cell-depleted recombination activating gene-1-deficient (-NK/RAG) recipients with an Abx cocktail containing vancomycin and neomycin for 7 days prior to and 4 weeks following adoptive transfer of allogeneic CD4 + T cells, exacerbated the development of aGVHD-induced BM failure and spleen damage when compared to untreated–NK/RAG recipients engrafted with syngeneic or allogeneic T cells. Abx-treated mice exhibited severe anemia and monocytopenia as well as marked reductions in BM- and spleen-residing immune cells. Blinded histopathological analysis confirmed that Abx-treated mice engrafted with allogeneic T cells suffered significantly more damage to the BM and spleen than did untreated mice engrafted with allogeneic T cells. Abx-induced exacerbation of BM and spleen damage correlated with a dramatic reduction in fecal bacterial diversity, marked loss of anaerobic bacteria and remarkable expansion of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Conclusions We conclude that continuous Abx treatment may aggravate aGVHD-induced tissue damage by reducing short chain fatty acid-producing anaerobes (e.g. Clostridium , Blautia ) and/or by promoting the expansion of pathobionts (e.g. Akkermansia ) and opportunistic pathogens ( Cronobacter) ."
https://openalex.org/W3193220027,"Background Sentinel physician surveillance in communities has played an important role in detecting early signs of epidemics. The traditional approach is to let the primary care physician voluntarily and actively report diseases to the health department on a weekly basis. However, this is labor-intensive work, and the spatio-temporal resolution of the surveillance data is not precise at all. In this study, we built up a clinic-based enhanced sentinel surveillance system named “Sentinel plus” which was designed for sentinel clinics and community hospitals to monitor 23 kinds of syndromic groups in Taipei City, Taiwan. The definitions of those syndromic groups were based on ICD-10 diagnoses from physicians. Methods Daily ICD-10 counts of two syndromic groups including ILI and EV-like syndromes in Taipei City were extracted from Sentinel plus. A negative binomial regression model was used to couple with lag structure functions to examine the short-term association between ICD counts and meteorological variables. After fitting the negative binomial regression model, residuals were further rescaled to Pearson residuals. We then monitored these daily standardized Pearson residuals for any aberrations from July 2018 to October 2019. Results The results showed that daily average temperature was significantly negatively associated with numbers of ILI syndromes. The ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations were significantly positively associated with ILI syndromes. In addition, daily minimum temperature, and the ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations were significantly negatively associated with the EV-like syndromes. The aberrational signals detected from clinics for ILI and EV-like syndromes were earlier than the epidemic period based on outpatient surveillance defined by the Taiwan CDC. Conclusions This system not only provides warning signals to the local health department for managing the risks but also reminds medical practitioners to be vigilant toward susceptible patients. The near real-time surveillance can help decision makers evaluate their policy on a timely basis."
https://openalex.org/W3187432924,"Background and aim Both breastfeeding and the use of human milk are strategies that provide better conformation to health throughout an individual’s life and bring countless short- and long- term benefits, which are well established in the scientific literature. For at-risk newborns (NBs), these strategies are crucial interventions to enable neonatal survival with better quality of life due to the distinctive and complex composition of human milk, which serves as personalized food-medicine-protection. However, there is limited knowledge about breastfeeding practices in high-risk NBs. The aim was to estimate the duration of EBF and to investigate the effect of risk at birth on EBF discontinuity in the first six months of life’. Methods This cohort study included 1,003 NBs from a high-risk referral center, followed up from birth to the sixth month of life, between 2017 and 2018. Correspondence and cluster analysis was used to identify neonatal risk clusters as the main exposure. The object of interest was the time until EBF discontinuity. The Kaplan-Meier methods and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Results The prevalence and median duration of EBF decreased proportionally in the three groups. The multiple model revealed a gradient in EBF discontinuity, which was 40% higher in risk group 1 and 111% higher in risk group 2 compared to healthy full-term NBs. Additionally, EBF during hospitalization predicted a longer median duration of this practice for high-risk NBs. Conclusion This study confirms a high proportion of high-risk NBs who have EBF discontinued before six months of life. The risk of EBF discontinuity is higher in risk groups, with a gradual effect even when adjusted by several factors. Effective interventions are needed to promote, protect, and support breastfeeding in different profiles of risk-at-birth groups."
https://openalex.org/W3189135819,"References are employed in most academic research papers to give credits and to reflect scholarliness. With the upsurge in academic publications in recent decades, we are curious to know how the number of references cited per research article has changed across different disciplines over that time. The results of our study showed significant linear growth in reference density in eight disciplinary categories between 1980 and 2019 indexed in Web of Science. It appears that reference saturation is not yet in sight. Overall, the general increase in the number of publications and the advanced accessibility of the Internet and digitized documents may have promoted the growth in references in certain fields. However, the seemingly runaway tendency should be well appreciated and objectively assessed. We suggest that authors focus on their research itself rather than on political considerations during the process of writing, especially the selection of important references to cite."
https://openalex.org/W3189998572,"Abstract Leukemia patients bearing t(6;11)(q27;q23) translocations can be divided in two subgroups: those with breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region of MLL (introns 9–10; associated mainly with AML M1/4/5), and others with breakpoints in the minor breakpoint cluster region (introns 21–23), associated with T-ALL. We cloned all four of the resulting fusion genes ( MLL-AF6 , AF6-MLL , exMLL-AF6 , AF6-shMLL ) and subsequently transfected them to generate stable cell culture models. Their molecular function was tested by inducing gene expression for 48 h in a Doxycycline-dependent fashion. Here, we present our results upon differential gene expression (DGE) that were obtained by the “Massive Analyses of cDNA Ends” (MACE-Seq) technology, an established 3′-end based RNA-Seq method. Our results indicate that the PHD/BD domain, present in the AF6-MLL and the exMLL-AF6 fusion protein, is responsible for chromatin activation in a genome-wide fashion. This led to strong deregulation of transcriptional processes involving protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, non-annotated genes, and RNA genes, e.g., LincRNAs and microRNAs, respectively. While cooperation between the MLL-AF6 and AF6-MLL fusion proteins appears to be required for the above-mentioned effects, exMLL-AF6 is able to cause similar effects on its own. The exMLL-AF6/AF6-shMLL co-expressing cell line displayed the induction of a myeloid-specific and a T-cell specific gene signature, which may explain the T-ALL disease phenotype observed in patients with such breakpoints. This again demonstrated that MLL fusion proteins are instructive and allow to study their pathomolecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3190301460,"As human pressures on the environment continue to spread and intensify, effective conservation interventions are direly needed to prevent threats, reduce conflicts, and recover populations and landscapes in a liaison between science and conservation. It is practically important to discriminate between true and false (or misperceived) effectiveness of interventions as false perceptions may shape a wrong conservation agenda and lead to inappropriate decisions and management actions. This study used the false positive risk (FPR) to estimate the rates of misperceived effectiveness of electric fences (overstated if reported as effective but actually ineffective based on FPR; understated otherwise), explain their causes and propose recommendations on how to improve the representation of true effectiveness. Electric fences are widely applied to reduce damage to fenced assets, such as livestock and beehives, or increase survival of fenced populations. The analysis of 109 cases from 50 publications has shown that the effectiveness of electric fences was overstated in at least one-third of cases, from 31.8% at FPR = 0.2 (20% risk) to 51.1% at FPR = 0.05 (5% risk, true effectiveness). In contrast, understatement reduced from 23.8% to 9.5% at these thresholds of FPR. This means that truly effective applications of electric fences were only 48.9% of all cases reported as effective, but truly ineffective cases were 90.5%, implying that the effectiveness of electric fences was heavily overstated. The main reasons of this bias were the lack of statistical testing or improper reporting of test results (63.3% of cases) and interpretation of marginally significant results (p < 0.05, p < 0.1 and p around 0.05) as indicators of effectiveness (10.1%). In conclusion, FPR is an important tool for estimating true effectiveness of conservation interventions and its application is highly recommended to disentangle true and false effectiveness for planning appropriate conservation actions. Researchers are encouraged to calculate FPR, publish its constituent statistics (especially treatment and control sample sizes) and explicitly provide test results with p values. It is suggested to call the effectiveness ""true"" if FPR < 0.05, ""suggestive"" if 0.05 ≤ FPR < 0.2 and ""false"" if FPR ≥ 0.2."
https://openalex.org/W3191560859,"Feature selection is an important task in big data analysis and information retrieval processing. It reduces the number of features by removing noise, extraneous data. In this paper, one feature subset selection algorithm based on damping oscillation theory and support vector machine classifier is proposed. This algorithm is called the Maximum Kendall coefficient Maximum Euclidean Distance Improved Gray Wolf Optimization algorithm (MKMDIGWO). In MKMDIGWO, first, a filter model based on Kendall coefficient and Euclidean distance is proposed, which is used to measure the correlation and redundancy of the candidate feature subset. Second, the wrapper model is an improved grey wolf optimization algorithm, in which its position update formula has been improved in order to achieve optimal results. Third, the filter model and the wrapper model are dynamically adjusted by the damping oscillation theory to achieve the effect of finding an optimal feature subset. Therefore, MKMDIGWO achieves both the efficiency of the filter model and the high precision of the wrapper model. Experimental results on five UCI public data sets and two microarray data sets have demonstrated the higher classification accuracy of the MKMDIGWO algorithm than that of other four state-of-the-art algorithms. The maximum ACC value of the MKMDIGWO algorithm is at least 0.5% higher than other algorithms on 10 data sets."
https://openalex.org/W3192320297,"A significant number of health care professionals subjected to high-risk situations have been infected by Covid-19 due to the lack of adequate protection equipment or the deficient safety margins that these present. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of a personal peripheral sealing device (PSD) on surgical face masks (SM) allows them to achieve double mask properties, by providing two-way protection to professionals or users. The proposed device is a thermoplastic resin ring composed of a reusable and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) designed to be used in a healthcare setting. Since it is a thermoplastic device, it can be molded and adapted to each individual, becoming personalized and ensuring a correct adjustment to the user’s face. First, a qualitative fit test was performed using a saccharin solution (SS) to evaluate respiratory protective equipment in recruited professionals exposed to high-risk situations of infection by Covid-19. Individuals were divided into an intervention group, who used SM with the PSD, and a control group, who used SM without the PSD. In addition, a quantitative inward air leakage fit test was performed using a 2% sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol in a sealed cabinet with probes sensitive to this substance, in order to validate the SM with the PSD as a Face Filtering Mask (FFP). Only 5% of the individuals who performed the qualitative fit test with the PSD perceived the sweet taste of the SS, while 100% of the individuals who performed the test without the PSD sensed it ( p = 0.0001). In the quantitative fit test, the percentage of air leakage of 2% NaCl aerosol into the SM with the PSD was 6.5%, achieving the same range of air leakage as a FFP mask. Thus, the use of a personalized PLA thermoplastic PSD, together with an inexpensive and widely available SM, could have a significant impact in terms of preventive safety by providing bi-directional protection to its user."

https://openalex.org/W3188736242,"“Well, at least you have permanent job security,” my aunt casually remarked last summer, referring to my role in the federal government's COVID-19 response. I shuddered. Little did she know I had just learned the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would not be renewing my annual contract. In my 12 years at NIH, job security had never been a priority; instead, I prized independence. But now, new motherhood followed by the pandemic seemed to be sinking my career, and I had to find a new path.



> “I was in danger of repeating a past mistake of quitting prematurely.” 

I had waited to have a baby until my career was well established, thinking that would help buffer me from some of the challenges I knew scientist mothers face, but I still struggled. When my son was born in 2018, I had no paid parental leave (U.S. government workers were finally granted paid parental leave in October 2020), and my husband got just 2 weeks from his small company. I could telework from home for the baby's first months, and I appreciated the flexibility at first. But it ended up being the worst of all worlds. I had neither full-time leave to adjust to motherhood nor a presence in the office to sway decisions pertaining to my work.

When I returned to the office, my supervisor repeatedly warned that I was on thin ice. I acknowledged that adjusting to being a working mom was a steep learning curve, but I was exhausted trying to manage all my obligations and didn't know what I could do differently. When it came time to renew my annual contract, my supervisor said he was inclined not to sign it. I cried and convinced him to renew me for one more year. But 3 months later, the pandemic hit and even more of my time was devoted to caring for my son. The next time around, my supervisor made good on his threat.

I was gutted. My virtual going away party felt more like a funeral. But then my son burst into the living room, triumphantly clutching his ukulele and filling the space with his light. I realized I was prepared to do anything to safeguard my family—including switching to a more secure, family-friendly career path.

I began to speak with colleagues in science policy and communication about alternatives. But when I gathered a group of trusted women in my field for a videochat, they insisted I could stay in research. All I needed was a crash course in survival as a woman and mother in science.

For months we met weekly to postmortem the nonscientific reasons my job fell apart and give me confidence to find a new one. I was surprised to learn that the setbacks I had faced were not unusual for women scientists. My colleagues also pointed out how my own gender biases were crippling my job search. My husband and I were determined to both be highly involved parents. Still, I was rejecting positions with longer hours or commutes, fearing they might interfere with my self-imposed expectations for my role as a mother rather than giving myself credit for securing my family financially while my husband launched a new company.

I also realized I was in danger of repeating a past mistake of quitting prematurely instead of giving myself time to adapt. Twenty years ago, I was a promising high school distance runner, with a boyish frame that helped me capture title after title. But during puberty I temporarily got fleshier and slower. Dieting and intense workouts only accelerated burnout until I gave up and quit, feeling broken. Years later, I dusted myself off and began trail running in the mountains. When I finally joined the college track team, I raced faster than ever and proved I did not need to be a flat-bodied pixie, I just needed time and space for my changing body to adjust. I have not stopped racing since.

I've learned, twice now, to keep lacing up. The pandemic was my tipping point as a working mom, but I survived by reaching out to savvier women who gave me perspective. I've now secured a better position at another branch of NIH that maintains my research independence while offering greater job security. This fall I'll be heading to my new office just as my toddler begins his first day of preschool. Other kids will surely push him down and snatch his toys. But I'll let him know the same thing happens to his mom, and we dust off, redirect, and embark on new adventures together."
