https://openalex.org/W3034168389,"There is an urgent need to better understand the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has infected more than three million people worldwide1. Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease and 5% of patients require intensive care2. Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines3,4 that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes5,6, lymphopenia7,8 and T cell exhaustion9,10. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, we provide a cell atlas of the peripheral immune response to severe COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis identifies changes in peripheral immune cells in seven hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including HLA class II downregulation, a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature and low pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in monocytes and lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3026265675,"COVID-19 has spread worldwide since 2019 and is now a severe threat to public health. We previously identified the causative agent as a novel SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the entry receptor. Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues. Last, we showed that pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could protect mice from severe pneumonia. Our results show that the hACE2 mouse would be a valuable tool for testing potential vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3034077561,"In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid deposits along the brain vasculature lead to a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which impairs blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and accelerates cognitive degeneration. Apolipoprotein (APOE4) is the strongest risk factor for CAA, yet the mechanisms underlying this genetic susceptibility are unknown. Here we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell-based three-dimensional model that recapitulates anatomical and physiological properties of the human BBB in vitro. Similarly to CAA, our in vitro BBB displayed significantly more amyloid accumulation in APOE4 compared to APOE3. Combinatorial experiments revealed that dysregulation of calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling and APOE in pericyte-like mural cells induces APOE4-associated CAA pathology. In the human brain, APOE and NFAT are selectively dysregulated in pericytes of APOE4 carriers, and inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling reduces APOE4-associated CAA pathology in vitro and in vivo. Our study reveals the role of pericytes in APOE4-mediated CAA and highlights calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a therapeutic target in CAA and Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W3034125968,"Although disinfection is key to infection control, the colonization patterns and resistomes of hospital-environment microbes remain underexplored. We report the first extensive genomic characterization of microbiomes, pathogens and antibiotic resistance cassettes in a tertiary-care hospital, from repeated sampling (up to 1.5 years apart) of 179 sites associated with 45 beds. Deep shotgun metagenomics unveiled distinct ecological niches of microbes and antibiotic resistance genes characterized by biofilm-forming and human-microbiome-influenced environments with corresponding patterns of spatiotemporal divergence. Quasi-metagenomics with nanopore sequencing provided thousands of high-contiguity genomes, phage and plasmid sequences (>60% novel), enabling characterization of resistome and mobilome diversity and dynamic architectures in hospital environments. Phylogenetics identified multidrug-resistant strains as being widely distributed and stably colonizing across sites. Comparisons with clinical isolates indicated that such microbes can persist in hospitals for extended periods (>8 years), to opportunistically infect patients. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing antibiotic resistance reservoirs in hospitals and establish the feasibility of systematic surveys to target resources for preventing infections."
https://openalex.org/W3033085681,"A major challenge for miniature bioelectronics is wireless power delivery deep inside the body. Electromagnetic or ultrasound waves suffer from absorption and impedance mismatches at biological interfaces. On the other hand, magnetic fields do not suffer these losses, which has led to magnetically powered bioelectronic implants based on induction or magnetothermal effects. However, these approaches have yet to produce a miniature stimulator that operates at clinically relevant high frequencies. Here, we show that an alternative wireless power method based on magnetoelectric (ME) materials enables miniature magnetically powered neural stimulators that operate up to clinically relevant frequencies in excess of 100 Hz. We demonstrate that wireless ME stimulators provide therapeutic deep brain stimulation in a freely moving rodent model for Parkinson's disease and that these devices can be miniaturized to millimeter-scale and fully implanted. These results suggest that ME materials are an excellent candidate to enable miniature bioelectronics for clinical and research applications."
https://openalex.org/W3033434116,"Three-dimensional organization of the genome is important for transcriptional regulation1-7. In mammals, CTCF and the cohesin complex create submegabase structures with elevated internal chromatin contact frequencies, called topologically associating domains (TADs)8-12. Although TADs can contribute to transcriptional regulation, ablation of TAD organization by disrupting CTCF or the cohesin complex causes modest gene expression changes13-16. In contrast, CTCF is required for cell cycle regulation17, embryonic development and formation of various adult cell types18. To uncouple the role of CTCF in cell-state transitions and cell proliferation, we studied the effect of CTCF depletion during the conversion of human leukemic B cells into macrophages with minimal cell division. CTCF depletion disrupts TAD organization but not cell transdifferentiation. In contrast, CTCF depletion in induced macrophages impairs the full-blown upregulation of inflammatory genes after exposure to endotoxin. Our results demonstrate that CTCF-dependent genome topology is not strictly required for a functional cell-fate conversion but facilitates a rapid and efficient response to an external stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3033079960,"The supplementary motor area (SMA) is believed to contribute to higher order aspects of motor control. We considered a key higher order role: tracking progress throughout an action. We propose that doing so requires population activity to display low ""trajectory divergence"": situations with different future motor outputs should be distinct, even when present motor output is identical. We examined neural activity in SMA and primary motor cortex (M1) as monkeys cycled various distances through a virtual environment. SMA exhibited multiple response features that were absent in M1. At the single-neuron level, these included ramping firing rates and cycle-specific responses. At the population level, they included a helical population-trajectory geometry with shifts in the occupied subspace as movement unfolded. These diverse features all served to reduce trajectory divergence, which was much lower in SMA versus M1. Analogous population-trajectory geometry, also with low divergence, naturally arose in networks trained to internally guide multi-cycle movement."

https://openalex.org/W3033998787,"Retrieval of everyday experiences is fundamental for informing our future decisions. The fine-grained neurophysiological mechanisms that support such memory retrieval are largely unknown. We studied participants who first experienced, without repetition, unique multicomponent 40–80-s episodes. One day later, they engaged in cued retrieval of these episodes while undergoing magnetoencephalography. By decoding individual episode elements, we found that trial-by-trial successful retrieval was supported by the sequential replay of episode elements, with a temporal compression factor of >60. The direction of replay supporting retrieval, either backward or forward, depended on whether the task goal was to retrieve elements of an episode that followed or preceded, respectively, a retrieval cue. This sequential replay was weaker in very-high-performing participants, in whom instead we found evidence for simultaneous clustered reactivation. Our results demonstrate that memory-mediated decisions are supported by a rapid replay mechanism that can flexibly shift in direction in response to task goals. Wimmer et al. show that successful recall of an extended episode of experience in humans is associated with temporally compressed replay of neural patterns associated with the memory, and that the direction of replay depends on task goals."
https://openalex.org/W3033772053,"Abstract Bile acids (BAs), well-defined signaling molecules with diverse metabolic functions, play important roles in cellular processes associated with many cancers. As one of the most common BAs, deoxycholic acid (DCA) is originally synthesized in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and processed in the gut. DCA plays crucial roles in various tumors; however, functions and molecular mechanisms of DCA in gallbladder cancer (GBC) still remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed human GBC samples and found that DCA was significantly downregulated in GBC, and reduced levels of DCA was associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with GBC. DCA treatment impeded tumor progression by halting cell proliferation. DCA decreased miR-92b-3p expression in an m 6 A-dependent posttranscriptional modification manner by facilitating dissociation of METTL3 from METTL3–METTL14–WTAP complex, which increased the protein level of the phosphatase and tensin homolog, a newly identified target of miR-92b-3p, and subsequently inactivated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings revealed that DCA might function as a tumor suppressive factor in GBC at least by interfering with miR-92b-3p maturation, and suggested that DCA treatment could provide a new therapeutic strategy for GBC."
https://openalex.org/W3033104308,"Massive declines in insect biodiversity and biomass are reported from many regions and habitats. In urban areas, creation of native wildflower meadows is one option to support insects and reduce maintenance costs of urban green spaces. However, benefits for insect conservation may depend on previous land use, and the size and location of new wildflower meadows. We show effects of conversion of roadside plantings–from exotic shrubs into wildflower meadows–on (1) the abundance of 13 arthropod taxa–Opiliones, Araneae, Isopoda, Collembola, Orthoptera, Aphidoidea, Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Nematocera, Brachycera, Apocrita, Formicidae–and (2) changes in maintenance costs. We assessed the influence of vegetation type (meadow vs. woody), meadow age, size, location (distance to city boundary), and mowing regime. We found many, but not all, arthropod taxa profiting from meadows in terms of arthropod activity abundance in pitfall traps and arthropod density in standardized suction samples. Arthropod number in meadows was 212% higher in pitfall traps and 260% higher in suction samples compared to woody vegetation. The increased arthropod number in meadows was independent of the size and isolation of green spaces for most taxa. However, mowing regime strongly affected several arthropod taxa, with an increase of 63% of total arthropod density in unmown compared to mown meadow spots. Costs of green space maintenance were fivefold lower for meadows than for woody vegetation. Our study shows that (1) many different arthropod taxa occur in roadside vegetation in urban areas, (2) replacement of exotic woody vegetation by native wildflower meadows can significantly increase arthropod abundance, especially if meadow management permits temporarily unmown areas, and (3) maintenance costs can be considerably reduced by converting woody plantings into wildflower meadows. Considering many groups of arthropods, our study provides new insights into possible measures to support arthropods in urban environments."

https://openalex.org/W3032949630,"In proteins where conformational changes are functionally important, the number of accessible states and their dynamics are often difficult to establish. Here we describe a novel 19F-NMR spectroscopy approach to probe dynamics of large membrane proteins. We labeled a glutamate transporter homolog with a 19F probe via cysteine chemistry and with a Ni2+ ion via chelation by a di-histidine motif. We used distance-dependent enhancement of the longitudinal relaxation of 19F nuclei by the paramagnetic metal to assign the observed resonances. We identified one inward- and two outward-facing states of the transporter, in which the substrate-binding site is near the extracellular and intracellular solutions, respectively. We then resolved the structure of the unanticipated second outward-facing state by cryo-EM. Finally, we showed that the rates of the conformational exchange are accessible from measurements of the metal-enhanced longitudinal relaxation of 19F nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W3033787260,"Salient experiences are often relived in the mind. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that such experiences drive activity patterns in visual association cortex that are subsequently reactivated during quiet waking. Nevertheless, the circuit-level consequences of such reactivations remain unclear. Here, we imaged hundreds of neurons in visual association cortex across days as mice learned a visual discrimination task. Distinct patterns of neurons were activated by different visual cues. These same patterns were subsequently reactivated during quiet waking in darkness, with higher reactivation rates during early learning and for food-predicting versus neutral cues. Reactivations involving ensembles of neurons encoding both the food cue and the reward predicted strengthening of next-day functional connectivity of participating neurons, while the converse was observed for reactivations involving ensembles encoding only the food cue. We propose that task-relevant neurons strengthen while task-irrelevant neurons weaken their dialog with the network via participation in distinct flavors of reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W3033356203,"Mortality statistics are traditionally used to quantify the burden of disease and to determine the relative importance of the various causes of death. Some of the most frequently used indices to quantify the burden of disease are the years of potential life lost (YPLL) and years of potential productive life lost (YPPLL). These two measures reflect the mortality trends in younger age groups and they provide a more accurate picture of premature mortality. This study was carried out to determine YPLL, YPPLL and cost of productivity lost (CPL) due to premature mortality caused by selected causes of deaths in Tanzania.Malaria, respiratory diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cancers and injuries were selected for this analysis. The number of deaths by sex and age groups were obtained from hospital death registers and ICD-10 reporting forms in 39 public hospitals in Tanzania, covering a period of 2006-2015. The life expectancy method and human capital approach were used to estimate the YPLL, YPPLL and CPL due to premature mortality. During 2006-2015, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, HIV+tuberculosis, cancer and injury were responsible for a total of 96,834 hospital deaths, of which 46.4% (n = 57,508) were among individuals in the productive age groups (15-64 years). The reported deaths contributed to 2,850,928 YPLL (female = 1,326,724; male = 1,524,205) with an average of 29 years per death. The average YPLL among females (32) was higher than among males (28). Malaria (YPLL = 38 per death) accounted for over one-third (35%) of the total YPLL. There was a significant increase in YPLL due to the selected underlying causes of death over the 10-year period. Deaths from the selected causes resulted into 1,207,499 YPPLL (average = 21 per death). Overall, HIV/AIDS contributed to the highest YPPLL (323,704), followed by malaria (243,490) and injuries (196,505). While there was a general decrease in YPPLL due to malaria, there was an increase of YPPLL due to HIV/AIDS, respiratory diseases, cancer and injuries during the 10-year period. The total CPL due to the six diseases was US$ 148,430,009 for 10 years. The overall CPL was higher among males than females by 29.1%. Over half (58%) of the losses were due to deaths among males. HIV/AIDS accounted for the largest (29.2%) CPL followed by malaria (17.8%) and respiratory diseases (14.6%). The CPL increased from US$11.4 million in 2006 to US$17.9 million in 2016.The YPLL, YPPLL and CPL due to premature death associated with the six diseases in Tanzania are substantially high. While malaria accounted for highest YPLL, HIV/AIDS accounted for highest YPPLL and CPL. The overall CPL was higher among males than among females. Setting resource allocation priorities to malaria, HIV/AIDS and respiratory diseases that are responsible for the majority of premature deaths could potentially reduce the costs of productivity loss in Tanzania."
https://openalex.org/W3034081635,"The ocular surface microbiome of veterinary species has not been thoroughly characterized using molecular-based techniques, such as next generation sequencing (NGS), as the vast majority of studies have utilized traditional culture-based techniques. To date, there is one pilot study evaluating the ocular surface of healthy dogs using NGS. Furthermore, alterations in the ocular surface microbiome over time and after topical antibiotic treatment are unknown. The objectives of this study were to describe the bacterial composition of the ocular surface microbiome in clinically normal dogs, and to determine if microbial community changes occur over time or following topical antibiotic therapy. Topical neomycin-polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment was applied to one eye each of 13 adult dogs three times daily for seven days, while contralateral eyes served as untreated controls. The inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes was sampled via swabbing at baseline prior to antibiotic therapy (day 0), after 1 week of treatment (day 7), and 4 weeks after discontinuing treatment (day 35). Genomic DNA was extracted from the conjunctival swabs and primers targeting the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to generate amplicon libraries, which were then sequenced on an Illumina platform. Data were analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Molecular Ecology (QIIME 2.0). At baseline, the most relatively abundant phyla sequenced were Proteobacteria (49.7%), Actinobacteria (25.5%), Firmicutes (12%), Bacteroidetes (7.5%), and Fusobacteria (1.4%). The most common families detected were Pseudomonadaceae (13.2%), Micrococcaceae (12%), Pasteurellaceae (6.9%), Microbacteriaceae (5.2%), Enterobacteriaceae (3.9%), Neisseriaceae (3.5%), and Corynebacteriaceae (3.3%). Alpha and beta diversity measurements did not differ in both control and treatment eyes over time. This report examines the temporal stability of the canine ocular surface microbiome. The major bacterial taxa on the canine ocular surface remained consistent over time and following topical antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3033256853,"Background Caesarean section (C-section) is a major obstetric life-saving intervention for the prevention of pregnancy and childbirth related complications. Globally C-section is increasing, as well as in Bangladesh. This study identifies the prevalence of C-section and socio-economic and health care seeking related determinants of C-section among women living in hard-to-reach (HtR) areas in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire between August and December 2017 at four distinct types of HtR areas of Bangladesh, namely coastal, hilly, haor (wetland), and char areas (shallow land-mass rising out of a river). Total 2,768 women of 15–49 years of age and who had delivery within one year prior to data collection were interviewed. For the analysis of determinants of C- section, the explanatory variables were maternal age, educational status of women and their husbands, women’s religion, employment status and access to mobile phone, wealth index of the household, distance to the nearest health facility from the household, the number of ANC visits and presence of complications during pregnancy and the last childbirth. Logistic regression model was run among 850 women, who had facility delivery. Variables found significantly associated with the outcome (C-section) in bivariate analysis were included in the multivariable logistic model. A p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant in the analyses. Results Of the 2,768 women included in the study, 13% had C-sections. The mean (±SD) age of respondents was 25.4 (± 0.1) years. The adjusted prevalence of C-section was 13.1 times higher among women who had their delivery in private facilities than women who delivered in public facilities (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR: 13.1; 95% CI 8.6–19.9; p-value: <0.001). Women from haor area and coastal area had 4.7 times (AOR: 4.7; 95% CI 2.4–9.4; p value: <0.001) and 6.8 times (AOR: 6.8; 95% CI 3.6–12.8; p value: <0.001) more chance of having C-section, respectively, than women living in char area. Among women who reported complications during the last childbirth, the AOR of C-section was 3.6 times higher than those who did not report any complication (AOR: 3.6; 95% CI 2.4–5.4; p value: <0.001). Conclusions The study identifies that the prevalence of C-sections in four HtR areas of Bangladesh in substantially below the national average, although, the prevalence was higher in coastal areas than three other HtR regions. Both public and private health services for C-section should be made available and accessible in remote HtR areas for women with pregnancy complications. Establishment of an accreditation system for regulating private hospitals are needed to ensure rational use of the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3033668619,"Hypothermic storage of boar semen provides the possibility to omit antibiotics from semen extenders so long as sperm quality is maintained and bacterial growth prevented. The objective of this study was to determine an optimal cooling-rate frame for boar semen preserved at 5°C in an antibiotic-free extender. Semen from eight boars extended in AndroStar® Premium was cooled from 30°C to 5°C using seven different cooling rates, ranging initially from 0.01 to 0.36°C min–1 and reaching 5°C between 2 h and 24 h after dilution. Sperm motility, membrane integrity, membrane fluidity, mitochondrial membrane potential and the response to the capacitation stimulus bicarbonate remained at a high level for 144 h at 5°C when the semen was initially cooled in a cooling-rate frame ranging from 0.01 to 0.09°C min‑1 in the temperature zone from 30 to 25°C, followed by 0.02 to 0.06°C min–1 to 10°C and 0.01 to 0.02°C min‑1 to the final storage temperature. A cooling rate of 0.07°C min–1 in the temperature zone from 30 to 10°C led to a reduced response to bicarbonate (P < 0.01) and fast cooling to 5°C within 1 h with a cooling rate of 0.31°C min–1 resulted in lower values (P > 0.05) of all sperm parameters. In a further experiment, slow cooling with a holding time of 6 h at 22°C induced after 6 h storage a temporary increase in Escherichia coli of 0.5 × 103 to 2.4 × 103 CFU mL–1 in the sperm-free inoculated extender. Overall, the load of mesophilic bacteria in the stored semen was below 6 × 103 CFU mL–1, a level that is not regarded as critical for sperm quality. In conclusion, appropriate cooling protocols were established for the antibiotic-free storage of boar semen at 5°C, allowing the application of hypothermic preservation in research and in artificial insemination."

Although adult epidermis can suppress the expansion of individual mutant clones, the mechanisms behind tolerance to oncogene activation across broader regions of tissue are unclear. Here, we uncover a dynamic translational mechanism that coordinates oncogenic HRAS-induced hyperproliferation with loss of progenitor self-renewal to restrain aberrant growth and tumorigenesis. We identify translation initiator eIF2B5 as a central co-regulator of HRAS proliferation and cell fate choice. By coupling in vivo ribosome profiling with genetic screening, we provide direct evidence that oncogene-induced loss of progenitor self-renewal is driven by eIF2B5-mediated translation of ubiquitination genes. Ubiquitin ligase FBXO32 specifically inhibits epidermal renewal without affecting overall proliferation, thus restraining HRAS-driven tumorigenesis while maintaining normal tissue growth. Thus, oncogene-driven translation is not necessarily inherently tumor promoting but instead can manage widespread oncogenic stress by steering progenitor fate to prolong normal tissue growth.

Thus, oncogene-driven translation is not necessarily inherently tumor promoting but instead can manage widespread oncogenic stress by steering progenitor fate to prolong normal tissue growth. The skin possesses remarkable ability to tolerate genetic and structural abnormalities. Surprisingly, this extends to mutations in known cancer-driving genes, which are frequently found in physiologically normal human skin (Martincorena et al., 2015Martincorena I. Roshan A. Gerstung M. Ellis P. Van Loo P. McLaren S. Wedge D.C. Fullam A. Alexandrov L.B. Tubio J.M. et al.Tumor evolution. High burden and pervasive positive selection of somatic mutations in normal human skin.Science. 2015; 348: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tissue has adaptive mechanisms to restrain the expansion of mutant cell populations and protect against progression to cancer. We recently observed through direct intravital imaging that the adult epidermis can entirely resolve abnormal growth of mutant cell clones following activation of Hras1 or β-catenin (Brown et al., 2017Brown S. Pineda C.M. Xin T. Boucher J. Suozzi K.C. Park S. Matte-Martone C. Gonzalez D.G. Rytlewski J. Beronja S. Greco V. Correction of aberrant growth preserves tissue homeostasis.Nature. 2017; 548: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We further uncovered that oncogenic Pik3ca epidermal clones can be completely blocked from expansion and eventually expelled from the adult tissue through loss of growth-sustaining progenitor cells (Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, these studies only examined the epidermis’ growth-restrictive potential in the context of individual clones arising from a single cell. The mechanisms behind tissue tolerance to widespread oncogene activation, as seen in oncogene-driven congenital overgrowth disorders (Keppler-Noreuil et al., 2016Keppler-Noreuil K.M. Parker V.E.R.

Wright N.A. Graham T.A. An evolutionary perspective on field cancerization.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), remain unexplored. Tissues can employ various cell-autonomous strategies to block the proliferation of single clones with somatic mutations, including apoptosis and senescence (Braig et al., 2005Braig M. Lee S. Loddenkemper C. Rudolph C. Peters A.H.F.M. Schlegelberger B. Stein H. Dörken B. Jenuwein T. Schmitt C.A.

USA. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Neighboring wild-type (WT) cells can also facilitate oncogene tolerance through non-cell-autonomous events that restrict expansion or displace mutant clones from the tissue (Brown et al., 2017Brown S. Pineda C.M. Xin T. Boucher J. Suozzi K.C. Park S. Matte-Martone C. Gonzalez D.G. Rytlewski J. Beronja S. Greco V.

Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An illustrative case is the recent finding that WT cells surrounding mutant Pik3ca clones maintain pro-renewal JNK signaling, allowing WT cells to outcompete and expel highly differentiating mutant clones (Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism for oncogene tolerance is not feasible when a large proportion of the tissue carries the same lesion, abolishing the growth-suppressive potential of WT neighbors. Furthermore, because the epidermis requires frequent cell turnover for its development and function (Fuchs and Raghavan, 2002Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Getting under the skin of epidermal morphogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, van der Flier and Clevers, 2009van der Flier L.G. Clevers H. Stem cells, self-renewal, and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), extensive elimination of mutant cells or a complete proliferation block would significantly disrupt tissue architecture and integrity. How oncogenic epidermis preserves the rapid physiological growth needed for tissue development while restraining pathological overgrowth remains a fundamental question. The embryonic murine interfollicular epidermis (IFE) is an ideal system to explore oncogene-induced stem cell behaviors in the context of rapid tissue growth (Beronja et al., 2010Beronja S.

Pasolli H.A. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote Notch-dependent epidermal differentiation.Nature. 2011; 470: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Its well-defined structure features frequently proliferating basal progenitor cells, which have the unique ability to self-renew, and their suprabasal differentiated progeny, which are post-mitotic and provide the form and function of skin (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Therefore, the IFE basal progenitors, which are thought to undergo stochastic fate decisions to self-renew or differentiate, are the key regulators of epidermal growth and maintenance. Here, we report that broad activation of oncogenic HrasG12V during epidermal development induces a translational landscape that inhibits progenitor cell renewal to contain tissue overgrowth. We uncover translation initiation factor eIF2B5 as a central regulator of HrasG12V growth and coordinator of progenitor cell response to oncogene-induced hyperproliferation. This coordination is achieved through eIF2B5-mediated translation of distinct proliferation and renewal regulators. Notably, although previous studies have indirectly linked translation rate with cell fate choice (Blanco et al., 2016Blanco S. Bandiera R. Popis M. Hussain S. Lombard P. Aleksic J. Sajini A. Tanna H.

Haematopoietic stem cells require a highly regulated protein synthesis rate.Nature. 2014; 509: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), our analysis provides direct functional evidence that oncogene-driven renewal inhibition operates through eIF2B5-mediated translation of ubiquitination genes, resulting in striking restriction of HRAS tumorigenesis. Our study therefore uncovers a dynamic translational mechanism by which the epidermis manages widespread oncogenic stress to prolong normal tissue growth. To probe mechanisms that restrain aberrant growth during widespread oncogene activation, we employed a conditional knockin mouse that activates oncogenic HrasG12V at physiological levels upon transduction with lentivirus containing Cre recombinase (LV-Cre) (Figures S1A and S1B; Chen et al., 2009Chen X. Mitsutake N. LaPerle K. Akeno N. Zanzonico P. Longo V.A. Mitsutake S. Kimura E.T. Geiger H. Santos E. et al.Endogenous expression of Hras(G12V) induces developmental defects and neoplasms with copy number imbalances of the oncogene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 7979-7984Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used an in utero lentiviral injection method (Beronja et al., 2010Beronja S. Livshits G. Williams S. Fuchs E.

Med. 2010; 16: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to target the ectoderm of embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) embryos with LV-Cre, which resulted in broad epidermal transduction reported by the expression of mGFP (Rosa26mT/mG Cre reporter; Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar) or YFP (Rosa26YFP/YFP Cre reporter; Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure S1C). We first assessed progenitor cell proliferation and found that epidermal HrasG12V activation induced an ∼2-fold increase in IFE basal cell proliferation rate (Figure 1A). During normal development, progenitor proliferation is accompanied by a high probability of self-renewal (renewal probability = 0.7), which sustains physiological epidermal expansion (Beronja et al., 2013Beronja S. Janki P. Heller E. Lien W.H. Keyes B.E. Oshimori N. Fuchs E. RNAi screens in mice identify physiological regulators of oncogenic growth.Nature. 2013; 501: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore expected that the elevated proliferation rate in HrasG12V basal progenitors would have a profound effect on epidermal growth. We modeled theoretical tissue expansion from a single ectodermal cell at E9.5–E18.5, using observed proliferation rates in HrasG12V and WT basal cells and a renewal probability = 0.7 following epidermal stratification at E15.5 (Sotiropoulou and Blanpain, 2012Sotiropoulou P.A. Blanpain C. Development and homeostasis of the skin epidermis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a008383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). Our model successfully predicted the experimentally observed tissue expansion in WT epidermis (Beronja et al., 2013Beronja S. Janki P. Heller E. Lien W.H. Keyes B.E. Oshimori N. Fuchs E. RNAi screens in mice identify physiological regulators of oncogenic growth.Nature. 2013; 501: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and further suggested that HrasG12V epidermis would undergo 25-fold the growth seen in WT epidermis over the same time frame. However, this prediction was not compatible with the limited tissue expansion observed in E18.5 HrasG12V epidermis (Figures S1D and S1E). Quantification of clonal expansion from E9.5 to E18.5 revealed that HrasG12V expression induces only ∼4-fold the growth seen in WT epidermis (Figures 1B and S1F). Therefore, increased proliferation of HrasG12V epidermis appears to be counteracted by a potent growth-suppressive mechanism. Although apoptosis and senescence occur at very low rates and are not significant factors in limiting epidermal growth (Beronja et al., 2013Beronja S. Janki P. Heller E. Lien W.H. Keyes B.E. Oshimori N. Fuchs E. RNAi screens in mice identify physiological regulators of oncogenic growth.Nature. 2013; 501: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we recently demonstrated that strong inhibition of progenitor cell renewal can reduce the fitness of mutant clones relative to WT neighbors, resulting in their complete ablation from the epidermis (Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Though this clonal expulsion mechanism cannot be employed during widespread oncogene activation, we hypothesized that moderate suppression of basal progenitor renewal may offset hyperproliferation to limit expansion of HrasG12V epidermis. To test the rate of progenitor renewal following HrasG12V activation, we used our 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU)/bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase incorporation assay (Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to distinctly mark replicating progenitors and score the fate of their progeny after cell division. We found a significant reduction in the probability of IFE progenitor cell renewal in broadly activated HrasG12V epidermis (Figure 1C). Importantly, although reduced, HrasG12V renewal probability remained at 0.5, which allows for tissue maintenance while limiting excess growth. We hypothesized that a switch from high renewal and low proliferation in WT tissue to low renewal and high proliferation in HrasG12V epidermis is indicative of a molecular mechanism that can coordinate stem cell response to widespread oncogene activation and contribute to the fundamental plasticity of epidermal development. Intriguingly, protein synthesis has recently been implicated in regulating both stem cell proliferation and fate choice (Buszczak et al., 2014Buszczak M. Signer R.A.J. Morrison S.J. Cellular differences in protein synthesis regulate tissue homeostasis.Cell. 2014; 159: 242-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may be a critical coordinator of the epidermal response to oncogene activation. To probe translation’s potential role in oncogene tolerance, we first examined the effect of HrasG12V activation on progenitor cell translation rate. We employed the SUnSET method, where in vivo protein synthesis is quantified by detecting puromycin incorporation into nascent peptides (Schmidt et al., 2009Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), which revealed an ∼2-fold increase in protein synthesis rate in HrasG12V basal cells (Figure 1D). This translation rate elevation is illustrated at the border regions containing activated HrasG12V epidermis and neighboring untransduced WT epidermis (Figure 1E). Elevated translation rate was also seen in HrasG12V primary keratinocytes cultured from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated E18.5 basal cells (Figure S1G), suggesting that HrasG12V-induced translation upregulation can occur independently of dermal signaling. We hypothesized that elevated translation rate in HrasG12V basal progenitors reflected an interactive relationship with the translation apparatus. We performed two in vivo functional screens to identify the translation machinery components that regulate HrasG12V progenitor proliferation and renewal (Figure 1F). We transduced E9.5 HrasG12V epidermis at clonal density (multiplicity of infection [MOI] < 1) with a lentivirus pool of 1,228 short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting 195 translation initiation factors, elongation factors, ribosomal proteins, tRNA synthetases, and poly(A) binding proteins (Bhat et al., 2015Bhat M.

Our screens utilized the validated principle (Ying et al., 2018Ying Z. Sandoval M. Beronja S. Oncogenic activation of PI3K induces progenitor cell differentiation to suppress epidermal growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that shRNAs targeting proliferation promoters are enriched in the non-dividing relative to dividing cell population, although shRNAs targeting renewal promoters are enriched in the suprabasal relative to basal cell population (Figure 1F). We classified genes as proliferation or renewal regulators if at least two of their shRNAs were significantly changed with consistent directionality (Beronja et al., 2013Beronja S. Janki P. Heller E. Lien W.H. Keyes B.E. Oshimori N. Fuchs E. RNAi screens in mice identify physiological regulators of oncogenic growth.Nature. 2013; 501: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We uncovered 101 translation genes as proliferation promoters (Figures 1G and 1I; Table S1), consistent with the essential role of translation in cell cycle progression (Lee et al., 2015aLee A.S.Y. Kranzusch P.J. Cate J.H.D. eIF3 targets cell-proliferation messenger RNAs for translational activation or repression.Nature. 2015; 522: 111-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Stumpf et al., 2013Stumpf C.R.

Cell. 2013; 52: 574-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, our screens identified only 15 translation genes as renewal inhibitors and 8 as renewal promoters (Figures 1H and 1I; Table S1). Notably, a significant subset of 11 genes simultaneously promoted HrasG12V progenitor proliferation and inhibited self-renewal (p < 0.05; Figure 1I). Among these dual regulators, translation initiation factor Eif2b5 was substantially altered across epithelial cancers and implicated in a congenital disorder marked by tissue-specific defects (Li et al., 2004Li W. Wang X. Van Der Knaap M.S. Proud C.G. Mutations linked to leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter impair the function of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B complex in diverse ways.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3295-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Scali et al., 2006Scali O. Di Perri C. Federico A.

Signal. 2013; 6: pl1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8763) Google Scholar). We focused our downstream studies on Eif2b5 to dissect the interplay between HrasG12V activation and protein synthesis control. To elucidate how eIF2B5 regulates HrasG12V stem cell behaviors, we first assessed its role in HrasG12V-driven translation. We examined basal cell translation rate in transduced (mGFP+) epidermis (Rosa26mT/mG Cre reporter; Muzumdar et al., 2007Muzumdar M.D. Tasic B. Miyamichi K. Li L. Luo L. A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse.Genesis. 2007; 45: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar) and found that shRNA depletion of Eif2b5 (Figures S2A and S2B) rescued HrasG12V translation rate to WT levels (Figures 2A and 2B ). Interestingly, comparable Eif2b5 depletion in WT epidermis did not significantly affect translation rate, suggesting that HrasG12V epidermis has increased dependency on eIF2B5 (Figures 2A and 2B). Of note, the elevated translation rate observed in cultured HrasG12V primary keratinocytes was also dependent on eIF2B5 (Figure S2C) and was not confounded by differences in proteasome activity between genetic backgrounds (Figure S2D). Observed translational differences were not due to induction of secondary cell stress, as indicated by eIF2α phosphorylation on serine 51 (Figure S2C; Koromilas, 2015Koromilas A.E. Roles of the translation initiation factor eIF2α serine 51 phosphorylation in cancer formation and treatment.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Instead, Ser51 p-eIF2α was decreased upon Eif2b5 depletion (Figure S2C), which may act as a compensatory mechanism to rescue translation. Next, we explored whether HrasG12V-induced progenitor cell behaviors are also dependent on eIF2B5. Upon Eif2b5 depletion, HrasG12V progenitor cell proliferation rate and renewal probability were both rescued to WT levels (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, comparable Eif2b5 depletion in WT tissue did not significantly affect progenitor proliferation or renewal, suggesting that eIF2B5 has an oncogene-specific regulatory effect on stem cell behavior (Figures 2C and 2D). eIF2B5 is the catalytic subunit of the eIF2B complex, a guanine exchange factor that returns eIF2 to its active state, allowing eIF2 to form the ternary complex for translation initiation (Figure S2E; Pavitt, 2005Pavitt G.D. eIF2B, a mediator of general and gene-specific translational control.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We next tested whether HrasG12V progenitor cell behaviors were dependent on eIF2B complex activity. We treated Eif2b5-depleted HrasG12V keratinocytes with ISRIB, a small molecule that promotes eIF2B dimerization and activity (Sidrauski et al., 2013Sidrauski C. Acosta-Alvear D. Khoutorsky A. Vedantham P. Hearn B.R. Li H. Gamache K. Gallagher C.M. Ang K.K.-H. Wilson C. et al.Pharmacological brake-release of mRNA translation enhances cognitive memory.eLife. 2013; 2: e00498Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Sidrauski et al., 2015Sidrauski C. Tsai J.C. Kampmann M. Hearn B.R. Vedantham P. Jaishankar P. Sokabe M. Mendez A.S. Newton B.W. Tang E.L. et al.Pharmacological dimerization and activation of the exchange factor eIF2B antagonizes the integrated stress response.eLife. 2015; 4: e07314Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and found that ISRIB largely rescued HrasG12V translation rate (Figure 2E). We reasoned that, if eIF2B5 is regulating HrasG12V progenitor cell behavior through its canonical eIF2B complex role, ISRIB treatment should suppress Eif2b5 knockdown phenotypes by increasing eIF2B activity. Indeed, Eif2b5 depletion in HrasG12V embryos followed by ISRIB treatment of maternal mice completely restored the rapid proliferation rate and low renewal probability in HrasG12V epidermis (Figures 2F and 2G). We hypothesized that eIF2B5-dependent proliferation rate and renewal probability were able to account for the HrasG12V growth phenotype, as no difference in apoptosis was detected across any conditions (Figure S2F). HrasG12V mice displayed grossly thickened and raised skin (Figure S2G), indicative of epidermal overgrowth. Tissue cross-sections of fully transduced (YFP+) epidermis (expressing Rosa26YFP/YFP Cre reporter; Srinivas et al., 2001Srinivas S. Watanabe T. Lin C.S. William C.M. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Costantini F. Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus.BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed hyperplastic expansion in both basal progenitor (K5+) and suprabasal differentiated (K10+) layers (Figure 2H). Remarkably, Eif2b5 depletion in HrasG12V epidermis restored the smooth appearance and stratified architecture found in WT skin (Figures 2H and S2G). HrasG12V primary keratinocytes also exhibited eIF2B5-dependent growth rate elevation, further reproducing the behavior of basal cells in vivo (Figure S2H). Together, these studies establish eIF2B5, through its role in eIF2B, as a central regulator of HRAS-induced progenitor cell behaviors and tissue growth. To dissect molecular mechanisms by which eIF2B5 drives HrasG12V progenitor cell behaviors, we used in vivo ribosome profiling to identify eIF2B5-dependent translational changes in HrasG12V progenitors (Figure 3A; Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T.

We transduced E9.5 HrasG12V and WT epidermis with control shRNA or shEif2b5 B3, our most efficient shRNA targeting Eif2b5. The virus was titrated to ensure comparable transduction rate across conditions, which suppressed HrasG12V epidermal overgrowth without tissue damage (Figure S3A). E18.5 skin was enzymatically dissociated to generate a basal cell-enriched population (Figure S3B) with preserved polysomes and depleted Eif2b5 (Figures S3C and S3D). Our ribosome footprint libraries displayed expected enrichment of 28-nt reads, triplet periodicity, and alignment to coding regions (Figures S3E–S3G). Across biological replicates, our sequencing libraries were highly reproducible (Pearson r2 > 0.9; Figures S3H and S3I). To assess differences in active translation independent of transcriptional changes, we identified all genes with significantly altered translation efficiencies (Log2FC > 0.5; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.1; Xiao et al., 2016Xiao Z. Zou Q. Liu Y. Yang X. Genome-wide assessment of differential translations with ribosome profiling data.Nat.

Monitoring the pathogenic profile and antimicrobial resistance is a prerequisite for effective therapy, infection control and for strategies aimed to counter antimicrobial resistance. The pathogenic spectrum of BSIs in blood cultures was analysed, focusing on the resistance patterns of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in Aljouf region. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study analysed the culture reports of all non-duplicate blood samples collected from January 1 to December 31, 2019. Antibiograms of A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae were analysed for antibiotic resistance. The frequency and percentages of multi-drug, extensively-drug, pan-drug and carbapenem resistance were calculated. Results Of the 222 bloodstream infections, 62.2% and 36.4% were caused by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Most BSIs occurred in patients aged ≥60 years (59.5%). Among the 103 isolates of the studied Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), 47.6%, 38.8%, and 2.9% were multi-drug, extensively drug and pan-drug resistant respectively. 46% of K. pneumoniae isolates were carbapenemase producers. Resistance to gentamycin, 1st–4th generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems was observed for A. baumannii. More than 70% of E. coli isolates were resistant to 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins. Klebsiella pneumoniae presented a resistance rate of >60% to imipenems. Conclusions Gram-negative bacteria dominate BSIs, with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae most frequently detected in this region. Resistant GNB infections make it challenging to treat geriatric patients. Regional variations in antimicrobial resistance should be continually monitored."

Increased food demand, global commerce of perishable foods, and the growing threat of antibiotic resistance are driving factors elevating concern for food safety. Foodborne illness is often associated with fresh-cut, ready-to-eat produce commodities due to the perishable nature of the product and relatively minimal processing from farm to the consumer. The research presented here optimizes and evaluates the utility of microfluidic droplets, also termed ultra-miniaturized bioreactors, for rapid detection of viable Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium in a shredded lettuce wash water acquired from a major Mid-Atlantic produce processing facility (denoted as Producer) in the U.S. Using a fluorescently-labeled anti-S. Typhimurium antibody and relative fluorescence intensities, paired with in-droplet incubation, S. Typhimurium was detected and identified with 100% specificity in less than 5 h. In initial optimization experiments using S. Typhimurium-spiked sterile water, the relative fluorescence intensity of S. Typhimurium was approximately two times that of the observed relative intensities of five non-S. Typhimurium negative controls at 4-h incubation in droplets containing Rappaport-Vasiliadis (RV) broth at 37°C: relative fluorescence intensity for S. Typhimurium = 2.36 (95% CI: 2.15-2.58), Enterobacter aerogens 1.12 (95% CI: 1.09-1.16), Escherichia coli 700609 = 1.13 (95% CI: 1.09-1.17), E. coli 13706 1.13 (95% CI: 1.07-1.19), E. coli 700891 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03-1.07) and Citrobacter freundii 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03-1.05). S. Typhimurium- and E. aerogens-spiked shredded lettuce wash waters acquired from the Producer were then incubated 4 h in-droplet at 37°C with RV broth. The observed relative fluorescence of S. Typhimurium was significantly higher than that of E. aerogens, 1.56 (95% CI: 1.42-1.71) and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08-1.12), respectively. While further optimization focusing on compatible concentration methodologies for highly-dilute produce water samples is needed, this application of droplet microfluidics shows great promise in dramatically shortening the time necessary-from days to hours-to confirm viable bacterial contamination in ready-to-eat produce wash waters used throughout the domestic and international food industry."

A structured questionnaire assessed needs, anxiety, and uncertainty in illness for 50 participants. Interview data of 10 participants were analyzed using grounded theory. Assurance was the highest family need, followed by information need. Family needs differed according to gender, relationship to the patient, and length of intensive care unit stay. Participants reported family-centered multidisciplinary rounds provided a sense of relief, a chance to listen to medical staff, and a chance to provide medical staff with comprehensive information about patient care. Proximity needs were found to have a positive correlation with state anxiety, while comfort needs had a negative correlation with uncertainty in illness. Families reported family-centered multidisciplinary rounds were positive, useful experiences. Thus, standardization of family-centered multidisciplinary rounds is needed to meet families' various needs."
https://openalex.org/W3034008211,"The Eupatorium adenophorum have widespread invaded the karst ecosystem of southwest China and threatened the regional native community stability. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) plays an important role in promoting growth for host plants via root external mycelia. However, whether AM regulates plant root traits underlying competition between invasive and native species via mycorrhizal networks in karst habitats, remains unclear. An experiment was conducted in a microcosm composed of two planting compartments flanking a competition compartment. The invasive E. adenophorum and native Artemisia annua were each placed in one of the two planting compartments with or without Glomus etunicatum fungus. The nutrient access treatments included the competitive utilization (Cu), single utilization (Su) and non-utilization (Nu) by using different nylon meshes allowed or prevented mycelium passing to acquire nutrients from the competition compartment. Root traits and nutrients of the two species were analyzed. The results showed that AM fungi had differential effects on root traits and nutrients of E. adenophorum and A. annua seedlings, which increased dry weight, length, surface area, volume, tips and branching points in roots, specific root length and volume, root nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents under Cu, Su and Nu treatments. AM fungus was also associated with decreases in the average diameter for both species. Under the Cu treatment, E. adenophorum had significantly greater length, surface area, volume, tips and branching points of roots, specific root traits, and root N and P than A. annua. AM fungi changed root phenotypes and nutrient uptake for both invasive and native plant species via interconnected mycorrhizal networks. Overall, our results suggest that through mycorrhizal networks, the invasive plant experiences greater benefits than the native plant in the nutrient competition, which fosters root morphological developments in karst soil."

In a cross-sectional study, eligible individuals were invited to participate in the questionnaire, and urine specimens were collected to identify CT and NG infections using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Considering the differences in the presentation of symptoms between men and women, this study was stratified by gender. Corresponding outcomes were analyzed by Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression. A total of 2,871 participants were asymptomatic and included in our analyses: 1120 (39.0%) men and 1751 (61.0%) women. The prevalence of asymptomatic NG and CT infections was 0.9% and 6.2% in men, and 0.4% and 7.9% in women, respectively. The proportion of asymptomatic urethral CT among men with urethral CT was 28.3%; for women, it was 34.2%. For asymptomatic men with CT, 3 independent risk factors were identified: (1) men under the age of 30 (aOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.11–3.03); (2) being employed in the commercial service work (2.82; 1.36–5.84); and (3) being recruited through the urological department (2.12; 1.19–3.79). For asymptomatic women with urethral CT, age less than 30 years was a risk factor. In conclusion, a substantial prevalence of asymptomatic CT infections was found among men and women presenting to clinics in Shenzhen. The significant correlation between asymptomatic CT infection and these risk factors could help identify high-risk populations and guide screening."
https://openalex.org/W3033660755,"Young biomedical PhD scientists are needed in a wide variety of careers. Many recent efforts have been focused on revising training approaches to help them choose and prepare for different careers. However, very little is known about how biomedical PhD students decide on and ""differentiate"" into careers, which limits the development of new training models. This knowledge gap also severely limits efforts to increase the representation of women and some racial/ethnic groups in academic research careers. Previous studies have used cross-sectional surveys of career interests and ratings, and have not been designed to identify career intentions. They also are limited by single-time data and response bias, having typically asked participants to recount decisions made years in the past. This report draws on annual, in-depth interviews with 147 biomedical PhD students from the start of the PhD to graduation. Qualitative content analysis methods were used to fully understand scientific development and career intentions over time. Longitudinal analysis reveals a striking level of fluidity and complexity in career intentions over time. Contrary to previous studies and the dominant narrative, data do not show generalized shifts away from academic careers. In addition to those who are consistent in this intention from the start, nearly as many students shift toward research academic careers as away from them, and only modest differences exist by gender and race/ethnicity. Thus, the dominant narrative misses the high fraction of individuals who acquire or sustain their intention to purse an academic research career during training. Efforts to increase diversity in academia must capitalize on and support those who are still considering and evolve toward an academic career. Efforts to revise research training should incorporate knowledge of the tremendous fluidity in when and how career differentiation occurs."
https://openalex.org/W3033737504,"Winter squash fruits (Cucurbita moschata D.) are among the best sources of vitamin A precursors and constitute sources of bioactive components such as phenolic compounds and flavonoids. Approximately 70% of C. moschata seed oil is made up of unsaturated fatty acids, with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and components such as vitamin E and carotenoids, which represent a promising nutritional aspect in the production of this vegetable. C. moschata germplasm expresses high genetic variability, especially in Brazil. We assessed 91 C. moschata accessions, from different regions of Brazil, and maintained at the Federal University of Viçosa (UFV) Vegetable Germplasm Bank, to identify early-flowering accessions with high levels of carotenoids in the fruit pulp and high yields of seed and seed oil. Results showed that the accessions have high variability in the number and mass of seeds per fruit, number of accumulated degree-days for flowering, total carotenoid content, and fruit productivity, which allowed selection for considerable gains in these characteristics. Analysis of the correlation between these characteristics provided information that will assist in selection to improve this crop. Cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 16 groups, confirming the variability of the accessions. Per se analysis identified accessions BGH-6749, BGH-5639, and BGH-219 as those with the earliest flowering. Accessions BGH-5455A and BGH-5598A had the highest carotenoid content, with averages greater than 170.00 μg g-1 of fresh mass. With a productivity of 0.13 t ha-1, accessions BGH-5485A, BGH-4610A, and BGH-5472A were the most promising for seed oil production. These last two accessions corresponded to those with higher seed productivity, averaging 0.58 and 0.54 t ha-1, respectively. This study confirms the high potential of this germplasm for use in breeding for promotion of earlier flowering and increase in total content of fruit pulp carotenoids and in seed and seed oil productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3032979276,"Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect approximately 1% of newborns. Epidemiological studies have identified several genetically-mediated maternal phenotypes (e.g., pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension) that are associated with the risk of CHDs in offspring. However, the role of the maternal genome in determining CHD risk has not been defined. We present findings from gene-level, genome-wide studies that link CHDs to maternal effect genes as well as to maternal genes related to hypertension and proteostasis. Maternal effect genes, which provide the mRNAs and proteins in the oocyte that guide early embryonic development before zygotic gene activation, have not previously been implicated in CHD risk. Our findings support a role for and suggest new pathways by which the maternal genome may contribute to the development of CHDs in offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3033134272,"Shoot fly (Atherigona naqvii) is one of the major insects affecting spring maize in North India and can cause yield loss up to 60 per cent. The genetics of insect resistance is complex as influenced by genotypic background, insect population and climatic conditions. Therefore, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping is a highly effective approach for studying genetically complex forms of insect resistance. The objective of the present study was to dissect the genetic basis of resistance and identification of genomic regions associated with shoot fly resistance. A total of 107 F2 population derived from the cross CM143 (resistant) x CM144 (susceptible) was genotyped with 120 SSR markers. Phenotypic data were recorded on replicated F2:3 progenies for various component traits imparting resistance to shoot fly at different time intervals. Resistance to shoot fly was observed to be under polygenic control as evidenced by the identification of 19 putative QTLs governed by overdominance to partial dominance and additive gene actions. The major QTLs conditioning shoot fly resistance viz., qDH9.1 (deadheart) and qEC9.1 (oviposition) explaining 15.03 and 18.89 per cent phenotypic variance, respectively were colocalized on chromosome 9. These QTLs are syntenic to regions of chromosome 10 of sorghum which were also accounted for deadheart and oviposition suggesting that the same gene block may be responsible for shoot fly resistance. The candidate genes such as cysteine protease, subtilisin-chymotrypsin inhibitor, cytochrome P450 involved in synthesis of alleochemicals, receptor kinases, glossy15 and ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway were identified within the predicted QTL regions. This is the first reported mapping of QTLs conferring resistance to shoot fly in maize, and the markers identified here will be a valuable resource for developing elite maize cultivars with resistance to shoot fly."
https://openalex.org/W3033313006,"There is a global lack of data concerning shark consumption trends, consumer attitudes, and public knowledge regarding sharks. This is the case in Trinidad and Tobago, where shark is a popular culinary delicacy. A Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted in Trinidad and Tobago. Six hundred and seven questionnaires were administered. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regressions were performed to test the association between KAP and demographic categories. The response rate was 93.4% with 567 questionnaires returned (473 from Trinidad and 94 from Tobago). Two hundred and seventeen (38.3%) participants were knowledgeable, 422 (74.4%) displayed attitudes in favour of shark conservation and sustainable use, and 270 (47.6%) displayed practices promoting shark conservation and sustainable use. Island (AOR = 2.81, CI = 1.78, 4.46) and tertiary education (AOR = 2.31, CI = 1.20, 4.46) significantly influenced knowledge level. Gender (AOR = 1.50, CI = 1.02, 2.20) and island (AOR = 0.56, CI = 0.35, 0.90) significantly influenced attitude. Gender (COR = 1.59, CI = 1.14, 2.22) was significantly associated with practices. Over 70% of respondents ate shark, and 54.7% ate shark infrequently enough to avoid risks from heavy metal toxicity. Our results may be useful to develop public awareness and practice improvement initiatives in order to improve KAP regarding shark meat consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3033437897,"The food environment can interact with cognitive processing and influence eating behaviour. Our objective was to characterize the impact of implicit olfactory priming on inhibitory control towards food, in groups with different weight status. Ninety-one adults completed a modified Affective Shifting Task: they had to detect target stimuli and ignore distractor stimuli while being primed with non-attentively perceived odours. We measured reactivity and inhibitory control towards food pictures. Priming effects were observed on reactivity: participants with overweight and obesity were slower when primed with pear and pound cake odour respectively. Common inhibitory control patterns toward foods were observed between groups. We suggest that non-attentively perceived food cues influence bottom-up processing by activating distinguished mental representations according to weight status. Also, our data show that cognitive load influences inhibitory control toward foods. Those results contribute to understanding how the environment can influence eating behaviour in individuals with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3033665367,"Brazilian native fruits are a rich source of polyphenolic compounds that can act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents. Here, we determined the polyphenolic composition, anti-inflammatory mechanism of action, antioxidant activity and systemic toxicity in Galleria mellonella larvae of Eugenia selloi B.D.Jacks. (synonym Eugenia neonitida Sobral) extract (Ese) and its polyphenol-rich fraction (F3) obtained through bioassay-guided fractionation. Phenolic compounds present in Ese and F3 were identified by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. The anti-inflammatory activity of Ese and F3 was tested in vitro and in vivo through NF-κB activation, cytokine release and neutrophil migration assays. The samples were tested for their effects against reactive species (ROO•, O2•-, HOCl and NO•) and for their toxicity in Galleria mellonella larvae model. The presence of hydroxybenzoic acid, ellagitannins and flavonoids was identified. Ese and F3 reduced NF-κB activation, cytokine release and neutrophil migration, with F3 being three-fold more potent. Overall, F3 exhibited strong antioxidant effects against biologically relevant radicals, and neither Ese nor F3 were toxic to G. mellonella larvae. In conclusion, Ese and F3 revealed the presence of phenolic compounds that decreased the inflammatory parameters evaluated and inhibited reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. E. selloi is a novel source of bioactive compounds that may provide benefits for human health."

In Benin, there is a lack of strategic information to offer appropriate interventions for these populations who live hidden due to their stigmatization and discrimination. The objective is to identify contributing factors that affect HIV incidence in the MSM population. Study of a prospective cohort of 358 HIV-negative MSM, aged 18 years and over, reporting having had at least one oral or anal relationship with another man during the last 12 months, prior to recruitment. The monitoring lasted 30 months with a follow-up visit every six months. Univariate analyses and a Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression were used to examine the association between bio-behavioral, socio-demographic and knowledge-related characteristics with HIV incidence. The retention rate for the follow-up of the 358 participants was 94.5%. On the 813.5 person-years of follow-up, 48 seroconversions with an HIV incidence of 5.91 per 100 person-years were observed (95% CI: 4.46–7.85). Factors associated with the high risk of HIV were age (HR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.8), living in couple (HR = 0.5 95% CI: 0.2–0.96) and the lack of condom systematic use with a male partner during high-risk sex (HR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.4–11.1). HIV incidence is high within MSM population and particularly among young people. Targeted, suitable and cost-effective interventions for the delivery of the combination prevention package in an environment free of stigma and discrimination are necessary and vital for reaching the 90x90x90 target."
https://openalex.org/W3034027540,"Background Studies in high-income countries have documented a consistent gradient between socio-economic status (SES) and high blood pressure (HBP), a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, evidence from Latin American countries (LA) remains comparatively scarce and inconclusive. Data Data for 3,984 individuals came from a nationally representative survey of individuals aged 60 years or above in Colombia (Encuesta de Salud, Bienestar y Envejecimiento) (SABE) conducted in 2015. SES was measured by educational achievement and household assets. CVD risk factors included objectively measured HBP and body mass index (BMI), as well as behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetables intake, and physical activity). Methods Bivariate methods and multivariate regression models were used to assess associations between SES with HBP as well as additional risk factors for CVD. Results Individuals with lower SES have significantly higher risk of suffering from HBP. Compared to those with no formal education, individuals with secondary or post-secondary education have a 37% lower risk of HBP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, P-value<0.001). Being in the highest asset quartile (most affluent) is associated with a 44% lower risk (OR = 56, P-value = 0.001) of HBP compared to those in the lowest asset quartile (most deprived). Individuals with lower SES are more likely to smoke, not engage in regular physical activity and not regularly consume fruits or vegetables. In contrast, individuals with higher SES are more likely to consume alcohol and, those with more assets, more likely to be obese. Conclusions Among older Colombians there exists a marked SES gradient in HBP as well as several additional risk factors for CVD. The results highlight the importance of a public health approach towards HBP and additional CVD risk factors that takes into account the specific conditions of older individuals, especially among disadvantaged groups."
https://openalex.org/W3034137851,"Loss-of-function variants in CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2, and CCM3/PDCD10 are associated with autosomal dominant cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated CCM3 inactivation in human endothelial cells (ECs) has been shown to induce profound defects in cell-cell interaction as well as actin cytoskeleton organization. We here show that CCM3 inactivation impairs fibronectin expression and consequently leads to reduced fibers in the extracellular matrix. Despite the complexity and high molecular weight of fibronectin fibrils, our in vitro model allowed us to reveal that fibronectin supplementation restored aberrant spheroid formation as well as altered EC morphology, and suppressed actin stress fiber formation. Yet, fibronectin replacement neither enhanced the stability of tube-like structures nor inhibited the survival advantage of CCM3−/− ECs. Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated introduction of biallelic loss-of-function variants into either CCM1 or CCM2 demonstrated that the impaired production of a functional fibronectin matrix is a common feature of CCM1-, CCM2-, and CCM3-deficient ECs."
https://openalex.org/W3033410266,"We previously reported that a single 5 ns high intensity electric pulse (NEP) caused an E-field-dependent decrease in peak inward voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. This study explored the effects of a pair of 5 ns pulses on INa recorded in the same cell type, and how varying the E-field amplitude and interval between the pulses altered its response. Regardless of the E-field strength (5 to 10 MV/m), twin NEPs having interpulse intervals ≥ than 5 s caused the inhibition of TTX-sensitive INa to approximately double relative to that produced by a single pulse. However, reducing the interval from 1 s to 10 ms between twin NEPs at E-fields of 5 and 8 MV/m but not 10 MV/m decreased the magnitude of the additive inhibitory effect by the second pulse in a pair on INa. The enhanced inhibitory effects of twin vs single NEPs on INa were not due to a shift in the voltage-dependence of steady-state activation and inactivation but were associated with a reduction in maximal Na+ conductance. Paradoxically, reducing the interval between twin NEPs at 5 or 8 MV/m but not 10 MV/m led to a progressive interval-dependent recovery of INa, which after 9 min exceeded the level of INa reached following the application of a single NEP. Disrupting lipid rafts by depleting membrane cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin enhanced the inhibitory effects of twin NEPs on INa and ablated the progressive recovery of this current at short twin pulse intervals, suggesting a complete dissociation of the inhibitory effects of twin NEPs on this current from their ability to stimulate its recovery. Our results suggest that in contrast to a single NEP, twin NEPs may influence membrane lipid rafts in a manner that enhances the trafficking of newly synthesized and/or recycling of endocytosed voltage-gated Na+ channels, thereby pointing to novel means to regulate ion channels in excitable cells."

However, the mechanisms underlying the role of EI in smoking behaviour are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse how EI abilities protect against relapse in a 12-month smoking cessation program.One hundred and seventy-three volunteer smokers were enrolled in a well-established smoking cessation program, accompanied by a 12-month follow-up, through the Spanish Association Against Cancer. Moderation and moderated mediation analyses were conducted to explore the influence of EI abilities on the effect of stress reactivity and nicotine dependence on the likelihood of relapse.Emotional repair ability moderated the effect of stress reactivity on relapse. Higher levels of stress reactivity were associated with a higher likelihood of relapse, but only in those individuals with lower emotional repair abilities. In addition, the moderated mediation analyses revealed that emotional clarity and emotional repair abilities moderated the indirect effect of nicotine dependence on smoking relapse through its influence on stress reactivity.Emotional management is a central concept in explaining smoking behaviour. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of EI training could be particularly useful for improving current smoking cessation programs. A good ability to manage emotions allows smokers to effectively apply psychological coping strategies to deal with stressful situations, thus protecting against relapse."

Two-way text-messaging interventions have shown promise in supporting adherence in US studies of mostly White people living with HIV (PLWH). However, culturally-appropriate tailoring is necessary to maximize intervention effectiveness among other racial/ethnic groups. Thus, to refine an existing text-messaging intervention, we examined barriers and facilitators to ART adherence among African Americans and perspectives on features to integrate into the extant intervention. Three focus groups, two with African American PLWH (n = 5 and n = 7) and one with providers of care (n = 11) were conducted; transcripts of audio-recordings were thematically analyzed. Adherence supports operated at individual, interpersonal, and structural/environmental levels (e.g., using reminders and pill organizers, wanting to protect partners from HIV, and positive interactions with providers). Adherence barriers also operated at multiple ecological levels (e.g., poor mental health, fear of disclosure of HIV status, and unstable housing). Participant-suggested features for refinement included: i) matching content to participants’ comfort with receiving messages referencing HIV or medication-taking, ii) culturally-tailoring content for African Americans, iii) tracking adherence, and iv) encouraging adherence interactions between patients and providers. Feedback from both patients and providers is foundational to designing effective ART interventions among African American PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3033802604,"Background In Japan, swimming school attendance is promoted as a form of therapy or as a prophylactic measure against asthma in young children. However, the putative beneficial effects have not been sufficiently verified. Objective The aim of the present study was to clarify whether or not swimming school attendance at age 3 years affects the onset and/or improvement of wheeze and rhinitis at age 5 years. Methods This study was a single-center, prospective, general, longitudinal cohort study (T-CHILD Study). Between November 2003 and December 2005, 1776 pregnant women were enrolled, and their offspring were followed up until age 5 years. Swimming school attendance at age 3 years and the presence of wheeze and/or rhinitis in the previous one year were examined using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire. The relationship between swimming school attendance and wheeze and/or rhinitis was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Data on the 1097 children were analyzed. At age 3 years, 126 (11.5%) children attended a swimming school, and at age 5 years, the prevalence of wheeze was 180 (16.4%) while that of rhinitis was 387 (35.3%). Swimming school attendance at age 3 showed no significant relationship with the development of either wheeze (aOR 0.83, 95% CI (0.43–1.60) or rhinitis (aOR 0.80, 95% CI (0.43–1.60) at age 5. Conclusions Swimming school attendance at age 3 years showed neither a preventive nor therapeutic effect on wheeze or rhinitis at age 5 years. There is thus no scientific evidence yet that swimming school attendance has a positive impact on the development of childhood wheeze or rhinitis."

We evaluated the current reporting system and identified the potential benefits of using a web-based MRIS by in-depth interviews on selected key informants. Feasibility study was then conducted to develop a prototype system. A web-based MRIS was developed, integrated and synchronized, with suitability ranging from Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) to the Lahat District Health Office.The paper-based reporting system was sub-optimal due to a lack of transportation, communication, and human capacity. We developed a web-based MRIS to replace the current one. Although the web-based system has the potential to improve the malaria reporting information system, there were some barriers to its implementation, including lack of skilled operators, computer availability and lack of internet access. Recommended ways to overcome the obstacles are by training operators, making the application in an offline mode and able to be operated by mobile phone text messaging for malaria reporting.The web-based MRIS has the potential to be implemented as an enhanced malaria reporting information system and investment in the system to support timely management responses is essential for malaria elimination.

https://openalex.org/W3033736662,"Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios of raw pollen sampled from nine abundant tree species growing in natural habitats of central and northern Europe were investigated to understand the intra- and inter-specific variability of pollen-isotope values. All species yielded specific δ13Cpollen and δ18Opollen values and patterns, which can be ascribed to their physiology and habitat preferences. Broad-leaved trees flowering early in the year before leaf proliferation (Alnus glutinosa and Corylus avellana) exhibited on average 2.6‰ lower δ13Cpollen and 3.1‰ lower δ18Opollen values than broad-leaved and coniferous trees flowering during mid and late spring (Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula pendula, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur). Mean species-specific δ13Cpollen values did not change markedly over time, whereas δ18Opollen values of two consecutive years were often statistically distinct. An intra-annual analysis of B. pendula and P. sylvestris pollen revealed increasing δ18Opollen values during the final weeks of pollen development. However, the δ13Cpollen values remained consistent throughout the pollen-maturation process. Detailed intra-individual analysis yielded circumferential and height-dependent variations within carbon and oxygen pollen-isotopes and the sampling position on a tree accounted for differences of up to 3.5‰ for δ13Cpollen and 2.1‰ for δ18Opollen. A comparison of isotope ranges from different geographic settings revealed gradients between maritime and continental as well as between high and low altitudinal study sites. The results of stepwise regression analysis demonstrated, that carbon and oxygen pollen-isotopes also reflect local non-climate environmental conditions. A detailed understanding of isotope patterns and ranges in modern pollen is necessary to enhance the accuracy of palaeoclimate investigations on δ13C and δ18O of fossil pollen. Furthermore, pollen-isotope values are species-specific and the analysis of species growing during different phenophases may be valuable for palaeoweather reconstructions of different seasons."
https://openalex.org/W3033297429,"Moral vitalism refers to a tendency to view good and evil as actual forces that can influence people and events. The Moral Vitalism Scale had been designed to assess moral vitalism in a brief survey form. Previous studies established the reliability and validity of the scale in US-American and Australian samples. In this study, the cross-cultural comparability of the scale was tested across 28 different cultural groups worldwide through measurement invariance tests. A series of exact invariance tests marginally supported partial metric invariance, however, an approximate invariance approach provided evidence of partial scalar invariance for a 5-item measure. The established level of measurement invariance allows for comparisons of latent means across cultures. We conclude that the brief measure of moral vitalism is invariant across 28 cultures and can be used to estimate levels of moral vitalism with the same precision across very different cultural settings."
https://openalex.org/W3033861605,"Understanding the molecular processes of seed development is important especially in agronomic crops that produce large amounts of nutrient reserves. Because soybean is a vital source of vegetable protein worldwide, producers are concerned about increasing the total amount of protein in the seed without substantially lowering the amount of oil, another economically important product. Here we describe a transgenic soybean line with increased protein and protein/oil ratio, containing an average of 42.2% protein vs. 38.5% in controls and with a protein/oil ratio of 2.02 vs. 1.76 in controls over several generations of greenhouse growth. Other phenotypic data show that the seeds are heavier, although there are overall lower yields per plant. We postulate these effects result from insertion site mutagenesis by the transgenic construct. As this line never achieves homozygosity and appears to be embryo lethal when homozygous, one functional copy of the gene is most likely essential for normal seed development. Global transcript analyses using RNA-Seq for 88,000 gene models over two stages of cotyledon development revealed that more genes are over-expressed in the transgenic line including ribosomal protein related genes and those in the membrane protein and transporters families. Localization of the insertion site should reveal the genes and developmental program that has been perturbed by the transgenic construct, resulting in this economically interesting increase in protein and the protein/oil ratio."

Through the simulation study, it is demonstrated that, the performance of the GPV-based method not only adequately controls the type I error rate at the nominal level but also is uniformly more powerful than the ratio test, Rothmann's and Wang's tests, the comparable extant methods.

https://openalex.org/W3034043754,"p53 is one of the most extensively studied proteins in cancer research. Mutations in p53 generally abolish normal p53 function, and some mutants can gain new oncogenic functions. However, the mechanisms underlying p53 mutation-driven cancer remains to be elucidated. Our study investigated the function of a heterozygous p53 mutation (p.Asn268Glufs*4) in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patient. We used episomal technology to perform somatic reprogramming, and used molecular and cell biology methods to determine the p53 mutation levels in patient-originated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells at the RNA and protein levels. We found that p53 protein expression was not increased in this patient’s somatic cells compared with those of a healthy control. p53 mutation facilitates the proliferation of tumor cells by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell division. It can inhibit the efficiency of somatic reprogramming by inhibiting OCT4 expression during reprogramming stage. Moreover, not all p53 mutant iPS cell lines have mutant p53 RNA sequences. A small percentage of mutant p53 mRNA is present in the somatic cells from the patient and his mother. In summary, this p53 mutation can promote tumor cell proliferation, inhibit somatic reprogramming, and exhibit random p53 allelic expression of heterozygous mutations in the patient and iPS cells which may be one of the reasons why the people with p53 mutations develop cancer at random. This finding suggested that mutant p53 allelic expression should be added to the risk forecasting of cancer."
