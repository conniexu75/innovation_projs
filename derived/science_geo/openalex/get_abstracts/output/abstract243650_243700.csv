https://openalex.org/W1980383146,"THE abrupt termination of the daytime ionosphere of Venus at about 500 km observed with the Mariner V two-frequency occultation experiment provides an extremely interesting picture of the direct interaction of the solar wind with a planetary ionosphere1,2. It has been suggested that a pseudo-magnetopause is formed by magnetic fields carried along by the solar wind and forced to pile up on the topside of the highly conducting planetary ionosphere3,4. This magnetic obstacle then interacts with the superalfv√©nic and supersonic solar wind to form a bow shock; evidence for such a bow shock has been obtained by experiments on Mariner V and Venera IV (refs. 2 and 5)."

https://openalex.org/W2090766491,"WE have undertaken a systematic investigation of the polarization of radio pulses from a number of pulsars, using a polarimeter feed in the Mark I radio telescope at 408 MHz. The results for the Crab Nebula pulsar, NP 0532, are of special interest, because they may be compared with the optical polarization recently measured by Wampler et al.1. We therefore now present a preliminary analysis for the main radio pulse, both in the form of an integration over many pulses and for individual pulses recorded photographically."
