https://openalex.org/W2462042948,"Modeling clinically relevant tissue responses using cell models poses a significant challenge for drug development, in particular for drug induced liver injury (DILI). This is mainly because existing liver models lack longevity and tissue-level complexity which limits their utility in predictive toxicology. In this study, we established and characterized novel bioprinted human liver tissue mimetics comprised of patient-derived hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells in a defined architecture. Scaffold-free assembly of different cell types in an in vivo-relevant architecture allowed for histologic analysis that revealed distinct intercellular hepatocyte junctions, CD31+ endothelial networks, and desmin positive, smooth muscle actin negative quiescent stellates. Unlike what was seen in 2D hepatocyte cultures, the tissues maintained levels of ATP, Albumin as well as expression and drug-induced enzyme activity of Cytochrome P450s over 4 weeks in culture. To assess the ability of the 3D liver cultures to model tissue-level DILI, dose responses of Trovafloxacin, a drug whose hepatotoxic potential could not be assessed by standard pre-clinical models, were compared to the structurally related non-toxic drug Levofloxacin. Trovafloxacin induced significant, dose-dependent toxicity at clinically relevant doses (≤ 4uM). Interestingly, Trovafloxacin toxicity was observed without lipopolysaccharide stimulation and in the absence of resident macrophages in contrast to earlier reports. Together, these results demonstrate that 3D bioprinted liver tissues can both effectively model DILI and distinguish between highly related compounds with differential profile. Thus, the combination of patient-derived primary cells with bioprinting technology here for the first time demonstrates superior performance in terms of mimicking human drug response in a known target organ at the tissue level."

One attractive candidate is the NS2B/NS3 viral protease, which, together with host cell proteases, cleaves the viral polyprotein into the individual proteins required for viral replication. Lei et al. report the crystal structure of this protease bound to a peptido-mimetic inhibitor. The structure reveals key interactions that probably contribute to the high catalytic efficiency of this enzyme relative to other flaviviruses, indicating promising starting points for drug design.

Introducing the protein responsible for chlorophyll f synthesis into crop plants could potentially expand the range of wavelengths that such plants use during photosynthesis and thereby increase their growth efficiency. Ho et al. identified chlorophyll f synthase (ChlF) in two cyanobacteria that are acclimatized to grow using far-red light. Introducing the ChlF-encoding gene into a model cyanobacterium allowed the organism to synthesize chlorophyll f. Similarities between ChlF and a core protein of photosystem II suggest that they have a close evolutionary relationship, and ChlF may even represent a more primitive photochemical reaction center.

This appears to be true even in utero, with potential long-lasting effects on adult phenotype and disease. Epigenetic factors are prime suspects in identifying the corresponding molecular mechanism because they can be maintained throughout cell division. Holland et al. show in mice that in utero nutritional deficits influence offspring growth through epigenetic states at multicopy ribosomal DNA elements. This effect is influenced by the genetic variation that naturally exists within the ribosomal RNA. Science , this issue p. 495"
https://openalex.org/W2463246198,"Altered microRNA profiles have been implicated in human brain disorders. However, the functional contribution of individual microRNAs to neuronal development and function is largely unknown. Here, we report biological functions for miR-19 in adult neurogenesis. We determined that miR-19 is enriched in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and downregulated during neuronal development in the adult hippocampus. By manipulating miR-19 in NPCs for gain- and loss-of-function studies, we discovered that miR-19 regulates cell migration by directly targeting Rapgef2. Concordantly, dysregulation of miR-19 in NPCs alters the positioning of newborn neurons in the adult brain. Furthermore, we found abnormal expression of miR-19 in human NPCs generated from schizophrenic patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that have been described as displaying aberrant migration. Our study demonstrates the significance of posttranscriptional gene regulation by miR-19 in preventing the irregular migration of adult-born neurons that may contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2464732678,"Typical antipsychotics can cause disabling side effects. Specifically, antagonism of D2R signaling by the typical antipsychotic haloperidol induces parkinsonism in humans and catalepsy in rodents. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) are major regulators of motor activity through their signaling on striatal projection neurons and interneurons. We show that D2R signaling on cholinergic interneurons contributes to an in vitro pause in firing of these otherwise tonically active neurons and to the striatal dopamine/acetylcholine balance. The selective ablation of D2R from cholinergic neurons allows discrimination between the motor-reducing and cataleptic effects of antipsychotics. The cataleptic effect of antipsychotics is triggered by blockade of D2R on cholinergic interneurons and the consequent increase of acetylcholine signaling on striatal projection neurons. These studies illuminate the critical role of D2R-mediated signaling in regulating the activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons and the mechanisms of typical antipsychotic side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2469994930,"Three distinct gamma oscillations, generated in different CA1 layers, occur at different phases of concurrent theta oscillation. In parallel, firing of place cells displays phase advancement over successive cycles of theta oscillations while an animal passes through the place field. Is the theta-phase-precessing output of place cells shaped by distinct gamma oscillations along different theta phases during place field traversal? We simultaneously recorded firing of place cells and three layer-specific gamma oscillations using current-source-density analysis of multi-site field potential measurements in mice. We show that spike timing of place cells can tune to all three gamma oscillations, but phase coupling to the mid-frequency gamma oscillation conveyed from the entorhinal cortex was restricted to leaving a place field. A subset of place cells coupled to two different gamma oscillations even during single-place field traversals. Thus, an individual CA1 place cell can combine and relay information from multiple gamma networks while the animal crosses the place field."
https://openalex.org/W2468118389,"Liver fibrosis results from a sustained wound healing response to chronic liver injury, and the activation of nonparenchymal hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is the pivotal process. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) is the direct target gene of p53 and activates p53 through sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) simultaneously. The miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway thus forms a positive feedback loop wherein p53 induces miR-34a and miR-34a activates p53 by inhibiting SIRT1, playing an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. miR-34a expression has been found to be increased in animal models or in human patients with different liver diseases, including liver fibrosis. However, the exact role of this classical miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway in liver fibrosis remains unclear. In the present study, using a CCl4-induced rat liver fibrosis model, we found that the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway was activated and could be inhibited by SIRT1 activator SRT1720. Further studies showed that the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway was activated in hepatocytes but not in HSCs. The activation of this pathway in hepatocytes resulted in the apoptosis of hepatocytes and thus activated HSCs. Our data indicate that the miR-34a/SIRT1/p53 signaling pathway might be a promising therapeutic target for liver fibrosis."

These pathways are believed to control distinct physiological end points but FFA2 receptor ligands appropriate to test this hypothesis have been lacking. Herein, we characterize AZ1729, a novel FFA2 regulator that acts as a direct allosteric agonist and as a positive allosteric modulator, increasing the activity of the endogenously produced short chain fatty acid propionate in Gi-mediated pathways, but not at those transduced by Gq/G11. Using AZ1729 in combination with direct inhibitors of Gi and Gq/G11 family G proteins demonstrated that although both arms contribute to propionate-mediated regulation of phospho-ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling in FFA2-expressing 293 cells, the Gq/G11-mediated pathway is predominant. We extend these studies by employing AZ1729 to dissect physiological FFA2 signaling pathways. The capacity of AZ1729 to act at FFA2 receptors to inhibit β-adrenoreceptor agonist-promoted lipolysis in primary mouse adipocytes and to promote chemotaxis of isolated human neutrophils confirmed these as FFA2 processes mediated by Gi signaling, whereas, in concert with blockade by the Gq/G11 inhibitor FR900359, the inability of AZ1729 to mimic or regulate propionate-mediated release of GLP-1 from mouse colonic preparations defined this physiological response as an end point transduced via activation of Gq/G11.

These are produced in the body predominantly by the fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates (fibers) through the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, with acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4) being the most abundant products (1den Besten G. van Eunen K.

Until recently, the role of SCFAs was believed to be confined to providing either a source of energy or as intermediate products of more complex molecules (1den Besten G. van Eunen K. Groen A.K.

For example, colonocytes utilize C4 as a main energy supply, whereas the liver can source C2 as a substrate for the synthesis of cholesterol or longer chain fatty acids and C3 as a precursor for gluconeogenesis (2den Besten G.

However, with the discovery and de-orphanization of a pair of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) responsive to SCFAs, FFA2, and FFA3 (previously designated GPR43 and GPR41, respectively) (3Stoddart L.A.

The SCFA receptors are mainly expressed in tissues involved in metabolic regulation, in particular white adipose tissue, intestinal enteroendocrine cells, and pancreatic beta cells (7Bolognini D.

Hence, a role for the SCFA receptors, in particular FFA2, in controlling energy homeostasis, and potentially in the regulation of metabolic disorders, has been proposed (9Kimura I. Inoue D. Hirano K.

Despite the increasing interest surrounding SCFA receptors, a general paucity of selective ligands has rendered the study and understanding of their pathophysiological functions extremely challenging (7Bolognini D.

For example, although there is a rank order of selectivity of endogenous SCFAs for the receptors (13Milligan G. Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Agonism and allosterism: the pharmacology of the free fatty acid receptors FFA2 and FFA3.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with C2 being more potent at human FFA2 than at FFA3, this level of selectivity, in concert with the general low potency of the SCFAs, is insufficient to allow their use in defining physiological roles of FFA2 over FFA3 without additional studies that incorporate receptor knock-down or knock-out models (7Bolognini D. Tobin A.B. Milligan G. Moss C.E. The pharmacology and function of short chain fatty acid receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2016; 89: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, even this poor degree of SCFA ligand selectivity is absent in the mouse orthologs of the SCFA receptors, where C2 is equipotent in activating FFA2 and FFA3 (7Bolognini D. Tobin A.B.

To date only a small number of selective synthetic ligands have been identified, with “compound 1” (3-benzyl-4-(cyclopropyl-(4-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)amino)-4-oxobutanoic acid) and 4-CMTB (4-chloro-α-(1-methylethyl)-N-2-thiazolyl-benzeneacetamide) being the best characterized ligands with agonist activity at FFA2 (7Bolognini D.

Although compound 1 is a selective and relatively potent orthosteric agonist at both human and mouse FFA2 (15Hudson B.D. Due-Hansen M.E. Christiansen E. Hansen A.M. Mackenzie A.E. Murdoch H.

Lett. 2010; 20: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have limited its use within in vivo validation studies for FFA2. An interesting feature of FFA2 is that, unlike the closely related SCFA receptor FFA3, which signals only via Gi-family G proteins, it is able to initiate signals via both Gi and Gq/G11-mediated pathways (7Bolognini D. Tobin A.B. Milligan G. Moss C.E. The pharmacology and function of short chain fatty acid receptors.Mol. Pharmacol. 2016; 89: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Milligan G.

However, the contribution of these two signaling arms to various downstream cascades and, indeed, to physiological processes remains, in large part, undefined. Clearly, mechanistically distinct and potent classes of synthetic ligands are required to define such questions. To begin to address this need, herein, we characterize a novel synthetic ligand N-[3-(2-carbamimidamido-4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-5-yl)phenyl]-4-fluorobenzamide (AZ1729). We demonstrate that AZ1729 acts as a FFA2 allosteric agonist and PAM by selectively activating Gi signaling but lacks the capacity to activate FFA2 Gq/G11-mediated signaling pathways. In this way we define AZ1729 as a Gi-biased ligand. In conjunction with the use of selective inhibitors of the Gi and Gq/G11 classes of G proteins, we then employ AZ1729 to define the relative contribution of these pathways to the integration of ERK1/2-MAP kinase activity in transfected cells and in natively expressing systems, in which we show that both FFA2-mediated inhibition of lipolysis and promotion of neutrophil chemotaxis reflect signaling via Gi family G proteins. By contrast, in murine colonic crypts FFA2 signaling to promote release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is not modulated by AZ1729 indicating that this response proceeds via activation of Gq/G11. In Flp-InTMT-RExTM 293 cells (20Ward R.J. Alvarez-Curto E. Milligan G. Using the Flp-InTM T-RexTM system to regulate GPCR expression.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 746: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) able to express human (h)FFA2-eYFP only upon addition of the antibiotic doxycycline, the physiological FFA2 receptor agonist propionate (C3) (Fig. 1A) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in a concentration-dependent manner (pEC50 = 3.95 ± 0.13) (Fig. 1B). AZ1729 (Fig. 1A), which was identified initially as a regulator of FFA2 in a high throughput screen conducted using an integrative, function agnostic, dynamic mass redistribution assay, also inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in these cells and, equally, did so in a concentration-dependent manner (pEC50 = 6.90 ± 0.14) (Fig. 1B). AZ1729 was somewhat more efficacious in this assay than C3 (74.0 ± 3.1% and 61.1 ± 2.8% inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, respectively) and also more than 500-fold more potent (p < 0.01). By contrast, a previously described allosteric agonist of this receptor 4-CMTB (16Lee T. Schwandner R. Swaminath G. Weiszmann J. Cardozo M. Greenberg J. Jaeckel P. Ge H. Wang Y. Jiao X. Liu J.

These effects were dependent on the presence of hFFA2 as none of C3, AZ1729, and 4-CMTB affected cAMP levels in these cells when expression of the hFFA2 receptor was not induced (Fig. 1C). As anticipated, this effect of each ligand was transduced via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi-family G proteins. Treatment of doxycycline-induced cells with PTX, to cause ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of members of this G protein subgroup, eliminated ligand regulation of cAMP levels in each case (Fig. 1D). The ability of AZ1729 to induce Gi-mediated FFA2 signaling was also assessed in [35S]GTPγS binding assays, an end point that is best suited to, and usually reflects, the contribution of Gi family G proteins (21Milligan G. Principles: extending the utility of [35S]GTPγS binding assays.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 87-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In membranes prepared from Flp-InTM T-RExTM 293 cells induced to express hFFA2-eYFP, AZ1729 was able to produce stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding with pEC50 7.23 ± 0.20 (Fig. 1E). Again, this compound displayed potency that was significantly higher than both C3 (pEC50 4.35 ± 0.14, p < 0.01) and 4-CMTB (pEC50 6.50 ± 0.16, p < 0.05), although in this case without marked differences in ligand efficacy (Fig. 1E).

Indeed, in cells induced to express hFFA2-eYFP, C3 produced a large increase in inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation (Fig. 2A), with potency (pEC50 = 4.19 ± 0.10) akin to that observed in the cAMP regulation experiments. Although 4-CMTB also produced a partial effect in this assay (pEC50 = 5.60 ± 0.11), AZ1729 was completely inactive at concentrations up to the highest (30 μm) that could be tested (Fig. 2A). These observations indicated that AZ1729 might be a “Gi-biased” agonist at hFFA2. To assess this hypothesis we also explored ligand regulation of phospho-ERK1/2, production of which can be induced by both Gi- and Gq/11-mediated signaling. C3 produced a robust increase of phospho-ERK1/2 levels (Fig. 2B) with potency (pEC50 = 3.93 ± 0.13) similar to those displayed in both Gi- and Gq/11-dependent assays. Interestingly, the effect of C3 on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was partially inhibited by pre-treatment of the cells with PTX and greatly reduced by the Gq/G11 inhibitor FR900359 (22Schrage R.

Commun. 2015; 6: 10156Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B), suggesting that although C3 mediates phospho-ERK1/2 accumulation via both G protein classes it is mainly through Gq/G11. In the same assay, AZ1729 was only a very weak partial agonist at this end point (Fig. 2, C and D) and also displayed more modest potency (pEC50 = 5.66 ± 0.21). Interestingly, the effect of AZ1729 on phospho-ERK1/2 accumulation was completely abolished in hFFA2 cells pre-treated with PTX, but unaffected by treatment with FR900359 (Fig. 2, C and D). The effects of both C3 and AZ1729 were completely abrogated upon pre-treatment of cells with both PTX and FR900359 (Fig. 2, B–D). Together, these data indicate that AZ1729 behaves as a biased agonist at hFFA2; preferentially activating Gi but being unable to engage with Gq/G11 signaling. Synthetic agonists at FFA2 that share the same orthosteric binding site as C3, and the other endogenously produced SCFAs, all contain a carboxylate group and this is integral to their agonist function (14Hudson B.D.

AZ1729 does not, and neither does it contain a bioisostere that might substitute for the carboxylate (Fig. 1A). We examined, therefore, if AZ1729 acted as an orthosteric agonist. This was assessed in two distinct ways. First, we examined whether the Gi-mediated agonism of AZ1729 was preserved in orthosteric binding site mutants of hFFA2. Two arginine residues, Arg-180 and Arg-255 (Ballesteros and Weinstein residue location numbers 5.39 and 7.35, respectively) act to coordinate the carboxylate moiety of FFA2 orthosteric agonists (23Stoddart L.A.

Mutation of either of these residues to Ala was able to eliminate the ability of C3 to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 3A) but did not affect substantially the function of AZ1729 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, as described previously (18Smith N.J. Ward R.J. Stoddart L.A. Hudson B.D. Kostenis E. Ulven T. Morris J.C. Tränkle C. Tikhonova I.G. Adams D.R. Milligan G.

These data indicate that neither AZ1729 nor 4-CMTB interact with the arginine residues that are the core of the FFA2 orthosteric binding pocket (23Stoddart L.A. Smith N.J. Jenkins L. Brown A.J.

Second, we performed sets of radioligand binding experiments. [3H]GLPG0974 was recently reported as an orthosteric radiolabeled antagonist of hFFA2 (25Sergeev E. Hansen A.H. Pandey S.K.

However, AZ1729 was unable to compete fully with [3H]GLPG0974 for binding to the receptor (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that AZ1729 does not share an overlapping binding site with the radiolabeled antagonist. It did, however, produce maximally 16.7 ± 4.4% reduction in specific binding of this radioligand with apparent pKi = 6.77 ± 0.50 (Fig. 4A). 4-CMTB was also poor in capacity to compete with [3H]GLPG0974, maximally preventing only 10.9 ± 6.8% of the specific binding of this ligand with apparent pKi estimated as 6.64 ± 1.29 (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4AZ1729 is a positive allosteric regulator of C3 affinity at FFA2.

https://openalex.org/W2473678689,"Endosomal sorting is a highly orchestrated cellular process. Retromer is a heterotrimeric complex that associates with endosomal membranes and facilitates the retrograde sorting of multiple receptors, including the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor for lysosomal enzymes. The cycling of retromer on and off the endosomal membrane is regulated by a network of retromer-interacting proteins. Here, we find that Parkinson disease-associated Vps35 variant, R524W, but not P316S, is a loss-of-function mutation as marked by a reduced association with this regulatory network and dysregulation of endosomal receptor sorting. Expression of Vps35 R524W-containing retromer results in the accumulation of intracellular α-synuclein-positive aggregates, a hallmark of Parkinson disease. Overall, the Vps35 R524W-containing retromer has a decreased endosomal association, which can be partially rescued by R55, a small molecule previously shown to stabilize the retromer complex, supporting the potential for future targeting of the retromer complex in the treatment of Parkinson disease."

Like several other invasive pathogens, S. aureus can capture plasminogen from the human host where it can be converted to plasmin by host plasminogen activators or by endogenously expressed staphylokinase. This study demonstrates that sortase-anchored cell wall-associated proteins are responsible for capturing the bulk of bound plasminogen. Two cell wall-associated proteins, the fibrinogen- and fibronectin-binding proteins A and B, were found to bind plasminogen, and one of them, FnBPB, was studied in detail. Plasminogen captured on the surface of S. aureus- or Lactococcus lactis-expressing FnBPB could be activated to the potent serine protease plasmin by staphylokinase and tissue plasminogen activator. Plasminogen bound to recombinant FnBPB with a KD of 0.532 μm as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Plasminogen binding did not to occur by the same mechanism through which FnBPB binds to fibrinogen. Indeed, FnBPB could bind both ligands simultaneously indicating that their binding sites do not overlap. The N3 subdomain of FnBPB contains the full plasminogen-binding site, and this includes, at least in part, two conserved patches of surface-located lysine residues that were recognized by kringle 4 of the host protein."
https://openalex.org/W2460501420,"In the family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) that predominantly generate either asymmetric or symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), PRMT7 is unique in producing solely monomethylarginine (MMA) products. The type of methylation on histones and other proteins dictates changes in gene expression, and numerous studies have linked altered profiles of methyl marks with disease phenotypes. Given the importance of specific inhibitor development, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which PRMT product specificity is conferred. We have focused our attention on active-site residues of PRMT7 from the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. We have designed 26 single and double mutations in the active site, including residues in the Glu-Xaa8-Glu (double E) loop and the Met-Gln-Trp sequence of the canonical Thr-His-Trp (THW) loop known to interact with the methyl-accepting substrate arginine. Analysis of the reaction products by high resolution cation exchange chromatography combined with the knowledge of PRMT crystal structures suggests a model where the size of two distinct subregions in the active site determines PRMT7 product specificity. A dual mutation of Glu-181 to Asp in the double E loop and Gln-329 to Ala in the canonical THW loop enables the enzyme to produce SDMA. Consistent with our model, the mutation of Cys-431 to His in the THW loop of human PRMT9 shifts its product specificity from SDMA toward MMA. Together with previous results, these findings provide a structural basis and a general model for product specificity in PRMTs, which will be useful for the rational design of specific PRMT inhibitors."

Despite their relatively common occurrence in the fossil record (second only to bone and teeth), few studies have addressed natural degradation processes that must occur in all organic material, including those keratinous structures that are incorporated into the rock record as fossils. Because feathers have high preservation potential and strong phylogenetic signal, in the current study we examine feathers subjected to different burial environments for a duration of ~10 years, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ immunofluorescence (IF). We use morphology and persistence of specific immunoreactivity as indicators of preservation at the molecular and microstructural levels. We show that feather keratin is durable, demonstrates structural and microstructural integrity, and retains epitopes suitable for specific antibody recognition in even the harshest conditions. These data support the hypothesis that keratin antibody reactivity can be used to identify the nature and composition of epidermal structures in the rock record, and to address evolutionary questions by distinguishing between alpha- (widely distributed) and beta- (limited to sauropsids) keratin."

We assessed the usefulness of IVIM-metrics in predicting survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Methods Fifteen patients with glioblastoma underwent MRI including spin-echo echo-planar DWI using 13 b-values ranging from 0 to 1000 s/mm2. Parametric maps for diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were generated for contrast-enhancing regions (CER) and non-enhancing regions (NCER). Regions of interest were manually drawn in regions of maximum f and on the corresponding dynamic susceptibility contrast images. Prognostic factors were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses. Results We found that fCER and D*CER correlated with rCBFCER. The best cutoffs for 6-month survival were fCER>9.86% and D*CER>21.712 x10−3mm2/s (100% sensitivity, 71.4% specificity, 100% and 80% positive predictive values, and 80% and 100% negative predictive values; AUC:0.893 and 0.857, respectively).

In the present studies, we reexamined the role of emotion in people’s judgments about moral dilemmas using a validated self-report measure of emotion. We measured participants’ specific emotional responses to moral dilemmas and, although we found that moral dilemmas evoked strong emotional responses, we found that these responses were only weakly correlated with participants’ moral judgments.

We aimed to explore the connectivity differences of structural neuroimaging between TLE with and without psychosis using a graph theoretical analysis, which is an emerging mathematical method to investigate network connections in the brain as a small-world system.We recruited 11 TLE patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) presenting psychosis or having a history of psychosis (TLE-P group). As controls, 15 TLE patients with unilateral HS without any history of psychotic episodes were also recruited (TLE-N group). For graph theoretical analysis, the normalized gray matter images of both groups were subjected to Graph Analysis Toolbox (GAT). As secondary analyses, each group was compared to 14 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects.The hub node locations were found predominantly in the ipsilateral hemisphere in the TLE-N group, and mainly on the contralateral side in the TLE-P group. The TLE-P group showed significantly higher characteristic path length, transitivity, lower global efficiency, and resilience to random or targeted attack than those of the TLE-N group. The regional comparison in betweenness centrality revealed significantly decreased connectivity in the contralateral temporal lobe, ipsilateral middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral postcentral gyri in the TLE-P group. The healthy subjects showed well-balanced nodes/edges distributions, similar metrics to TLE-N group except for higher small-worldness/modularity/assortativity, and various differences of regional betweenness/clustering.In TLE with psychosis, graph theoretical analysis of structural imaging revealed disrupted connectivity in the contralateral hemisphere. The network metrics suggested that the existence of psychosis can bring vulnerability and decreased efficiency of the whole-brain network. The sharp differences in structural networks between morphologically homogeneous groups are remarkable and may contribute to a better understanding of psychosis in TLE."
https://openalex.org/W2465966059,"Natural plant populations are often adapted to their local climate and environmental conditions, and populations of forest trees offer some of the best examples of this pattern. However, little empirical work has focused on the relative contribution of single-locus versus multilocus effects to the genetic architecture of local adaptation in plants/forest trees. Here, we employ eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) to test the hypothesis that it is the inter-genic effects that primarily drive climate-induced local adaptation. The genetic structure of 29 range-wide natural populations of eastern white pine was determined in relation to local climatic factors using both a reference set of SSR markers, and SNPs located in candidate genes putatively involved in adaptive response to climate. Comparisons were made between marker sets using standard single-locus outlier analysis, single-locus and multilocus environment association analyses and a novel implementation of Population Graphs. Magnitudes of population structure were similar between the two marker sets. Outlier loci consistent with diversifying selection were rare for both SNPs and SSRs. However, genetic distances based on the multilocus among population covariances (cGD) were significantly more correlated to climate, even after correcting for spatial effects, for SNPs as compared to SSRs. Coalescent simulations confirmed that the differences in mutation rates between SSRs and SNPs did not affect the topologies of the Population Graphs, and hence values of cGD and their correlations with associated climate variables. We conclude that the multilocus covariances among populations primarily reflect adaptation to local climate and environment in eastern white pine. This result highlights the complexity of the genetic architecture of adaptive traits, as well as the need to consider multilocus effects in studies of local adaptation."

Altered transcript expression of genes encoding other biosynthetic enzymes or proteoglycan core proteins could not account for the observed changes. However, the role of NDST2 in regulating the amount of heparan sulfate synthesized was confirmed by analyzing heparan sulfate content in tissues isolated from Ndst2(-/-) mice, which contained reduced levels of the polysaccharide. Detailed disaccharide composition analysis showed no major structural difference between heparan sulfate from control and Ndst2(-/-) tissues, with the exception of heparan sulfate from spleen where the relative amount of trisulfated disaccharides was lowered in the absence of NDST2. In vivo transcript expression levels of the heparan sulfate-polymerizing enzymes Ext1 and Ext2 were also largely unaffected by NDST2 levels, pointing to a mode of regulation other than increased gene transcription. Size estimation of heparan sulfate polysaccharide chains indicated that increased chain lengths in NDST2-overexpressing cells alone could explain the increased heparan sulfate content. A model is discussed where NDST2-specific substrate modification stimulates elongation resulting in increased heparan sulfate chain length."

However, analysis of the potential association between the clinical and virological characteristic and the lineage of influenza B viruses isolated in Thailand was lacking. To investigate influenza B virus genetically and determine its neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor susceptibility phenotype, a total of 6920 nasopharyngeal-wash samples were collected from patients with influenza-like illness between the years 2011 and 2014 and were screened for influenza B virus by real-time PCR. Of these samples, 3.1% (216/6920) were confirmed to contain influenza B viruses, and 110 of these influenza viruses were randomly selected for nucleotide sequence analysis of the HA and NA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA sequences showed clustering into various clades: Yamagata clade 3 (11/110, 10%), Yamagata clade 2 (71/110, 64.5%), and Victoria clade 1 (28/110, 25.5%). The analysis of clinical characteristic demonstrated that the Victoria lineage was significantly associated with the duration of hospitalization, number of deceased cases, pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection and underlying disease. When combined with phylogenetic analysis of the NA sequences, four samples showed viruses with reassortant sequences between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Statistical analysis of the clinical outcomes and demographic data for the reassortant strains did not differ from those of the other strains in circulation. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza B viruses were not detected. Our findings indicated the co-circulation of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages over the past four cold seasons in Bangkok.

The Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HFA) is used to assess visual function yet the spatial summation characteristics are unexplored for the central macular region. We therefore wanted to establish the relationship between contrast sensitivity and stimulus size (spatial summation) within the central 20° visual field using the high sampling density of the 10–2 test grid. Methods Thresholds were measured for one eye from 37 normal subjects using the HFA 10–2 test grid with all five Goldmann (G) targets (GI to GV). Subject data were converted to 50-year-old equivalent using published and calculated location-specific decade correction factors. Spatial summation curves were fitted for all data at all locations. The size of Ricco’s critical area (Ac) within which complete spatial summation operates (k = 1), and the slope of partial summation (k < 1: to characterize partial summation), was established. Results The 50-year-old age normative data were determined for all Goldmann stimulus sizes for the 10–2 HFA test grid and showed a marked change in contrast sensitivity for small test stimuli (e.g. GI) and little change in larger test stimuli (e.g. GV). Both the Ac and k values did not vary with age allowing for the application of the age correction factors. Ac and k values increased with eccentricity with GI remaining within complete spatial summation and GII was close or within complete spatial summation. GIII or larger test sizes were always outside complete spatial summation operating within various levels of partial summation. Conclusions The developed normative data now allows comparisons of data sets with high sampling density using the 10–2 grid irrespective of subject age. Test size is important when assessing ocular disease yet only GI or GII stimuli operate close to or within complete spatial summation in the macula. Current visual field testing protocols employ GIII which is always outside complete spatial summation and operates under various values of partial summation: GIII may not be the most suitable test size to assess ocular disease affecting the macula."

A community periodontal index greater than or equal to code 3 was defined as periodontal disease.Consumption of coffee was significantly higher in the individuals with periodontitis in males. The odds ratios of the percentage of individuals with periodontitis tended to increase with the consumption of coffee. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the male participants were 1, 1.131(0.792-1.617), 1.161(0.857-1.573), 1.053(0.805-1.379), 1.299(1.007-1.676), and 1.458(1.141-1.862) for once per month or less, once per month<x≤3 times per week, three times per week<x≤6 times per week, once per day, twice per day, and three or more per day, respectively.Consumption of coffee may be considered an independent risk indicator of periodontal disease in Korean male adults, and we suggest that the periodontal health of male may benefit from reduction of coffee consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2471191836,"Murine natural killer (NK) cells are regulated by the interaction of Ly49 receptors with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC-I). Although the ligands for inhibitory Ly49 were considered to be restricted to classical MHC (MHC-Ia), we have shown that the non-classical MHC molecule (MHC-Ib) H2-M3 was a ligand for the inhibitory Ly49A. Here we establish that another MHC-Ib, H2-Q10, is a bona fide ligand for the inhibitory Ly49C receptor. H2-Q10 bound to Ly49C with a marginally lower affinity (∼5 μm) than that observed between Ly49C and MHC-Ia (H-2Kb/H-2Dd, both ∼1 μm), and this recognition could be prevented by cis interactions with H-2K in situ. To understand the molecular details underpinning Ly49·MHC-Ib recognition, we determined the crystal structures of H2-Q10 and Ly49C bound H2-Q10. Unliganded H2-Q10 adopted a classical MHC-I fold and possessed a peptide-binding groove that exhibited features similar to those found in MHC-Ia, explaining the diverse peptide binding repertoire of H2-Q10. Ly49C bound to H2-Q10 underneath the peptide binding platform to a region that encompassed residues from the α1, α2, and α3 domains, as well as the associated β2-microglobulin subunit. This docking mode was conserved with that previously observed for Ly49C·H-2Kb. Indeed, structure-guided mutation of Ly49C indicated that Ly49C·H2-Q10 and Ly49C·H-2Kb possess similar energetic footprints focused around residues located within the Ly49C β4-stand and L5 loop, which contact the underside of the peptide-binding platform floor. Our data provide a structural basis for Ly49·MHC-Ib recognition and demonstrate that MHC-Ib represent an extended family of ligands for Ly49 molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2467987688,"N-(2-Chloro-4-pyridyl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU) is a highly active cytokinin-like plant growth regulator that promotes chlorophyll biosynthesis, cell division, and cell expansion. It also increases fruit set and accelerates fruit enlargement. However, there has been no report about the effect of CPPU on fruit development and its physiological mechanism in macadamia. In this study, we investigated the effect of CPPU treatment at early fruit development via foliar spray or raceme soaking at 20 mg·L-1 on fruit set and related physiology in macadamia. Changes in carbohydrate contents and endogenous hormones in leaves, bearing shoots and fruit were also examined. Results showed that CPPU significantly reduced young fruit drop and delayed the wave of fruit drop by 1-2 weeks. The treatment significantly decreased the contents of total soluble sugars and starch in the leaves, but increased them in the bearing shoots and total soluble sugars in the husk (pericarp) and seeds. These findings suggested that CPPU promoted carbohydrate mobilization from the leaves to the fruit. In addition, CPPU increased the contents of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin acid (GA3), and zeatin riboside (ZR) and decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) in the husk. Therefore, CPPU treatment reduced the early fruit drop by increasing carbohydrate availability and by modifying the balance among endogenous hormones."

Lunapark (Lnp) localizes to and stabilizes ER three-way junctions by antagonizing the small GTPase Atlastin, but how Lnp shapes the ER network is unclear. Here, we used an affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry to identify Lnp as an interacting partner of the ER protein quality control ubiquitin ligase gp78. Accordingly, Lnp purified from mammalian cells has a ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. Intriguingly, biochemical analyses show that this activity can be attributed not only to associated ubiquitin ligase, but also to an intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity borne by Lnp itself. This activity is contained in the N-terminal 45 amino acids of Lnp although this segment does not share homology to any known ubiquitin ligase motifs. Despite its interaction with gp78, Lnp does not seem to have a broad function in degradation of misfolded ER proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2468509918,"Electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus can motivate feeding or can serve as a reward in its own right. It remains unclear whether the same or independent but anatomically overlapping circuitries mediate the two effects. Electrical stimulation findings implicate medial forebrain bundle (MFB) fibers of passage in both effects, and optogenetic studies confirm a contribution from fibers originating in the lateral hypothalamic area and projecting to or through the ventral tegmental area. Here we report that optogenetic activation of ventral tegmental fibers from cells of origin in more anterior or posterior portions of the MFB failed to induce either reward or feeding. The feeding and reward induced by optogenetic activation of fibers from the lateral hypothalamic cells of origin were influenced similarly by variations in stimulation pulse width and pulse frequency, consistent with the hypothesis of a common substrate for the two effects. There were, however, several cases where feeding but not self-stimulation or self-stimulation but not feeding were induced, consistent with the hypothesis that distinct but anatomically overlapping systems mediate the two effects. Thus while optogenetic stimulation provides a more selective tool for characterizing the mechanisms of stimulation-induced feeding and reward, it does not yet resolve the question of common or independent substrates."

Extensive work has provided insight into the mechanisms underlying IKKβ activation through the identification of context-specific regulators.

Here, we identified KLHL21, a member of the Kelch-like gene family, as a novel negative regulator of IKKβ. The expression of KLHL21 was rapidly down-regulated in macrophages upon treatment with proinflammatory stimuli. Overexpression of KLHL21 inhibited the activation of IKKβ and degradation of IκBα, whereas KLHL21 depletion via siRNA showed the opposite results. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that KLHL21 specifically bound to the kinase domain of IKKβ via its Kelch domains and that this interaction was gradually attenuated upon TNFα treatment. Furthermore, KLHL21 did not disrupt the interaction between IKKβ and TAK1, TRAF2, or IκBα. Also, KLHL21 did not require its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for IKKβ inhibition.

Various stimuli, including pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns as well as proinflammatory factors (e.g. TNFα and IL-1β), trigger specific signaling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-κB. Most of these diverse pathways converge on the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which phosphorylates specific serine residues on the classical NF-κB inhibitors, IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ. Phosphorylated IκB proteins are targeted for ubiquitination and rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, resulting in the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB proteins (2Hayden M.S.

A previous study demonstrated that KLHL21 is required for successful cytokinesis by regulating translocation of the chromosomal passenger complex from chromosomes to the spindle midzone during anaphase (20Maerki S.

Mechanistically, KLHL21 interacts with Cul3 to mediate the ubiquitination of aurora B kinase in vitro (20Maerki S. Olma M.H. Staubli T. Steigemann P. Gerlich D.W. Quadroni M. Sumara I. Peter M.

However, the functions of KLHL21 in other cellular processes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that KLHL21 is a novel negative regulator of IKKβ. Exogenous expression of KLHL21 suppressed TNFα-stimulated IKKβ activation, resulting in reduced NF-κB signaling, whereas depletion of KLHL21 led to enhanced IKKβ activity. This inhibitory function of KLHL21 was independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which IKKβ is regulated in cells. To identify novel genes regulated by LPS (specific agonist of TLR4 receptor) treatment, we performed a comprehensive search of the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The expression of Klhl21 was consistently down-regulated in RAW264.7 monocytic macrophage cells upon LPS treatment (GEO accession number GDS1043) (21Murray R.Z. Wylie F.G. Khromykh T. Hume D.A.

Taken together, these findings suggest that down-regulation of Klhl21 may be a general consequence of the inflammatory response and that KLHL21 might contribute to the regulation of related cellular processes. We confirmed that LPS treatment induced rapid down-regulation of Klhl21 in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1A). KLHL21 mRNA levels were lowest by 4 h after treatment, representing <10% of the levels observed in untreated cells, before gradually increasing and reaching their peak (about 70% of the levels of untreated cells) around 24 h. However, levels cannot be completely restored even extending LPS treatment to 48 h (Fig. 1A). We observed a similar Klhl21 expression trend in LPS-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 1B). KLHL21 protein abundance also appeared to be temporally regulated, decreasing dramatically in RAW264.7 cells at 1 h after LPS treatment, followed by a steady increase (Fig. 1C). Further analysis revealed that Klhl21 mRNA levels were down-regulated in RAW264.7 cells exposed to Pam2CSK4 (TLR2/6 agonist), Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), or ODN1826 (TLR9 agonist) (Fig. 1, D and E). Treatment with TNFα also resulted in reduced expression of Klhl21 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that rapid down-regulation of Klhl21 may be a general phenomenon in response to extracellular proinflammatory stimuli in macrophages. To investigate the potential roles of KLHL21 in the inflammatory process, we first assessed its impact on NF-κB signaling. KLHL21 was coexpressed with known inducers of NF-κB signaling in HEK293T cells carrying an NF-κB luciferase reporter. Coexpression of KLHL21 and TRAF2 (upstream regulator of the TNFR1 signaling pathway), TRAF6 (upstream regulator of the TLRs and IL-1R signaling pathways), TBK1, or the IKKβ (SS/EE) constitutively active mutant (Ser-177/181 to Glu mutations) resulted in significant inhibition of NF-κB activation (Fig. 2A). Conversely, KLHL21 had no effect on p65 (RelA)-mediated NF-κB activity (Fig. 2A). Similar findings were obtained in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). Coexpression of KLHL21 and the IKKβ (SS/EE) mutant suppressed luciferase expression driven by the mouse NFKBIA (encoding IκBα, a NF-κB transcriptional target) promoter (Fig. 2C). Moreover, overexpression of KLHL21 inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB-luciferase activity in HEK293T cells and IL-1β-induced NF-κB-luciferase activity in HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). These results strongly imply that KLHL21 might function downstream of IKKβ and upstream of p65 to inhibit NF-κB activation. In resting cells, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm when bound to inhibitory IκB proteins. The ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBs, especially IκBα, releases bound NF-κB and leads to its nuclear translocation (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). Given our observation that KLHL21 inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, we analyzed its effect on the nuclear translocation of p65/RelA in HEK293T cells upon TNFα treatment. Overexpression of KLHL21 suppressed p65/RelA nuclear translocation after 10 and 30 min of TNFα treatment, but nuclear p65/RelA reached levels similar to control cells by 60 min posttreatment (Fig. 3A). These results reveal that overexpressing KLHL21 inhibits the early phase of NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation after TNFα treatment, thereby attenuating NF-κB activation. We then examined the effects of KLHL21 on IκBα degradation. In control cells, TNFα treatment induced rapid degradation of IκBα, followed by its reaccumulation (Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, overexpression of KLHL21 suppressed the degradation and reaccumulation of IκBα (Fig. 3B, right). To corroborate these findings, we introduced chemosynthesized siRNA to knock down KLHL21 in HEK293T cells and confirmed reduced mRNA (Fig. 3C) and protein (Fig. 3D) levels. KLHL21 depletion did not affect IκBα protein in resting cells, but it enhanced the degradation of TNFα-induced IκBα (Fig. 3D). Prior phosphorylation of both Ser-32 and Ser-36 is required for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBα protein (2Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-κB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of KLHL21 overexpression on TNFα-induced phosphorylation of IκBα. In response to TNFα treatment, the amount of phosphorylated IκBα (Ser-32) increased substantially in control cells but was significantly suppressed in cells overexpressing KLHL21 (Fig. 3E). In contrast, knocking down KLHL21 with specific siRNAs enhanced the phosphorylation of IκBα in HEK293T cells upon TNFα treatment (Fig. 3F). Our findings that KLHL21 suppressed TNFα-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBα as well as the IKKβ (SS/EE) mutant-induced activation of NF-κB further suggest that KLHL21 might act directly on the IKK complex and inhibit its activity. To identify potential interacting partners of KLHL21 in the NF-κB signaling pathway, FLAG-tagged KLHL21 protein was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. Putative interactions between KLHL21 and endogenous IKKβ, IκBα, and p65 were examined by coimmunoprecipitation assays. The interaction between KLHL21 and Cullin3 was included as a positive control (20Maerki S. Olma M.H. Staubli T. Steigemann P. Gerlich D.W. Quadroni M. Sumara I. Peter M. The Cul3-KLHL21 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets aurora B to midzone microtubules in anaphase and is required for cytokinesis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Only IKKβ specifically interacted with KLHL21 (Fig. 4A). An interaction between endogenous IKKβ and KLHL21 was also observed in HEK293T and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting a physiologically relevant role for this association. KLHL21 and IKKβ demonstrated a direct interaction by in vitro GST pull-down assays (Fig. 4C) and colocalized in HeLa cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, interaction between KLHL21 with IKKα and NEMO (other components of the IKK complex) was also detected in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4E), demonstrating that KLHL21 specifically interacts with the IKK complex in cells. To define the nature of the KLHL21-IKKβ interaction under inflammatory conditions, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays in TNFα-treated HEK293T cells and found that their interaction was gradually attenuated upon TNFα treatment, significantly reduced after 10 min (Fig. 4F). It led to the release of IKKβ, which can then be activated by its upstream inducers subsequently. It is consistent with the above findings that overexpression of KLHL21 inhibited the early phase of p65 nuclear translocation after TNF treatment. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that KLHL21 directly interacts with the IKK complex under both transient and endogenous circumstances and that TNFα-mediated immune responses may perturb this interaction to activate NF-κB signaling. IKKβ contains an N-terminal KD, a ubiquitin-like domain, an elongated, α-helical scaffold/dimerization domain, and a C-terminal NEMO-binding domain (27Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X. Jiang X. Dreano M. Karin M. Wu H. Crystal structure of inhibitor of κB kinase β.Nature. 2011; 472: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To identify the domain of IKKβ through which the interaction with KLHL21 occurs, we generated five deletion mutants of mouse IKKβ and examined their abilities to interact with wild-type KLHL21 (Fig. 5A). Similar to wild-type IKKβ, deletion mutants M3 (containing KD only), M4 (lacking the scaffold/dimerization domain and NEMO-binding domain), and M5 (lacking the NEMO-binding domain) were efficiently coprecipitated with KLHL21 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal KD (mutant M1) dramatically reduced the ability of KLHL21 to coisolate with IKKβ. The interaction between KLHL21 and IKKβ was completely abolished when both KD and ubiquitin-like domains were deleted (mutant M2) (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the KD of IKKβ is critical for association with KLHL21. Next, to identify the domain of KLHL21 responsible for interaction with IKKβ, we generated four deletion mutants (Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4) of mouse KLHL21 (Fig. 5B). Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that deletion mutants Δ3 and Δ4 (both containing Kelch domains) were coisolated with IKKβ. Deletion of the Kelch domains of KLHL21 (mutants Δ1 and Δ2) abolished the interaction with IKKβ. These results revealed that the C-terminal Kelch domains were required for KLHL21 to interact with IKKβ. Point mutant KLHL21M (D114A/L115A/Q117A), which is unable to bind CUL3 (Fig. 5C) (20Maerki S. Olma M.H. Staubli T. Steigemann P. Gerlich D.W. Quadroni M. Sumara I. Peter M. The Cul3-KLHL21 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets aurora B to midzone microtubules in anaphase and is required for cytokinesis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was also coisolated with IKKβ (Fig. 5B). This finding reveals that the BTB domain of KLHL21 is unnecessary for association with IKKβ. KEAP1, another member of the KLHL gene family, binds to a unique (E/A)TGE motif in the KD of IKKβ via its Kelch domains and promotes the degradation of IKKβ (11Kim J.E. You D.J. Lee C. Ahn C. Seong J.Y. Hwang J.I. Suppression of NF-κB signaling by KEAP1 regulation of IKKβ activity through autophagic degradation and inhibition of phosphorylation.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L. Lai C.C.

To test whether KLHL21 also binds to this unique motif, Glu-39 of the mouse IKKβ motif was mutated (E39A). Consistent with previous reports, the E39A mutation dramatically reduced the interaction between IKKβ and KEAP1 (11Kim J.E. You D.J. Lee C. Ahn C. Seong J.Y. Hwang J.I. Suppression of NF-κB signaling by KEAP1 regulation of IKKβ activity through autophagic degradation and inhibition of phosphorylation.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W. Ding Q. Liao T.L. Lai C.C.

Cell. 2009; 36: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but it had no effect on the interaction between KLHL21 and IKKβ (Fig. 5D). These results imply that KLHL21 is unlikely to compete with KEAP1 for binding to this unique motif within the KD of IKKβ in cells. Activation of the IKK complex, especially via phosphorylation of both Ser-177 and Ser-181 within the KD of IKKβ, is the key step driving stimulation of NF-κB signaling. Given our observations that KLHL21 binds to the KD of IKKβ and inhibits the activation of NF-κB signaling, we hypothesized that KLHL21 may regulate the phosphorylation of IKKβ. Overexpression of IKKβ in HEK293T cells resulted in its autophosphorylation, which was dramatically suppressed when KLHL21 was coexpressed (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the KLHL21M mutant functioned similarly to wild-type KLHL21 (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that KLHL21 inhibits the activation of IKKβ independently of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Moreover, overexpression of KLHL21 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of endogenous IKKα/β (Ser-177) induced by TNFα treatment (Fig. 6B). Conversely, siRNA-mediated depletion of KLHL21 resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of IKKα/β (Ser-177) in response to TNFα treatment without affecting total endogenous IKKβ protein levels (Fig. 6C). To rule out off-target effects, we performed a rescue experiment where HEK293T cells were cotransfected with siRNA specifically targeting human KLHL21 and mCherry-tagged wild-type or enzymatically inactive mutant of mouse KLHL21 construct. Consistent with above findings, knocking down KLHL21 promoted the phosphorylation of IKKβ and IκBα and the degradation of IκBα in HEK293T cells exposed to TNFα (Fig. 6D, lane 4), whereas coexpression of either WT KLHL21 or E3 ligase activity-inactive mutant KLHL21M reversed these effects (Fig. 6D, lanes 6 and 8). This result further confirmed our observation that KLHL21 negatively regulates TNFα-induced IKKβ activation, which is independent of its E3 ligase activity. KLHL21 interacts with Cul3 and mediates the ubiquitination of aurora B kinase in vitro (20Maerki S. Olma M.H. Staubli T. Steigemann P. Gerlich D.W. Quadroni M. Sumara I. Peter M. The Cul3-KLHL21 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets aurora B to midzone microtubules in anaphase and is required for cytokinesis.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether KLHL21 plays a role in the ubiquitination of IKKβ. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, long-term exposure of the nitrocellulose membrane revealed smeared bands of polyubiquitinated IKKβ in HEK293T cells (Fig. 6E). Overexpression of either wild-type KLHL21 or the KLHL21M mutant failed to enhance the ubiquitination of IKKβ (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, exogenously expressed KLHL21 did not significantly affect endogenous levels of IKKβ protein (Fig. 6B). These results further demonstrate that KLHL21 is unlikely to target IKKβ endogenously through its E3 ubiquitin ligase function. Given our observations that KLHL21 efficiently inhibited TBK1-, TRAF2-, and TRAF6-induced activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2A), we next tested whether KLHL21 can bind directly to TBK1, TRAF2, or TRAF6.

https://openalex.org/W2471843487,"The habenulae are highly conserved nuclei in the dorsal diencephalon that connect the forebrain to the midbrain and hindbrain. These nuclei have been implicated in a broad variety of behaviours in humans, primates, rodents and zebrafish. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms that control the genesis and differentiation of neural progenitors in the habenulae remain relatively unknown. We have previously shown that, in zebrafish, the timing of habenular neurogenesis is left-right asymmetric and that in the absence of Nodal signalling this asymmetry is lost. Here, we show that habenular neurogenesis requires the homeobox transcription factor Pax6a and the redundant action of two proneural bHLH factors, Neurog1 and Neurod4. We present evidence that Hedgehog signalling is required for the expression of pax6a, which is in turn necessary for the expression of neurog1 and neurod4. Finally, we demonstrate by pharmacological inhibition that Hedgehog signalling is required continuously during habenular neurogenesis and by cell transplantation experiments that pathway activation is required cell autonomously. Our data sheds light on the mechanism underlying habenular development that may provide insights into how Nodal signalling imposes asymmetry on the timing of habenular neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2460581228,"Larvae of holometabolous insects must determine the timing of their metamorphosis. How they determine this timing has only been studied in detail for a few insect species. In a few species of Coleoptera, starvation is known to be a cue for metamorphosis, leading to the formation of smaller adults (starvation-induced pupation, SiP). We investigated the occurrence of SiP in the beetle Psacothea hilaris. When P. hilaris larvae were starved late in the feeding phase of the last (5th) instar, they exhibited typical SiP characterized by constancy of the time from food deprivation to pupation (TTP) irrespective of the body weight upon food deprivation or the length of prior feeding. In contrast, when larvae were starved early in the feeding phase, TTP decreased by roughly 1 day as the feeding became 1 day longer. The change in the response to starvation was estimated to occur on day 5.9 in the last instar. A series of refeeding experiments suggested that whereas SiP occurred readily in the larvae starved in the late feeding phase, activation of SiP was suspended until day 5.9 in the larvae starved early in the feeding phase. When P. hilaris larvae were fed continuously, they eventually ceased feeding spontaneously and pupated. The time length between spontaneous cessation of feeding and pupation was approximately equal to the TTP in SiP. This suggests that the same mechanism was activated by food deprivation in the late feeding phase and by spontaneous cessation of ad libitum feeding."

Expanded pigmented cells were purified by plate adhesion after Accutase® treatment. Enriched cells were cultured until they developed a cobblestone appearance with cuboidal shape. The characteristics of iPS-RPE were confirmed by gene expression, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy. Functions and immunologic features of the iPS-RPE were also evaluated.We obtained iPS-RPE at high purity (approximately 98%). The iPS-RPE showed apical-basal polarity and cellular structure characteristic of RPE. Expression levels of several RPE markers were lower than those of freshly isolated mouse RPE but comparable to those of primary cultured RPE. The iPS-RPE could form tight junctions, phagocytose photoreceptor outer segments, express immune antigens, and suppress lymphocyte proliferation.We successfully developed a differentiation/purification protocol to obtain mouse iPS-RPE. The mouse iPS-RPE can serve as an attractive tool for functional and morphological studies of RPE."
https://openalex.org/W2464132528,"Plant–animal interactions imply costs and benefits with net balance depending on interacting species and ecological context. Ungulates, in particular, confer costs (e.g., plant leaf consumption, flower bud predation) and benefits (e.g., plant overcompensation, seed dispersal) to plants. Magnitude of costs and benefits may be altered by habitat management or ecological conditions favoring high density ungulate populations. Little is known however on whether plant costs or benefits predominate over the years, or the long-term outcomes of plant-animal interactions in habitat types sustaining high density ungulate populations. We investigated how high density ungulate populations alter plant costs and benefits by quantifying ungulate long-term effects on the shrub Cistus ladanifer (Cistaceae) individual size, seed weight and number, seed bank, and population density, through a 12-year ungulate exclusion experiment in a Mediterranean scrubland. We monitored plant size and flower buds in plants exposed or protected from ungulates and number of developed capsules and seeds consumed (potential seed dispersal) by ungulates during three reproductive seasons. We found that ungulates negatively affected shrub size and led to a dramatically decline of shrub reproductive structures and seed production, affecting the plant reproductive cycle. Number of buds was 27 times higher and number of developed seed 5 times higher in ungulate-excluded as compared to ungulate-exposed plots. After 9 years of ungulate exclusion, the C. ladanifer seed bank was 2.6 times higher in ungulate-excluded plots. The population density of C. ladanifer was 4 times higher in ungulate-excluded plots. Our long-term experiment showed that high density ungulate populations can alter plant-animal interactions by reducing plant benefits and increasing plant costs."
https://openalex.org/W2467667878,"Interferon signaling plays important roles in both intestinal homeostasis and in the host response to pathogen infection. The extent to which bacterial pathogens inhibit this host pathway is an understudied area of investigation. We characterized Citrobacter rodentium strains bearing deletions in individual type III secretion system effector genes to determine whether this pathogen inhibits the host type I IFN response and which effector is responsible. The NleB effector limited host IFN-β production by inhibiting Lys(63)-linked ubiquitination of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). Inhibition was dependent on the glycosyltransferase activity of NleB. GAPDH, a target of NleB during infection, bound to TRAF3 and was required for maximal TRAF3 ubiquitination. NleB glycosyltransferase activity inhibited GAPDH-TRAF3 binding, resulting in reduced TRAF3 ubiquitination. Collectively, our data reveal important interplay between GAPDH and TRAF3 and suggest a mechanism by which the NleB effector inhibits type I IFN signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2469481968,"The facultative anaerobic bacterium Escherichia coli is frequently forced to adapt to changing environmental conditions. One important determinant for metabolism is the availability of oxygen allowing a more efficient metabolism. Especially in large scale bioreactors, the distribution of oxygen is inhomogeneous and individual cells encounter frequent changes. This might contribute to observed yield losses during process upscaling. Short-term gene expression data exist of an anaerobic E. coli batch culture shifting to aerobic conditions. The data reveal temporary upregulation of genes that are less efficient in terms of energy conservation than the genes predicted by conventional flux balance analyses. In this study, we provide evidence for a positive correlation between metabolic fluxes and gene expression. We then hypothesize that the more efficient enzymes are limited by their low expression, restricting flux through their reactions. We define a demand that triggers expression of the demanded enzymes that we explicitly include in our model. With these features we propose a method, demand-directed dynamic flux balance analysis, dddFBA, bringing together elements of several previously published methods. The introduction of additional flux constraints proportional to gene expression provoke a temporary demand for less efficient enzymes, which is in agreement with the transient upregulation of these genes observed in the data. In the proposed approach, the applied objective function of growth rate maximization together with the introduced constraints triggers expression of metabolically less efficient genes. This finding is one possible explanation for the yield losses observed in large scale bacterial cultivations where steady oxygen supply cannot be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2460878039,"Cochlear and deep brain implants are prominent examples for neuronal prostheses with clinical relevance. Current research focuses on the improvement of the long-term functionality and the size reduction of neural interface electrodes. A promising approach is the application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), either as pure electrodes but especially as coating material for electrodes. The interaction of CNTs with neuronal cells has shown promising results in various studies, but these appear to depend on the specific type of neurons as well as on the kind of nanotubes. To evaluate a potential application of carbon nanotube coatings for cochlear electrodes, it is necessary to investigate the cytocompatibility of carbon nanotube coatings on platinum for the specific type of neuron in the inner ear, namely spiral ganglion neurons. In this study we have combined the chemical processing of as-delivered CNTs, the fabrication of coatings on platinum, and the characterization of the electrical properties of the coatings as well as a general cytocompatibility testing and the first cell culture investigations of CNTs with spiral ganglion neurons. By applying a modification process to three different as-received CNTs via a reflux treatment with nitric acid, long-term stable aqueous CNT dispersions free of dispersing agents were obtained. These were used to coat platinum substrates by an automated spray-coating process. These coatings enhance the electrical properties of platinum electrodes, decreasing the impedance values and raising the capacitances. Cell culture investigations of the different CNT coatings on platinum with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest an overall good cytocompatibility of these coatings. For spiral ganglion neurons, this can also be observed but a desired positive effect of the CNTs on the neurons is absent. Furthermore, we found that the well-established DAPI staining assay does not function on the coatings prepared from single-wall nanotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2462692469,"Background Subclinical infections in endemic areas of Southeast Asia sustain malaria transmission. These asymptomatic infections might sustain immunity against clinical malaria and have been considered benign for the host, but if they are associated with chronic low-grade inflammation this could be harmful. We conducted a case-control study to explore the association between subclinical malaria and C-reactive protein (CRP), an established biomarker of inflammation. Methods Blood samples from asymptomatic villagers in Pailin, Western Cambodia were tested for malaria by high-volume ultra-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (uPCR) to determine the Plasmodium species. Plasma CRP concentration was measured in 328 individuals with parasitaemia (cases) and compared with: i) the same individual’s value at the first time point when they had no detectable parasites (n = 282); and ii) age- sex- and village-matched controls (n = 328) free of Plasmodium infection. Plasma CRP concentrations were compared against thresholds of 3mg/L and 10mg/L. Subgroup analysis was carried out for cases with P vivax and P falciparum mono-infections. Results Median plasma CRP level for all samples was 0.59mg/L (interquartile range: 0.24–1.64mg/L). CRP concentrations were higher in parasitaemic individuals compared with same-person-controls (p = 0.050); and matched-controls (p = 0.025). 4.9% of samples had CRP concentrations above 10mg/L and 14.6% were above 3mg/L. Cases were more likely to have plasma CRP concentrations above these thresholds than age/sex matched controls, odds ratio 3.5 (95%CI 1.5–9.8) and 1.8 (95%CI 1.1–2.9), respectively. Amongst cases, parasite density and CRP were positively correlated (p<0.001), an association that remained significant when controlling for age and fever. Individuals with P.vivax mono-infections had the highest plasma CRP concentrations with the greatest association with parasitaemia. Discussion In this setting persistent malaria infections in asymptomatic individuals were associated with moderately elevated plasma CRP concentrations; chiefly evident in cases with P.vivax mono-infections. As well as interrupting malaria transmission within the community, treatment of asymptomatic malaria infections, in particular radical cure of vivax malaria, may benefit the health of infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2470137877,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate how stretch reflex (SR) responses in the ankle extensor (soleus: SOL) and flexor (tibialis anterior: TA) muscles would be modulated with temporal and/or spatial predictions of external perturbations and whether their effects are specific to the standing posture. SR responses in the SOL/TA were elicited by imposing quick ankle toes-up/toes-down rotations while standing upright and in the supine position. We designed four experimental conditions based on pre-information about perturbations: no information (No Cue), the timing of the perturbation onset (TIM), the direction of the perturbation (DIR), and both the timing and direction of the perturbation (TIM/DIR). Each condition was separated and its order was counterbalanced. In the SR of TA evoked by toes-down rotation, integrated electromyography activities of the late component were significantly reduced in the TIM and TIM/DIR conditions as compared with those in the No Cue and DIR conditions. The occurrence rate of late SR components that reflects how often the reflex response was observed was also lower in the TIM and TIM/DIR conditions as compared with that in the No Cue and DIR conditions. On the other hand, no significant changes were seen among the four conditions in the early SR component in the TA and both SR components in the SOL. The same results in the occurrence rate were found in the supine position. The present results suggest (1) only temporal predictions have a remarkable effect on the SR excitability of the TA, and (2) this effect is independent of posture."

Large-scale food fortification is considered a cost-effective approach to deliver micronutrients, and fortification of salt (iodine), wheat flour (iron and folic acid), and vegetable oil (vitamin A) is mandatory in Côte d’Ivoire. A cross-sectional survey on households with at least one child 6–23 months was conducted to update coverage figures with adequately fortified food vehicles in Abidjan, the capital of and largest urban community in Côte d’Ivoire, and to evaluate whether additional iron and vitamin A intake is sufficient to bear the potential to reduce micronutrient malnutrition. Information on demographics and food consumption was collected, along with samples of salt and oil. Wheat flour was sampled from bakeries and retailers residing in the selected clusters. In Abidjan, 86% and 97% of salt and vegetable oil samples, respectively, were adequately fortified, while only 32% of wheat flour samples were adequately fortified, but all samples contained some added iron. There were no major differences in additional vitamin A and iron intake between poor and non-poor households. For vitamin A in oil, the additional percentage of the recommended nutrient intake was 27% and 40% for children 6–23 months and women of reproductive age, respectively, while for iron from wheat flour, only 13% and 19% could be covered. Compared to previous estimates, coverage has remained stable for salt and wheat flour, but improved for vegetable oil. Fortification of vegetable oil clearly provides a meaningful additional amount of vitamin A. This is not currently the case for iron, due to the low fortification levels. Iron levels in wheat flour should be increased and monitored, and additional vehicles should be explored to add iron to the Ivorian diet."
https://openalex.org/W2463879412,"Decades of intensive experimental studies of the recognition of DNA sequences by proteins have provided us with a view of a diverse and complicated world in which few to no features are shared between individual DNA-binding protein families. The originally conceived direct readout of DNA residue sequences by amino acid side chains offers very limited capacity for sequence recognition, while the effects of the dynamic properties of the interacting partners remain difficult to quantify and almost impossible to generalise. In this work we investigated the energetic characteristics of all DNA residue-amino acid side chain combinations in the conformations found at the interaction interface in a very large set of protein-DNA complexes by the means of empirical potential-based calculations. General specificity-defining criteria were derived and utilised to look beyond the binding motifs considered in previous studies. Linking energetic favourability to the observed geometrical preferences, our approach reveals several additional amino acid motifs which can distinguish between individual DNA bases. Our results remained valid in environments with various dielectric properties."
https://openalex.org/W2465255227,"Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene (FLT3-ITD) are associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Due to the development of drug resistance, few FLT3-ITD inhibitors are effective against FLT3-ITD+ AML. In this study, we show that FLT3-ITD activates a novel pathway involving p21Cdkn1a (p21) and pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) that attenuates FLT3-ITD cell proliferation and is involved in the development of drug resistance. FLT3-ITD up-regulated p21 expression in both mouse bone marrow c-kit+-Sca-1+-Lin- (KSL) cells and Ba/F3 cells. The loss of p21 expression enhanced growth factor-independent proliferation and sensitivity to cytarabine as a consequence of concomitantly enriching the S+G2/M phase population and significantly increasing the expression of Pbx1, but not Evi-1, in FLT3-ITD+ cells. This enhanced cell proliferation following the loss of p21 was partially abrogated when Pbx1 expression was silenced in FLT3-ITD+ primary bone marrow colony-forming cells and Ba/F3 cells. When FLT3-ITD was antagonized with AC220, a selective inhibitor of FLT3-ITD, p21 expression was decreased coincident with Pbx1 mRNA up-regulation and a rapid decline in the number of viable FLT3-ITD+ Ba/F3 cells; however, the cells eventually became refractory to AC220. Overexpressing p21 in FLT3-ITD+ Ba/F3 cells delayed the emergence of cells that were refractory to AC220, whereas p21 silencing accelerated their development. These data indicate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inhibiting FLT3-ITD+ cell proliferation through the p21/Pbx1 axis and that treatments that antagonize FLT3-ITD contribute to the subsequent development of cells that are refractory to a FLT3-ITD inhibitor by disrupting p21 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2515594871,"Human Cys-loop receptors are important therapeutic targets. High-resolution structures are essential for rational drug design, but only a few are available due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of protein suitable for structural studies. Although expression of proteins in E. coli offers advantages of high yield, low cost, and fast turnover, this approach has not been thoroughly explored for full-length human Cys-loop receptors because of the conventional wisdom that E. coli lacks the specific chaperones and post-translational modifications potentially required for expression of human Cys-loop receptors. Here we report the successful production of full-length wild type human α7nAChR from E. coli. Chemically induced chaperones promote high expression levels of well-folded proteins. The choice of detergents, lipids, and ligands during purification determines the final protein quality. The purified α7nAChR not only forms pentamers as imaged by negative-stain electron microscopy, but also retains pharmacological characteristics of native α7nAChR, including binding to bungarotoxin and positive allosteric modulators specific to α7nAChR. Moreover, the purified α7nAChR injected into Xenopus oocytes can be activated by acetylcholine, choline, and nicotine, inhibited by the channel blockers QX-222 and phencyclidine, and potentiated by the α7nAChR specific modulators PNU-120596 and TQS. The successful generation of functional human α7nAChR from E. coli opens a new avenue for producing mammalian Cys-loop receptors to facilitate structure-based rational drug design. Human Cys-loop receptors are important therapeutic targets. High-resolution structures are essential for rational drug design, but only a few are available due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of protein suitable for structural studies. Although expression of proteins in E. coli offers advantages of high yield, low cost, and fast turnover, this approach has not been thoroughly explored for full-length human Cys-loop receptors because of the conventional wisdom that E. coli lacks the specific chaperones and post-translational modifications potentially required for expression of human Cys-loop receptors. Here we report the successful production of full-length wild type human α7nAChR from E. coli. Chemically induced chaperones promote high expression levels of well-folded proteins. The choice of detergents, lipids, and ligands during purification determines the final protein quality.

Among the human Cys-loop receptors, high-resolution structures have been obtained for only the β3 GABAA and α3 glycine receptors (6Miller P.S. Aricescu A.R.

The dichotomy between the small number of available structures and the relatively large receptor population in the superfamily indicates the technical difficulties for structural determination of these receptors.

U.S.A. 2015; 112: 2865-2870Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) cell lines. We chose an alternate approach: to produce functional full-length human α7nAChR in E. coli. Production of recombinant proteins in E. coli is fast and inexpensive relative to other expression systems. In addition, E. coli may produce a more homogeneous population of purified proteins due to its limited ability for post-translational modifications (23Cain J.A. Solis N. Cordwell S.J. Beyond gene expression: the impact of protein post-translational modifications in bacteria.J. Proteom. 2014; 97: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, the native pathway for α7nAChR expression in mammalian cells involves subcellular trafficking through multiple subcellular compartments, where specific chaperone proteins and post-translational modifications aid folding and assembly. Thus, α7nAChR purified from mammalian or insect cells contain a mixture of receptors with different post-translational modifications representing various stages of maturation, including glycosylation, palmitoylation, and alternate disulfide conformations (24Millar N.S. Harkness P.C. Assembly and trafficking of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Review).Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Drisdel R.C. Manzana E.

Ion-channel assembly.Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 280-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These modifications were reported to be essential for the proper assembly and navigation of functional α7nAChR to the mammalian cell surface (24Millar N.S. Harkness P.C. Assembly and trafficking of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Review).Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that these modifications are not needed for the proper folding and pentameric assembly of α7nAChR in the simpler expression environment of E. coli. Here we report that α7nAChR purified from E. coli retains signature properties of native α7nAChR, including the ability to assemble into pentameric structures, to bind specific ligands, and to form functional ion channels that can be activated by agonists, inhibited by channel blockers, and enhanced by α7nAChR-specific positive allosteric modulators. The study demonstrates that E. coli is capable of producing human Cys-loop receptors. It also suggests that the post-translational machinery may not be as essential as previously thought for expressing functional complex membrane proteins. Our expression construct consists of DNA encoding the wild-type full-length human α7nAChR with the signal sequence replaced by that of pelB (a bacterial leader sequence) for expression in E. coli. An 8-histidine tag was added to the C terminus to aid in purification. All subsequent mention of α7nAChR refers to this construct. Initial attempts to express full-length human α7nAChR in E. coli resulted in low expression levels and the formation of inclusion bodies. These problems could not be solved by expression of α7nAChR as a fusion protein with MBP, as a chimera with the bacterial homolog ELIC (27Tillman T.S. Seyoum E. Mowrey D.D. Xu Y. Tang P. ELIC-α7 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) chimeras reveal a prominent role of the extracellular-transmembrane domain interface in allosteric modulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13851-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or with various modifications to the protein sequence including codon optimization, deletion of the intracellular loop between the TM3 and TM4 helices, truncation of the N and C termini, and specific mutagenesis of suspected problem sequences. 3T. S. Tillman and P. Tang, unpublished observations. The most significant improvement in the expression of α7nAChR was achieved by using osmotic shock (0.5 m sorbitol) at low temperature (15 °C) to induce E. coli native chaperones (28de Marco A. Vigh L. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Native folding of aggregation-prone recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli by osmolytes, plasmid- or benzyl alcohol-overexpressed molecular chaperones.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005; 10: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and using the α7nAChR agonist choline as a chemical chaperone (29Molinari E.J. Delbono O. Messi M.L. Renganathan M. Arneric S.P. Sullivan J.P. Gopalakrishnan M. Up-regulation of human α7 nicotinic receptors by chronic treatment with activator and antagonist ligands.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) during induction (Fig. 1a). After testing multiple E. coli strains, we found Rosetta(DE3)pLysS to be most suitable for α7nAChR expression. For the choice of detergents, we found that n-dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) was most effective for extracting α7nAChR from cell membranes. Both DPC and n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) were suitable for purification. Fig. 1b shows the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profile of purified α7nAChR, which is consistent with a pentameric assembly. Under these conditions, we can obtain 1.2 ± 0.2 mg pentameric α7nAChR from each liter induction culture (n = 6). Purified α7nAChR migrates on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight near 50 kDa (Fig. 1c), consistent with the de-glycosylated monomer of α7nAChR (30Rangwala F. Drisdel R.C. Rakhilin S. Ko E. Atluri P. Harkins A.B. Fox A.P. Salman S.S. Green W.N. Neuronal α-bungarotoxin receptors differ structurally from other nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8201-8212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein identity was further confirmed by mass spectrometry, which showed more than 51% coverage of tryptic fragments (Fig. 1d). Although the C terminus was not identified by mass spectrometry, the full-length α7nAChR was ensured by C-terminal His-tag purification. Representative mass spectra are shown in the supplemental data. We used electron microscopy (EM) to analyze the oligomeric state of α7nAChR. To improve the quality of negative-stain EM images, we reduced excess detergent by exchanging DDM to the chemically similar lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG), which forms micelles at very low concentrations (0.01 mm). In the negative-stain EM images, α7nAChR was observed as discrete particles (Fig. 2a). From 113 micrographs, 7300 particles were sorted into 30 classes by two-dimensional classification (Fig. 2b). Among them, at least 13 classes represent essentially different versions of pentameric particles of ∼6–7 nm in diameter with a pore in the middle (Fig. 2b, white box), accounting for 47% of the particles analyzed (Fig. 2c). The remaining classes may include various tilted views or aberrant particles. Under these sample conditions, α7nAChR appears to prefer an orientation showing the end-on view (i.e. top or bottom), precluding three-dimensional reconstruction. Native human α7nAChR demonstrates nanomolar binding affinity for the antagonist bungarotoxin (31Peng J.H. Fryer J.D. Hurst R.S. Schroeder K.M. George A.A. Morrissy S. Groppi V.E. Leonard S.S.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5867-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We measured binding of bungarotoxin to the purified α7nAChR immobilized on NiNTA plates using a chemiluminescent assay and found an affinity of 4 ± 1 nm (Fig. 3a), which is similar to the reported value of ∼5 nm measured from α7nAChR heterologously expressed in SH-EP1 human epithelial cells (31Peng J.H.

Ther. 2005; 313: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using surface plasmon resonance, we also measured binding affinities of PNU-120596 and TQS to purified α7nAChR immobilized on a NiNTA chip (Fig. 3, b and c). For our purified α7nAChR, PNU-120596 had an apparent disassociation constant (Kd) of 1.1 ± 0.1 μm, which is close to the previously reported half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.6 ± 0.4 μm (32Grønlien J.H. Håkerud M. Ween H. Thorin-Hagene K. Briggs C.A. Gopalakrishnan M. Malysz J. Distinct profiles of α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulation revealed by structurally diverse chemotypes.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). TQS has a relatively lower affinity than PNU-120596 with a Kd of 7.8 ± 3.2 μm, which is similar to the EC50 of 6.2 ± 0.6 μm reported previously (33Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5867-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The results provide convincing evidence that human α7nAChR purified from E. coli retains binding sites for these ligands as observed in native membranes. We measured the functional integrity of purified α7nAChR using quantitative bungarotoxin pull-down experiments and electrophysiology measurements in Xenopus oocytes. α-Bungarotoxin binding to α7nAChR has been used as a measure of functional α7nAChR at the cell surface (34Rakhilin S. Drisdel R.C. Sagher D. McGehee D.S. Vallejo Y. Green W.N. α-bungarotoxin receptors contain α7 subunits in two different disulfide-bonded conformations.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We found that 92.9 ± 0.3% of purified α7nAChR was pulled-down by α-bungarotoxin immobilized to Sepharose resin, as measured by absorbance at A280 (n = 3). The result suggests that most of the purified α7nAChR is folded properly in an active state. Oocytes injected with purified α7nAChR showed activation currents upon applying the agonist choline, acetylcholine, or nicotine in TEVC experiments (Fig. 4a). Note that choline is a selective agonist for α7nAChR (35Alkondon M. Pereira E.F. Cortes W.S. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. Choline is a selective agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the rat brain neurons.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The observed currents from protein injection (6 ± 2 nA, n = 5) are smaller than currents from cRNA injection (150 ± 50 nA, n = 5). The smaller current is typical for purified channel proteins injected into oocytes (36Labriola J.M. Pandhare A. Jansen M. Blanton M.P. Corringer P.J. Baenziger J.E.

Incorporation of reconstituted acetylcholine receptors from Torpedo into the Xenopus oocyte membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8468-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Oocytes tolerate injection of only a limited amount of reconstituted protein. We injected only 5 ng of purified α7nAChR compared with 25 ng of cRNA. Each cRNA molecule can result in hundreds of synthesized protein molecules (39Csárdi G. Franks A. Choi D.S. Airoldi E.M. Drummond D.A. Accounting for experimental noise reveals that mRNA levels, amplified by post-transcriptional processes, largely determine steady-state protein levels in yeast.PLoS Genetics. 2015; 11: e1005206Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is anticipated that cRNA injection will generate many more channels and larger currents than protein injection. The currents were absent from oocytes injected with buffer only (Fig. 4a). Fast activation and desensitization are signature properties of α7nAChR (13Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M.

An expanded time scale demonstrates similar kinetics for currents resulting from protein and cRNA injections (Fig. 4b). Representative traces in Fig. 4c show that the currents were inhibited by channel blockers N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenylcarbamoylmethyl) trimethylammonium chloride (QX-222) (40Cuevas J. Adams D.J.

Furthermore, following an important Phe residue found in human (Phe11) and some bacterial cytochromes (21Kleingardner J.G. Bren K.L.

Substitution of the glutamate residues and insertion of an alanine residue at the corresponding positions in Rhodobacter capsulatus cyt c2 resulted in its maturation by HCCS (27San Francisco B.

The N-terminal α helix-1 of human cyt c consists of an 11-residue sequence (Val4–Lys14) immediately followed by the conserved C15XXC18H19 heme attachment motif (Fig. 2, A and B). α helix-1 includes the Lys8, Ile10, and Phe11 residues that appear to be important for HCCS-mediated maturation due to their putative roles in substrate recognition by HCCS (21Kleingardner J.G.

Second, heme-bound HCCS recognizes, binds to, and positions apocyt c adjacent to the heme with His19 from cyt c acting as the second axial ligand. Third, heme spontaneously forms two thioether bonds to the apocytochrome cysteines at the CXXCH motif. Fourth, the heme-attached cyt c is released from HCCS. The exact roles of the N-terminal α helix-1 residues (e.g. Phe11) in recognition (step 2) and/or thioether attachment (step 3) are unknown. In this study, we engineered human cyt c variants (e.g. deletion of the Met13 residue (ΔM13)) to reflect the sequence properties of bacterial cyt c with resultant poor maturation by HCCS. We examined the biochemical basis behind the inability of HCCS to mature the ΔM13 cyt c variant. We discovered that substrate recognition by HCCS is not defective with the ΔM13 cyt c variant. Rather, the N-terminal α helix-1 of cyt c is responsible for aligning the Cys15 thiol for covalent attachment to the heme 2-vinyl. The ΔM13 cyt c variant does not possess a thioether at the Cys15 position when bound at the HCCS active site. However, in the ΔM13 cyt c variant, His19 forms the axial heme ligand and positions the Cys18 thiol for heme 4-vinyl attachment. These results provide mechanistic insight into step 2 (and consequently step 3) of HCCS-mediated cytochrome c maturation and are depicted in an updated model in Fig. 1. We confirmed these conclusions by engineering a cyt c substrate with a repositioned “Cys15” thiol in the ΔM13 background, creating a unique CXCH motif, which now was matured by HCCS. To determine how sequence variations in the N-terminal region of bacterial c-type cytochromes affect the HCCS-mediated biogenesis of eukaryotic cyt c, we co-expressed human HCCS with human cyt c variants that are analogous to bacterial cytochromes (Fig. 2, A–C). Ser16 and Gln17 were substituted with alanine residues (S16A/Q17A) because the equivalent positions in bacterial cytochromes are variable. These substitutions resulted in near-wild-type (WT) levels of cyt c (Fig. 2C) and thus do not appear to be involved in maturation by HCCS. Changing Lys8 and Ile10 in human cyt c to glutamate (K8E/I10E) resulted in a marked increase in cyt c yield (Fig. 2C). We have not investigated this effect further because ΔM13, which mimics the shifted residue spacing found in bacterial cytochromes (Fig. 2A), resulted in at least a 10-fold decrease in maturation by HCCS (Fig. 2C). The decrease in cyt c was confirmed by UV-visible spectra of purified soluble ΔM13 cyt c when compared with WT cyt c from 1-liter cultures (Fig. 2D). This purified cyt c is termed “released cyt c” because it is released from membrane-bound HCCS into the soluble fraction as described previously (27San Francisco B. Bretsnyder E.C. Kranz R.G. Human mitochondrial holocytochrome c synthase's heme binding, maturation determinants, and complex formation with cytochrome c.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: E788-E797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Levels of released cyt c for the S16A/Q17A variant were the same as WT, whereas the levels of the K8E/I10E and K8E/I10E/ΔM13 variants were 1.8-fold more and 10-fold less than WT, respectively. Other N-terminal α helix-1 deletion variants of cyt c (i.e. ΔI12, ΔK14, ΔM13/ΔS16, and ΔM13/CSAQC) also were poorly matured as determined by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 2, A and E). Combining the Met13 deletion with the Lys8/Ile10 substitutions (K8E/I10E/ΔM13) resulted in a dramatic reduction of holocyt c product (Fig. 2C), effectively negating the increase in cyt c yield gained by the K8E/I10E double mutation. These data indicate that the spatial organization of residues in the N-terminal α helix-1 is of major importance for maturation by HCCS and the major basis behind the inability of HCCS to mature bacterial c-type cytochromes. Following co-expression, a fraction of cyt c can be co-purified in complex with membrane-bound HCCS (27San Francisco B. Bretsnyder E.C. Kranz R.G.

We used this co-purification approach to determine whether ΔM13 cyt c was defective in recognition by HCCS (step 2) or perhaps another step in maturation. HCCS complexes containing cyt c exhibit spectral characteristics that provide insight into the heme environment within the complex (31Babbitt S.E. San Francisco B. Mendez D.L. Lukat-Rodgers G.S.

To determine whether cyt c α helix-1 deletion variants interact with HCCS, we purified recombinantly expressed HCCS from Escherichia coli membranes and probed for co-purified cyt c (Fig. 3, A–C). Similar to WT cyt c (Fig. 3A, lane 1), each deletion variant co-purified with HCCS in a heme-attached state (Fig. 3A). The heme stain shows significant holocyt c in all cases co-purifying with HCCS. This was confirmed by total protein stain (Fig. 3B) and by immunoblotting with antibodies that specifically recognize cyt c (Fig. 3C). However, when we evaluated the UV-visible spectra of the WT, ΔM13, and ΔK14 complexes (Fig. 3D, panels i–iii), complexes with deletion variants exhibited spectral features similar to a C15S cyt c complex (Refs. 27San Francisco B.

When co-purified with HCCS, C15S cyt c is only able to form a single covalent attachment (at Cys18) with heme, yielding a split α absorption peak at wavelength 555–560 nm upon chemical reduction (Refs. 27San Francisco B.

Complexes with C18A cyt c form a single thioether with heme at Cys15 and yield an α peak at ∼560 nm (27San Francisco B. Bretsnyder E.C. Kranz R.G.

The above results suggest that ΔM13 cyt c may only have Cys18 covalently attached when in complex with HCCS. These results were further supported by dithionite-reduced pyridine hemochrome spectra for each of the complexes, which showed α peak maxima at 552.8, 552.4, and 552.5 nm for ΔM13, ΔK14, and the C15S cyt c complexes, respectively (Fig. 3E), values indicative of a single thioether (31Babbitt S.E.

The economic assumption that people would behave focusing on their own material self-interest was proved incomplete, once the empirical evidence consistently showed that many other motives may influence such behaviour. Therefore, models that can incorporate rational decision process as well as other intervening factors are a key issue to both understand the observations from economic experiments and to apply the lessons learned from them. In this paper, we incorporate the influence of emotions to the utility function in an explicit manner, using the Ultimatum Game as a case study. Our model is amenable to analytical study, and is connected with the Circumplex model of emotions and with Kahneman’s two-system theory. The simplicity of the model allows to obtain predictions for the offers and acceptance thresholds. We study two specific examples, when the model parameters are distributed uniformly or normally, and show that in the latter case the results are already qualitatively correct. Although this work can be considered as a first approach, it includes what we believe are the main stylized facts, is able to qualitatively reproduce experimental results in a very simple manner, and can be straightforwardly extended to other games."
https://openalex.org/W2469006844,"Objective Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2a) plays a major role in the progression of disease, although the role of HIF-2α gene polymorphisms in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related diseases remains elusive. The aim of this study is to determine whether HIF-2a rs13419896 and rs6715787 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis (LC), or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method A case-control study of 107 patients with CHB, 83 patients with LC, 234 patients with HCC, and 224 healthy control subjects was carried out, and the HIF-2a rs13419896 and rs6715787 SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results No significant differences were observed in the genotype or allele frequency of two HIF-2a SNPs between the cases and controls (all p>0.05). However, in subgroup analysis by gender, the HIF-2a rs13419896 GA and AA genotypes were significantly associated with a risk of CHB (odds ratio [OR] = 3.565, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.123–11.314, p = 0.031 and OR = 12.506, 95% CI = 1.329–117.716, p = 0.027) in females, and the A allele of rs13419896 was associated with a risk of CHB (OR = 2.624, 95% CI = 1.244–5.537, p = 0.011) and LC (OR = 2.351, 95% CI = 1.002–5.518, p = 0.050) in females. The rs6715787 CG genotype polymorphism may contribute to a reduced risk of LC in the Guangxi Zhuang Chinese population (OR = 0.152, 95% CI = 0.028–0.807, p = 0.027), as determined via subgroup analysis by ethnicity. Moreover, binary logistic regression analyses that were adjusted by drinking status indicated that the AA genotype of rs13419896 may contribute to an increased risk of LC in the non-alcohol-drinking population (OR = 3.124, 95% CI = 1.091–8.947, p = 0.034). In haplotype analysis, GG haplotype was significantly associated with a reduced risk of LC (OR = 0.601, 95% CI = 0.419–0.862, p = 0.005). Conclusions The HIF-2a rs13419896 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of CHB and LC in the Guangxi Chinese population, especially in females and in the non-alcohol-drinking population, while the HIF-2a gene rs6715787 polymorphism is associated with a decreased risk of LC in the Guangxi Zhuang population."
https://openalex.org/W2471481323,"Relief of iron (Fe) limitation in the surface Southern Ocean has been suggested as one driver of the regular glacial-interglacial cycles in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The proposed cause is enhanced deposition of Fe-bearing atmospheric dust to the oceans during glacial intervals, with consequent effects on export production and the carbon cycle. However, understanding the role of enhanced atmospheric Fe supply in biogeochemical cycles is limited by knowledge of the fluxes and 'bioavailability' of atmospheric Fe during glacial intervals. Here, we assess the effect of Fe fertilization by dust, dry-extracted from the Last Glacial Maximum portion of the EPICA Dome C Antarctic ice core, on the Antarctic diatom species Eucampia antarctica and Proboscia inermis. Both species showed strong but differing reactions to dust addition. E. antarctica increased cell number (3880 vs. 786 cells mL-1), chlorophyll a (51 vs. 3.9 μg mL-1) and particulate organic carbon (POC; 1.68 vs. 0.28 μg mL-1) production in response to dust compared to controls. P. inermis did not increase cell number in response to dust, but chlorophyll a and POC per cell both strongly increased compared to controls (39 vs. 15 and 2.13 vs. 0.95 ng cell-1 respectively). The net result of both responses was a greater production of POC and chlorophyll a, as well as decreased Si:C and Si:N incorporation ratios within cells. However, E, antarctica decreased silicate uptake for the same nitrate and carbon uptake, while P. inermis increased carbon and nitrate uptake for the same silicate uptake. This suggests that nutrient utilization changes in response to Fe addition could be driven by different underlying mechanisms between different diatom species. Enhanced supply of atmospheric dust to the surface ocean during glacial intervals could therefore have driven nutrient-utilization changes which could permit greater carbon fixation for lower silica utilization. Additionally, both species responded more strongly to lower amounts of direct Fe chloride addition than they did to dust, suggesting that not all the Fe released from dust was in a bioavailable form available for uptake by diatoms."
https://openalex.org/W2468771051,"Computational models of cognition provide an interface to connect advanced mathematical tools and methods to empirically supported theories of behavior in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience. In this article, we consider a computational model of instance-based learning, implemented in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We propose an approach for obtaining mathematical reformulations of such cognitive models that improve their computational tractability. For the well-established Sugar Factory dynamic decision making task, we conduct a simulation study to analyze central model parameters. We show how mathematical optimization techniques can be applied to efficiently identify optimal parameter values with respect to different optimization goals. Beyond these methodological contributions, our analysis reveals the sensitivity of this particular task with respect to initial settings and yields new insights into how average human performance deviates from potential optimal performance. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of our approach as well as future steps towards applying more powerful derivative-based optimization methods."
https://openalex.org/W2468548817,"It has been shown that Lurcher mutant mice have significantly altered motor abilities, regarding their motor coordination and muscular strength because of olivorecebellar degeneration. We assessed the response of the cross-sectional geometry and lacuno-canalicular network properties of the tibial mid-diaphyseal cortical bone to motor differences between Lurcher and wild-type (WT) male mice from the B6CBA strain. The first data set used in the cross-sectional geometry analysis consists of 16 mice of 4 months of age and 32 mice of 9 months of age. The second data set used in the lacunar-canalicular network analysis consists of 10 mice of 4 months of age. We compared two cross-sectional geometry and four lacunar-canalicular properties by I-region using the maximum and minimum second moment of area and anatomical orientation as well as H-regions using histological differences within a cross section. We identified inconsistent differences in the studied cross-sectional geometry properties between Lurcher and WT mice. The biggest significant difference between Lurcher and WT mice is found in the number of canaliculi, whereas in the other studied properties are only limited. Lurcher mice exhibit an increased number of canaliculi (p < 0.01) in all studied regions compared with the WT controls. The number of canaliculi is also negatively correlated with the distance from the centroid in the Lurcher and positively correlated in the WT mice. When the Lurcher and WT sample is pooled, the number of canaliculi and lacunar volume is increased in the posterior Imax region, and in addition, midcortical H-region exhibit lower number of canaliculi, lacuna to lacuna distance and increased lacunar volume. Our results indicate, that the importance of precise sample selection within cross sections in future studies is highlighted because of the histological heterogeneity of lacunar-canalicular network properties within the I-region and H-region in the mouse cortical bone."
