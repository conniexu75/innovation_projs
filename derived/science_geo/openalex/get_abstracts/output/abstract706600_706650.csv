https://openalex.org/W4313306406,"Real-world information on socioeconomic differences within and between chronic conditions represents an important data source for treatments and decision-makers executing and prioritising healthcare resources.The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and mean of socioeconomic disparities from educational, income, and socioeconomic positions of 199 chronic conditions and disease groups, including sex and age group estimates, for use in planning of care services and prioritisation, by healthcare professionals, decision-makers and researchers.The study population includes all Danish residents 16 years and above, alive on 1 January 2013 (n = 4,555,439). The data was established by linking seven national registers encompassing educational achievements, incomes, socioeconomic positions, hospital- and general practice services, and filled-in out-of-hospital prescriptions. The health register data were used to identify the 199+ chronic conditions. Socioeconomic differences were primarily measured as differences in educational prevalence levels from low to high educational achievements using a ratio. Furthermore, multiple binary logistic regression models were carried out to control for potential confounding and residual correlations of the crude estimates.The prevalence of having one or more chronic conditions for patients with no educational achievement was 768 per thousand compared to 601.3 for patients with higher educational achievement (ratio 1.3). Across disease groups, the highest educational differences were found within disease group F-mental and behavioural (ratio 2.5), E-endocrine, nutritional and metabolic disease (ratio 2.4), I-diseases of the circulatory system (ratio 2.1) and, K-diseases of the digestive system (ratio 2.1). The highest educational differences among the 29 common diseases were found among schizophrenia (ratio 5.9), hyperkinetic disorders (ratio 5.2), dementia (ratio 4.9), osteoporosis (ratio 3.9), type 2 diabetes (ratio 3.8), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD (ratio 3.3), heart conditions and stroke (ratios ranging from 2.3-3.1).A nationwide catalogue of socioeconomic disparities for 199+ chronic conditions and disease groups is catalogued and provided. The catalogue findings underline a large scope of socioeconomic disparities that exist across most chronic conditions. The data offer essential information on the socioeconomic disparities to inform future socially differentiated treatments, healthcare planning, etiological, economic, and other research areas."

Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) has been widely studied for this indication. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has been assumed to be effective. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ESPB over TPVB in preventing acute PSP.In this prospective observational study, 120 patients admitted for unilateral major oncologic breast surgery received T2/T3 ESPB (ropivacaine 0.75%, 0.35 ml.kg-1), and 102 were analysed. Then, the ESPB cohort was compared to a TPVB cohort from the experimental arm of a randomized controlled study with the same protocol (NCT02408393) using propensity score matching analysis. The primary outcome was the need for morphine consumption in the PACU. Secondary outcomes were the morphine total dose, the incidence of ESPB and TPVB complications, and discontinuous visual analogue scale measurement trends at rest and at mobilization in the 24 hours after surgery.A total of 102 patients completed the study between December 2018 and August 2019. Propensity score matching formed 94 matched pairs. The proportion of morphine titration in the PACU was higher in the ESPB group than in the TPVB group (74.5% vs. 41.5%, p<0.001), with a between-group difference of 33.0% (95% CI [19.3%, 46.7%]). No ESPB-related complications were observed.ESPB is less effective in preventing morphine consumption in the PACU than TPVB. Our findings do not support the use of ESPB as the first-line regional anaesthesia for major breast cancer surgery. Randomized trials comparing ESPB and TPVB are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4313307875,"The noise levels in intensive care units have been repeatedly reported to exceed the recommended guidelines and yield negative health outcomes among healthcare professionals. However, it is unclear which sound sources within this environment are perceived as disturbing. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate how healthcare professionals in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria perceive the sound levels and the associated sound sources within their work environment and explore sound reduction strategies.An online survey was conducted among 350 healthcare professionals working in intensive care units. The survey consisted of items on demographic and hospital data and questions about the perception of the sound levels [1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)], disturbance from sound sources [1 (not disturbing at all) to 5 (very disturbing)], and implementation potential, feasibility, and motivation to reduce sound reduction measures [1 (not high at all) to 5 (very high)].Approximately 69.3% of the healthcare professionals perceived the sound levels in the ICUs as too high. Short-lasting human sounds (e.g. moans or laughs) [mean (M) ± standard deviation (SD) = 3.30 ± 0.81], devices and alarms (M ± SD = 2.67 ± 0.59), and short-lasting object sounds (M ± SD = 2.55 ± 0.68) were perceived as the most disturbing sounds. Reducing medical equipment alarms was considered to have greater implementation potential [M ± SD = 3.62 ± 0.92, t(334) = -7.30, p < 0.001], feasibility [M ± SD = 3.19 ± 0.93, t(334) = -11.02, p < 0.001], and motivation [M ± SD = 3.85 ± 0.89, t(334) = -10.10, p < 0.001] for reducing the sound levels.This study showed that healthcare professionals perceive short-lasting human sounds as most disturbing and rated reducing medical equipment alarms as the best approach to reduce the sound levels in terms of potential, feasibility, and motivation for implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4313306385,"Background Globally, TB is the leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality with many diagnostic uncertainties. Access to affordable and rapid diagnostics remained a major challenge for many developing countries which bear the greatest burden of TB delaying the initiation time to treatment. Objective This study aimed to assess the GeneXpert MTBRIF assay probe utility for the detection of pulmonary TB and Rifampicin-resistant TB cases in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was performed from October 2019 to July 2020 in Saint Peter TB Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa metropolitan area, Ethiopia. This study enrolled 216 clinically suspected new presumptive pulmonary TB cases confirmed by GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were captured using a structured tool. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2019, checked for inconsistency, cleaned promptly, and exported to IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0. Armonk, N.Y: IBM Corp, the USA for analysis. Descriptive analysis and binary and multivariate logistics regression were performed and all statistical significance was determined at a 95% confidence level. Results The majority of the study participants, 55.1% [119/216] were males aged 6–80 years. The prevalence of RR MTB was 11.11% [24/216]. A higher proportion of RR TB was found in female patients [54.2%, 13/24], in patients in the age group of 30–50 years [45.8%, 11/24], in married individuals [62.5%, 15/24], in persons whose residence is urban [79.2%, 19/24], in persons who had a previous history of TB symptoms [100%, 24/24], in persons who had a history of contact with active and LTBI [33.3%, 8/24], and in persons who had a history of HIV and IDUs [41.7%, 10/24]. Occupation (AOR 22.868, 95% CI 1.655–316.022, p = 0.019), history of previous PTB+ (AOR 4.222, 95% CI 1.020–17.47, p = 0.047), and history of HIV and IDUs (AOR 4.733, 95% CI 1.416–15.819, p = 0.012) were independent predictors associated with RR-TB emergence. The commonest mutation 62.5% [15/24] was found in probe E (codons 529–533) region. There was no mutation associated with probe A (codons 507–511), probe B (codons 511–518), and probe C (codons 518–523) regions, as well as no combination of missed probes, was revealed. However, 12.5% [3/24] of RR TB patients were found without unidentified missed probe types detected outside of the RRDR. The delta Ct max was &gt;4.0 and the highest proportion of 35.6% [77/216] RR TB was detected in samples of medium DNA load. Conclusion The proportion of RR-TB we observed in this study was high. Similarly, a higher proportion of RR TB was detected outside of the RRDR. Moreover, a significant number of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Assay probes were identified as unhybridized and this critical observation would mean that most of the probes had no or minimal utility in this geographical region. This calls for further studies to uncover mutation in the rpoB gene conferring RR and reshape TB triage and definite diagnostic algorithm in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4313307973,"Over the last two decades, the incidence of gestational diabetes (GDM) has almost doubled resulting in almost 9% of pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. Occurring more frequently than GDM is impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), also known as pre-diabetes, but it has been understudied during pregnancy resulting in a lack of clinical recommendations of maternal and fetal surveillance. The purpose of this retrospective, cross-sectional study was to examine the association between microbial diversity and function of the maternal microbiome with IGT while adjusting for confounding variables. We hypothesized that reduced maternal microbial diversity and increased gene abundance for insulin resistance function will be associated with IGT as defined by a value greater than 140 mg/dL on the glucose challenge test. In the examination of microbial composition between women with IGT and those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), we found five taxa which were significantly different. Taxa higher in participants with impaired glucose tolerance were Ruminococcacea ( p = 0.01), Schaalia turicensis ( p &lt;0.05), Oscillibacter ( p = 0.03), Oscillospiraceae ( p = 0.02), and Methanobrevibacter smithii ( p = 0.04). When we further compare participants who have IGT by their pre-gravid BMI, five taxa are significantly different between the BMI groups, Enterobacteriaceae , Dialister micraerophilus , Campylobacter ureolyticus , Proteobacteria , Streptococcus Unclassified (species). All four metrics including the Shannon ( p &lt;0.00), Simpson ( p &lt;0.00), Inverse Simpson ( p = 0.04), and Chao1 ( p = 0.04), showed a significant difference in alpha diversity with increased values in the impaired glucose tolerance group. Our study highlights the important gastrointestinal microbiome changes in women with IGT during pregnancy. Understanding the role of the microbiome in regulating glucose tolerance during pregnancy helps clinicians and researchers to understand the importance of IGT as a marker for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4313365097,"Health care workers (HCWs) faced an increased risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout commenced in February 2021 to priority groups, including HCWs. Given their increased risk, as well as influence on patients' vaccine uptake, it was important that HCWs had a positive COVID-19 vaccination experience, as well as trusting the vaccine safety and efficacy data.Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 19 public- and privately-practicing HCWs in Western Australia between February-July 2021. Data were deductively analysed using NVivo 12 and guided by the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour model.15/19 participants had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were highly motivated, mostly to protect themselves and to get back to ""normal"", but also to protect patients. Many had a heightened awareness of COVID-19 severity due hearing from colleagues working in settings more impacted than Western Australia. Participants trusted the COVID-19 vaccine development and approval process; their histories of having to accept vaccines for work helped them to see COVID-19 vaccination as no different. Many recalled initially being unsure of how and when they'd be able to access the vaccine. Once they had this knowledge, half had difficulties with the booking process, and some were unable to access a clinic at a convenient location or time. Participants learnt about COVID-19 vaccination through government resources, health organisations, and their workplace, but few had seen any government campaigns for the wider public. Finally, most had discussed COVID-19 vaccination with their social network.HCWs in Western Australia demonstrated good knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination, with many reasons to vaccinate themselves and support the vaccination of others. Addressing the barriers identified in this study will be important for planning to vaccinate health workforces during future pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4313306325,"Interpersonal violence among adolescents is a serious public health issue across the globe and has been one of the leading causes of death among Paraguayan adolescents. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of physical fighting among adolescents in Paraguay in order to identify problematic fighting behaviour. We also aim to examine the correlates of physical fighting and the extent to which previously identified factors correlate with physical fighting.We used the Paraguay 2017 Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). This survey collects health-related information on school-attending adolescents aged 13-17 years. We defined physical fighting as having participated in at least two physical fights in the previous 12 months. We chose 16 independent variables: 12 individual-level variables and four social-level variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify factors associated with physical fighting. One of the limitations of this study is that it only captured the responses of the students who attended school on the day of the survey.A total of 3,149 students completed the survey questionnaire, with the response rates for the school, student, and total response being 100%, 87%, and 87%, respectively. In 2017, 8% of the survey participants (11.4% of the males, and 4.7% of the females) had been involved in two or more physical fights during the past 12 months. In the multivariable model, having been physically attacked, male gender, physical activity, alcohol use, early sexual debut, and suicide planning were significantly associated with involvement in physical fighting. Having helpful peers and supportive parents was not statistically significant in the model adjusted for all variables.Although Paraguay shows relatively lower prevalence of physical fighting than other countries, the high association between physical fighting and having been physically attacked is noteworthy. Considering the serious interpersonal violence among Paraguayan adolescents, preventive attributes should be considered, and further assessment of other types of interpersonal violence should be made."
https://openalex.org/W4313306361,"Improved understanding of participant engagement in web-based dietary interventions is needed. Engagement is a complex construct that may be best explored through mixed methods to gain comprehensive insight. To our knowledge, no web-based dietary intervention in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) has previously used a mixed methods approach. The aim of this study was to explore factors that may contribute to effective engagement in a web-based dietary program for people with T2D.This study employed a mixed methods intervention design, with a convergent design embedded for post-intervention evaluation. The convergent design collected and analyzed quantitative and qualitative data independent of each other, with the two datasets merged/compared during results/interpretation. Quantitative data collected from intervention group participants (n = 40) were self-administered questionnaires and usage data with average values summarized. Qualitative data were participant semi-structured interviews (n = 15) incorporating a deductive-inductive thematic analysis approach.The results from the quantitative and qualitative data indicated positive overall engagement with the web-based dietary program. Factors that contributed to effective engagement were sustained frequency and intensity of engagement; structured weekly program delivery; participants affective engagement prior to and during the intervention, with positive affective states enhancing cognitive and behavioral engagement; and participants experience of value and reward. In addition, the user-centered development process employed prior to intervention delivery played an important role in facilitating positive engagement outcomes.This study yielded novel findings by integrating qualitative and quantitative data to explore engagement with a web-based dietary program involving people with T2D. Effective engagement occurred in this intervention through a combination of factors related to usage and participants' affective, cognitive and behavioral states. The engagement outcomes that emerged will be useful to current and future researchers using digital technologies to deliver lifestyle interventions for T2D or other chronic health conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4313306379,"While many new programs bridge the arts and sciences, a data-based examination of art-science program design can lead to more efficient programming. The Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation Artist-in-Residence program is a virtual program that brings together undergraduate student ""artists"" and faculty-level ""scientists"" to generate science-art content. We have recruited over 80 artists and 50 scientists to collaborate in creating visual science communication content. Using self-reported data from both groups, we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses to define sources for negative and positive experiences for artists and scientists. We also identify areas for improvement and key features for in producing a positive experience. We found that artists participants had more positive responses about ""learning something new"" from the program than scientists. We also found that for both artists and scientists the length of the program and the virtual nature were identified as key features that could be improved. However, the most surprising aspect of our analysis suggests that for both ""way of thinking"" and ""science communication to the public or general audience,"" were seen as significant beneficial gains for scientists compared to artists. We conclude this analysis with suggestions to enhance the benefits and outcomes of an art-science program and ways to minimize the difficulties, such as communication and collaboration, faced by participants and program designers."
https://openalex.org/W4313306392,"This study proposes a Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) variant named Elastic Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (EGWO) with shrinking, resilient surrounding, and weighted candidate mechanisms. Then, the proposed EGWO is used to optimize the weights and biases of Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), and the EGWO-MLP model for predicting student achievement is thus obtained. The training and verification of the EGWO-MLP prediction model are conducted based on the thirty attributes from the University of California (UCI) Machine Learning Repository dataset's student performance dataset, including family features and personal characteristics. For the Mathematics (Mat.) subject achievement prediction, the EGWO-MLP model outperforms one model's prediction accuracy, and the standard deviation possesses the stable ability to predict student achievement. And for the Portuguese (Por.) subject, the EGWO-MLP outperforms three models' Mathematics (Mat.) subject achievement prediction through the training process and takes first place through the testing process. The results show that the EGWO-MLP model has made fewer test errors, indicating that EGWO can effectively feedback weights and biases due to the strong exploration and local stagnation avoidance. And the EGWO-MLP model is feasible for predicting student achievement. The study can provide reference for improving school teaching programs and enhancing teachers' teaching quality and students' learning effect."

Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the validity of the test. Subsequently, partial correlation analysis was used to determine the associations between age, sex, body mass index, and sports level as control variables and motor function.Correlation and partial correlation analyses showed a strong positive correlation between the functional movement screening and the KOJI AWARENESS™ scores.This study found that the KOJI AWARENESS™ test is valid and comparable to functional movement screening. It can be used for self-screening of movement."
https://openalex.org/W4313307915,"Although a diversity of trypanosome species have been detected in various animal taxa from human African trypanosomosis (HAT) foci, cattle trypanosomosis has not been addressed in HAT foci of west and central African countries including Chad. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of pathogenic trypanosome species in cattle from three HAT foci of the south of Chad. Blood samples were collected from 1466 randomly selected cattle from HAT foci of Mandoul, Maro, and Moïssala in the south of Chad. For each animal, the sex, age and body condition were recorded. Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was used to search Trypanosoma brucei gambiense antibodies while the capillary tube centrifugation (CTC) test and PCR-based methods enabled to detect and identify trypanosome species. From the 1466 cattle, 45 (3.1%) were positive to RDT. The prevalence of trypanosome infections revealed by CTC and PCR-based method were respectively 2.7% and 11.1%. Trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon were dominant (6.5%) followed by T . congolense savannah (2.9%), T . congolense forest (2.5%) and T . vivax (0.8%). No animal was found with DNA of human infective trypanosome ( T . b . gambiense) . The overall prevalence of trypanosome infections was significantly higher in animal from the Maro HAT focus (13.8%) than those from Mandoul (11.1%) and Moïssala HAT foci (8.0%). This prevalence was also significantly higher in animal having poor body condition (77.5%) than those with medium (11.2%) and good (0.5%) body condition. The overall prevalence of single and mixed infections were respectively 9.4% and 1.6%. This study revealed natural infections of several pathogenic trypanosome species in cattle from different HAT foci of Chad. It showed similar transmission patterns of these trypanosome species and highlighted the need of developing control strategies for animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) with the overarching goal of improving animal health and the economy of smallholder farmers."
https://openalex.org/W4313316334,"Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is transmitted predominantly by the Aedes species of mosquito, but also through sexual contact, blood transfusions, and congenitally from mother to child. Although approximately 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic and typical symptoms are mild, multiple studies have demonstrated a causal link between ZIKV and severe diseases such as Microcephaly and Guillain Barré Syndrome. Two goals of this study are to improve ZIKV models by considering the spread dynamics of ZIKV as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and also to approximate the degree of under-reporting. In order to accomplish these objectives, we propose a compartmental model that allows for the analysis of spread dynamics as both a vector-borne and sexually transmitted disease, and fit it to the ZIKV incidence reported to the National System of Public Health Surveillance in 27 municipalities of Colombia between January 1 2015 and December 31 2017. We demonstrate that our model can represent the infection patterns over this time period with high confidence. In addition, we argue that the degree of under-reporting is also well estimated. Using the model we assess potential viability of public health scenarios for mitigating disease spread and find that targeting the sexual pathway alone has negligible impact on overall spread, but if the proportion of risky sexual behavior increases then it may become important. Targeting mosquitoes remains the best approach of those considered. These results may be useful for public health organizations and governments to construct and implement suitable health policies and reduce the impact of the Zika outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4313316380,"The relationship between baseline BMI and CD4+ T cells during follow-up in HIV patients in China requires further evaluation. We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on adult AIDS patients who underwent or received antiretroviral therapy from 2003 to 2019 in Guangxi, China. BMI was divided into categories and compared, and after adjusting for BMI being related to the change in CD4 lymphocyte count, with normal weight as the reference group, the BMI before treatment was positively correlated with the changes in CD4+ T cells at different time periods. Among them, obese patients had significant CD4+ cell gain. In patients with pretreatment CD4+ T lymphocyte counts <200 cells/μL, a higher BMI was associated with an increased likelihood of achieving immunologic reconstitution [≥350 cells/μL: AHR: 1.02(1.01, 1.04), P = 0.004; ≥500 cells/μL: AHR: 1.03 (1.01, 1.05), P = 0.004]. Underweight in HIV patients was a risk factor for poor viral suppression [AHR: 1.24 (1.04, 1.48), P = 0.016]. Our study demonstrated that HIV/AIDS patients receiving ART with higher baseline BMI had better immune reconstitution and that baseline BMI could be an important predictor of immune reconstitution in patients receiving ART. Baseline BMI was not associated with virological failure, but a lower baseline BMI indicated poor viral suppression during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W4313316395,"Several methods have been reported to estimate Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in blood samples. The Ellman assay is the most important among all but with several shortcomings, and there is a need to develop a method which is accurate, sensitive and quick for analyzing AChE. Therefore, we have developed an assay utilizing RP-HPLC with UV detection for the determination of AChE activity. This method measured the conversion of 1-naphthol acetate to 1-naphthol to estimate AChE activity in blood samples. Performance was judged on the basis of reproducibility, sensitivity, accuracy, and the ability to screen enzyme activity within 20minutes. A series of experiments were performed, varying the concentration of blood and substrate, with optimal sensitivity using 50 μM substrate and 10μL blood. The validation parameters such as linearity (R2 of ≥ 0.9842 for 1-naphthol and ≥ 0.9897 for 1-naphthol acetate), precision (94.21-96.41%), accuracy (85.2%-99.6% and 82.6%-99.3% for 1-naphthol and 1-naphthol acetate respectively), and robustness were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Blood samples were collected from healthy people, farmers exposed to spraying of pesticides, and suicidal patients who ingested pesticides and were hospitalized and were analyzed by the developed method. The AChE level was approximately 21 units/mL compared to 24units/mL in controls, whereas suicidal patients showed the least AChE levels of 1 unit/mL. The employment of this method is recommended for estimating AChE level on various matrices."
https://openalex.org/W4313316532,"Following a huge global effort, the first World Health Organization (WHO)-endorsed catalogue of 17,356 variants in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex along with their classification as associated with resistance (interim), not associated with resistance (interim) or uncertain significance was made public In June 2021. This marks a critical step towards the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) data for clinical care. Unfortunately, the variant format used makes it difficult to look up variants when NGS data is generated by other bioinformatics pipelines. Furthermore, the large number of variants of uncertain significance in the catalogue hamper its useability in clinical practice. We successfully converted 98.3% of variants from the WHO catalogue format to the standardized HGVS format. We also created TBProfiler version 4.4.0 to automate the calling of all variants located in the tier 1 and 2 candidate resistance genes along with their classification when listed in the WHO catalogue. Using a representative sample of 339 clinical isolates from South Africa containing 691 variants in a tier 1 or 2 gene, TBProfiler classified 105 (15%) variants as conferring resistance, 72 (10%) as not conferring resistance and 514 (74%) as unclassified, with an average of 29 unclassified variants per isolate. Using a second cohort of 56 clinical isolates from a TB outbreak in Spain containing 21 variants in the tier 1 and 2 genes, TBProfiler classified 13 (61.9%) as unclassified, 7 (33.3%) as not conferring resistance, and a single variant (4.8%) classified as conferring resistance. Continued global efforts using standardized methods for genotyping, phenotyping and bioinformatic analyses will be essential to ensure that knowledge on genomic variants translates into improved patient care."
https://openalex.org/W4313318714,"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for university students, creating uncertainties for their academic careers, social lives, and mental health. Our study utilized a machine learning approach to examine the degree to which students’ college adjustment and coping styles impacted their adjustment to COVID-19 disruptions. More specifically, we developed predictive models to distinguish between well-adjusted and not well-adjusted students in each of five psychological domains: academic adjustment, emotionality adjustment, social support adjustment, general COVID-19 regulations response, and discriminatory impact. The predictive features used for these models are students’ individual characteristics in three psychological domains, i.e., Ways of Coping (WAYS), Adaptation to College (SACQ), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), assessed using established commercial and open-access questionnaires. We based our study on a proprietary survey dataset collected from 517 U.S. students during the initial peak of the pandemic. Our models achieved an average of 0.91 AUC score over the five domains. Using the SHAP method, we further identified the most relevant risk factors associated with each classification task. The findings reveal the relationship of students’ general adaptation to college and coping in relation to their adjustment during COVID-19. Our results could help universities identify systemic and individualized strategies to support their students in coping with stress and to facilitate students’ college adjustment in this era of challenges and uncertainties."
https://openalex.org/W4313318723,"Young adults aged 18-39 years commonly experience persistent side effects following cancer treatment that can impair their quality of life. Physical activity (PA) holds promise as a behavioral intervention to mitigate persistent side effects and improve quality of life. Yet, few young adults are active enough to incur these benefits and efforts to promote PA after cancer treatment ends are lacking. Therefore, we developed a novel theory-driven behavior change intervention to promote PA via videoconferencing technology in young adults who have completed cancer treatment, and are undertaking a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to gather evidence to inform the design of a large, full-scale RCT. The specific aims of this parallel, two-arm pilot RCT are to: (1) assess intervention and trial protocol feasibility and acceptability; and (2) generate data on PA behavior. To promote transparency, improve reproducibility, and serve as a reference for forthcoming publication of results, we present the study protocol for this pilot RCT (version 7) within this paper.Young adults who have completed cancer treatment are being recruited from across Canada. After informed consent is obtained and baseline assessments are completed, participants are randomized to the intervention group (i.e., a 12-week behavior change intervention delivered via videoconferencing technology by trained PA counsellors) or usual care group (i.e., no intervention). Several feasibility outcomes covering enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis are tracked by study staff. Acceptability is assessed through interviews exploring participants' experiences, thoughts, and perspectives of the trial protocol (i.e., intervention and usual care groups), as well as participants' views of the intervention and its mode of delivery (i.e., intervention group only) and PA counsellors' experiences delivering the intervention. PA behavior is measured using accelerometers at baseline (pre-randomization), post-intervention, and at follow-up (24 weeks post-baseline).There are growing calls to develop interventions to support young adults' motivation to engage in PA and adopt an active lifestyle to improve their quality of life after cancer treatment ends. Real-time videoconferencing shows promise for disseminating behavior change interventions to young adults and addressing participation barriers. Considering the importance of establishing intervention and trial protocol feasibility and acceptability prior to evaluating intervention efficacy (or effectiveness), this pilot RCT is critical to understand how participants embrace, engage with, and complete the intervention and trial protocol. Indeed, these data will help to determine which refinements, if any, are required to the intervention and trial protocol (e.g., implementation approach, evaluation methods) prior to a large, full-scale RCT aiming to test the effects of the intervention on PA behavior. Additionally, the PA behavior data collected will be useful to inform the sample size calculation for a large, full-scale RCT.The trial was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov database (ID: NCT04163042) on November 14, 2019, prior to the start of the trial in February, 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4313318805,"The sharp line of demarcation between zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata (ZF) has been recently challenged suggesting that this interface is no longer a compartment boundary. We have used immunohistochemical analyses to study the steroid 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) pattern of expression and investigate the remodeling of the adrenal cortex in relation to aging. We analyzed human adrenal glands prepared from 47 kidney donors. No aldosterone-producing micronodules (APMs) were detectable in the younger donors aged between 22-39 but the functional ZG depicted by positive CYP11B2 staining demonstrated a lack of continuity. In contrast, the development of APMs was found in samples from individuals aged 40-70. Importantly, the progressive replacement of CYP11B2-expressing cells in the histological ZG by CYP11B1-expressing cells highlights the remodeling capacity of the adrenal cortex. In 70% of our samples, immunofluorescence studies revealed the presence of isolated or clusters of CYP11B2 positive cells in the ZF and zona reticularis. Our data emphasize that mineralocorticoid- and glucocorticoid-producing cells are distributed throughout the cortex and the medulla making the determination of the functional status of a cell or group of cells a unique tool in deciphering the changes occurring in adrenal gland particularly during aging. They also suggest that, in humans, steroidogenic cell phenotype defined by function is a stable feature and thus, the functional zonation might be not solely maintained by cell lineage conversion/migration."

As such, CDF analysis can be a powerful tool for the analysis of positional correlations within anisotropic systems, such as liquid crystals. Here we describe a lightweight Python tool, cylindr , for the calculation of cylindrical distribution function, which is compatible with the output of a number of popular MD engines. We demonstrate the use of cylindr in computing the CDF of a number of exemplar materials: classical and ferroelectric nematics; lamellar and columnar liquid crystals."
https://openalex.org/W4313364347,"The worldwide use of prone position (PP) for invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 is progressively increasing from the first pandemic wave in everyday clinical practice. Among the suggested treatments for the management of ARDS patients, PP was recommended in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 guidelines as an adjuvant therapy for improving ventilation. In patients with severe classical ARDS, some authors reported that early application of prolonged PP sessions significantly decreases 28-day and 90-day mortality.Since January 2021, the COVID19 Veneto ICU Network research group has developed and implemented nationally and internationally the ""PROVENT-C19 Registry"", endorsed by the Italian Society of Anesthesia Analgesia Resuscitation and Intensive Care…'(SIAARTI). The PROVENT-C19 Registry wishes to describe 1. The real clinical practice on the use of PP in COVID-19 patients during the pandemic at a National and International level; and 2. Potential baseline and clinical characteristics that identify subpopulations of invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 that may improve daily from PP therapy. This web-based registry will provide relevant information on how the database research tools may improve our daily clinical practice.This multicenter, prospective registry is the first to identify and characterize the role of PP on clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients. In recent years, data emerging from large registries have been increasingly used to provide real-world evidence on the effectiveness, quality, and safety of a clinical intervention. Indeed observation-based registries could be effective tools aimed at identifying specific clusters of patients within a large study population with widely heterogeneous clinical characteristics.The registry was registered (ClinicalTrial.Gov Trials Register NCT04905875) on May 28,2021."
https://openalex.org/W4313306317,"There are limited data on why the 2016 Zika outbreak in Miami-Dade County, Florida was confined to certain neighborhoods. In this research, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Zika virus, are studied to examine neighborhood-level differences in their population dynamics and underlying processes. Weekly mosquito data were acquired from the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division from 2016 to 2020 from 172 traps deployed around Miami-Dade County. Using random forest, a machine learning method, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics of Ae. aegypti in response to meteorological conditions and neighborhood-specific socio-demographic and physical characteristics, such as land-use and land-cover type and income level, were created. The study area was divided into two groups: areas affected by local transmission of Zika during the 2016 outbreak and unaffected areas. Ae. aegypti populations in areas affected by Zika were more strongly influenced by 14- and 21-day lagged weather conditions. In the unaffected areas, mosquito populations were more strongly influenced by land-use and day-of-collection weather conditions. There are neighborhood-scale differences in Ae. aegypti population dynamics. These differences in turn influence vector-borne disease diffusion in a region. These results have implications for vector control experts to lead neighborhood-specific vector control strategies and for epidemiologists to guide vector-borne disease risk preparations, especially for containing the spread of vector-borne disease in response to ongoing climate change."

The aim of this study was to assess the heterocyclic aromatic amines profile and contents in processed chicken in Burkina Faso. Eight polar and apolar heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) including 2-mino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinolone (IQ), 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4, 3-b]indole (Trp-P1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P2), 2-mino-9H-pyrido-[2,3-b]indole (AαC), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4, 5- ]pyridine (PhIP), 2-amino-3-methyl-9H-pyrido[2,3-b] indole (MeAαC), 2-amino-3,4,8-rimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx) and 2-amino-3,8-imethylimidazo[4,5-]quinoxaline (MeIQx) were screened by high performance liquid chromatography from 29 samples of flamed chicken and 66 samples of braised chicken collected in Ouagadougou city. Apolar HAAs and polar HAAs were respectively 12 and 3 times more abundant in flamed chickens (32.66±10 and 3.48±10.39 ng/g, respectively) than in braised chickens (2.70±9.67 and 0.92 ng/g, respectively). The maximum levels of AαC were in the same proportions in flamed (12.01 ng/g) and braised chickens (14.13 ng/g). Flamed chicken had the highest Trp-P1 content (530.31 ng/g). The 4,8-DiMeIQx was not detected in braised chicken. The AαCs were more abundant in flamed than in braised chicken. The profile and the contents of the HAAs in processed chicken are related to cooking methods. Because of the high variability observed on the obtained concentrations, investigations on the contents of precursors in raw chicken, the effect of marinating ingredients on the formation of HAAs are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4313306346,"Emotional flexibility reflects the ability to adjust the emotional response to the changing environmental context. To understand how context can trigger a change in emotional response, i.e., how it can upregulate the initial emotional response or trigger a shift in the valence of emotional response, we used a task consisting of picture pairs during functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions. In each pair, the first picture was a smaller detail (a decontextualized photograph depicting emotions using primarily facial and postural expressions) from the second (contextualized) picture, and the neural response to a decontextualized picture was compared with the same picture in a context. Thirty-one healthy participants (18 females; mean age: 24.44 ± 3.4) were involved in the study. In general, context (vs. pictures without context) increased activation in areas involved in facial emotional processing (e.g., middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and temporal pole) and affective mentalizing (e.g., precuneus, temporoparietal junction). After excluding the general effect of context by using an exclusive mask with activation to context vs. no-context, the automatic shift from positive to negative valence induced by the context was associated with increased activation in the thalamus, caudate, medial frontal gyrus and lateral orbitofrontal cortex. When the meaning changed from negative to positive, it resulted in a less widespread activation pattern, mainly in the precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and occipital lobe. Providing context cues to facial information recruited brain areas that induced changes in the emotional responses and interpretation of the emotional situations automatically to support emotional flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W4313306351,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is responsible for the synthesis of ADP-ribose polymers, which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as preservation of genome integrity, DNA damage signaling and repair, molecular switches between distinct cell death pathways, and cell cycle progression. Previously, we demonstrated that the only PARP present in T . cruzi migrates to the nucleus upon genotoxic stimulus. In this work, we identify the N-terminal domain as being sufficient for TcPARP nuclear localization and describe for the first time that TcPARP is enriched in the parasite’s nucleolus. We also describe that TcPARP is present in a thread-like structure that connects two dividing nuclei and co-localizes with nucleolar material and microtubules. Furthermore, ADP-ribose polymers could also be detected in this thread during mitosis. These findings represent a first approach to new potential TcPARP functions inside the nucleus and will help understand its role well beyond the largely described DNA damage response protein in trypanosomatids."

They were divided into two groups; the first (n = 120) was treated with metformin while the second (n = 35) was not. Patients' demographics (age, gender, duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking status), medication parameters (daily dosage and duration of metformin therapy), and biochemical parameters (hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum vitamin B12, and folate level) were recorded. Definite deficiency was defined as serum vitamin B12 levels of < 150 pg/ml, whereas < 200 pg/ml indicated possible deficiency.The mean serum ± standard deviation (SD) vitamin B12 level was significantly lower in patients who were treated with metformin (268.5 ± 35.8 vs. 389.5 ± 29.8 pg/ml, p = 0.029). The metformin group had significantly higher prevalence of definite deficiency (32% vs. 9%, p < 0.02) and possible deficiency (48% vs. 30%, p < 0.02). Within the metformin group, the mean serum ± SD vitamin B12 level was significantly lower in those on high dosage (175.2 ± 30.5 vs. 315.6 ± 37.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001). MCV (μm3) levels ± SD were higher in the metformin group (87.5 ± 2.9 vs. 83.7 ± 2.4) with no statistical significance.There is a significant association between metformin intake and vitamin B12 deficiency. Serum vitamin B12 levels should be checked by physicians and serial monitoring is necessary in patients who are treated with metformin."
https://openalex.org/W4313306378,"Due to its close resemblance, the domesticated pig has proven to be a diverse animal model for biomedical research and genome editing tools have contributed to developing porcine models for several human diseases. By employing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, porcine embryos or somatic cells can be genetically modified to generate the desired genotype. However, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) of modified somatic cells and embryo manipulation are challenging, especially if the desired genotype is detrimental to the embryo. Direct in vivo edits may facilitate the production of genetically engineered pigs by integrating Cas9 into the porcine genome. Cas9 expressing cells were generated by either random integration or transposon-based integration of Cas9 and used as donor cells in SCNT. In total, 15 animals were generated that carried a transposon-based Cas9 integration and two pigs a randomly integrated Cas9. Cas9 expression was confirmed in muscle, tonsil, spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, oral mucosa, and liver in two boars. Overall, Cas9 expression was higher for transposon-based integration, except in tonsils and liver. To verify Cas9 activity, fibroblasts were subjected to in vitro genome editing. Isolated fibroblasts were transfected with guide RNAs (gRNA) targeting different genes (GGTA1, B4GALNT2, B2M) relevant to xenotransplantation. Next generation sequencing revealed that the editing efficiencies varied (2–60%) between the different target genes. These results show that the integrated Cas9 remained functional, and that Cas9 expressing pigs may be used to induce desired genomic modifications to model human diseases or further evaluate in vivo gene therapy approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4313306396,"“ Candidatus Berkiella cookevillensis” (strain CC99) and “ Candidatus Berkiella aquae” (strain HT99), belonging to the Coxiellaceae family, are gram-negative bacteria isolated from amoebae in biofilms present in human-constructed water systems. Both bacteria are obligately intracellular, requiring host cells for growth and replication. The intracellular bacteria-containing vacuoles of both bacteria closely associate with or enter the nuclei of their host cells. In this study, we analyzed the genome sequences of CC99 and HT99 to better understand their biology and intracellular lifestyles. The CC99 genome has a size of 2.9Mb (37.9% GC) and contains 2,651 protein-encoding genes (PEGs) while the HT99 genome has a size of 3.6Mb (39.4% GC) and contains 3,238 PEGs. Both bacteria encode high proportions of hypothetical proteins (CC99: 46.5%; HT99: 51.3%). The central metabolic pathways of both bacteria appear largely intact. Genes for enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway, the non-oxidative branch of the phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid pathway, and the respiratory chain were present. Both bacteria, however, are missing genes for the synthesis of several amino acids, suggesting reliance on their host for amino acids and intermediates. Genes for type I and type IV ( dot/icm ) secretion systems as well as type IV pili were identified in both bacteria. Moreover, both bacteria contain genes encoding large numbers of putative effector proteins, including several with eukaryotic-like domains such as, ankyrin repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, and leucine-rich repeats, characteristic of other intracellular bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4313306400,"Background Hepatitis B and C virus infections are endemic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest prevalence of these infections in the world. Female sex workers are exposed to sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and C, because of their high-risk sexual behavior and limited access to health services. There are no large-scale data on the prevalence of hepatitis B and C virus infections among female sex workers in Ethiopia, a critical gap in information this study aimed to fill. Methods This was a cross-sectional, biobehavioral survey conducted from December 2019—April 2020 among 6085 female sex workers aged ≥15 years and residing in sixteen (16) regional capital cities and selected major towns of Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected from the participants for hepatitis B and C virus serological testing. The data were collected using an open data kits (ODK) software and imported into STATA version16 for analysis. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and proportions) were used to summarize data on the study variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the strength of association between independent variables (risk factors) and the outcome (hepatitis B and C virus infection). Adjusted Odd ratio (AOR) was used to determine independent associations, 95% confidence interval to assess precision of the estimates, and a P value ≤ 0.05 to determine statistically significant. Results The prevalence of hepatitis B and C infections among the 6085 female sex workers was 2.6% [(95% CI (2.2,2.8)] and 0.5% [(95% CI (0.4,0.7)], respectively. Female sex workers who had 61–90 and ≥91 paying clients in the past six months [(AOR = 1.66; 95% CI, (0.99, 2.79); P = 0.054] and [(AOR = 1.66 95% CI, (1.11, 2.49); P = 0.013], respectively, age at first sex selling of 20–24 and &gt;25 years [(AOR = 1.67; 95% CI, (1.14, 2.44); P = 0.009)] and [(AOR = 1.56; 95% CI (1.004, 2.43); P = 0.048)], respectively, known HIV positive status [(AOR = 1.64; 95% CI (1.03, 2.62); P = 0.036] were significantly associated with the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection. Similarly, hepatitis C was significantly associated with, age at first sex ≤15 years and age 16–20 years [(AOR = 0.21; 95%CI (0.07,0.61); P = 0.005)] and [(AOR = 0.18; 95% CI (0.061, 0.53); P = 0.002)], respectively, known HIV positive status [(AOR = 2.85; 95%CI (1.10,7.37); P = 0.031)] and testing positive for syphilis [(AOR = 4.38; 95% CI (1.73,11.11); P = 0.002)], respectively. Conclusion This analysis reveals an intermediate prevalence of hepatitis B and a low prevalence of hepatitis C infection among female sex workers in Ethiopia. It also suggests that population groups like female sex workers are highly vulnerable to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and other sexually transmitted infections. There is a need for strengthening treatment and prevention interventions, including immunization services for hepatitis B vaccination, increasing HCV testing, and provision of treatment services."
https://openalex.org/W4313306403,"Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the reference standard for evaluation of lateralized hormone production in primary aldosteronism. We aimed to investigate the impact of pre-interventional right renal vein (RRV) to right adrenal vein (RAV) distance measurement on fluoroscopy time, contrast agent exposure and radiation dose during AVS.Forty-five patients with primary aldosteronism undergoing AVS were enrolled in our retrospective study and divided into three groups. In the group ""ruler"" (n = 14), RRV-RAV-distances were determined pre-interventionally by cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) and AVS was performed by one interventional radiologist with limited experience in AVS. CT/MRI-derived and fluoroscopy-derived RRV-RAV-distances were correlated for aimed cannulation of the RAV. Patients in group ""no ruler"" (n = 24, three interventional radiologists with limited experience in AVS) and in group ""expert"", (n = 7, one expert interventional radiologist) underwent AVS without pre-interventional estimation of RRV-RAV-distances. Procedure parameters (fluoroscopy time, contrast agent volume, radiation dose) of group ""ruler"" were compared to both other groups by Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test.Correlation of CT/MRI-derived and fluoroscopy-derived RRV-RAV-distances was good (r = 0.74;p = 0.003). The median RRV-RAV-distance was 4.5cm at CT/MRI (95%-CI:4.2-5.0cm) and 4.0cm at fluoroscopy (95%-CI:3.8-4.5cm). Fluoroscopy time (p<0.0001), contrast agent exposure (p = 0.0003) and radiation dose (air kerma and dose area product both p = 0.038) were significantly lower in group ""ruler"" compared to group ""no ruler"" (all p<0.05), and similar to group ""expert"" (all p>0.05).CT/MRI-derived pre-interventional renal-adrenal vein distance measurements correlate well with angiographic distance measurements. Pre-interventional estimation of the RRV-RAV-distance allows for aimed cannulation of the RAV with potential reduction of fluoroscopy time, contrast agent exposure and radiation-dose during AVS."

The main aim of this work is to investigate the frequency of self-medication in children under 6 years and the factors affecting it.This is a population-based cross-sectional study conducted in the Arak metropolitan in the center of Iran from January 2019 to January 2020. We used stratified random sampling to determine recruitment criteria. As 1754 households were invited to the study that 1483 were approved to participate. Children's data were obtained by the interview with their mothers. In order to define self-medication consumption of antibiotics, it was adapted between annually maternal self-reported consumption of antibiotics among their children and history of received antibiotics registered in insurance services during the same time period. Logistic regression models were exploited to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Mean age of mothers was 31.8 years (SD = 5.4), 52.1% of the children were boys. Annually self-medication of antibiotic consumption was estimated 61.6% (n = 914). Based on the logistic regression analysis, in the adjusted analysis, girls were associated with self-medication consumption of antibiotics lower than boys' children (p = 0.016). Older mothers were lower self-medication consumption of antibiotics than youngers (p = 0.001). Moreover, the permanent job of fathers was associated with lower self-medication consumption of antibiotics than temporarily and unemployment (p = .001). The odds of self-medication consumption of antibiotics were increasing with the increase in age of children (OR: 1.21, CI95%: 1.12, 1.31 and p = 0.001). The increase in parity has been a significant association with the self-medication consumption of antibiotics (OR: 1.64, CI95%: 1.38, 1.95and p = 0.001).Results of this study show that some factors such as children's age, gender, mother's age, father's occupational status, and parity are the determinants that significantly impact the self-medication prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W4313306415,"Multi-scale image decomposition is crucial for image fusion, extracting prominent feature textures from infrared and visible light images to obtain clear fused images with more textures. This paper proposes a fusion method of infrared and visible light images based on spatial domain and image features to obtain high-resolution and texture-rich images. First, an efficient hierarchical image clustering algorithm based on superpixel fast pixel clustering directly performs multi-scale decomposition of each source image in the spatial domain and obtains high-frequency, medium-frequency, and low-frequency layers to extract the maximum and minimum values of each source image combined images. Then, using the attribute parameters of each layer as fusion weights, high-definition fusion images are through adaptive feature fusion. Besides, the proposed algorithm performs multi-scale decomposition of the image in the spatial frequency domain to solve the information loss problem caused by the conversion process between the spatial frequency and frequency domains in the traditional extraction of image features in the frequency domain. Eight image quality indicators are compared with other fusion algorithms. Experimental results show that this method outperforms other comparative methods in both subjective and objective measures. Furthermore, the algorithm has high definition and rich textures."
https://openalex.org/W4313306420,"Background The United States health care sector is one of the largest polluting industries, which has significant adverse effects on human health. Medical device reprocessing (MDR) is a sustainability solution that has the potential to decrease hospital waste, cut carbon emissions, reduce spending, and improve supply chain resiliency; however, only a small proportion of FDA-approved devices are actually reprocessed. Thus, we conducted a qualitative study to understand barriers and facilitators of scaling up MDR. Methods and findings We conducted in-depth interviews with 17 stakeholders (exceeding thematic saturation) at a large academic health system in New England and national MDR organizations. We also collected observations through site visits at the health system. We recruited participants from June 2021 to April 2022 through purposive sampling. Using an analytic approach guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we applied inductive and deductive codes related to key implementation constructs. We then conducted a thematic analysis and identified five overarching themes related to barriers and facilitators of MDR. First, respondents explained that regulatory bodies and original equipment manufacturers determine which devices can be reprocessed. For example, some respondents described that original equipment manufacturers use tactics of forced obsolescence that prevent their devices from being reprocessed. Second, respondents explained that MDR has variable compatibility with hospital priorities; for example, the potential cost savings of MDR is compatible with their priorities, while the perception of decreased functionality of reprocessed medical devices is incompatible. Third, respondents described that physician preferences influence which reprocessed devices get ordered. Fourth, respondents explained that variable staff knowledge and beliefs about MDR influence their motivations to select and collect reprocessable devices. Lastly, respondents emphasized that there was a lack of infrastructure for evaluating and maintaining MDR programs within their health system. Conclusions Based on our findings, we have outlined a number of recommendations that target these barriers and facilitators so that the environmental and financial benefits of MDR can be realized at this health system and nationally. For example, implementing federal policies that prevent original equipment manufacturers from using tactics of forced obsolescence can facilitate the scale-up of MDR nationally. Additionally, providing life cycle assessments that compare the environmental effects of single-use disposable, reprocessable disposable, and reusable devices could facilitate health systems’ purchasing decisions. Creating and disseminating audit and feedback reports to hospital staff might also facilitate their continued engagement in the program. Lastly, hiring a full-time program manager that leads MDR programs within health systems could improve program sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W4313307952,"Background In LMICs, including Indonesia, there is a rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) with a prevailing burden of infectious diseases, including among pregnant women. The Indonesian health system faces significant challenges to provide effective care for infectious diseases, and even more so, NCDs. This is concerning due to the greater vulnerability of pregnant women to complications caused by concomitant illnesses (NCDs and infectious diseases), and the need for complex, integrated healthcare between maternal care and other health services. Methods The objective of this study was to understand supporting factors and challenges of the health system to providing care for concomitant illnesses in pregnancy and how it may be improved. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with sixteen key stakeholders, including health providers and health service managers, involved in maternal healthcare for concomitant illnesses at a District level in Indonesia. The study was conducted in Kutai Kartanegara District of East Kalimantan. Analysis was conducted using framework analysis to identify themes from transcripts. Results Supporting factors of the health system to provide care for concomitant illness in pregnancy included collaboration between health providers and health services, availability of screening and diagnostic tools, and access to universal healthcare coverage and financial subsidies. Common challenges included knowledge and awareness of concomitant illnesses among health providers, competency to diagnose and/or manage concomitant illnesses, and inappropriate referrals. Suggested improvements identified to address these gaps included increasing education and refresher training for healthcare providers and strengthening referrals between primary and hospital care. Conclusions The findings identified gaps in the health system to provide care for concomitant illnesses in pregnancy in Indonesia that need to be strengthened. More evidence-based research is needed to guide the implementation of policy and practice interventions for the health system to deal with a broader range of concomitant illnesses in pregnancy, particularly NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W4313307971,"In this study, using AI, we empirically examine the irrational behaviour, specifically attention-driven trading and emotion-driven trading such as consensus trading, of retail investors in an emerging stock market. We used a neural network to assess the tone of messages on social media platforms and proposed a novel Hype indicator that integrates metrics of investor attention and sentiment. The sample of messages, which are written in Russian with slang expressions, was retrieved from a unique dataset of social network communication of investors in the Russian stock market. Applying different portfolio designs, we evaluated the effectiveness of the new Hype indicator against the factors of momentum, volatility, and trading volume. We found the possibility of building a profitable trading strategy based on the Hype indicator over a 6-month time horizon. Over short periods, the Hype indicator allows investors to earn more by buying stocks of large companies, and over «longer» periods, this indicator tends to perform better for illiquid stocks of small companies. As consensus trading tends to produce negative returns, the investment strategy of 'Go against the crowd' proves rewarding in the medium term of 3 months."

However, in West Africa, in the absence of quality data for many stocks and effective stock assessment models, the cases where this has been truly successful are notable for their rarity. In West Africa, small pelagic fish are of great socio-economic importance, as well as good indicators of fish stressors. Here, historical data (2004-2019) of five small pelagic species (Sardina pilchardus, Ethmalosa fimbriata, Trachurus trecae, Scomber colias and Mugil cephalus) were collected in Senegalese waters. The B/BMSY results showed stocks to be collapsed (B/BMSY = 0.13 and 0.1 for M. cephalus and S. pilchardus, respectively) and heavily overfished (B/BMSY = 0.24; E. fimbriata). Only S. colias and T. trecae stock were considered to be in good condition (B/BMSY = 1.7 and 1.4 respectively). The Lc/Lc_opt ratio was ≤ 1 for E. fimbriata and M. cephalus, suggesting that the individuals caught for these species were too small. To reverse these bad stock statuses, catching individuals at Lc_opt, 25, 21, 43 and 18 cm for S. colias, E. fimbriata, M. cephalus and S. pilchardus, respectively should be a natural guarantee against recruitment failure and allow individuals to ensure the long-term survival of populations, in a context of data poor fisheries. In conclusion, this study shows that, despite limitations, the LBB model can provides indicators of stock status for species to encourage management measures, especially in data poor countries. It is hoped that these results can help to better assess many stocks currently considered too data poor to be assessed or at least encourage data collection effort on stocks discerned as in bad or critical status."

In this study, three reproductive role indicators—first sexual encounter, first marriage, and first birth–for three synthetic birth cohorts were used to identify and characterize the reproductive trajectories of youths. In our analysis, for the sake of comparison with global literature, we considered youths to be between ages 15 and 24. The analysis was conducted using data extracted from the 2005, 2011, and 2016 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey for Oromia National Regional State. Three synthetic birth cohorts of youths of birth years between 1975 and 1989 were constructed for the analysis. A sequence analysis based on dynamic hamming distance with partition around medoids technique was employed to extract the typologies of reproductive trajectories of youths. In addition, discrepancy analysis and a sequence regression tree analysis were employed to characterize the identified typologies of trajectories. Data management was done using STATA 14 and all analyses were carried out using R software. The study identified four different typologies of reproductive trajectories among the youth. The sex of respondents was the primary discriminating factor of the typologies of reproductive trajectories. The findings support the notion of changing norms in reproductive behavior among the less educated youth irrespective of sex. The discriminating power of education was stronger for female youth in urban areas than rural females. It implies that the postponement of reproductive role assumption was stronger among educated female youths residing in urban than their rural counterparts. Normative reproductive practices such as early marriage and adolescent fertility are still common practices that require efforts of communities and local government bodies to ameliorate these practices. Results of the study indicate that less educated youth should be targeted in programs that aim at improving youth empowerment (i.e., training and employment opportunities) as well as their sexual and reproductive health."

Based on the TyG index and thyroid function status, the participants were divided into six groups: LoTyG-SHyper (low TyG index with subclinical hyperthyroidism), LoTyG-Eu (low TyG index with euthyroidism), LoTyG-SHypo (low TyG index with subclinical hypothyroidism), HiTyG-SHyper (high TyG index with subclinical hyperthyroidism), HiTyG-Eu (high TyG index with euthyroidism), and HiTyG-SHypo (high TyG index with subclinical hypothyroidism). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the risk of carotid plaques.The proportion of participants with significant carotid plaques was significantly different among the six groups (p<0.001, p for trend<0.001). The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for significant carotid plaques were significantly higher in the HiTyG-SHypo group than in the LoTyG-Eu group, even after adjusting for confounding variables including sex, age, smoking, obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.506, 95% CI 1.045-2.170, p = 0.028). The OR of significant carotid plaques was higher in the HiTyG-Eu group than in the LoTyG-Eu group; however no associations were observed after additional adjustment for confounding variables.The TyG index and thyroid function status are important predictors of the risk of carotid plaques in healthy individuals. Early evaluation of carotid plaques may be necessary for subjects with high insulin resistance and subclinical hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W4313316324,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly influenced the lifestyle and entertainment activities of the society that has significantly increased the growth rate of the gaming industry. While the studies on the game industry, one of the leading content industries, related to the pandemic has been done from various perspectives, little attention has been taken in regards to how the pandemic have impacted on the national digital game production and its industrial sustainability as a whole. Thus, this study was conducted to analyze the changes in the domestic game industry before and after the COVID-19 outbreak using the big data analysis of semantic network. This study aims to understand the growing trend in the gaming industry that can be helpful for the marketing and production of future games, as well as to guide the establishment of the public game policies in the game industry. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic positively decreased the public's worries and the government's restrictions towards gaming due to game addiction as a mental disease. However, its sudden change in the gamer's attitudes and the current gaming policies implied that for the sustainable development of the domestic game production, laws and regulations related to the game industry need to be reliable and planned on a long term basis since the industry is immensely large and is also related to several industries such as computing, programming, arts, and story contents. Accordingly, it is necessary to build an industrial ecology through which cluster complexes specializing in developing startups and small and medium-sized business can grow along with political support."

We investigated public attitudes toward vaccination and associated factors of vaccine hesitancy during the third state of emergency.An internet-based, self-reported, cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2021, using the smartphone health app for residents of Osaka aged ≥18 years. Respondents were asked about their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine. Responses ""Don't want to receive vaccines"" or ""Don't know"" were defined as vaccine hesitancy (vs. ""Received [1st dose]"", ""Received [2nd dose]"", or ""Want to receive vaccines""). Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between hesitancy and population characteristics.23,214 individuals (8,482 men & 14,732 women) were included in the analysis. Proportions that answered ""Received (1st dose)"", ""Received (2nd dose)"", ""Want to receive vaccines"", ""Don't want to receive vaccines"", ""Don't know"", and ""Don't want to answer"" were 14.6%, 3.8%, 70.6%, 4.3%, 6.1%, and 0.5% among men; and 11.3%, 6.0%, 64.9%, 6.2%, 11.0%, and 0.6% among women. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included being a woman (aPR = 1.33; 95%CI = 1.23-1.44), age 18-39 (aPR = 7.00; 95%CI = 6.01-8.17) and 40-64 years (aPR = 4.25; 95%CI = 3.71-4.88 vs. 65+ years), living alone (aPR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.08-1.30 vs. living with 3+ members), non-full-time employment and unemployment (aPRs ranged 1.12 to 1.49 vs. full-time employment), cardiovascular diseases/hypertension (aPR = 0.72; 95%CI = 0.65-0.81), and pregnancy (women of reproductive age only) (aPR = 1.35; 95%CI = 1.03-1.76).Most respondents expressed favorable attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination while hesitancy was disproportionately high in certain populations. Efforts are needed to ensure accessible vaccine information resources and healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W4313318694,"Ustekinumab, is a new therapy for patients with IBD, especially for patients suffering from Crohn's disease (CD) who did not respond to anti-TNF treatment. To shed light on the longitudinal effect of ustekinumab on the immune system, we investigated the effect on skin and gut microbiota composition, specific immune response to commensals, and various serum biomarkers.We recruited 11 patients with IBD who were monitored over 40 weeks of ustekinumab therapy and 39 healthy controls (HC). We found differences in the concentrations of serum levels of osteoprotegerin, TGF-β1, IL-33, and serum IgM antibodies against Lactobacillus plantarum between patients with IBD and HC. The levels of these biomarkers did not change in response to ustekinumab treatment or with disease improvement during the 40 weeks of observation. Additionally, we identified differences in stool abundance of uncultured Subdoligranulum, Faecalibacterium, and Bacteroides between patients with IBD and HC.In this preliminary study, we provide a unique overview of the longitudinal monitoring of fecal and skin microbial profiles as well as various serum biomarkers and humoral and cellular response to gut commensals in a small cohort of patients with IBD on ustekinumab therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4313318705,"Background Political participation is an important component of civil rights. Several studies have shown that citizens’ political participation not only influences the allocation of public resources, but also has a positive correlation with participants’ life satisfaction. Recently, political participation has become increasingly frequent in China; however, the research on Chinese citizens’ political participation and life satisfaction is insufficient. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between political participation and life satisfaction in the Chinese cultural context, and how this relationship varied under different conditions. Methods Based on 8,475 respondents from the 2015 Chinese Social Survey, ordinary least squares modeling was used to investigate the relationship of Chinese citizens’ political participation and their life satisfaction, and the differences that might exist in this relationship. Results Political participation was closely related to life satisfaction. Compared with non-political participants, the life satisfaction of political participants was 0.133 units higher, which was significant at the 1% level. Regarding the types of political participation, citizens engaged in institutionalized political participation had higher life satisfaction, whereas citizens engaged in non-institutionalized political participation had lower life satisfaction. Furthermore, two social capitals, namely social tolerance and social trust, were the mediating variables linking political participation to citizens’ life satisfaction. Conclusions In China, citizens engaged in political participation had higher life satisfaction, in contrast, citizens engaged in non-institutionalized political participation had lower life satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W4313318722,"Is visual perception ""rich"" or ""sparse?"" One finding supporting the ""rich"" hypothesis shows that a specific visual summary representation, color diversity, is represented ""cost-free"" outside focally-attended regions in dual-task paradigms [1]. Here, we investigated whether this ""cost-free"" phenomenon for color diversity perception extends to peripheral vision. After replicating previous findings and verifying that color diversity is represented ""cost-free"" in central vision, we performed two experiments: in our first experiment, we extended the paradigm to peripheral vision and found that in minimally-attended regions of space, color diversity perception was impaired. In a second and final experiment, we added confidence judgments to our task, and found that participants maintained high levels of metacognitive awareness of impaired performance in minimally-attended visual areas in the periphery. These findings provide evidence that color perception may be partially attention-dependent in peripheral vision, and challenge previous views on both sides of the rich vs. sparse debate."
https://openalex.org/W4313318770,"Population-based seroprevalence of chronic hepatitis B and C infections has not been examined in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of these infections in the general population of Lao PDR and perform subgroup analysis. A nationwide seroprevalence survey was conducted in Lao PDR in June 2019 using the multistage cluster sampling method. Dried blood spot samples were collected onto WhatmanTM 903 filter paper by finger prick. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to measure the levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C antibody (HCV-Ab). Samples in which the HBsAg level was above 0.05 IU/ml and HCV-Ab was above the signal/cutoff ratio of 1.0 were considered positive based on comparisons with the relative light unit value of a calibration sample. A total of 1,927 samples (male: 47.3%, mean age: 23.0 years) were included in the analysis. The prevalence was estimated to be 4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-6.3) for HBsAg and 1.6% (95% CI: 0.5-5.3) for HCV-Ab. Multivariable analysis revealed that those aged 20-24 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.6), those aged 25-29 years (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-5.6), those from the Northern region (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2-6.6), and those who were Khmu (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 2.0-6.8) or Hmong (AOR: 5.0, 95% CI: 3.3-7.5) were significantly more likely to be positive for HBsAg. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the HCV-Ab prevalence according to each variable, males (2.9%, 95% CI: 0.7-10.7), those aged ≥40 years (6.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-16.8), and those from the Southern region (3.3%, 95% CI: 0.6-15.3) tended to have a higher prevalence. This novel population-based survey found differences in the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections in Lao PDR according to sex, age group, region, and ethnicity; however, the results of this study should be confirmed in future studies, and relevant responses tailored for each target also need to be determined to control the transmission of hepatitis B and C infections."
https://openalex.org/W4313318777,"Cloud Data Computing (CDC) is conducive to precise energy-saving management of user data centers based on the real-time energy consumption monitoring of Information Technology equipment. This work aims to obtain the most suitable energy-saving strategies to achieve safe, intelligent, and visualized energy management. First, the theory of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is discussed. Besides, an intelligent energy-saving model based on CNN is designed to ameliorate the variable energy consumption, load, and power consumption of the CDC data center. Then, the core idea of the policy gradient (PG) algorithm is introduced. In addition, a CDC task scheduling model is designed based on the PG algorithm, aiming at the uncertainty and volatility of the CDC scheduling tasks. Finally, the performance of different neural network models in the training process is analyzed from the perspective of total energy consumption and load optimization of the CDC center. At the same time, simulation is performed on the CDC task scheduling model based on the PG algorithm to analyze the task scheduling demand. The results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the CNN algorithm in the CDC energy-saving model is better than that of the Elman algorithm and the ecoCloud algorithm. Besides, the CNN algorithm reduces the number of virtual machine migrations in the CDC energy-saving model by 9.30% compared with the Elman algorithm. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm performs the best in task scheduling of the cloud data center, and the average response time of the DDPG algorithm is 141. In contrast, the Deep Q Network algorithm performs poorly. This paper proves that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and neural networks can reduce the energy consumption of CDC and improve the completion time of CDC tasks, offering a research reference for CDC resource scheduling."
https://openalex.org/W4313318791,"Fucose, the terminal glycan of the intestinal glycoprotein Mucin2, was shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in mouse colitis models and modulate immune response due to macrophage polarization changes. In this study we evaluated the effect of 0.05% L-fucose supplementation of drinking water on immune parameters in the intestine of homozygous mutant Muc2 −/− , compared to Muc2 +/+ mice. To get into innate and adaptive immunity mechanisms of gut inflammation, we tested Prkdc SCID Muc2 −/− strain, Muc2 knockout on SCID background, that is characterized by lack of lymphocytes, in comparison with Prkdc SCID mice. We evaluated intestinal cytokine profiling, macrophage and eosinophil infiltration, and expression of Nos2 and Arg1 markers of macrophage activation in all strains. Markers of Th1, Treg and Th17 cells ( Tbx21 , Foxp3 , and Rorc expression) were evaluated in Muc2 −/− and Muc2 +/+ mice. Both Muc2 −/− and Prkdc SCID Muc2 −/− mice demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages, eosinophils, elevated levels of TNFa, GM-CSF, and IL-10 cytokines. In Muc2 −/− mice we observed a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated, such as IFN-gamma, IL-1b, IL-12p70, IL-6, M-CSF, G-CSF, IL-17, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP1b, MIP2. Muc2 −/− mice demonstrated increase of Nos2 , Tbx21 and Foxp3 genes mRNA, while in Prkdc SCID Muc2 −/− mice Arg1 expression was increased. We found that in Muc2 −/− mice L-fucose reduced macrophage infiltration and IL-1a, TNFa, IFNgamma, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP1b levels, decreased Nos2 expression, and induced the expression of Treg marker Foxp3 gene. On the contrary, in Prkdc SCID Muc2 −/− mice L-fucose had no effect on macrophage and eosinophil numbers, but increased TNFa, GM-CSF, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-15, IL-10, MCP1, G-CSF, IL-3 levels and Nos2 gene expression, and decreased Arg1 gene expression. We demonstrated that anti-inflammatory effect of L-fucose observed in Muc2 −/− mice is not reproduced in Prkdc SCID Muc2 −/− , which lack lymphocytes. We conclude that activation of Treg cells is a key event that leads to resolution of inflammation upon L-fucose supplementation in Muc2 −/− mice."
https://openalex.org/W4313318802,"Mental health inequalities along ethnic and socioeconomic groupings are well documented. The extent to which these observed inequalities are genuine or reflect measurement differences is unclear. In the current study we sought to investigate this in a large population-based sample of children and adolescents in the United Kingdom. The main objective of the study was to establish whether the parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was invariant across ethnicity and socioeconomic status groupings at six time points from 3 to 17 years (maximum N = 17,274). First, we fitted a series of confirmatory factor analysis models to the data and confirmed that the five-factor structure (emotional problems; peer problems; conduct problems; hyperactivity/inattention; and prosocial behaviour) had acceptable fit at ages 5, 7, 11, and 14 years. Next, we tested configural, metric, and scalar invariance at these time points and demonstrated scalar invariance across household income, parent highest education, and ethnicity categories. The five-factor structure did not fit well at ages 3 and 17 years; therefore invariance was not tested at these ages. These findings suggest the parent-report SDQ can be used to measure socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities in mental health from ages 5-14 years but more consideration is required outside these ages."
https://openalex.org/W4313364721,"Developing mathematical representations of biological systems that can allow predictions is a challenging and important research goal. It is demonstrated here how the ribosome, the nano-machine responsible for synthesizing all proteins necessary for cellular life, can be represented as a bipartite network. Ten ribosomal structures from Bacteria and six from Eukarya are explored. Ribosomal networks are found to exhibit unique properties despite variations in the nodes and edges of the different graphs. The ribosome is shown to exhibit very large topological redundancies, demonstrating mathematical resiliency. These results can potentially explain how it can function consistently despite changes in composition and connectivity. Furthermore, this representation can be used to analyze ribosome function within the large machinery of network theory, where the degrees of freedom are the possible interactions, and can be used to provide new insights for translation regulation and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4313365044,"The paper aims to empirically assess the effects of technological spillovers on economic growth and to examine the roles of host country absorptive capacity. The empirical analysis was carried out at the country level on a panel of five Asian countries covering the period from 1972 to 2018. As the variable of interest (technological spillovers) and mediator variable (absorptive capacity) are captured with a variety of indicators, hence two empirical models are estimated with different specifications. The study's findings indicate that technological spillovers through all three channels have a positive effect on economic and TFP growth. Touching on the role of absorptive capacity in technological spillovers and economic growth nexus, study findings reveal that the human capital of the sample countries has no significant role to absorbed imported technology in the growth process of the host country. However, the empirical indication illustrates that a country holding comparatively more domestic R&D expenditure yields the potential gain of technological spillovers in economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W4313365088,"Background Sparse data are available on prehospital care by Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) for pediatric patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study focusses on prehospital interventions, neurosurgical interventions and mortality in this group. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of pediatric (0–18 years of age) patients with TBI treated by Rotterdam HEMS. Results From January 2012 to December 2017 415 pediatric (&lt;18 years of age) patients with TBI were included. Intubation was required in in 92 of 111 patients with GCS ≤ 8, 92 (82.9%), compared to 12 of 77 (15.6%) with GCS 9–12, and 7 of 199 (3.5%) with GCS 13–15. Hyperosmolar therapy (HSS) was started in 73 patients, 10 with a GCS ≤8. Decompressive surgery was required in 16 (5.8%), nine patients (56.3%) of these received HSS from HEMS. Follow-up data was available in 277 patients. A total of 107 (38.6%) patients were admitted to a (P)ICU. Overall mortality rate was 6.3%(n = 25) all with GCS ≤8, 15 (60.0%) died within 24 hours and 24 (96.0%) within a week. Patients with neurosurgical interventions (N = 16) showed a higher mortality rate (18.0%). Conclusions The Dutch HEMS provides essential emergency care for pediatric TBI patients, by performing medical procedures outside of regular EMS protocol. Mortality was highest in patients with severe TBI (n = 111) (GCS≤8) and in those who required neurosurgical interventions. Despite a relatively good initial GCS (&gt;8) score, there were patients who required prehospital intubation and HSS. This group will require further investigation to optimize care in the future."
