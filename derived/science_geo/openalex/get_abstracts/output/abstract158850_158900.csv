https://openalex.org/W1578944750,"The expression pattern and activity of fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) in experimental assays indicate that it has important roles in limb development, but early embryonic lethality resulting from mutation of Fgf8 in the germ line of mice has prevented direct assessment of these roles. Here we report that conditional disruption of Fgf8 in the forelimb of developing mice bypasses embryonic lethality and reveals a requirement for Fgf8 in the formation of the stylopod, anterior zeugopod and autopod. Lack of Fgf8 in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) alters expression of other Fgf genes, Shh and Bmp2."

https://openalex.org/W2160371743,"The kidneys play pivotal roles in acid-base homeostasis, and the acid-secreting (α-type) and bicarbonate-secreting (β-type) intercalated cells in the collecting ducts are major sites for the final modulation of urinary acid secretion. Since the H+-ATPase and anion exchanger activities in these two types of intercalated cells exhibit opposite polarities, it has been suggested that the α- and β-intercalated cells are interchangeable via a cell polarity change. Immunohistological studies, however, have failed to confirm that the apical anion exchanger of β-intercalated cells is the band 3 protein localized to the basolateral membrane of α-intercalated cells. In the present study, we show the evidence that a novel member of the anion exchanger and sodium bicarbonate cotransporter superfamily is an apical anion exchanger of β-intercalated cells. Cloned cDNA from the β-intercalated cells shows about 30% homology with anion exchanger types 1–3, and functional expression of this protein in COS-7 cells and Xenopus oocytes showed sodium-independent and 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid-insensitive anion exchanger activity. Furthermore, immunohistological studies revealed that this novel anion exchanger is present on the apical membrane of β-intercalated cells, although some β-intercalated cells were negative for AE4 staining. We conclude that our newly cloned transporter is an apical anion exchanger of the β-intercalated cells, whereas our data do not exclude the possibility that there may be another form of anion exchanger in these cellsAB038263AB038264.

Proximal convoluted tubules reabsorb bicarbonate from the primary urine, and the Na+/H+exchanger and sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC)1 are the key transporters for this function. Cortical to medullary collecting ducts secrete protons and bicarbonate, whereas proton secretion occurs predominantly under usual conditions. Over the past 2 decades, the mechanisms of these acid-base transporters have been extensively studied. In the cortical collecting ducts, there are at least two types of intercalated cells, α and β, which secrete protons and bicarbonate, respectively (1Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The α-intercalated cells possess H+-ATPase and an anion exchanger on the apical membrane and the basolateral membrane, respectively (1Schuster V.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Brown D. Hirsch S. Gluck S.L. Nature. 1988; 331: 622-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 3Schuster V.L. Bonsib S.M. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C347-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This basolateral anion exchanger in the α-intercalated cells is a truncated form of band 3 protein (4Kudrycki K.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8185-8192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anion exchanger (AE) type 1 (5Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), and its localization was revealed by immunohistochemical studies (3Schuster V.L. Bonsib S.M. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C347-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Madsen K.M. Kim J. Tisher C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1015-F1022PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, β-intercalated cells possess H+-ATPase and an anion exchanger on the basolateral and the apical membranes, respectively. In the early work of Schuster et al. (3Schuster V.L. Bonsib S.M. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C347-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that peanut lectin binds exclusively to β-intercalated cells. Further immunohistochemical studies (7Schuster V.L. Fejes-Tóth G. Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F506-F517PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that a minority of the intercalated cells had basolateral band 3 protein labeling with apical peanut lectin binding, raising the possibility that there might be a third type of intercalated cell. Functional studies by Emmons and Kurtz (8Emmons C. Kurtz I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) also suggested that about half of the peanut lectin-positive cells might be a variant of β-intercalated cells, which showed anion exchanger activities on the both apical and the basolateral membranes. The apical anion exchanger in the peanut -lectin-positive cells, however, exhibits several differences in its transporter characteristics, such as 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) sensitivity (8Emmons C. Kurtz I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Emmons C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F635-F643PubMed Google Scholar), as compared with AE1. Furthermore, since immunohistological studies with a specific antibody directed against the band 3 protein have not shown positive staining on the apical membranes of β-intercalated cells (3Schuster V.L. Bonsib S.M. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C347-C355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Madsen K.M. Kim J. Tisher C.C. Am. J.

Physiol. 1991; 260: F506-F517PubMed Google Scholar), it has been suggested that this apical anion exchanger is a transporter distinct from AE1. In contrast to these previous immunocytochemical and functional studies, van Adelsberg et al. (10van Adelsberg J.S. Edwards J.C. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11283-11289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that purified and immortalized β-intercalated cells express AE1 and have apical anion exchanger activity, suggesting that the difference in the characteristics of the apical and basolateral membranes is responsible for the difference in the immunoreactivity to the anti-AE1 antibody in immunohistological studies. Fejes-Tóth et al. (11Fejes-Tóth G. Chen W.-R. Rusvai E. Moser T. Náray-Fejes-Tóth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26717-26721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, reported that primary cultures of β-intercalated cells showed very low levels of AE1 mRNA and protein expression. In the present study, we examined whether there is indeed a novel anion exchanger in β-intercalated cells, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cloning method. The obtained cDNA was determined to be a new member of the AE and NBC superfamily, and this novel transporter is present on the apical membranes of the β-intercalated cells. The β-intercalated cells were collected by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, as previously reported (12Ikeda M. Iyori M. Yoshitomi K. Hayashi M. Imai M. Saruta T. Kurokawa K. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). Female New Zealand White rabbits (1.2–1.8 kg) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (35 mg/kg, intravenously). Both kidneys were immediately removed and perfused through cannulae inserted into the renal arteries with solution A at 4 °C (which contained (in mm) NaCl 115, KCl 5.0, MgSO4 1.0, CaCl2 1.8, sodium acetate 10, Na2HPO4 1.6, NaH2PO40.4, Na-HEPES 5, H-HEPES 5, and d-glucose 8.3, at pH 7.4) containing 0.2% collagenase and 0.02% hyaluronidase. The kidney cortex was separated and cut into small pieces. The pieces were incubated in the enzyme-containing solution A at 37 °C for 5 min. After this enzymatic digestion, tubular fragments were obtained by centrifugation (50 × g) and washed three times with enzyme-free solution A. The fragments were suspended in 40% Percoll solution and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. With this centrifugation, the tubular fragments were separated into two layers, and the distal tubular fragments became concentrated in the upper layer. This layer was resuspended and washed three times with solution A. These fragments were further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min under a 100% O2 atmosphere in solution A containing 0.2% collagenase, 0.02% hyaluronidase, and 500 units of DNase. The cells were then centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in solution A containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled peanut lectin (50 μg/ml). The cell suspension was passed 2 times through a 26-μm stainless steel mesh. The final density of the cells was adjusted to 1–1.5 × 107 cells/ml with solution A. The cells were analyzed and sorted with an Epics cell sorter system (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) as reported previously (12Ikeda M. Iyori M. Yoshitomi K. Hayashi M. Imai M. Saruta T. Kurokawa K. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 231-241PubMed Google Scholar). Living single cells were distinguished by forward and 90° light scatter, according to the criteria in the aforementioned report. The purity of the sorted β-intercalated cells was examined by flow cytometric analysis or counting of FITC-positive and -negative cells by fluorescence microscopy. These analyses showed the purity of the cells to be about 95%. Total RNA from β-intercalated cells was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with a random hexamer (Gene Amp RNA PCR Core kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR was performed with a pair of degenerate primers: 5′-AAGGG(C/T)TC(G/C)GG(G/C/T)TTCCA(C/T)CT-3′ (forward, F-1) and 5′-GTGAC(G/C/T)CCCATGTA(G/C)AGGAA-3′ (reverse, R-1), which were designed from the consensus sequences of AE1 to AE3 (GenBankTM accession numbers X12609, S45791, and AF031650). The cycler (DNA Thermal Cycler 480, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was programmed as follows: 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 44 °C for 30 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 60 s (extension) with 30 cycles. An additional final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min (final extension) was then performed. A band corresponding to an ∼300-bp PCR product was isolated by gel electrophoresis and subcloned. Two out of 30 clones, which were sequenced with an ABI Dideoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems), were considered to be a partial cDNA of the novel anion exchanger, named AE4. Among the 30 sequenced clones, 14 clones were highly homologous to cDNA of human AE1 (GenBankTM accession number X12609), and 14 clones were identical to cDNA of rabbit AE2 (GenBankTM accession number S45791). The partial AE4 cDNA was extended toward the 5′-site end by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with the AE4-specific primer, 5′-CTGATGCCCAGGAAGCTGTG-3′ (RT-1), for the RT reaction and the forward primer, 5′-ATCACTTTTGGAGGACTGCTTGG-3′ (F-2), which was designed from the AE consensus sequence, and reverse primer, 5′-GCTCGGCTCTCCCTCCGAAG-3′ (AE4-specific, R-2), for PCR. An ∼1-kb PCR product containing the partial AE4 sequence was obtained. The 5′-region of this 1-kb fragment (5′-GCCTTCTGCAGAGATTACAGCCTG-3′, probe-1) was used for the cDNA library screening. The rabbit kidney uni-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was purchased and mass-excised in accordance with the instructions provided, and it was then screened with the GeneTrapper cDNA-positive Selection System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two positive clones (∼2.3 and ∼2.5 kb) were obtained, and sequencing analysis showed both clones to contain the partial AE4 sequence and that the 2.5- and 2.3-kb clones contained identical sequences. The 5′-RACE System (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to obtain full-length AE4 cDNA with the primer, 5′-AGCACAGCTGAGACACACTG-3′ (GSP-31), for the RT reaction. A pair of primers, the forward primer, 5′-RACE Abridged Anchor Primer (included in the kit), and reverse primer, 5′-TGCAGGGCATCCGAGAAATC-3′ (GSP-32), was used for the PCR. These two primers, GSP-31 and -32, were designed from the 5′-region of the 2.3-kb AE4 clone. Approximately 1.1-kb PCR products were obtained and subcloned into the TA cloning vector. Sequencing of several clones yielded clones of two lengths, one short and one long. The shorter cDNA was 48 bp shorter than the longer cDNA. The procedure for the sequencing of full-length AE4 is summarized in Fig. 1. To clone full-length cDNA of AE4 for functional studies, we performed RT-PCR again with the primer GSP-31 for the RT reaction, and forward primer tagged with an EcoRI recognition sequence at the 5′-end, 5′-ATCAGAATTCAGCTGTGCCGCTCCCAGCAT-3′, and reverse primer (GSP-32) for the PCR. Two PCR products of different lengths were obtained and subcloned. Both clones were ligated at the KpnI site with the 2.3-kb AE4 cDNA, which was obtained by cDNA library screening, as described above. The sequences of the obtained cDNA were verified; the longer and shorter clones were named AE4a and AE4b, respectively. For the functional study, the AE4a cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector at theEcoRI and HindIII sites (pcDNA AE4a). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) using oligo(dT)-cellulose from various rabbit tissues. In each lane, 1–5 μg of RNA were electrophoresed. The blot was hybridized for 18 h in hybridization solution at 63 °C, with a 32P-labeled probe prepared from the full-length cDNA of the newly cloned anion exchanger gene. A final high stringency wash was performed at 61 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and the blot was exposed to the Imaging Plate (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The blot was re-hybridized with a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate probe, which was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). COS-7 cells were grown and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in humidified incubators at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-cm culture dishes, 18 h prior to transfection with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. pcDNA AE4a, pEGFP N3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), or control vector pcDNA was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells by the LipofectAMINE method. After 36–42 h of incubation, the transfected COS-7 cells were used for functional studies, and the efficiency of the GFP transfection was determined by an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). In each of the transfection studies, 100 cells on the coverslips with the GFP-transfected COS-7 cells were observed and the ratio of GFP-positive to total cells was calculated. 36–42 h after the transfection, the transfected COS-7 cells were loaded with 10 μm of an acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2′7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. To determine the function of AE4, we studied the effects of Cl− removal on the intracellular pH (pHi) in AE4- and vector-transfected COS-7 cells. The superfusion solution (solution B), containing (in mm) NaCl 115, NaHCO3 25, KCl 5, Na2HPO4 1.6, NaH2PO40.4, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, andd-glucose 10, at pH 7.4, was gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 and was changed continuously with a peristapump at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The solution was preheated through a water-jacketed line, and the temperature of the superfusion chamber was maintained at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured with an Argus 50 system (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan). Cultured cells loaded with BCECF-AM were excited alternately at 480 and 430 nm by a computer-controlled shutter for 1/30 of a second, and the fluorescent image at 510 nm was obtained at each excitation wavelength (a set of fluorescent images). The ratio of the intensity of fluorescence at 480 nm to that at 430 nm was calculated for each set of images. The mean of 16 sets of images was taken as one measurement value and stored and processed in a personal computer. The 16 sets of images were obtained every 10 s. After a 15-min equilibration period, pHi measurement was started. After measuring basal pHi for 1–2 min, solution B was quickly changed to Cl−-free solution, containing (in mm) sodium gluconate 115, NaHCO3 25, potassium gluconate 5, Na2HPO4 1.6, NaH2PO4 0.4, calcium gluconate 3.5, magnesium gluconate 1, and d-glucose 10, at pH 7.4, and gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. After a 4–6-min superfusion with the Cl−-free solution, the superfusion solution was changed to solution B. After acquisition of fluorescent images, the pHi was calibrated by the nigericin method as reported previously (14Hayashi M. Yamaji Y. Iyori M. Kitajima W. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 10–20 cells in each dish were chosen, and the pHi was calculated by using a calibration curve. In each independent transfection, patch clamp studies and pHimeasurements on the AE4-transfected cells and mock-transfected cells were performed on the same day. The rate of pHi change (dpHi/dt) during the initial 30 s after Cl− removal from the bath was calculated from the recording of pHi by a personal computer. The pHiand dpHi/dt measurements were also performed with Cl−- and Na+-free solutions. The Na+-free solution contained (in mm) tetramethylammonium (TMA)-Cl 115, TMA-HCO3 25, K2HPO4 2, KH2PO4 0.5, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, and d-glucose 10. The Na+- and Cl−-free solution contained (in mm) TMA hydroxide 115, gluconic acid lactone 115, TMA-HCO3 25, K2HPO4 2, KH2PO4 0.5, calcium gluconate 3.5, magnesium gluconate 1, and d-glucose 10. Both solutions were gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 and adjusted to pH 7.4 by TMA hydroxide or gluconic acid lactone. In addition, the pHi and dpHi/dtmeasurements were performed with Cl− and HCO 3−-free solutions in another series of experiments with four independent transfections. The HCO 3−-free solution contained (in mm) NaCl 115, sodium gluconate 15, Na-HEPES 5, H-HEPES 5, KCl 5, Na2HPO4 1.6, NaH2PO4 0.4, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, and d-glucose 10. The Cl−- and HCO 3−-free solution contained (in mm) sodium gluconate 130, Na-HEPES 5, H-HEPES 5, potassium gluconate 5, Na2HPO41.6, NaH2PO4 0.4, calcium gluconate 3.5, magnesium gluconate 1, and d-glucose 10. Both solutions were gassed with 100% O2 and adjusted to pH 7.4 by Na-HEPES or H-HEPES. A coverslip to which cultured cells had adhered was placed in a recording chamber, and the chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with Nomarski optics (IX-70, Olympus, Japan) and an × 40 objective lens. The chamber was continuously superfused with solutions, gravity-fed at a rate of ∼1 ml/min at room temperature (∼25 °C). Membrane voltages were recorded by a patch clamp method in the whole cell configuration. The patch pipette was made of Pyrex tubing pulled on a micropipette puller (P-87, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The recording pipette was connected to the input stage of a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). An Ag-AgCl wire connected to the bath via a ceramic bridge served as an indifferent electrode. The pipette resistance was ∼10 MΩ when filled with pipette solution. The input capacitance and the series resistance were electrically compensated to the maximal extent possible. Signals were low-pass filtered (Bessel filter, cut-off frequency 5 kHz) and sampled at 10 kHz with a DigiData 1200 interface and pCLAMP 8 software (Axon Instruments) or a digital tape recorder (Sony Precision, Japan). Recorded data were analyzed with Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Three external solutions for the current clamp experiments were used. The CO2/HCO 3−-free external solution contained (in mm) NaCl 115, sodium gluconate 15, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, Na-HEPES 5, H-HEPES 5, and d-glucose 10 (pH 7.4, gassed with 100% O2). The CO2/HCO 3− external solution contained (in mm) NaCl 115, NaHCO3 25, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and d-glucose 10 (pH 7.4, gassed with 5% CO2 and 95% O2). The Na+-free external solution contained (in mm) TMA-Cl 115, TMA-HCO3 25, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, and d-glucose 10 (pH 7.4, gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2). The pipette solution contained (in mm) KCl 20, potassium gluconate 110, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 1, EGTA 5, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.3). cRNA synthesis and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (15Kusuhara H. Sekine T. Utusnomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Kojima R. Cha S.H. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13675-13680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase from the plasmid DNA linearized withHindIII. Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 10–50 ng of the capped AE4 cRNA and incubated in Barth's solution, which contained (in mm) NaCl 88, KCl 1.0, Ca(NO3)2 0.33, CaCl2 0.44, MgSO4 0.8, NaHCO3 2.4, and HEPES 10 with 10 μg/ml gentamicin at 18 °C. After 2–3 days of incubation, uptake experiments were performed at room temperature in flux media (which contained (in mm) NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5) containing 0.1 mm bumetanide to block the endogenous Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter as reported previously (16Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1295-C1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A group of 4–8 oocytes was placed in microtiter wells containing 300 μl of the flux medium with 3.52 μCi of Na36Cl. This quantity of isotope added 14.4 mm to the NaCl concentration of the flux medium. After incubation, isotopic influx was terminated by rapid transfer through three 5-ml washes with Cl−-free ND-96 (which contained (in mm) sodium isethionate 96, potassium gluconate 2, calcium gluconate 1.8, magnesium gluconate 1, HEPES 5, bumetanide 0.1). Individual oocytes were then quickly transferred to 4-ml scintillation vials containing 250 μl of 10% SDS. Sodium-independent36Cl− flux was measured in the Na+-free flux medium (which contained (in mm) TMA-Cl 86, TMA hydroxide 20, KCl 2, CaCl2 1.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, bumetanide 0.1, H36Cl 20). In this experiment, after incubation, the oocytes were washed three times with 5 ml of Cl−- and Na+-free medium (which contained (in mm) TMA hydroxide 96, gluconic acid lactone 96, potassium gluconate 2, calcium gluconate 1.8, magnesium gluconate 1, bumetanide 0.1). The 36Cl− flux was also measured in a flux medium containing 200 μm DIDS (which contained (in mm) NaCl 96, KCl 2, CaCl21.8, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, bumetanide 0.1) with 3.52 μCi of Na36Cl for each sample. In these experiments, DIDS was added 20 min before the start of incubation with the flux medium. The influx values were calculated as nanomoles of chloride per oocyte in the time course experiments. In the experiments on sodium dependence and DIDS sensitivity, the influx values were calculated as nanomoles of chloride per oocyte per min. Rat polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal amino acids of AE4 (residues LMYQPKAPEINISVN). A cysteine residue was attached to the N terminus of the peptide to introduce an SH residue for coupling. The 16-amino acid CLMYQPKAPEINISVN was synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl method. A synthetic peptide conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the sulfo-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester method was used to immunize two Wistar rats with Freund's complete adjuvant (first injection) or incomplete adjuvant (from the second injection). After five injections, a sufficient increase of the antibody titer was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum was collected. Specific antibodies were prepared from the antiserum by affinity column chromatography using the antigen peptide coupled to 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium-toluene-4-sulfonate-activated Cellulofine (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Membrane fractions were prepared from the kidneys of female New Zealand White rabbits. The kidneys were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) via the renal artery. After washing as much blood as possible out of the kidney, the cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla were dissected. Crude tissue homogenates were prepared by homogenization in ice-cold buffer (which contained (in mm) sucrose 320, Tris-HCl 10, EDTA 2, PMSF 0.1, pepstatin A 1 μg/ml, leupeptin 1 μg/ml) with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Crude homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 20 min to remove nuclei and tissue debris, and a supernatant was obtained. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was suspended in the same buffer (membrane fraction). Total protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. Fifty micrograms of the membrane fraction from each part of the kidney were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) on 5% gels. Proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with affinity-purified anti-AE4 antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized by an ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Cappel, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aurora, OH) as the second antibody. To determine antigen specificity, the antibody solutions (0.5 μg/ml of IgG) were preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (50 μg/ml). Kidneys from female New Zealand White rabbits were fixed by perfusion of a periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde mixture via the renal artery. The kidney pieces were embedded in OCT compound in dry ice and isopentane, and thin sections (∼6 μm) were prepared with a cryotome. The kidney sections were stained with affinity-purified polyclonal rat antibody raised against the C terminus of rabbit AE4 and post-stained with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Cappel) as follows. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. The sections were washed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified polyclonal rat antibody against rabbit AE4 (IgG concentration 4 μg/ml). The tissue sections were then washed in PBS (4 times) and incubated for 2 h in peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG diluted 1:200 in PBS. The sections were washed in PBS (4 times), and peroxidase was detected by incubation in solution containing 0.1% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. After color development, the samples were washed in PBS. For light microscopy, the sections were counterstained with methyl green, dehydrated, and coverslipped. For immunofluorescence observations, rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Cappel) was used as the second antibody. After incubation with the first antibody, the tissue sections were stained in PBS containing rhodamine-labeled antibody and FITC-labeled peanut lectin (10 μg/ml) for 2 h. The sections were washed in PBS (4 times) and viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LM510, Carl Zeiss Co. Ltd., Jena, Germany). For FITC, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and 505 nm, respectively. For rhodamine, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 568 and 585 nm, respectively. To determine antigen specificity, the antibody solutions were preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (100 μg/ml). The results are expressed as means ± S.E. in the text and figures. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance and Fisher's test.p < 0.05 was considered to denote statistical significance. Unless stated otherwise, all the chemicals employed were purchased from Sigma or Wako Junyaku Co. (Osaka, Tokyo, Japan). As described under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.1, the full-length cDNA of AE4 was cloned and sequenced. Among the 30 clones sequenced, only 2 clones contained a novel cDNA sequence of AE. Since the sequences of the degenerate primers contained sequences completely matching those of AE1 and AE2 and were 80–90% homologous with the cloned AE4, the relatively low frequency of the AE4 clone among the 30 clones does not necessarily mean that AE4 mRNA expre"

https://openalex.org/W1502871643,"In circulating lymphocytes, the VLA-4 integrin preexists in multiple affinity states that mediate spontaneous tethering, rolling, and arrest on its endothelial ligand, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The regulation and function of VLA-4 affinity in lymphocytes has never been elucidated. We show here that p56lck, the major Src kinase in T cells, is a key regulator of high affinity VLA-4. This high affinity is essential for the rapid development of firm adhesion of resting T cells to VCAM-1 and to their extracellular matrix ligand, fibronectin. Lck-regulated VLA-4 function does not require intact TCR nor several key components of the TCR signaling pathway, including ZAP-70 and SLP-76. Furthermore, stimulation of p56lck by the phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, triggers firm VLA-4-dependent adhesion to VCAM-1. Although Lck is not required for chemokine receptor signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinase, the presence of Lck-regulated high affinity VLA-4 also facilitates firm adhesion triggered by the chemokine, SDF-1, at short-lived contacts. Surprisingly, bond formation rates, ability to tether cells to VLA-4 ligand, and VLA-4 tether bond stability under shear flow are not affected by VLA-4 affinity or Lck activity. Thus, the ability of high affinity VLA-4 to arrest cells on VCAM-1 under flow arises from instantaneous post-ligand strengthening rather than from increased kinetic stability of individual VLA-4 bonds. These results suggest that p56lck maintains high affinity VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, which determines their ability to strengthen VLA-4 adhesion and rapidly respond to proadhesive chemokine signals at endothelial sites.

These results suggest that p56lck maintains high affinity VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, which determines their ability to strengthen VLA-4 adhesion and rapidly respond to proadhesive chemokine signals at endothelial sites. Lymphocytes circulating throughout the blood and lymphatic tissues respond to inflammatory cytokines and antigenic signals (1Springer T.A. Cell.. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). These cytokine and antigenic stimuli regulate both the expression and function of vascular receptors on effector and memory lymphocytes, which determine their preferential migration to extra lymphoid sites of inflammation (2Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Science.. 1996; 272: 60-66Google Scholar). To emigrate from the circulation into inflamed tissues, lymphocytes must develop rapid firm adhesion to endothelial ligands, displayed on the vascular endothelium within the target tissue. This firm adhesion is mediated primarily by the binding of lymphocyte integrins such as VLA-4 (α4β1), LFA-1, and α4β7 to their respective endothelial ligands expressed or induced on vessel walls of target sites (3Berlin C. Bargatze R.F. Campbell J.J. von Andrian U.H. Szabo M.C. Hasslen S.R. Nelson R.D. Berg E.L. Erlandsen S.L. Butcher E.C. Cell.. 1995; 80: 413-422Google Scholar, 4Warnock R.A. Askari S. Butcher E.C. von Andrian U.H. J. Exp. Med... 1998; 187: 205-216Google Scholar). To induce cell arrest on their endothelial ligands, lymphocyte integrins must rapidly stabilize their short-lived contacts with endothelial ligands without modulation of integrin surface expression. Stabilization of lymphocyte contacts could be critical for their subsequent response to endothelium-displayed chemoattractants (chemokines) (5Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp.

Previously we and others have demonstrated that low affinity VLA-4 subsets mediate weak tethering and rolling interactions of VLA-4-expressing lymphocytes on vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1)1 under shear flow (3Berlin C.

We further demonstrated that a small subset of high affinity VLA-4 expressed by a portion of circulating peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBL) or resting T leukemia Jurkat cells supports tethers followed by firm arrest on high density VCAM-1, even in the absence of stimulatory chemokines (14Chen C.

Indeed, stimulation of integrin function by TCR-signaling elements and associated costimulatory molecules is not accompanied by induction of high affinity states in the major lymphocyte integrins VLA-4, VLA-5, and LFA-1 (31Stewart M.P.

We demonstrate here that a high affinity VLA-4 subset continuously regulated by Lck preexists on resting Jurkat cells as well as on freshly isolated blood T cells. This subset is crucial for these lymphocytes to firmly adhere to endothelial VCAM-1 and the extracellular matrix ligand fibronectin (FN), both in the absence and presence of chemokine-triggering signals. We show that this high affinity subset is continuously regulated by Lck in resting cells, independent of their TCR activation state and of key components of the TCR signaling machinery. Lck-deficient cells are devoid of high affinity VLA-4 subsets, display reduced adhesion strengthening to VCAM-1 and FN, and exhibit impaired integrin responsiveness to T cell chemokines compared with their Lck-reconstituted analogue cells. The study also sheds new light on how integrin affinity to ligand translates into tether adhesion strengthening events under dynamic context of shear flow. Our work suggests that Lck activity in T cells is a checkpoint in the generation of high affinity VLA-4, which may determine the migratory patterns of T cells to specific sites of inflammation expressing high levels of endothelial and extracellular matrix VLA-4 ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and AntibodiesThe function-blocking HP1/2 mAb specific for the integrin α4 subunit (34Sanchez-Madrid F.

Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (Biological Industries, Beithemeek, Israel), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Biological Industries), 100 mm nonessential amino acids (Biological Industries), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Merck), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Lck-expressing transfectants were grown in the same medium supplemented with 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Human PBL (obtained from healthy donors) were isolated from citrate-anticoagulated buffy coats by dextran sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation separation as previously described (43Carr M.W. Alon R. Springer T.A. Immunity.. 1996; 4: 179-187Google Scholar). The mononuclear cells were further purified on nylon wool, and monocytes were removed by plastic adsorption. The resulting PBL were >90% CD3+ T lymphocytes.Western Blot Analysis10 × 106 cells were solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmvanadate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) and, 10-μl lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing buffer. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes and reacted with either monoclonal anti-Lck (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), or anti-phosphospecific extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (a kind gift from Dr. Rony Seger, Weizmann Institute) followed by peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson) or reacted with polyclonal anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (provided by R.

Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Sigma).Immunofluorescence Flow CytometryCells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in FACS wash buffer (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% sodium azide) and incubated with primary antibodies (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then washed and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and analyzed immediately on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Erembodegem, Belgium).For surface staining of β1 integrin activation epitopes and for monitoring the induction of ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes by soluble peptide ligand, intact or treated cells were incubated for 5 min at 24 °C in H/H binding medium (Hanks' buffered saline solution containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) alone or in the presence of LDV- or DVL-containing octapeptides. The LIBS-specific anti-β1 mAbs, 15/7, 9EG7, or HUTS, were then added at 10 μg/ml to the cell suspension for an additional 5 min at 24 °C, and cells were then incubated on ice for an additional 30-min period. Unbound mAbs were washed out at 4 °C by multiple washing followed by staining with PE-conjugated goat-anti mouse Ig. Induction of the 15/7 or 9EG7 epitope was determined and expressed as mean fluorescence intensity units, with the preimmune mIgG control staining subtracted. To compare ligand-induced 15/7 staining among differently treated PBL, 15/7 staining in the presence of 10 μg/ml control DVL peptide was subtracted from the 15/7 staining in the presence of equimolar LDV peptide.Binding of [3H]BIO-1211 to α4β1-expressing Jurkat Cells[3H]BIO-1211, a radiolabeled LDV derivative was prepared as described (44Lin K.

For equilibrium binding measurements, Jurkat cells were incubated for 40 min with increasing concentrations of [3H]BIO-1211 in Tris-buffered saline binding medium (50 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4) containing either Ca2+ and Mg2+ (1 mm each) or Mn2+ (2 mm). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and bound ligand was quantitated by scintillation counting as described (35Chen L.L. Whitty A. Lobb R.R. Adams S.P. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 13167-13175Google Scholar). Background binding determined in the absence of divalent cations was subtracted from total binding counts. For kon measurements, cells were incubated with 0.5–5 nm [3H]BIO-1211, and at specific time points, cell samples were taken, diluted with 500-fold excess of unlabeled BIO-1211 ligand, and immediately pelleted and quantitated by scintillation counting. The konwas determined by multiplying the observed binding rate constant by the BIO-1211 concentration. For koff measurements, cells were incubated with 5 nm [3H]BIO-1211 for 40 min, diluted with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled BIO-1211 to quench further binding of [3H]BIO-1211, and further incubated for increasing periods up to 120 min. Cell samples were pelleted at different time points, and radiolabeled ligand binding was determined as above. Data were expressed as a percentage of the maximum specific radioligand binding and were fit to an exponential curve by nonlinear regression, yielding the first orderkoff as described (35Chen L.L.

Cells were then washed twice by suspension in H/H binding medium and incubated with PE-donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson) for 20 min at 4 °C (in binding medium) before washing with PBS, and fluorescence was analyzed by FACS. The results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity units.Preparation of Adhesive SubstratesAffinity-purified seven-domain human VCAM-1 (45Lobb R. Chi-Rosso G. Leone D. Rosa M. Newman B.

The plate was then washed three times and blocked with human serum albumin (20 mg/ml PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C. For SDF-1 coimmobilization on the adhesive substrate, ligands were coated in the presence of normal or heat-denatured chemokine (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (2 μg/ml) and a carrier protein (human serum albumin, 2 μg/ml) and washed and quenched as above.Laminar Flow Adhesion AssaysAnalysis of Cell Tethering, Rolling, and ArrestA polystyrene plate on which purified ligand had been adsorbed was assembled in a parallel plate laminar flow chamber (260-μm gap) mounted on the stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Diaphot 30, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (46Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell.. 1991; 65: 859-873Google Scholar, 47Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature.. 1995; 374: 539-542Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cation-free H/H medium containing 5 mm EDTA and stored in cation-free H/H medium at room temperature up to 1 h. Cells were diluted with H/H binding medium and perfused through the flow chamber at the desired shear stress generated with an automated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA). All experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Cell images were videotaped with a long integration LIS-700 CCD video camera (Applitech, Holon, Israel) and a Sony SLV E400 video recorder (Sony, Japan) and manually quantified by analysis directly from the monitor screen. All adhesive interactions between the cells flowing over ligand-coated substrates at low shear stresses of 0.5–1.5 dyn/cm2 were tracked and quantified. Tethering events were defined as adhesive interactions between cells and the substrate. Four categories of cell tethers under flow were defined as follows. Tethers were defined as transient if cells attached briefly (<2 s) to the substrate in a VLA-4-dependent manner, rolling if cells displayed rolling motions >5 s with a velocity of at least 1 μm/s, and slow rolling if cells rolled >5 s with a velocity of less than 1 μm/s, and arrests were defined as cells that immediately arrested on the substrate, remaining adherent and stationary for at least 20 s of continuous flow. Firm arrests were defined as cells that arrested under flow and resisted detachment when subjected to abruptly increased shear force of 2.5 dyn/cm2 for 5 s. The number of tethers for each was divided by the flux of freely flowing cells in close proximity to the substrate that moved through the same field during the analysis period.Analysis of Transient Cell Tethers to Low Density VCAM-1Transient tethers were determined as previously described (47Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature.. 1995; 374: 539-542Google Scholar) at a resolution of 0.02 s in a digital still playback mode (Panasonic AG-7355, Osaka, Japan). Background tethering to VCAM-1-coated fields blocked with the VCAM-1-blocking mAb, 4B9, was less than 5% of overall tethers. All tethering events were set to start at t = 0, and the natural log of the tethers that remained bound after initiation of tethering derived from the duration of all transient tethers and was plotted against tether duration to yield a slope = −koff.Analysis of Cell Resistance to Detachment after Static Contact with LigandCells were allowed to settle onto the substrate for 1–2 min at stasis. Flow was then initiated and increased stepwise every 5 s. The number of cells that remained bound was expressed relative to the number of cells originally settled on the substrate. Prolonged adhesion assays were similarly performed by allowing cells to settle for 15 min on flow chamber-assembled substrates. Nonadherent cells were removed by a single 2-s wash of cells at a shear stress of 50 dyn/cm2.DISCUSSIONIntegrin-mediated adhesion strengthening can result from changes in intrinsic affinity to ligand as well as alterations in lateral integrin clustering and post-ligand cell spreading, which generate high avidity to multivalent ligand through low affinity integrin subsets (31Stewart M.P.

Leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium under shear flow involves the establishment of rapid integrin-dependent adhesion within subseconds to seconds of leukocyte contact with the endothelium, suggesting that high affinity recognition of ligand by integrin molecules is important rather than integrin recruitment at the adhesive zone or cell spreading (31Stewart M.P. Cabanas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol... 1996; 156: 1810-1817Google Scholar, 32Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 121: 155-162Google Scholar). In this study, we examined how integrin affinity contributes to cell adhesion in different contexts of recognition of immobilized ligands,i.e. ligand density, contact time, shear flow, and proadhesive cytokines. Our study assigns a major role for high affinity integrin recognition of ligand in regulating rapid development of firm integrin-dependent adhesion at short-lived adhesive zones under physiological flow and during short static contacts.A subset of VLA-4, found by us to be constitutively regulated on T cells by the Src kinase p56lck, exhibits high affinity to both fibronectin-derived VLA-4 binding peptides and soluble VCAM-1. This high affinity VLA-4 was found crucial for development of firm VLA-4-mediated adhesions by T cells interacting with VCAM-1 and fibronectin at short-lived contacts and under shear flow. Adhesive interactions mediated by low affinity VLA-4 subsets were found to support only weak adhesions to VCAM-1, which readily dissociated under high shear forces (Figs. 1 B, 3, and 4A). Dissecting the relationship between ligand binding properties and adhesiveness of distinct states of VLA-4, we found that both high affinity and low affinity VLA-4 subsets (expressed by Lck-expressing and -deficient cells, respectively) bind a soluble monovalent fibronectin-derived VLA-4 peptide with similarkon, which corresponded to similar rates of tether formation supported by both VLA-4 subsets on immobilized VCAM-1 (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with our previous findings that the formation rate of VLA-4 tethers to VCAM-1 does not depend on the VLA-4 affinity state in Jurkat and PBL (14Chen C. Mobley J.L. Dwir O. Shimron F. Grabovsky V. Lobb R.L. Shimizu Y. Alon R. J. Immunol... 1999; 162: 1084-1095Google Scholar). High affinity VLA-4 recognition of VCAM-1 in Lck-expressing cells, but not in Lck-deficient cells could, however, translate within subseconds of contact to rapid adhesion strengthening on high density VCAM-1 under flow (Fig.4 A). Unexpectedly, high affinity VLA-4 dissociated from low density VCAM-1 with similar rates to low affinity VLA-4 (Fig.4 B), suggesting that intrinsic tether bond lifetimes mediated by either low or high affinity VLA-4 are similar. Similar findings were observed with another Jurkat cell line, an activation mutant defective in PKC signaling and high VLA-4 affinity that failed to translate VLA-4 tethers to high density VCAM-1 into adhesion strengthening events (14Chen C. Mobley J.L. Dwir O. Shimron F. Grabovsky V. Lobb R.L. Shimizu Y. Alon R. J. Immunol... 1999; 162: 1084-1095Google Scholar) but exhibited identical bond formation rates and similar kinetic stability of tether bonds in the presence of shear flow. 2C. Chen and R. Alon, unpublished results. This is a first demonstration that equilibrium properties of integrin bonds do not correlate to the kinetics of these bonds in the"
