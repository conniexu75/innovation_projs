https://openalex.org/W2026070522,"We have cloned and sequenced a gene (MF alpha) coding for alpha-factor, a tridecapeptide mating factor secreted by yeast alpha cells. A plasmid carrying the MF alpha gene was identified by screening for production of alpha-factor by mat alpha 2 mutants, which fail to secrete alpha-factor because of simultaneous synthesis and degradation of the factor. The cloned segment codes for four mature alpha-factor within a putative precursor of 165 amino acids. The putative precursor begins as a signal sequence for secretion. The next segment, of approximately 60 amino acids, contains three potential glycosylation sites. The carboxy-terminal half of the precursor contains four tandem copies of mature alpha-factor, each preceded by spacer peptides of six or eight amino acids (variations of Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala-Asp-Ala-Glu-Ala), which are hypothesized to contain proteolytic processing signals."
https://openalex.org/W2151585536,"Temperature-sensitive secretory mutants (sec) of S. cerevisiae have been used to evaluate the organelles and cellular functions involved in transport of the vacuolar glycoprotein, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY). Others have shown that CPY (61 kd) is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme (69 kd) that is matured by cleavage of an 8 kd amino-terminal propeptide. sec mutants that are blocked in either of two early stages in the secretory process and accumulate endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi bodies also accumulate precursor forms of CPY when cells are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (37°C). These forms are converted to a proper size when cells are returned to a permissive temperature (25°C). Vacuoles isolated from sec mutant cells do not contain the proCPY produced at 37°C. These results suggest that vacuolar and secretory glycoproteins require the same cellular functions for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and from the Golgi body. The Golgi body represents a branch point in the pathway: from this organelle, vacuolar proenzymes are transported to the vacuole for proteolytic processing and secretory proteins are packaged into vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1969737118,"Precise frameshift and nonsense mutations were introduced into the region preceding the galactokinase gene (galK) of Escherichia coli. These mutations after the position at which upstream translation terminates relative to the galK translation initiation signal. Constructions were characterized that allow ribosomes to stop selectively before, within or downstream from the galK initiation signal. The effects of these mutations on galK expression were monitored. Galactokinase levels are highest when upstream translation terminates within the galK initiation region. In contrast, when translation stops either upstream or down stream from the galK start site, galK expression is drastically reduced. These results demonstrate that the galK gene is translationally coupled to the gene immediately preceding galK in the gal operon (that is, galT), and that the coupling effect depends primarily on the position at which upstream translation terminates relative to the galK start site. Possible mechanisms and implications of this translational coupling phenomenon are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585301053,"Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was crystallized from an equilibrium mixture containing predominantly NAD+ and p-bromobenzyl alcohol. X-ray diffractometer data to a resolution of 2.9 A were collected and used to compute electron density maps with phases calculated from the isomorphous enzyme . NADH . dimethyl sulfoxide complex, which has been refined to an R value of 25.6%. The electron density maps were readily interpreted in a graphics display system. Both subunits of the dimer bind coenzyme and alcohol in essentially the same manner; there is no evidence of asymmetry between subunits. The bromophenyl group is accommodated in a large hydrophobic pocket that has the side chain of Leu-116 rotated into a different position than in the complex with dimethyl sulfoxide. The alcohol oxygen is directly ligated to the catalytic zinc atom. The zinc is tetracoordinate and there is no room for a water molecule to make the zinc pentacoordinate. A hydrogen-bonded system formed with the hydroxyl groups of the alcohol, Ser-48 and nicotinamide ribose (2'), and the imidazole of His-51 may provide a proton relay system that links the buried alcohol to solvent. The insertion of the coenzyme's hydroxyl group into this system appears to install the catalytically active species. The observed structure has the pro-R hydrogen on C1 of the alcohol pointing away from C4 of the nicotinamide ring. This is probably a nonproductive complex that easily becomes productive by a rapid rotation of the alcohol to put the pro-R hydrogen within 3 A of C4 of the nicotinamide ring and in position for a direct transfer of hydrogen. A model of the productive complex readily explains the stereospecificity of hydride transfer observed for ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W1590947913,"Addition of insulin to Triton-solubilized extracts of human placental membranes selectively stimulates the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into an endogenous 95,000-dalton protein, which is identified as a component of the insulin receptor by immunoprecipitation. The insulin-stimulated increment in 32P is recovered largely in [32P]tyrosine after acid hydrolysis. E Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates the phosphorylation of a 150,000-dalton protein in these detergent extracts. This reaction differs in several respects from the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the 95,000-dalton protein. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation exhibits an absolute requirement for Mn2+ as the sole divalent cation, whereas EGF-stimulated phosphorylation is supported by Mg2+ and Co2+ as well as Mn2+. In the presence of Mn2+, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation is not detected at less than 50 microM ATP, whereas EGF-stimulated phosphorylation is well expressed at 5 microM ATP. Thus, in detergent-solubilized membrane extracts, insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of its own receptor on tyrosine residues. This reaction has enzymatic properties distinct from those of the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation in these same extracts. The role of this insulin-stimulated phosphorylation reaction in the initiation of insulin's many biologic actions merits further study."

https://openalex.org/W1517989168,"Import of in vitro-synthesized cytochrome b2 (a soluble intermembrane space enzyme) was studied wih isolated yeast mitochondria. Import requires an electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane and is accompanied by cleavage of the precursor to the corresponding mature form. This conversion proceeds via an intermediate form of cytochrome b2, which can be detected as a transient species when mitochondria are incubated with the cytochrome b2 precursor for short times or at low temperatures. Conversion of the precursor to the intermediate form is energy-dependent and catalyzed by an o-phenanthroline-sensitive protease located in the soluble matrix. The intermediate is subsequently converted to mature cytochrome b2 in a reaction which is o-phenanthroline-insensitive and requires neither an energized inner membrane nor a soluble component of the intermembrane space. Whereas mature cytochrome b2 is soluble, the intermediate formed by isolated mitochondria is membrane-bound and exposed to the intermembrane space. The same intermediate is detected as a transient species during cytochrome b2 maturation in intact yeast cells (Reid, G. A., Yonetani, T., and Schatz, G (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13068-13074). The in vitro studies reported here suggest that a part of the cytochrome b2 precursor polypeptide chain is transported to the matrix where it is cleaved to a membrane-bound intermediate form by the same protease that processes polypeptides destined for the matrix space or for the inner membrane. In a second reaction, the cytochrome b2 intermediate is converted to mature cytochrome b2 which is released into the intermembrane space. The binding of heme is not necessary for converting the intermediate to the mature polypeptide."

In this system the catalytic activity of one of the enzymes studied (peroxidase) became much higher than in water, and the specificity of the other enzyme (alcohol dehydrogenase) was dramatically altered."
https://openalex.org/W2022838319,"Transfer RNA's are probably very strongly selected for translational efficiency. In this article, the argument is presented that the coding performance of the triplet anticodon is enhanced by selection of a matching anticodon loop and stem sequence. The anticodon plus these nearby sequence features (the extended anticodon) therefore contains more coding information than the anticodon alone and can perform more efficiently and accurately at the ribosome. This idea successfully accounts for the relative efficiencies of many transfer RNA's."
https://openalex.org/W2158182001,"Alleles of the var1 locus on yeast mitochondrial DNA specify the size of var1 ribosomal protein. We report the nucleotide sequence of a var1 allele that determines the smallest var1 protein. It contains an open reading frame of 396 codons, which we identify as the structural gene for var1 protein. The var1 protein specified by this allele has an amino acid composition in close agreement with that predicted by the DNA sequence. The var1 coding region is highly unusual: it is 89.6% AT and contains a 46 bp GC-rich palindromic cluster that accounts for 38% of the total GC residues. Our results strongly suggest that like mammalian mitochondria but unlike those from Neurospora, yeast mitochondria use AUA as a methionine codon. Comparison with the sequence of a var1 allele specifying a larger protein suggests that some size polymorphism of var1 protein results from in-frame insertions of a variable number of AAT (Asn) codons."

https://openalex.org/W1611254900,"Synthesis of the N-linked oligosaccharides of Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycoproteins has been studied in vivo by labeling with [2-3H]mannose and gel filtration analysis of the products released by endoglycosidase H. Both small oligosaccharides, Man8-14GlcNAc, and larger products, Man greater than 20GlcNAc, were labeled. The kinetics of continuous and pulse-chase labeling demonstrated that Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the initial product transferred to protein, was rapidly (t1/2 congruent to 3 min) trimmed to Man8GlcNAc2 and then more slowly (t1/2 = 10-20 min) elongated to larger oligosaccharides. No oligosaccharides smaller than Man8GlcNAc2 were evident with either labeling procedure. In confirmation of the trimming reaction observed in vivo, 3H-labeled Man9-N-acetylglucosaminitol from bovine thyroglobulin and [14C]Man9GlcNAc2 from yeast oligosaccharide-lipid were converted in vitro by broken yeast cells to 3H-labeled Man8-N-acetylglucosaminitol and [14C]Man8GlcNAc2. Man8GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc from yeast invertase and from bovine thyroglobulin were purified by gel filtration and examined by high field 1H-NMR analysis. Invertase Man8GlcNAc (B) and Man9GlcNAc (C) were homogeneous compounds, which differed from the Man9GlcNAc (A) of thyroglobulin by the absence of a specific terminal alpha 1,2-linked mannose residue. The Man9GlcNAc of invertase (C) had an additional terminal alpha 1,6-linked mannose and appeared identical in structure with that isolated from yeast containing the mnn1 and mnn2 mutations (Cohen, R. E., Zhang, W.-j., and Ballou, C. E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5730-5737). It is concluded that Man8GlcNAc2, formed by removal of glucose and a single mannose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, is the ultimate product of trimming and the minimal precursor for elongation of the oligosaccharides on yeast glycoproteins. The results suggest that removal of a particular terminal alpha 1,2-linked mannose from Man9GlcNAc2 by a highly specific alpha-mannosidase exposes the nascent Man-alpha 1,6-Man backbone for elongation with additional alpha 1,6-linked mannose residues, according to the following scheme: (formula, see text)."

Further, the methyltransferase activity is strikingly resistant to heat inactivation under reducing conditions. The protein has Mr = 18,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius of the native enzyme yield Mr = 18,400.

https://openalex.org/W2129824616,"Secretion of β-lactamase was studied in Salmonella typhimurium infected with P22 phage carrying wild-type and mutant alleles of the structural gene. Cellular location of precursor and mature products of wild-type and temperature-sensitive and chain-terminating mutants was analyzed by cell fractionation and by trypsin accessibility in intact and lysed spheroplasts. The precursors of wild-type and all these mutants (none of which alter the signal peptide) are found sequestered within the cell, while all the mature forms have at least partially been translocated across the inner membrane. Thus most β-lactamase molecules traverse the membrane after completion of their translation. It seems that the carboxyl terminus of β-lactamase is not required for translocation across the inner membrane but is required for the protein to appear in the periplasm as a soluble species."

https://openalex.org/W1991163749,"The bacteriophage P22 promoter for the antirepressor (ant) gene, Pant, in the absence of Arc repressor, directs the synthesis of extremely high levels of antirepressor. Overproduction of antirepressor leads secondarily to the failure to produce progeny phage upon lytic infection. A substantial fraction of revertants of P22 arc-amber phage are pseudorevertants that have acquired additional mutations that decrease the activity of the ant promoter. DNA sequence analysis of 72 independent Pant “promoter-down” mutations reveals more than 25 different alterations that define two regions critical for promoter activity. With few exceptions, these promoter-down mutations decrease the homology of Pant with the consensus promoter sequence, demonstrating that the conserved features among a large number of different wild-type promoters are the determinants of promoter strength. In general, different substitution mutations at the same site within the promoter have similar effects, resulting in either a severe or a mild reduction in promoter activity."

https://openalex.org/W1966578724,"We have sequenced the mutational changes in eight mutants in the open reading frame of intron 4 of the cob gene on yeast mitochondrial DNA. Three have a cis-acting splicing defect, while the others inactivate a trans-recessive intron domain that specifies a trans-acting splicing factor. From phenotypic evidence, including analyses of the allele-specific extra proteins, we have identified a protein (P27) encoded wholly within the intron that appears to be the intron 4 splicing factor (maturase). The evidence suggests that P27 is a secondary translation product resulting from the proteolytic cleavage of a larger precursor encoded by exon and intron sequences, but an alternative model, in which P27 is a primary translation product, has not been ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1539631646,"Cyc- S49 mouse lymphoma cell membranes contain an adenylyl cyclase system which is deficient in the regulatory properties characteristic of a stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Ns), such as enhancement of activity in the presence of GTP, GTP analogues, and NaF. Detailed kinetic analysis of cycl- adenylyl cyclase showed, however, that it is not unresponsive to these agents, for their addition to assays elicited inhibitory effects. Inhibition of cyc- activity was seen in 11 different membrane preparations obtained from two different strains and was observable both in the absence and presence of the strongly stimulatory diterpene forskolin. The GTP analogues GTP gamma S and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate caused a maximum of 60% inhibition with IC50 values of 2 and 12 nM, respectively. GTP itself was less potent than its analogues, with an IC50 of 100 mM, and elicited less inhibition as well (a maximum of 25%). Cholera toxin treatment of cyc- S49 cell membranes, under conditions which appeared to maximally activate the adenylyl cyclase system of wild type S49 cell membranes, had no effect on inhibition of catalytic activity. Our results indicate the presence in cyc- S49 cell membranes of a guanine nucleotide-binding component which is inhibitory to adenylyl cyclase activity (Ni). This suggests (a) that these membranes cannot be considered as completely deficient of adenylyl cyclase guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory components, and (b) that these membranes offer a unique opportunity to study Ni-mediated effects of guanine nucleotides and fluoride in the functional absence of Ns-mediated effects of these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1567485884,"The phosphorylation of Enzyme I is the first step in the phosphotransfer reaction sequence catalyzed by the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) from Salmonella typhimurium. The characterization of phospho approximately Enzyme I and the reactions in which it participates are described in this report. About 1 mol of phosphoryl group was incorporated per mol of Enzyme I monomer when the homogeneous enzyme was incubated with [32]phosphoenolpyruvate and Mg2+. The phosphoryl group in phospho approximately Enzyme I is linked at the N-3 position in the imidazole ring of a histidine residue. Phospho approximately Enzyme I donates its phosphoryl group to pyruvate (to form phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate)) and to the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system (HPr) (to form phospho approximately HPr). In the presence of HPr and appropriate sugar-specific proteins, the phosphoryl group can be transferred from Enzyme I to methyl alpha-glucoside (to form sugar-phosphate). The phosphorylation of Enzyme I by phosphoenolpyruvate requires divalent cation, but the phosphoryl group is transferred from phospho approximately Enzyme I to HPr in the presence of 20 mM EDTA. Kinetic studies show a biphasic rate for Enzyme I phosphorylation, suggesting that the enzyme is phosphorylated in the associated state. Equilibrium experiments were conducted on the following Reactions A and C. (formula: see text). The apparent K' for Reaction B was calculated from K'A and K'C. K'C was found to be about 11. K'A was studied both at very low and high substrate (P-enolpyruvate and pyruvate) concentrations relative to their respective Km values. At low substrate concentrations, the reaction appeared independent of pH in the range of 6.5 to 8.0, and when analyzed according to the simplest expression that could be written for total species of each component (Reaction A), the apparent average K' was 1.5. At high substrate concentrations, about 50% of the Enzyme I was phosphorylated, and this value changed only slightly with large changes in the P-enolpyruvate to pyruvate ratio. Expressions for K'A are derived which partially explain these results by including enzyme-substrate complexes in the equilibrium expression. The K' values were used to derive apparent standard free energy changes for the hydrolysis of the phosphoproteins of the PTS. Since these are similar to those for the hydrolysis of P-enolpyruvate, the phosphate transfer potentials of the PTS phosphoproteins are among the highest of known biological phosphate derivatives. In addition, unlike the reactions which occur during anaerobic glycolysis and electron transport, the high phosphate transfer potential is conserved in the PTS reaction sequence until the last step, the translocation of the sugar substrate across the membrane concomitant with its phosphorylation. Potential regulation of the PTS, in particular the effect of the intracellular ratio of P-enolpyruvate to pyruvate, is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1493498138,"In order to assess the role of different polysomal populations in mitochondrial protein import, yeast spheroplasts were treated with cycloheximide to prevent polysome run-off and fractionated into free polysomes, polysomes bound to the mitochondrial outer surface, and polysomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. These polysomes were analyzed for translatable mRNAs coding for 8 cytosolic and 12 imported mitochondrial proteins. The mitochondrial proteins included 7 proteins of the inner membrane, 2 proteins of the matrix, 2 proteins of the intermembrane space, and 1 protein of the outer membrane. Of the mRNAs for imported mitochondrial proteins, 8 were enriched in mitochondria-bound polysomes, 3 were enriched in free polysomes, and 1 was enriched in neither. All mRNAs for cytosolic proteins were enriched in free polysomes. Polysomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum lacked significant levels of translatable mRNAs for either cytosolic or mitochondrial proteins. Even though mRNAs for imported mitochondrial proteins were enriched in mitochondria-bound polysomes, these polysomes represented only 12-18% of the total cytoplasmic polysomes. As a consequence, none of the translatable mRNAs for imported mitochondrial proteins tested was predominantly associated with mitochondria-bound polysomes. While mitochondria-bound polysomes may contribute to mitochondrial protein import, they do not appear to be obligatory for this process."

The molecular, catalytic, and immunological properties of the testicular enzyme are presented and compared with the corresponding properties of pulmonary angiotensin-converting enzyme. Although catalytically similar and immunologically related to pulmonary dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, the testicular enzyme has a molecular weight (100,000) which is lower by a factor of about one-third and differs in its NH2 and COOH termini. Furthermore, we present evidence that the testicular enzyme is not a post-translation product of the pulmonary type enzyme. These data suggest that testicular and pulmonary dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase are two distinct proteins which are catalytically similar and immunologically closely related."
https://openalex.org/W1494524731,"Abstract The phosphocarrier protein, IIIGlc, of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) was purified to homogeneity by two methods. The first method utilized ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and required several weeks for completion. The second method utilized and antibody affinity column plus two additional steps and could be completed in a few days. By both procedures, two forms of IIIGlc were isolated, which were called IIIGlc Slow and IIIGlc Fast on the basis of their relative mobilities in polyacrylamide gels. IIIGlc Fast is derived from IIIGlc Slow by cleavage of the seven NH2-terminal amino acids from the latter protein. Both IIIGlc Slow and IIIGlc Fast have Mr approximately 20,000; neither protein contains cysteine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. IIIGlc Slow is very stable to heat; only 50% of its sugar phosphorylating activity is lost after 1 h at 100 degrees C. The phosphoryl group in IIIGlc Slow appears to be linked to a histidinyl residue. Direct transfer of the phosphoryl group from HPr (the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS) to IIIGlc slow was demonstrated as well as the reverse reaction. In addition, phospho-IIIGlc Slow served as a phosphoryl donor to methyl alpha-glucoside (or glucose) in the absence of all other PTS components except the partially purified integral membrane protein specific for this sugar, II-BGlc. The loss of the seven amino acids from IIIGlc Slow (giving IIIGlc Fast) leads to a marked alteration in the kinetic properties of the protein in the phosphotransferase system. IIIGlc Slow accepts 1 mol of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate via Enzyme I and HPr (the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein) and participates in the phosphorylation of glucose or methyl alpha-D-glucoside. IIIGlc Fast also accepts 1 mol of phosphate, but phospho-IIIGlc Fast is only 2-3% as active as phospho-IIIGlc Slow in the phosphorylation of sugar. IIIGlc Fast is found only in trace quantities in living cells, and may play a role in the regulation of non-PTS sugar transport systems."

This binding requires a 460 bp stretch of origin DNA between positions −40 and 420 of the oriC map. Specific binding can be detected by the use of a membrane filter retention assay in the presence of excess calf thymus DNA. This binding is enhanced by divalent cations and takes place specifically at a few (0.7-3.0) membrane sites per cell.

https://openalex.org/W1502661253,"Excess recA protein, a protein essential to general genetic recombination in Escherichia coli, promotes a sequence of formation and dissociation of D-loops from negative superhelical closed circular double-stranded DNA (form I DNA) and homologous single-stranded fragments in the presence of excess ATP, resulting in inactivation of the form I DNA without apparent damage to the DNA. The dissociation of D-loops is accompanied by hydrolysis of ATP to ADP that apparently depends on homologous DNA molecules (homology-dependent ATP hydrolysis). However, at a lower concentrations of ATP, we observed anomalous kinetics in the formation and dissociation of D-loops; as the concentration of ATP was decreased, there was a progressively smaller dissociation of D-loops and a faster resynthesis in the second phase, without changing the rate of the first formation of D-loops. This anomaly might suggest that, as the increase in the amount of ADP relative to that of ATP, dissociation form I DNA is stimulated before formation of D-loops is inhibited. We found that addition of ADP inhibited competitively both formation and dissociation of D-loops and that the latter process was more sensitive to the inhibition than was the former process. Addition of a sufficient amount of ADP to inhibit both formation and dissociation of D-loops, cessation of homology-dependent hydrolysis of ATP, or incubation at low temperature resulted in reactivation of form I DNA that had been inactivated by the sequence. In the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, we confirmed our previous result that limiting the amount of recA protein also causes anomalous kinetics in the formation and dissociation of D-loops. These observations indicate that the formation and dissociation of D-loops and the inactivation and reactivation of form I DNA make a circular reaction sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2104447498,"A preparation of bacteriophage T4-induced deoxyribonucleotide synthetase complex is described. This very large complex of enzymes can be separated by centrifugation at 100,000 X g, by sucrose step gradient centrifugation, or with molecular exclusion columns. By direct assay and by unidimensional and two-dimensional acrylamide electrophoretic separations the following T4-coded enzymes were shown to be associated with the complex: ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, dCMP deaminase, dCTP/dUTPase, dCMP hydroxymethylase, dTMP synthetase, and DNA polymerase. Other phage-coded prereplicative proteins related to DNA replication and other phage functions such as the proteins coded by genes 32, 46, rIIA, and rIIB as well as many unidentified proteins were also consistently associated with the isolated fractions. T4 DNA topoisomerase, a membrane-bound enzyme, was found in quantity in all purified fractions of the complex, even in preparations apparently free of membrane and of T4 DNA. The functional integrity of a segment of the complex was followed by measuring the conversion of [5-3H]CDP to the level of 5-hydroxymethyl dCMP. This series of reactions requires the actions of T4-coded ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase and its associated reducing system, dCTP/dUTPase and dCMP hydroxymethylase, 3H being lost to water at the last step. In this reaction sequence an intermediate, [5-3H]dCMP, is maintained at low steady state concentrations, and argument is presented that the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides is channeled and normally tightly coupled to DNA replication. One of the primary characteristics of this complex is its ready dissociation of dilution into smaller complexes of proteins and to the free forms of the proteins. That the complex is held together by weak electrostatic forces was supported by its sensitivity to dissociation at moderate salt concentrations. Not only the enzymes required in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis but T4 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA topoisomerase, and a number of other proteins dissociate to varying degrees from the larger complexes under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1561268569,"Effects of temperature on glucose transport in fat cells were studied. In this system, the basal (no insulin) glucose transport activity was higher at approximately 25-30 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, as previously reported (Vega, F. V., and Kono, T. (1979) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 192, 120-127). The stimulatory effect of low temperature (or the insulin-like effect) was reversible and apparently required metabolic energy for both its forward and reverse reactions. By lowering the ATP level with 2,4-dinitrophenol, one could separately determine the insulin-like stimulatory effect of low temperature and its inhibitory effect on the transport process itself. The maximum level of stimulation by low temperature was greater at 10 degrees C than at 25-30 degrees C, but the rate of stimulation was considerably slower at 10 degrees C than at 25-30 degrees C. When cells were exposed to low temperature, the glucose transport activity in the plasma membrane-rich fraction was increased, while that in the Golgi-rich fraction was decreased. The Arrhenius plot of the basal glucose transport activity determined in the presence of dinitrophenol was apparently linear from 10 to 37 degrees C and parallel to that of the plus insulin activity measured either in the presence or absence of dinitrophenyl. Insulin itself slowly stimulated the glucose transport activity at 10 degrees C. These results are consistent with the view that (a) low temperature, like insulin, induces translocation of the glucose transport activity from an intracellular storage site to the plasma membrane, (b) insulin stimulates glucose transport activity without changing its activation energy, and (c) subcellular membranes do not entirely stop their movement at a low temperature, e.g, at 10 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W2103010047,"We have fused DNA fragments derived from an Escherichia coli tRNALeu1 operon to the galK gene of E. coli to identify sequences necessary for the in vivo initiation of transcription and growth-rate-dependent regulation. Promoter sequences consisting of residues from -50 to +56 or -50 to +5 with respect to the in vivo site for initiation of transcription were introduced into chimeric plasmids upstream from the galK gene. Cells bearing these chimeric plasmids exhibited much higher levels of galactokinase than did cells bearing plasmids wherein the galactose promoter was fused to galK. This indicates that the tRNALeu1 promoter is substantially more efficient than the gal promoter. The tRNALeu1 promoter-galK chimeras exhibited marked growth-dependent regulation in a manner consistent with that reported for tRNA regulation. Since tRNALeu1 DNA spanning residues -50 to +5 was sufficient to provide growth rate regulation of galK, an inverted repeat centered at position +17 is not, under the conditions we used, required for this type of regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1565453664,"A composite rate assay has been applied to investigate the rate and mechanism of formation of open promoter complexes. Seven DNA templates were studied which were related to the lac ps promoter by single base pair changes in the -10 or -35 region of promoter sequence homology. These small changes induce a nearly 3 order of magnitude variation in the rate of open complex formation. This variation persists over a wide range of concentrations of RNA polymerase. Nevertheless, all promoters direct open complex formation which proceeds through a closed or A polymerase:DNA complex which dissociates readily. These data, when taken together with our previous results on the lac spacer mutations, demonstrate that mutation of the lac ps promoter leads to changes in the rate of open complex formation predicted by the following rule. Changes which substitute a less conserved element of sequence in the -10 and -35 regions, or of length in the spacer, always decrease the rate in this homologous series of promoters."
https://openalex.org/W203273233,"Tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex containing [4'-3H]pyridoxal phosphate was reduced with sodium borohydride in the presence of various substrates and analogs in an attempt to trap reaction intermediates. Reduction in the presence of L-serine gave noncovalently bound radioactive material which was identified as phosphopyridoxylalanine, presumably resulting from reduction of the intermediate Schiff's base formed between pyridoxal phosphate and alpha-aminoacrylate. The tritium in this compound was located in the pro-R position at C-4', indicating that reduction of the Schiff's base double bond had occurred on the Si face at C-4'. On the other hand, analysis of phosphopyridoxyllysine obtained by hydrolysis of the reduced [3H]pyridoxal-P-alpha 2 beta 2 protein showed that the internal Schiff's base had been reduced on the C-4' Re face, suggesting a cofactor reorientation upon substrate binding. Analysis of phosphopyridoxylalanine from a reduction of unlabeled alpha 2 beta 2 complex in the presence of (2S,3R)-[2,3-2H2]serine with tritiated sodium borohydride demonstrated the presence of tritium at C-4' (50%), C-2 (20%), and C-3 (30%). According to the configuration at C-3, reduction of the phosphopyridoxal-alpha-aminoacrylate Schiff's base has occurred from the same side of the molecule at C-4' and C-3."
https://openalex.org/W1588147834,"The locations of the periplasmic proteins of Escherichia coli on standard two-dimensional gel patterns are described. The periplasmic fractions were prepared by osmotic shock of plasmolyzed whole cells and by release during EDTA-lysozyme treatment of whole cells. Within this fraction of proteins, we identify nine binding proteins (leucine-specific, glutamate-aspartate, glutamine, cystine, galactose, maltose, xylose, ribose, and arabinose) in addition to leucine-isoleucine-valine binding protein, which has been previously identified (Bloch, P. L., Phillips, T. A., and Neidhardt, F. C. (1980) J. Bacteriol. 141, 1409-1420). The identifications are based upon genetic criteria, protein induction, and comigration with purified protein. The levels of these proteins are compared in strains K12, B, and HA12 (a derivative of W). A technique was developed for renaturation of the ligand binding sites of periplasmic binding proteins in denaturing two-dimensional gels. This technique was used to demonstrate that leucine-specific and cystine binding proteins both have different isoelectric points in different strains. Renaturation was also used to demonstrate that there are two different charged forms for glutamine binding protein."

Although the sperm were not viable, they should be useful for addressing the question of haploid expression of genes linked to sex chromosomes and for efficiently searching for biochemical markers that differentiate the two populations."
https://openalex.org/W2132374708,"Studies were conducted on the physical properties of Enzyme I, the first protein in the Salmonella typhimurium phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system. Since values lower than those previously reported for the monomer molecular weight were obtained, experiments were performed to determine whether Enzyme I had been partially degraded during isolation of homogeneous protein. Crude extracts and partially purified and homogeneous protein preparations exhibited identical behavior in crossed immunoelectrophoresis analyses, indicating that the isolated protein represented native, intact Enzyme I. The monomeric subunit of Enzyme I is globular, with a frictional ratio of about 1. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments provided a monomer molecular weight of 57,700 +/- 3,400, and gel filtration studies under denaturing conditions gave a comparable value of 57,000. The values previously obtained from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate varied with the conditions used, but under one set of conditions agreed with those given above. The sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted at 8 degrees C, in the absence of substrates and cofactor (phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, Mg2+). Under these conditions Enzyme I self-associates, but the association is weak, favoring primarily monomer. Because of solubility limitations, the sedimentation experiments were performed with Enzyme I at an initial concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, providing a concentration distribution of 0.1 to 2 mg/ml. Computer analysis of the results showed that within this concentration range it was not possible to distinguish between two modes of self-association, monomer-dimer and isodesmic. The physiological significance of the results is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1585079305,"Regulation of Escherichia coli carbamyl phosphate synthetase by UMP and IMP was examined in studies with various analogs of these nucleotides. Whereas UMP inhibits enzyme activity, the arabinose analog of UMP was found to be an activator. dUMP neither activates nor inhibits, but binds to the enzyme in a manner similar to UMP as evaluated by direct binding studies, sedimentation behavior, and ultraviolet difference spectral measurements. dUMP decreases inhibition by UMP and activation by IMP, but has no effect on activation by L-ornithine. The findings are in accord with the view that IMP and UMP bind to the same region of the enzyme; a possible general model for such overlapping binding sites is considered. Additional evidence is presented that inorganic phosphate can modulate regulation of the activity by nucleotides. Phosphate (and arsenate) markedly increase inhibition by UMP, decrease activation by IMP, but do not affect activation by L-ornithine. The extent of activation by IMP and by L-ornithine and that of inhibition by UMP are decreased when Mg2+ concentrations are increased relative to a fixed concentration of ATP. The findings suggest that the allosteric effectors may affect affinity of the enzyme for divalent metal ions as well as, as previously shown, the affinity of the enzyme for Mg-ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1523629614,"We have used photoaffinity labeling of pBR322 DNA with 8-azido-3-amino-5-ethyl-6-phenylphenanthridinium chloride to demonstrate high affinity ethidium-binding sites. Plasmid equilibrated with as little as 1 drug/DNA molecule was photoactivated, freed of uncomplexed drug by ethanol precipitation, and subjected to restriction analysis. There was highly specific, rather than random, blockage of HhaI sites (d(GCGC)) at low drug concentrations. Furthermore, the same 7 new digestion fragments were generated at drug to nucleotide ratios ranging from 1:100 to 1:8000. All the new DNA fragments had chain lengths greater than the largest HhaI fragment (393 base pairs). At higher ligand concentrations closely approximating those needed for equilibrium binding studies, detection of the high affinity sites was greatly masked. Drug binding to HhaI restriction fragments which had been prepared prior to the action of drug did not induce new bands. Furthermore, the larger DNA fragments from drug-labeled plasmid were resistant to HhaI digestion over a wide range of enzyme concentrations. These findings suggest that ligand binding can be highly selective even between sites which have the same tetranucleotide sequence. Therefore, selective drug binding must be dictated not only by local base sequence preference, but also by other long range parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1604058669,"A calorimetric study has been made of the interaction between the lac repressor and isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The buffer-corrected enthalpy of reaction at 25 degrees C was found to be -15.6, -24.7, -4.6 kJ/mol of bound IPTG at pH 7.0, pH 8.1, and pH 9.0, respectively. This large range of enthalpy values is in contrast to a maximum difference in the free energy of the reaction of only 1.5 kJ/mol of bound IPTG between these pH values. The reaction was found by calorimetric measurements in different buffers to be accompanied by an uptake of 0.29 mol of protons/mol of bound IPTG at pH 8.1. The pH dependency of the reaction enthalpy suggests differences in the extent of protonation of the binding site and the involvement of H bonding with IPTG. The lack of strong hydrophobic contributions in the IPTG binding process is revealed by the absence of any determinable heat capacity change for the reaction at pH 7.0. The presence of phosphate buffer significantly alters the enthalpy of IPTG binding at higher pH values, but has little effect upon the binding constant. This implies that highly negative phosphate species change the nature of the IPTG binding site without any displacement of phosphate upon IPTG binding."

https://openalex.org/W1480625242,"Submaxillaris protease, reportedly specific for arginine residues, was used to probe accessible arginines of chicken erythrocyte nucleosome cores. The relative rates of digestion of histones in nucleosome cores by this protease were H3 greater than H2b greater than H4 much greater than H2a. At most, 8 of 52 total arginines among the four core histones were reasonably accessible to attack. Sites most rapidly cleaved were Arg-26 in H3, a site approximately 13 residues from the NH2 terminus of H2b, and Lys-12 or Arg-17 in H4. Five sites attacked more slowly were Arg-8, -128, or -129 and Arg-49, -52, or -53 in H3; Arg-3 and Arg-17 or -19 in H4; and a site near one terminus of H2b or H3. H2a and fragments resulting from the above cleavages were highly resistant to attack, even after prolonged incubation. Similar results were obtained upon digestion of histones in intact chromatin. H1 and H5 in whole chromatin were attacked at rates comparable to H3. Seven of the eight accessible sites lie outside of structure-forming histone sequences, i.e. sequences that are immobilized in histone complexes, indicating that these sequences are inaccessible in nucleosome cores. The single exceptional site noted, approximately 50 residues from the NH2 terminus of H3, is consistent with previous observations that Glu-51 and Glu-60 of H3 in nucleosomes are accessible to attack by S. aureus protease (Rill, R. L., and Oosterhof, D. K. (1981). J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12687-12691). The relationships of these protease accessibilities to NMR assignments of mobile histone tails in nucleosome cores are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1491409845,"HPr is a low molecular weight, phosphocarrier protein of the Salmonella typhimurium phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS). This protein was alkylated with the fluorescent reagent (N-iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamino-1-sulfonate under conditions which favor alkylation of the thioether linkage in methionine residues (Link, T. P. and Stark, G. R. (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 1082-1088) to give the corresponding sulfonium derivatives. The isolated fluorescent protein (95-100% pure) was as active as native HPr both as a phosphoryl acceptor protein (phosphoenolpyruvate and Enzyme I of the PTS), and as a phosphocarrier protein in the phosphorylation of methyl alpha-glucoside by the complete PTS. The fluorescent label was shown to be predominantly, possibly exclusively, at the NH2-terminal methionine residue. The decay of the fluorescence intensity could be described in terms of a biexponential function with the time constants tau 1 approximately 7 ns, tau 2 approximately 15 ns, and a ratio of alpha 2/alpha 1 approximately 3 for the pre-exponential factors. The decay of the fluorescence emission anisotropy was found to be consistent with some internal motion of the probe, in addition to the rotation of the protein conjugate as a whole."
