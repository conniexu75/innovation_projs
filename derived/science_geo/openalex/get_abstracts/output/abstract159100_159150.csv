https://openalex.org/W2041159500,"Adaptive immune responses begin after antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) traffic from peripheral tissues to lymph nodes. Here, we show that DC migration from skin to lymph nodes utilizes the leukotriene C4 (LTC4) transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). DC mobilization from the epidermis and trafficking into lymphatic vessels was greatly reduced in MRP1−/− mice, but migration was restored by exogenous cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4 or LTD4. In vitro, these cysteinyl leukotrienes promoted optimal chemotaxis to the chemokine CCL19, but not to other related chemokines. Antagonism of CCL19 in vivo prevented DC migration out of the epidermis. Thus, MRP-1 regulates DC migration to lymph nodes, apparently by transporting LTC4, which in turn promotes chemotaxis to CCL19 and mobilization of DCs from the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W1982573383,"Cryptochrome blue light photoreceptors share sequence similarity to photolyases, flavoproteins that mediate light-dependent DNA repair. However, cryptochromes lack photolyase activity and are characterized by distinguishing C-terminal domains. Here we show that the signaling mechanism of Arabidopsis cryptochrome is mediated through the C terminus. On fusion with beta-glucuronidase (GUS), both the Arabidopsis CRY1 C-terminal domain (CCT1) and the CRY2 C-terminal domain (CCT2) mediate a constitutive light response. This constitutive photomorphogenic (COP) phenotype was not observed for mutants of cct1 corresponding to previously described cry1 alleles. We propose that the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis cryptochrome is maintained in an inactive state in the dark. Irradiation with blue light relieves this repression, presumably through an intra- or intermolecular redox reaction mediated through the flavin bound to the N-terminal photolyase-like domain."
https://openalex.org/W1983424467,"Interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells are responsible for organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. This mutual cross-talk involves cell surface proteins and soluble factors, which are mostly the result of regulated transcription. To elucidate dimer-specific functions of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, we reconstituted skin by combining primary human keratinocytes and mouse wild-type, c-jun(-/-), and junB(-/-) fibroblasts. We have discovered an antagonistic function of these AP-1 subunits in the fibroblast-mediated paracrine control of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and traced this effect to the IL-1-dependent regulation of KGF and GM-CSF. These data suggest that the relative activation state of these AP-1 subunits in a non-cell-autonomous, transregulatory fashion directs regeneration of the epidermis and maintenance of tissue homeostasis in skin."
https://openalex.org/W2045882503,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is an enzyme with proteolytic activity against matrix and nonmatrix proteins, particularly basement membrane constituents. Thus, any naturally occurring genetic variants that directly affect gene expression and/or protein function would be expected to impact on progression of pathological processes involving tissue remodeling. We scanned a 2-kilobase pair promoter region and all 13 exons of the humanMMP-2 gene, from a panel of 32 individuals, and we identified the position, nature, and relative allele frequencies of 15 variant loci as follows: 6 in the promoter, 1 in the 5′-untranslated region, 6 in the coding region, 1 in intronic sequence, and 1 in the 3′-untranslated region. The majority of coding region polymorphisms resulted in synonymous substitutions, whereas three promoter variants (at −1306, −790, and +220) mapped onto cis-acting elements. We functionally characterized all promoter variants by transient transfection experiments with 293, RAW264.7, and A10 cells. The common C → T transition at −1306 (allele frequency 0.26), which disrupts an Sp1-type promoter site (CCACC box), displayed a strikingly lower promoter activity with the T allele. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed that these differences in allelic expression were attributable to abolition of Sp1 binding. These data suggest that this common functional genetic variant influencesMMP-2 gene transcription in an allele-specific manner and is therefore an important candidate to test for association in a wide spectrum of pathologies for which a role for MMP-2 is implicated, including atherogenesis and tumor invasion and metastasis.AJ298926 Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is an enzyme with proteolytic activity against matrix and nonmatrix proteins, particularly basement membrane constituents.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Currently upwards of 20 vertebrate MMPs have been reported that can be categorized, by substrate specificity, to give the collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type MMPs. The broad range of substrates conveys a pivotal role for MMP involvement during both normal physiological processes (e.g. embryonic development, bone remodeling, angiogenesis, nerve growth, etc.) and pathological states (e.g. arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, liver fibrosis, etc.) (2Woessner Jr., J.F. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Accordingly, MMP activity is tightly coordinated at several levels including transcriptional regulation, activation of latent zymogen, and interaction with endogenous inhibitors (3Birkedal Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). MMP-2 (gelatinase A) has type IV collagenolytic activity and is constitutively expressed by most connective tissue cells including endothelial cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and myoblasts. The membrane-bound activation of pro-MMP-2 ensures that proteolytic activity, predominantly against components of the basement membrane, is localized to discrete regions on the cell surface (4Strongin A.Y.

Indeed, the majority of MMP-2 studies have focused on demonstrating an essential role in promoting cell invasiveness during tumor angiogenesis, arthritis, and atherogenesis (11Fang J. Shing Y.

Pignatelli M. Stetler Stevenson W.G. Liotta L.A. Wright P.A. Jeffery R.E. Longcroft J.M. Rogers L. Stamp G.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar, 17Boag A.H. Young I.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 585-591PubMed Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the design of specific and selective inhibitors of MMP-2, for therapeutic intervention, remains an intense focus of research (18Sang Q.A. Jia M. Schwartz M.A. Jaye M.C. Kleinman H.K. Ghaffari M.A. Luo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The diseases in which a role for MMP-2 has been demonstrated are characterized by varying individual susceptibility, implying the role of genetic factors. Traditional linkage analysis methods for mapping the genes of Mendelian disorders have not been as successful in the studies of complex genetic diseases including coronary heart disease, cancers, and arthritic disorders. Attention has therefore focused on the rapid elucidation of a new class of genetic markers termed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These are the most common types of stable genetic variants estimated to occur, on average, every 1,000 bp and are therefore valuable markers in tests of association for susceptibility, or resistance, to common and genetically complex diseases (19Chakravarti A.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 492-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, the emergence of the common disease-common variant hypothesis (21Risch N. Merikangas K. Science. 1996; 273: 1516-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (4270) Google Scholar, 23Collins F.S. Guyer M.S. Charkravarti A. Science. 1997; 278: 1580-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) has provided important examples of such associations, including theAPOE-4 allele in Alzheimer's disease (24Martin E.R. Lai E.H. Gilbert J.R. Rogala A.R. Afshari A.J. Riley J. Finch K.L. Stevens J.F. Livak K.J. Slotterbeck B.D. Slifer S.H. Warren L.L. Conneally P.M. Schmechel D.E. Purvis I.

Ahuja S.S. Gonzalez E. Anderson S.A. Santiago E.N. Stephan K.T. Craig F.E. O'Connell P. Tryon V. Clark R.A. Dolan M.J. Ahuja S.K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, the power of association-based studies can be compromised by multiple hypothesis testing that is exacerbated by publication bias (26Altshuler D. Kruglyak L. Lander E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This problem can be overcome, in part, by distinguishing functional SNPs from neutral counterparts across a candidate region thereby generating a panel of robust, informative variants that are more likely to have an influence in disease progression. The specific predilection of MMP-2 for substrates important in basement membrane integrity makes it a strong candidate for a number of heritable traits including, for example, atherosclerosis (by allowing immigration of smooth muscle cells and by facilitating plaque rupture). Common variants that alter the amount of protein expressed, for instance by affecting transcriptional regulation, or that subtly alter the activity of the protein itself would be expected to have a quantitative influence on disease activity. We have therefore identified the nature and extent of genetic variation in the promoter (∼2 kb) and complete coding region of the human matrix metalloproteinase-2 gene. We describe the in vitrocharacterization of the entire panel of promoter polymorphisms, and we identify one particular functional variant that alters MMP-2promoter activity through allele-specific binding of the transcription factor Sp1. The Human Genome Walking kit (CLONTECH) was used to obtain additional MMP-2 5′-flanking sequence to that previously published (27Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A primer complementary to the sequence +51/+72 relative to the major transcription start site (28Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in combination with an adaptor primer in primary PCRs using five human genomic libraries as templates. A secondary PCR, using a nested MMP-2-specific primer (−13/+10 relative to the transcription start site), was performed, and products from the DraI, SspI, and ScaI libraries were gel-purified and cloned into pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene). Sequence extending 1900 bp upstream of the transcription start site was obtained by sequencing several independent clones on an ABI 377 automated sequencing apparatus with cycle sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Eleven overlapping PCR amplicons were designed to analyze the promoter sequence (1900 bp), whereas 25 PCR fragments were generated to scan the 5′-UTR, coding region, and 3′-UTR (see Table I). To address the extent of genetic variation at splice site junctions, scanning primers were designed based on sequence information obtained by amplifying between exons, using oligonucleotides based on the genomic organization (28Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used to scan the MMP-2 gene for sequence variation, using the WAVE™ DNA Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomic), as previously described (29Underhill P.A.

Optimal PCR conditions for faithful amplification were derived for each amplicon; reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 20 ng of genomic DNA, 50 mm potassium chloride, 25-pmol primers, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene). Genomic DNA was amplified from a panel of 32 unrelated healthy Caucasian subjects. PCR products (45 μl) were denatured at 95 °C for 4 min and allowed to reanneal to form homo- and heteroduplexes by cooling to 25 °C over a 50-min period. 10 μl of each PCR product was applied to the WAVETM machine using varying column temperatures (57–69 °C), as predetermined by the Transgenomic Analysis Software (according to the predicted melting characteristics of each amplicon). Individual PCR products, which displayed heteroduplex signaling patterns, were purified with QIAquick™ purification columns (Qiagen), and both strands were sequenced on an ABI 377. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning 3 concatenated copies of the adjacent 24 nucleotides, flanking a variant, upstream of a previously characterized minimal promoter region of the human translation initiation factor EIF-4AI gene (30Quinn C.M.

KpnI sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends of concatamers to facilitate cloning. The sequences of the forward oligonucleotides used for concatenation are shown with variant(s) in lowercase: −1575G, 5′-AAGACATAATCgTGACCTCCAATG-3′; −1575A, 5′-AAGACATAATCaTGACCTCCAATG-3′; −1306C, 5′-ACCCAGCACTCcACCTCTTTAGCT-3′; −1306T, 5′-ACCCAGCACTCtACCTCTTTAGCT-3′; −955C, 5′-TGCCATGGCATTTATAcACTGCCA-3′; −955A, 5′-TGCCATGGCATTTATAaACTGCCA-3′; −790T/−787T, 5′-GTGACCTCTATCtTAtTAAACCAG-3′; −790G/−787T, 5′-GTGACCTCTATCgTAtTAAACCAG-3′; −790T/−787G, 5′-GTGACCTCTATCtTAgTAAACCAG-3′; 790G/−787G, 5′-GTGACCTCTATCgTAgTAAACCAG-3′; −168G, 5′-AGGCGGCCGGGgAAAAGAGGTGGA-3′; −168T, 5′-AGGCGGCCGGGtAAAAGAGGTGGA-3′; +220G, 5′-ACCAGGCGGCGAgGCGGCCACACG-3′; and +220C, 5′-ACCAGGCGGCGAcGCGGCCACACG-3′. Additionally, a PCR-based approach was used to generate a construct encompassing −1691 to +10 of the human MMP-2 promoter. 5′-HindIII and 3′-XhoI cloning sites were included in the forward and reverse primers, respectively. To obtain the −1691/+10 DNA fragment, the oligonucleotide sequence −1691/−1671 (5′-GTCAAAGCTTA-AAACTGACTCTGGAAAGTCA-3′) and −11/+10 (5′-GTCACTCGAGTCTGGATGCAGCGGAAACAAG-3′) were used in the PCR in combination with PfuTurbo polymerase to ensure high fidelity amplification. The PCR product was digested with HindIII andXhoI and ligated into an appropriately digested pGL3-Basic vector. The resulting construct was designated as p1306T because sequence analysis demonstrated that it contains a thymine at the −1306 polymorphic site. Subsequently, p1306T acted as a template to generate a construct with a thymine to cytosine point mutation at the −1306 position, assigned p1306C, using the QuikChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs used in this study were restriction-mapped and sequenced to confirm their authenticity. The RAW264.7, A10, and 293 cell lines were obtained from the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology Cell Bank, and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (RAW264.7) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (A10 and 293) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For transient transfection experiments, 5 × 104 cells were plated in 10-mm 24-multiwell plates and grown to 60–70% confluence. Transfection was carried out using FuGENE™ 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of pcDNA3-β-galactosidase expression vector (30Quinn C.M. Wiles A.P. El Shanawany T. Catchpole I. Alnadaf T. Ford M.J. Gordon S. Greaves D.R. Genomics. 1999; 62: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to standardize for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated for 24 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). Luciferase levels were quantified using a Luminoskan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems), and β-galactosidase activities were measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All experiments were carried out in triplicate and independently performed at least three times. Results were expressed as a ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity, and statistical levels of significance, for comparison between transfections, were determined by the Student's t test. Mammalian expression vectors containing wild-type and mutant murine GATA-1 were a kind gift from Dr. Sjaak Philipsen (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (31Cowan P.J. Tsang D. Pedic C.M. Abbott L.R. Shinkel T.A. d'Apice A.J. Pearse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11737-11744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed using the following double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes: −1306C, 5′-ACCCAGCACTCCACCTCTTTAGCT-3′; −1306T, 5′-ACCCAGCACTCTACCTCTTTAGCT-3′; and Sp1cons, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. 0.25 ng of32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide (>30,000 cpm) was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 10 μg of nuclear extract in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 12.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 μg of sheared salmon sperm. For competition experiments, a 50–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either cold probe, an Sp1-mutant consensus site (5′-ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC-3′), or a nonspecific oligonucleotide (5′-GAGCGCATACTGACTATCGGAGAC-3′) was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of labeled probe. For supershift experiments, antibodies raised against Sp1 (sc-59X), AP-2 (sc-184X), RANTES (sc-1410), and control rabbit IgG were purchased, with Sp1-blocking peptide (sc-59P), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody (2 μg), or antibody-blocking peptide complex, was incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by an additional incubation for 20 min at room temperature with labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were run on a nondenaturing 7% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE, at 250 V for 2–3 h. Dried gels were exposed overnight to Kodak X-Omat film at −80 °C. To generate additional sequence data for variant analysis, an extended promoter region of the human MMP-2 gene was isolated. Nested MMP-2-specific primers were used with adaptor primers to amplify the promoter from five adaptor-ligated human genomic libraries. The DraI,SspI, and ScaI libraries yielded products of 1.7, 4.1, and 6.0 kb, respectively, that were cloned and analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping. The DNA sequence extending 1900 bp upstream of the major transcription start site (28Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was determined, and 11 overlapping amplicons were designed for DHPLC analysis. Additional intronic sequence was generated to that available (28Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by sequencing introns, isolated as PCR products, and the information obtained was used to design appropriate primers for DHPLC analysis to evaluate the extent of genetic variation at MMP-2 splice-site junctions. Thirty four different PCR primer pairs, encompassing the promoter sequence (1900 bp), 5′-UTR, complete coding region, and 3′-UTR, were designed to assess the nature and extent of nucleotide variation in the human MMP-2 gene (see TableI). Amplicons were generated from a panel of 32 unrelated healthy Caucasian individuals. This number was chosen to provide >90% power to detect polymorphisms with an allele frequency of >5% (21Risch N. Merikangas K. Science. 1996; 273: 1516-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (4270) Google Scholar), on the basis that common variants were the principal target of this screen. PCR products were applied to the DHPLC column and subjected to partial heat denaturation, over a 6.8-min interval, to produce sequence-specific chromatograms. Elution profiles were compared with each other, with double or multiple peak patterns indicating the presence of polymorphic site(s) (Fig.1). The nature and location of variants were determined by dye-terminator sequencing. By using this approach, a total of 15 novel sequence variants were identified in the MMP-2 gene. All variants were single base substitutions, comprising seven transversions and eight transitions distributed throughout the gene with six variants in the promoter, one in the 5′-UTR, six in the coding region, one in intervening sequence, and one in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 2). The majority of coding region variants (Fig.2 A) results in synonymous substitutions; however, the G → A transition at cDNA position 1646 causes a nonconservative amino acid change from glycine to serine (G456S). This amino acid is situated in the hinge region of the protein, which links the catalytic domain to the hemopexin-like domain, and is believed to be important in the targeting of substrates (32Imper V. Van Wart H.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 219-242Crossref Google Scholar). Clustal alignment revealed that Gly-456 is conserved across species (chicken, rabbit, rat, and mouse) demonstrating the importance of this small neutral residue and signifying the potential impact that a substitution to a larger hydrophilic amino acid may have upon enzymatic activity/substrate specificity. We are currently undertaking in vitro studies to address possible functional effects of this variant. We identified one intronic sequence variant in intron 5, located 11 bp downstream of the intron start site. This does not map to known splice-site junction consensus sequences and is therefore unlikely to affect mRNA splicing patterns. We also identified a common A → C transversion in the 3′-UTR of the gene (nt 2523). Sequence analysis established that this variant does not lie within, or in close proximity to, adenylate/uridylate-rich elements that are known to be bound by families of proteins implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability (33Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Six variants were identified in the promoter region (four transversions and two transitions) that were evenly distributed across a ∼2-kb interval with the exception of two T → G transversions at −790 and −787 (Fig. 2 B). Sequence analysis demonstrated an error in the published sequence (27Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with the AG dinucleotide reported at position −1569 actually being the G → A polymorphism at −1575 (allowing for the different transcription start sites mapped in these studies). To determine whether variants created or abolished potentialcis-acting elements, we used the TRANSFAC data base (34Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V.

https://openalex.org/W2140882620,"Mutations in the amnesiac gene in Drosophila affect both memory retention and ethanol sensitivity. The predicted amnesiac gene product, AMN, is an apparent preproneuropeptide, and previous studies suggest that it stimulates cAMP synthesis. Here we show that, unlike other learning-related Drosophila proteins, AMN is not preferentially expressed in mushroom bodies. Instead, it is strongly expressed in two large neurons that project over all the lobes of the mushroom bodies, a finding that suggests a modulatory role for AMN in memory formation. Genetically engineered blockade of vesicle recycling in these cells abbreviates memory as in the amnesiac mutant. Moreover, restoration of amn gene expression to these cells reestablishes normal olfactory memory in an amn deletion background. These results indicate that AMN neuropeptide release onto the mushroom bodies is critical for normal olfactory memory."
https://openalex.org/W2115744231,"While the activated viral Src oncoprotein, v-Src, induces uncontrolled cell growth, the mechanisms underlying cell cycle deregulation by v-Src have not been fully defined. Previous studies demonstrated that v-Src induces constitutively active STAT3 signaling that is required for cell transformation and recent data have implicated STAT3 in the transcriptional control of critical cell cycle regulators. Here we show in mouse fibroblasts stably transformed by v-Src that mRNA and protein levels of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), cyclin D1, and cyclin E are elevated. Using reporter constructs in transient-transfection assays, the cyclin D1 and p21 promoters were both found to be transcriptionaly induced by v-Src in a STAT3-dependent manner. The kinase activities of cyclin D/CDK4, 6 and cyclin E/CDK2 complexes were only slightly elevated, consistent with the findings that coordinate increases in p21, cyclin D1 and cyclin E resulted in an increase in cyclin/CDK/p21 complexes. Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 and BALB/c 3T3 cells stably transformed by v-Src, indicating that these regulatory events associated with STAT3 signaling represent common mechanisms independent of cell line or clonal variation. These findings suggest that STAT3 has an essential role in the regulation of critical cell cycle components in v-Src transformed mouse fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2319486658,"In this study we sought to clarify the role of the pro-apoptotic potential of mitochondria in the death pathway emanating from the TRAIL (APO-2L) and CD95 receptors in pancreatic carcinoma cells. We focused on the role of the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL, using three pancreatic carcinoma cell lines as a model system, two of which have high (Panc-1, PancTuI) and one has low (Colo357) Bcl-XL expression. In these cell lines, the expression of Bcl-XL correlated with sensitivity to apoptosis induced by TRAIL or anti-CD95. Flow cytometric analysis revealed cell surface expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 on PancTuI and Colo357, and TRAIL-R2 on Panc-1 cells. In Colo357 cells retrovirally transduced with Bcl-XL, caspase-8 activation in response to treatment with TRAIL or anti-CD95 antibody was not different from parental cells and EGFP-transfected controls, however, apoptosis was completely suppressed as measured by the mitochondrial transmembrane potential Δψm, caspase-3 activity (PARP cleavage) and DNA-fragmentation. Inhibition of Bcl-XL function by overexpression of Bax or administration of antisense oligonucleotides against Bcl-XL mRNA resulted in sensitization of Panc-1 cells to TRAIL and PancTuI cells to anti-CD95 antibody-induced cell death. The results show that Bcl-XL can protect pancreatic cancer cells from CD95- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus, in these epithelial tumour cells the mitochondrially mediated ‘type II’ pathway of apoptosis induction is not only operative regarding the CD95 system but also regarding the TRAIL system."
https://openalex.org/W2062509860,"NF-κB/Rel transcription factors regulate many genes involved in control of cellular proliferation, neoplastic transformation, and apoptosis, including the c-myc oncogene. Recently, we have observed that levels of NF-κB and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which mediates malignant transformation by environmental carcinogens, are highly elevated and appear constitutively active in breast cancer cells. Rel factors have been found to functionally interact with other transcription factors. Here we demonstrate a physical and functional association between the RelA subunit of NF-κB and AhR resulting in the activation of c-myc gene transcription in breast cancer cells. RelA and AhR proteins were co-immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of non-malignant MCF-10F breast epithelial and malignant Hs578T breast cancer cells. In transient co-transfection, RelA and AhR gene products demonstrated cooperation in transactivation of the c-myc promoter, which was dependent on the NF-κB elements, and in induction of endogenous c-Myc protein levels. A novel AhR/RelA-containing NF-κB element binding complex was identified by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of nuclear extracts from RelA and AhR co-transfected Hs578T cells. Thus, the RelA and AhR proteins functionally cooperate to bind to NF-κB elements and induce c-myc gene expression. These findings suggest a novel signaling mechanism whereby the Ah receptor can stimulate proliferation and tumorigenesis of mammary cells."

In this study, we determined the 2.9 A crystal structure of a complex of Thermus thermophilus ValRS, tRNA(Val), and an analog of the Val-adenylate intermediate. The analog is bound in a pocket, where Pro(41) allows accommodation of the Val and Thr moieties but precludes the Ile moiety (the first sieve), on the aminoacylation domain. The editing domain, which hydrolyzes incorrectly synthesized Thr-tRNA(Val), is bound to the 3' adenosine of tRNA(Val). A contiguous pocket was found to accommodate the Thr moiety, but not the Val moiety (the second sieve). Furthermore, another Thr binding pocket for Thr-adenylate hydrolysis was suggested on the editing domain."
https://openalex.org/W2127444840,"Mutation and subsequent recombination events create genetic diversity, which is subjected to natural selection. Bacterial mismatch repair (MMR) deficient mutants, exhibiting high mutation and homologous recombination rates, are frequently found in natural populations. Therefore, we have explored the possibility that MMR deficiency emerging in nature has left some ""imprint"" in the sequence of bacterial genomes. Comparative molecular phylogeny of MMR genes from natural Escherichia coli isolates shows that, compared to housekeeping genes, individual functional MMR genes exhibit high sequence mosaicism derived from diverse phylogenetic lineages. This apparent horizontal gene transfer correlates with hyperrecombination phenotype of MMR-deficient mutators. The sequence mosaicism of MMR genes may be a hallmark of a mechanism of adaptive evolution that involves modulation of mutation and recombination rates by recurrent losses and reacquisitions of MMR gene functions."

We previously showed that Smad3 promotes α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) activation in human glomerular mesangial cells, potentially contributing to glomerulosclerosis. Here, we report that Sp1 binding is necessary for TGF-β1-induced type I collagen mRNA expression. Deletion of three Sp1 sites (GC box) between −376 and −268 or mutation of a CAGA box at −268/−260 inhibited TGF-β1-induced α2(I) collagen promoter activity. TGF-β1 inducibility was also blocked by a Smad3 dominant negative mutant. Chemical inhibition of Sp1 binding with mithramycin A, or deletion of the GC boxes, inhibited COL1A2 activation by Smad3, suggesting cooperation between Smad3 and Sp1 in the TGF-β1 response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Sp1 and Smads form complexes with −283/−250 promoter sequences. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that endogenous Sp1, Smad3, and Smad4 form complexes in mesangial cells. In a Gal4-LUC reporter assay system, Sp1 stimulated the TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activity of Gal4-Smad3, Gal4-Smad4 (266), or both. Using the transactivation domain B of Sp1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, we show that, in our system, the transcriptional activity of this Sp1 domain is not regulated by TGF-β1, but it becomes responsive to this factor when Smad3 is coexpressed. Finally, combined Sp1 and Smad3 overexpression induces marked ligand-independent and ligand-dependent promoter activity of COL1A2. Thus, Sp1 and Smad proteins form complexes and their synergy plays an important role in mediating TGF-β1-induced α2(I) collagen expression in human mesangial cells.

It is considered to be the final pathway leading to the progressive loss of renal function in several kidney diseases. Mechanical factors such as hyperfiltration and intraglomerular hypertension, as well as a variety of mediators including cytokines, growth factors, and eicosanoids derived from circulating or glomerular cells, have been implicated in initiating or maintaining sclerosis (1Schnaper H.W. Neilson E.G. Couser W.G. Immunologic Renal Disease. Lippincott-Raven, New York1997: 1003-1026Google Scholar). However, little information is available regarding the cellular mechanisms by which these factors affect matrix turnover. Our laboratory has been studying the mechanisms by which transforming growth factor (TGF)-β stimulates ECM accumulation. Previously, we determined that the Smad pathway plays a role in activating type I collagen gene expression in human glomerular mesangial cells. The Smads are a series of proteins that function downstream from the serine/threonine kinase receptors of the TGF-β family to transduce signal to the nucleus (2Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following TGF-β binding to its receptors, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3, are phosphorylated by the type I receptor and associate with the common partner, Smad4. The resulting heteromultimer translocates to the nucleus where it regulates expression of TGF-β target genes (2Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 4Massagué J.

Several of these studies showed that mutations of these CAGA boxes in the context of the promoter abrogate TGF-β stimulation. Conversely, multiple copies of this sequence support ligand inducibility, demonstrating the importance of Smad3/Smad4 binding sites in mediating TGF-β responsiveness.

We previously showed that a construct containing the sequence from −376 to +58 of the human α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) promoter is responsive to TGF-β1 in human mesangial cells and that overexpression of Smad3 stimulates COL1A2 promoter activity (29Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The TGF-β response element of the α2(I) collagen gene has been mapped to the sequences located between −340 and −183 from the transcription start site (30Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region contains three Sp1 binding sites and one AP-1 consensus sequence. Different groups have implicated either Sp1 or AP-1 as the mediator of TGF-β stimulation of α2(I) collagen gene in dermal fibroblasts (30Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

In gel shift experiments, a transcriptional complex containing Smad proteins in nuclear extracts from TGF-β-treated fibroblasts binds to this CAGA box (33Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A.S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Multiple copies of this motif conferred TGF-β1 inducibility to a heterologous promoter in HepG2 cells and in fibroblasts (34Chen S.-J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to further delineate the region responsible for TGF-β1 stimulation of COL1A2 promoter in human mesangial cells and to address the controversy concerning the role of AP-1, Sp1, and Smad proteins in TGF-β1-induced α2(I) collagen gene expression. Reagents were purchased from the following vendors: active, human recombinant TGF-β1 from R&D Systems; goat polyclonal anti-Smad2/3 IgG (N-19), mouse monoclonal anti-Smad1/2/3 IgG (H-2), mouse monoclonal anti-Smad4 IgG (B-8), rabbit anti-Sp1 IgG (PEP-2), normal goat IgG, normal mouse IgG, normal rabbit IgG, anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody, Sp1 consensus binding site, AP-1 consensus binding site, Smad3/4 binding site (CAGA), and mutated CAGA oligonucleotide from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 IgG from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; recombinant protein G-Sepharose and rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assay systems from Promega;Pwo DNA polymerase and rapid DNA ligation kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; T4 polynucleotide kinase from Life Technologies, Inc.; mithramycin A and curcumin from Sigma. Human mesangial cells were isolated from glomeruli by differential sieving of minced normal human renal cortex obtained from anonymous surgery or autopsy specimens. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, Hepes buffer, and 8 μg/ml insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (35Schnaper H.W. Kopp J.B. Hubchak S.C. Poncelet A.-C. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Bruggeman L.A. Klotman P.E. Kleinman H.K. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2521-2528PubMed Google Scholar) and were used between passages 5 and 8. Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes (3–5 × 105 cells/dish). The next day, they were preincubated with mithramycin A (100 mm) for 17 h or curcumin (20 μm) for 30 min before addition of 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 or control vehicle for 24 h. These conditions are similar to the ones showing efficient inhibition of Sp1 binding by mithramycin A and of AP-1 activation by curcumin (32Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (36Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F458-F466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were scanned with an Arcus II Scanner (AGFA) in transparency mode, and densitometric analysis was performed using the NIH Image 1.61 program for Macintosh. The same blots were successively rehybridized with additional probes after confirming complete stripping. cDNAs for human α1(I) (clone Hf677; Ref. 37Chu M.-L. Myers J.C. Bernard M.P. Ding J.-F.

The cDNA for the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 (39Carmichael D.F. Sommer A. Thompson R.C. Anderson D.C. Smith C.G. Welgus H.G. Stricklin G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2407-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. D. Carmichael (Synergen, Boulder, CO). The signals obtained by hybridization with these probes were corrected for loading using the signal obtained with a bovine cDNA for 28 S ribosomal RNA provided by Dr. H. Sage (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The day before the transfection, 6.5–8 × 104 cells were seeded in six-well plates. Eighteen hours later, cells were switched to 1% FBS medium and transfected with the indicated constructs along with 0.5 μg of CMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a control of transfection efficiency. Transfection was performed with the Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h, 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 or control vehicle was added to the cells. In some experiments, the transfected cells were pretreated for 2 h with mithramycin A before adding TGF-β1. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were harvested in 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (29Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Experimental points were realized in triplicate in at least two independent transfections. The 376COL1A2-LUC construct containing 376 bp of the α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter and 58 bp of the transcribed sequence fused to the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene was described previously (29Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The 5′ deletion constructs were generated by PCR amplification using the plasmid pMS-3.5/CAT (40Boast S. Su M.-W. Ramirez F. Sanchez M. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13351-13356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and the following pairs of primers: 5′-GCGGATCCATGCAGACAACGAGTCAC-3′ or 5′-CAGGATCCGAGTCAGAGTTTCCCC-3′ with 3′-CCTCCATGACCGGTGCTCGAGTA-5′. The PCR reactions were carried with the proofreading Pwo DNA polymerase. After digestion byBamHI and SstI, the PCR products were extracted from an agarose gel with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified fragments were subcloned into the pXP2 vector (41Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), which carries the luciferase reporter gene without a promoter. The resulting constructs were called 268COL1A2-LUC (region from −268 to +50) and 258COL1A2-LUC (region from −258 to +50). Point mutations were introduced into the potential Smad recognition site (at −268/−260) of the 376COL1A2-LUC construct using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modification: 1 cycle of 1 min at 94 °C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 7 min at 72 °C; 1 cycle of 15 min at 72 °C. The primers used were 5′-AGGGCGGAGGTATGTATACAACGAGTCAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTGACTCGTTGTATACATACCTCCGCCCT-3′. The resulting clone was called 376mCACA-LUC. Mutation and deletion constructs were verified by sequencing. The vectors expressing the indicated Smad3 variants (42Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and TGF-β1-treated cells as described by Schreiber et al. (45Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Five μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 40,000 cpm of 32P probe in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). For competition and supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide or 1 μg of antibody for 30 min or 1 h before addition of the labeled probe. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. Cells plated in 150-mm dishes (0.75–1 × 106 cells/plate) were cultured for 3 days. The cells were switched to medium containing 1% FBS and then treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for different time periods leading up to simultaneous harvest. The cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Three milligrams of lysate protein were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 6 μg of anti-Smad2/3 antibody (N-19) or anti-Sp1, followed by precipitation with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 90 min at 4 °C. After four washes with complete lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 60 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The resulting immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed through a 6% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Smad1/2/3, anti-Smad2/3, anti-Smad4, anti-Sp1, or anti-phosphoSmad2 antibody (0.2 μg/ml), or anti-phosphoserine antibody (1 μg/ml). The blots were developed with chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantification of the bands on autoradiograms was performed using densitometric analysis. Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance using InStat 2.03 software program for Macintosh. Values of p< 0.05 were considered significant. The 5′-flanking region of the human COL1A2gene contains several GC boxes (Sp1 binding sites) and an AP-1 recognition sequence between nucleotides −340 and −230 (Fig.1 A). This region has been shown to mediate TGF-β responses in fibroblasts, although contradictory data exist concerning the role of these sites for basal activity and TGF-β inducibility of the α2(I) collagen promoter (30Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol.

Moreover, a CAGA box, which can interact with recombinant Smad3 and Smad4, is present between the Sp1 and AP-1 binding sites, at the location −268/−260. Here, we investigated the role of these transcription factors in mediating TGF-β1-induced type I collagen expression in human mesangial cells. Cells were pretreated with mithramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 binding (47Ray R. Snyder S.D. Thomas C.A. Miller D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), or with curcumin, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway and AP-1 activation (48Huang T.-S. Lee S.-C. Lin J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar,49Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), before adding TGF-β1 for 24 h. Type I collagen mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blot. Mithramycin A inhibited both basal and TGF-β1-induced α1(I) and α2(I) collagen mRNA levels, whereas curcumin did not significantly affect type I collagen expression (Fig. 1 B). These results are consistent with previous findings from other groups using human fibroblasts (32Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 50Nehls M.C. Brenner D.A. Gruss H.-J. Dierbach H. Mertelmann R. Herrmann F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2916-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of mithramycin A was specific since transcription of other genes such as TIMP-1 was not blocked by this chemical antagonist (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that Sp1, but not AP-1, is involved in induction of type I collagen transcription by TGF-β1. To further support these findings and delineate the TGF-β1-responsive region of COL1A2 in mesangial cells, we performed transient transfection experiments with a series of 5′-deletion mutants of the α2(I) collagen promoter. The construct 376COL1A2-LUC, containing the sequence from −376 to +58 of the human α2(I) collagen promoter in front of the luciferase reporter gene, was stimulated about 2-fold by TGF-β1 (Fig. 2). Deletion of the sequence between −376 and −268, containing three GC boxes, blocked the TGF-β1 stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity. However, basal expression was not affected. Further deletion, removing the CAGA box but leaving the AP-1 motif intact, slightly decreased basal activity and still inhibited TGF-β1 inducibility. These data indicate that the three GC boxes are necessary for TGF-β1-induced α2(I) collagen promoter activity while the CAGA motif in the context of the promoter is not sufficient to support ligand stimulation in mesangial cells. They also confirm that the AP-1 site is not involved in the activation of the α2(I) collagen gene by TGF-β1. The contribution of Smad3 to TGF-β1-inducedCOL1A2 promoter activity was examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, the 376COL1A2-LUC construct was stimulated by TGF-β1 when mesangial cells were cotransfected with the empty expression vector, pEXL (2.07 ± 0.22-fold induction, n ≥ 7). Overexpression of Smad3 increased both basal (11.09 ± 2.82-fold, n ≥ 7) and TGF-β1-induced luciferase activity (a further 3.90 ± 0.47-fold, n ≥ 7). In contrast, a Smad3 dominant negative mutant cons"

Polarity establishment also requires the small GTPase Cdc42p and its exchange factor, Cdc24p, but the mechanism whereby Cdc28p induces Cdc42p-dependent polarization is unknown. Here we show that Cdc24p becomes phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, triggered by Cdc28p. However, the role of Cdc28p is indirect, and the phosphorylation appears to be catalyzed by the p21-activated kinase family member Cla4p and also depends on Cdc42p and the scaffold protein Bem1p. Expression of GTP-Cdc42p, the product of Cdc24p-mediated GDP/GTP exchange, stimulated Cdc24p phosphorylation independent of cell cycle cues, raising the possibility that the phosphorylation is part of a feedback regulatory pathway. Bem1p binds directly to Cdc24p, to Cla4p, and to GTP-bound Cdc42p and can mediate complex formation between these proteins in vitro. We suggest that Bem1p acts to concentrate polarity establishment proteins at a discrete site, facilitating polarization and promoting Cdc24p phosphorylation at specific times during the cell cycle.

In recent years, it has become apparent that many signaling pathways that trigger actin reorganizations involve small GTPases of the Rho family (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). This family includes about 20% of the known Ras-related G proteins and can be subdivided into Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies. CDC42 was first identified as a gene required for the establishment of cell polarity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Adams A.E.M. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and subsequent studies showed that Cdc42p is also a key regulator of cell shape in a variety of other eukaryotes (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar,3Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Eaton S. Auvinen P.

Biol. 1996; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A prominent role of Cdc42p in all cases appears to be the polarization of cells toward a variety of signals (e.g.polarization of haploid yeast toward mating partners (6Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), of T cells toward antigen-presenting cells (7Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar)). Human and yeast CDC42 are 80% identical and functionally interchangeable, suggesting that key functions of Cdc42p have been highly conserved (9Shinjo K. Koland K.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V.

Vectorial secretion involves delivery of secretory vesicles along polarized actin cables (11Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn are reorganized several times during the cell cycle (12Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), relocating growth zones to form a properly shaped bud. The actin reorganizations are triggered sequentially by changes in the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p (13Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), which together with several cyclins acts as the master regulator of cell cycle progression in yeast (14Lew D.J. Weinert T. Pringle J.R. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Cell Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 607-695Google Scholar). Bud emergence is a tightly controlled process that normally occurs at specific sites dictated by positional markers that are inherited by newborn cells (15Chant J. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Zahner J.E. Harkins H.A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After a period of uniform growth during G1, activation of Cdc28p by G1cyclins triggers a dramatic polarization of many proteins as well as cytoskeletal elements toward the cortical site demarcated by the positional markers. Thus, a temporal signal (Cdc28p) allows a pre-existing cellular asymmetry (the positional markers) to be translated into a more general cytoskeletal asymmetry.The isolation by Hartwell and co-workers (17Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and Pringle and co-workers (2,18) of temperature-sensitive mutants that could not initiate bud formation at the restrictive temperature led to the identification of Cdc42p, along with Cdc24p and Bem1p, as critical regulators of cell polarization. Like most Ras superfamily members, Cdc42p exhibits slow intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis and GDP/GTP exchange that are accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins and GDP/GTP exchange factors, respectively. Cdc24p is a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Cdc42p (19Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the similarity between the phenotypes ofcdc24 and cdc42 mutants suggests that Cdc24p is both responsible for and dedicated to the GTP loading of Cdc42p. Bem1p is a putative scaffold protein containing two SH3 domains, andbem1Δ mutants exhibit a less severe loss of cell polarity than cdc42 or cdc24 mutants, so that cells can proliferate (albeit poorly) in its absence (18Bender A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 20Chenevert J. Corrado K. Bender A. Pringle J. Herskowitz I. Nature. 1992; 356: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Three putative GTPase-activating proteins for Cdc42p have also been identified, Bem3p, Rga1p, and Rga2p (21Zheng Y. Hart M.J. Shinjo K. Evans T. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24629-24634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stevenson B.J. Ferguson B. De Virgilio C. Bi E. Pringle J.R. Ammerer G. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (see Saccharomyces genome data base for Rga2p), but their role in cell polarity remains unclear.During early G1, Cdc42p is distributed throughout the plasma membrane (and possibly internal membranes), but following Cdc28p activation a significant fraction of the Cdc42p in the cell is localized to a small patch of plasma membrane where the bud will form, together with Cdc24p and Bem1p (23Ziman M. Preuss D. Mulholland J. O'Brien J.M. Botstein D. Johnson D.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Pringle J.R. Bi E. Harkins H.A. Zahner J.E.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cdc42p then appears to recruit a number of effectors to that site, promoting polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, assembly of a ring of septins, and targeting of secretion toward that site (see Refs. 24Pringle J.R. Bi E. Harkins H.A. Zahner J.E. De, V.irgilio C. Chant J. Corrado K. Fares H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 729-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and 26Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). These observations suggested that Cdc28p promotes cell polarity through modulation of Cdc42p and its regulators. To elucidate these events, we undertook an analysis of the regulation of Cdc24p through the cell cycle. We found that Cdc24p underwent a cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation that appeared to occur in complexes containing Bem1p, GTP-Cdc42p, and the p21-activated kinase (PAK)1 Cla4p. The regulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial element in the cell division cycle of proliferating cells and in the determination of cell shape and cell motility of nonproliferating cells. In recent years, it has become apparent that many signaling pathways that trigger actin reorganizations involve small GTPases of the Rho family (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). This family includes about 20% of the known Ras-related G proteins and can be subdivided into Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies. CDC42 was first identified as a gene required for the establishment of cell polarity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Adams A.E.M. Johnson D.I. Longnecker R.M. Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and subsequent studies showed that Cdc42p is also a key regulator of cell shape in a variety of other eukaryotes (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar,3Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Eaton S. Auvinen P.

Biol. 1996; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A prominent role of Cdc42p in all cases appears to be the polarization of cells toward a variety of signals (e.g.polarization of haploid yeast toward mating partners (6Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), of T cells toward antigen-presenting cells (7Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5027-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), or of fibroblasts toward wound sites (8Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar)). Human and yeast CDC42 are 80% identical and functionally interchangeable, suggesting that key functions of Cdc42p have been highly conserved (9Shinjo K. Koland K.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V.

Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells grow by budding, a process in which the rigid cell wall is locally expanded as a result of polarized secretion. Vectorial secretion involves delivery of secretory vesicles along polarized actin cables (11Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn are reorganized several times during the cell cycle (12Adams A.E.M. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), relocating growth zones to form a properly shaped bud. The actin reorganizations are triggered sequentially by changes in the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p (13Lew D.J. Reed S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), which together with several cyclins acts as the master regulator of cell cycle progression in yeast (14Lew D.J. Weinert T. Pringle J.R. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Cell Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 607-695Google Scholar). Bud emergence is a tightly controlled process that normally occurs at specific sites dictated by positional markers that are inherited by newborn cells (15Chant J. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 16Zahner J.E. Harkins H.A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After a period of uniform growth during G1, activation of Cdc28p by G1cyclins triggers a dramatic polarization of many proteins as well as cytoskeletal elements toward the cortical site demarcated by the positional markers. Thus, a temporal signal (Cdc28p) allows a pre-existing cellular asymmetry (the positional markers) to be translated into a more general cytoskeletal asymmetry. The isolation by Hartwell and co-workers (17Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and Pringle and co-workers (2,18) of temperature-sensitive mutants that could not initiate bud formation at the restrictive temperature led to the identification of Cdc42p, along with Cdc24p and Bem1p, as critical regulators of cell polarization. Like most Ras superfamily members, Cdc42p exhibits slow intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis and GDP/GTP exchange that are accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins and GDP/GTP exchange factors, respectively. Cdc24p is a GDP/GTP exchange factor for Cdc42p (19Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the similarity between the phenotypes ofcdc24 and cdc42 mutants suggests that Cdc24p is both responsible for and dedicated to the GTP loading of Cdc42p.

Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). In addition, excessive breakdown of connective tissue plays an important role in a number of pathological processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and tumor invasion and metastasis (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 2Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). Among the diverse proteolytic enzymes potentially involved in these physiological and pathological processes, many studies have focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),1 a family of structurally related endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading the major protein components of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes. At present, 20 different human MMPs have been characterized at the amino acid sequence level (3Urı́a J.A. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4745-4751PubMed Google Scholar). According to structural and functional characteristics, these human MMPs can be classified into at least six different subfamilies of closely related members: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs), and other MMPs. The collagenase subfamily of human MMPs consists of three distinct members: fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1), neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), and collagenase-3 (MMP-13). An additional collagenase called collagenase-4 has been identified in Xenopus laevis (4Stolow M.A. Bauzon D.D. Li J. Sedgwick T. Liang V.C.T. Sang Q.A. Shi Y.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but to date the putative orthologues of this enzyme in other vertebrate species have not been described. Biochemical characterization of all these collagenases has revealed that they share the ability to cleave fibrillar collagens at a specific peptide bond, resulting in the generation of fragments of about three-fourths and one-fourth the size of the intact molecule. Then, the resulting fragments denature spontaneously to gelatin in physiological temperature and become susceptible to degradation by other MMPs (5Freije J.P. Dı́ez-Itza I. Balbı́n M. Sánchez L.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Interestingly, kinetic studies have revealed that each human collagenase shows distinct substrate preferences toward the diverse fibrillar collagens. Thus, MMP-1 degrades preferentially type III collagen (6Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9511-9515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MMP-8 prefers type I collagen (7Hasty K.A. Jeffrey J.J. Hibbs M.S. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10048-10052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MMP-13 degrades type II collagen 6-fold more effectively than type I and type III collagens (8Knäuper V. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). It is also remarkable that MMP-13 displays about 40-fold stronger gelatinolytic activity than MMP-1 and MMP-8 (8Knäuper V. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, we have previously proposed that the different human collagenases have evolved as specialized enzymes to participate in the remodeling of tissues with different collagen composition (8Knäuper V. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Knight G. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1544-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The observation that the three human collagenases exhibit distinct tissue distribution and are subjected to different regulatory mechanisms (9Urı́a J.A. Jiménez M.G. Balbı́n M. Freije J.M.P.

Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 291: 137-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) is also consistent with the idea that they may play different functional roles in both physiological and pathological processes. To provide further experimental support to this proposal, it is essential that animal models be available in which the activity of the different enzymes can be selectively manipulated. However, these studies have been seriously hampered by the inability to detect the murine orthologue of MMP-1. In fact, to date only murine MMP-8 and MMP-13 have been identified and characterized at the amino acid sequence level (11Balbı́n M. Fueyo A. Knäuper V. Pendás A.M. López J.M. Jiménez M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas all attempts from many different groups to isolate murine MMP-1 have been repeatedly unsuccessful. These data have suggested that MMP-1 may be functionally substituted in murine tissues by other enzymes with collagenolytic activity such as MMP-8 and MMP-13. Nevertheless, the possibility that additional as yet unidentified murine enzymes could be structurally or functionally related to human MMP-1 cannot be definitively ruled out. To evaluate this possibility, we have performed an extensive screening of murine genomic and cDNA libraries using as probe the full-length cDNA for human MMP-1. As a direct result of this work, we report herein the identification of two novel members of the MMP gene family originally selected by their positive hybridization with the human MMP-1 probe, and contained within the cluster of MMP genes located at murine chromosome 9. We also describe the expression of the genes in Escherichia coli and perform an analysis of the enzymatic activity of the recombinant proteins. Finally, we analyze the expression of these novel MMPs in murine tissues with the finding of their predominant presence at sites of embryo implantation. A high density gridded mouse P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) genomic library was supplied by the Human Genome Mapping Resource Center (Cambridgeshire, UK). Restriction endonucleases and other reagents used for molecular cloning were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Oligonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 392A DNA synthesizer. Double-stranded DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK) using a commercial random-priming kit purchased from the same company. The mouse PAC genomic library was hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to full-length human MMP-1 probe (ATCC number 57684). Hybridization and washes were performed at 60 °C. After autoradiographic exposure of the filters, 24 positive clones were detected, and 7 of them were further analyzed by extensive Southern blotting and DNA sequencing of isolated fragments. Oligonucleotides derived from the coding yexons of the previously isolated genomic DNA sequences were used as primers for RT-PCR amplification of RNA from mouse embryos using the RNA-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All PCR assays were carried out in a GeneAmp 2400 or 9700 PCR system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Full-length cDNA of Mcol-A and Mcol-B was obtained by RT-PCR amplification and further assembly of two overlapping fragments of each gene, covering from the ATG sequence to the stop codon of the previously identified genomic fragments. DNA fragments of interest were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method, using the Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH), and the ABI-Prism DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Computer analysis of DNA and protein sequences was performed with the GCG software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group. A phylogenetic tree directed to examine the evolutionary relationships between human and mouse MMPs clustered in human chromosome 11 and mouse chromosome 9 was constructed on-line at the United Kingdom Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Center, using PIE, which provides awww interface to programs included in the PHYLIP software package. Labeling of the probes was performed by using 2 μg of PAC or BAC DNA in a nick translation reaction with biotin-16-dUTP. Biotinylated probes were hybridized to mouse male metaphase chromosomes and detected using two avidin-fluorescein layers. Chromosomes were diamine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride-banded, and images were captured in a Zeiss axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics). The specific probe for mouse chromosome 9 was the telomeric probe BAC 55J6 corresponding to the marker D9Mit152 (14Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Devon K.L. Noya D. Oster-Granite M.L. Birren B.W. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nylon filters containing 20 μg of RNA of murine tissues were prehybridized at 42 °C for 3 h in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, and then hybridized for 20 h under the same conditions. Filters were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 h at 50 °C and exposed to autoradiography. RNA integrity and equal loading was assessed by hybridization with an actin probe. Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared with digoxigenin RNA-labeling mix and the corresponding T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mcol-A probe was a 770-bp BamHI fragment, Mcol-B probe was a 700-bpBamHI/HindIII fragment, and MMP-9 probe was a 1353-bp BamHI fragment, and all of them were subcloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) vector. In situ hybridization was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 9.5-day postcoitum (dpc) mouse embryos or 10.5-dpc rat embryos, essentially as described (15Jiménez M.J. Balbı́n M.

The PCR-amplified product was cloned in the pRSETB expression vector and transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS-competent E. coli cells. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration), inclusion bodies were prepared and the enzymes were refolded as described previously (16Butler G.S. Apte S.S. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For comparative purposes we refolded human MMP-13 and -14 using this protocol and established that these enzymes displayed collagenolytic activity, as an indication of correct folding of the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain, which determines collagenolytic ability in all known human collagenases. Enzymatic activity of purified recombinant Mcol-A and Mcol-B against fibrillar collagens was followed by SDS-PAGE. All assays were performed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Brij-35, pH 7.6, for 16 h at 37 °C (17Willembrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M.I. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The enzyme/substrate ratio (w/w) used in these experiments was 1/10. Enzymatic activity was also analyzed using the synthetic fluorescent substrates Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (QF-24), Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (QF-35), and Mca-Pro-Cha-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2 (QF-41) (provided by C. G. Knight, University of Cambridge, UK). Routine assays were performed at 37 °C at substrate concentrations of 1 μm in an assay buffer of 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Brij-35, pH 7.6, with a final concentration of Me2SO of 1% (17Willembrock F.

The fluorometric measurements were performed using an LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer. Enzyme concentrations were determined by active site titration using a standard TIMP-1 solution following 4-h preincubation to allow complex formation (17Willembrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M.I. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Collagenolytic activity was determined by incubating soluble rat type I collagen (18Cawston T.E. Murphy G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or acid-soluble bovine type II collagen (Biogenesis Inc., Poole, UK) with the recombinant enzymes at 25 °C, and the degradation products were demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, we determined the specific collagenolytic activity of Mcol-A using14C-labeled rat type I collagen in a fibrillar assay at 35 °C essentially as described (18Cawston T.E. Murphy G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The activity of both murine orthologues against 14C-labeled gelatin and casein was determined by overnight incubation at 37 °C. Three-dimensional models of catalytic domains of Mcol-A and Mcol-B were calculated using a semiautomated modeling server (19Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9259) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the Swiss-PdbViewer. Briefly, the amino acid sequences of the respective catalytic domains were compared with the sequences of the macromolecules deposited in the Protein Data Bank to identify suitable templates. We chose nonredundant proteins that had the highest structural quality, and high similarity with Mcol-A and Mcol-B. The pdb files corresponding to these proteins are 2TCL (human MMP-1), 1JAN (human MMP-8), the B chain of file 830C (human MMP-13), and 1SLM (human MMP-3). The templates were superimposed and aligned structurally. Then, the target sequences were automatically threaded over the structure, built with ProMod II, and energy-minimized with Gromos96. The models were analyzed with Swiss-Pdb Viewer, whereas the electrostatic calculations were performed with MolMol (20Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6425) Google Scholar). Charges of conserved ions were also included in the calculations: two Zn2+ and two Ca2+ for the catalytic domain, as present in 2TCL. The figures were modeled with MolMol and rendered with Megapov and POV-Ray (from the POV-Ray site on the Web). To identify putative murine MMPs structurally related to human interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), we screened a mouse PAC genomic library using as a probe a full-length cDNA coding for this human protease. After hybridization under low stringency conditions, several PAC clones were selected on the basis of positive hybridization to the probe. The inserts contained in these clones were characterized by endonuclease restriction analysis and selected fragments showing hybridization with the MMP-1 cDNA probe were cloned and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. This analysis allowed the identification of two DNA fragments, derived from PAC 528 C11, whose nucleotide sequences were similar to those previously determined for other murine MMPs. Further sequence analysis of these fragments and comparison with the exon-intron distribution of other MMP genes led us to identify several putative exons of a presumably novel MMP gene. To try to determine the complete structure of this MMP, studies were undertaken to isolate a full-length cDNA encoding this enzyme. To do that, two primers covering the start and stop codons identified in the putative first and last exons of the cloned MMP gene were synthesized and used for RT-PCR amplification of total RNA obtained from mouse embryos. The PCR-amplified product was cloned, and its identity was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Computer analysis of the obtained sequence (Fig.1A) revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 464 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 53.5 kDa, which was tentatively called Mcol-A (Murine collagenase-likeA).Figure 1Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequences of mouse Mcol-A and Mcol-B. The deduced amino acid sequences for Mcol-A (A) and Mcol-B (B) are shown below the nucleotide sequences. Potential sites forN-glycosylation are underlined. C, comparison of the amino acid sequences of mouse Mcol-A and Mcol-B with mouse collagenases (MMP-8 and MMP-13), human MMP-1, and stromelysins.

Residues specific of collagenases are inbold and marked with an asterisk. Numbering refers to Mcol-A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further analysis, of additional clones obtained by RT-PCR amplification of murine embryos RNA with oligonucleotides derived from the sequence determined for Mcol-A, revealed the presence of sequences highly related to but distinct from that determined for this novel MMP. A full-length cDNA for this apparently distinct MMP was isolated following the same strategy as above and then characterized by nucleotide sequencing. Analysis of the resulting sequence (Fig.1B) allowed the finding of an open reading frame encoding a protein of 463 residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 53.5 kDa, and tentatively called Mcol-B. Genomic clones for this second MMP gene were also identified from DNA fragments obtained from PAC 519 F1 and allowed to confirm the sequence determined by analysis of the cDNA amplified by RT-PCR of murine embryos RNA. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences determined for Mcol-A and Mcol-B showed that they were closely related, exhibiting about 82% identities between them. Pairwise comparisons for sequence similarities between the identified amino acid sequences (Fig. 1C) and those determined for other murine MMPs showed that the maximum percentage of identities was found with mouse neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) (48% and 45% with Mcol-A and Mcol-B, respectively). Interestingly, a higher percentage of identities (58% in amino acids and 74% in nucleotides) was found with human interstitial collagenase (MMP-1). This comparative sequence analysis also revealed that both Mcol-A and Mcol-B display all structural features characteristic of archetypal MMPs, including signal sequences, prodomain regions with the conserved Cys residues in the conserved PRCGVPD motif (at positions 87–93), catalytic, and hemopexin domains (Fig. 1C). The percentage of identities of each domain of the murine proteins with human MMP-1 is 53% (prodomain), 63% (catalytic), and 59% (hemopexin) in the case of Mcol-A, and 53% (prodomain), 58% (catalytic), and 61% (hemopexin) in the case of Mcol-B. The amino acid sequence deduced for Mcol-A and McolB contains three and two potential sites of N-glycosylation, respectively, including the one at position 117 absolutely conserved in the catalytic domain of collagenases, macrophage metalloelastases, stromelysin-1 and -2, gelatinase B, and MT-MMPs. To further explore the structural relationship between human MMP-1 and murine Mcol-A and Mcol-B, we next performed a more detailed sequence analysis with special emphasis aimed at comparing a series of residues conserved in all collagenases described to date and proposed as essential determinants of collagenase specificity. These residues include Tyr-210, Asp-231, and Gly-233 according to human MMP-1 numbering (5Freije J.P. Dı́ez-Itza I. Balbı́n M. Sánchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. López-Otı́n C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equivalent residues at these three positions in Mcol-A are Phe-208, Asp-229, and Gly-231, whereas in Mcol-B these residues are Phe-208, Asp-229, and Glu-231, respectively (Fig.1C). Therefore, it seems that Mcol-A is more related to collagenases than Mcol-B at least in terms of occurrence of residues important for this activity. This structural analysis also revealed that both Mcol-A and Mcol-B contain an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif in the catalytic domain. This motif is present at equivalent position in the MMP-1 sequence from all species in which this protein has been characterized, but not in other MMPs, providing additional evidence on the structural relationship between MMP-1 and the newly identified family members Mcol-A and Mcol-B. By contrast, both enzymes lack the nine-residue insertion present in the hinge region of all stromelysins. They also lack the fibronectin-like domain present in gelatinases, the C-terminal extension rich in hydrophobic residues characteristic of MT-MMPs, and the furin activation motif (RX(R/K)R) mediating the intracellular activation of MT-MMPs and stromelysin-3 (22Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 23Sato H. Kinoshita T. Takino T. Nakayama K. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In summary, and taking collectively all these structural comparisons, most data point to the inclusion of Mcol-A and Mcol-B as members of the collagenase subfamily, although they cannot be unequivocally classified within this group on the exclusive basis of their amino acid sequence characteristics. To determine the chromosomal location of murine genes encoding Mcol-A and Mcol-B, metaphase spreads from a male mouse were hybridized with the biotinylated PACs 528 C11 and 519 F1 enclosing these genes and with the telomeric marker of chromosome 9, BAC 55J6. After single- and double-fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments with both probes, fluorescent signal corresponding to Mcol-A andMcol-B genes was located to the A1–A2 region of chromosome 9 (Fig. 2). Other murine MMP genes (MMP-7, -12, -13, and -20) have been already mapped to this region (24Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Ley T.J. J. Biol.

We split DsbD into three structural domains, each containing two essential cysteines. Remarkably, when coexpressed, these truncated proteins restore DsbD function. Utilizing this three piece system, we were able to determine a pathway of the electrons through DsbD. Our findings strongly suggest that the pathway is based on a series of multistep redox reactions that include direct interactions between thioredoxin and DsbD, and between DsbD and its periplasmic substrates. A thioredoxin-fold domain in DsbD appears to have the novel role of intramolecular electron shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W1970227011,"Following challenge with proinflammatory stimuli or generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), transcription factor NF-κB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to activate expression of target genes. In addition, NF-κB plays a key role in protecting cells from proapoptotic stimuli, including DSBs. Patients suffering from the genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia, caused by mutations in the<i>ATM</i> gene, are highly sensitive to inducers of DSBs, such as ionizing radiation. Similar hypersensitivity is displayed by cell lines derived from ataxia-telangiectasia patients or<i>Atm</i> knockout mice. The ATM protein, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like family, is a multifunctional protein kinase whose activity is stimulated by DSBs. As both ATM and NF-κB deficiencies result in increased sensitivity to DSBs, we examined the role of ATM in NF-κB activation. We report that ATM is essential for NF-κB activation in response to DSBs but not proinflammatory stimuli, and this activity is mediated via the IκB kinase complex. DNA-dependent protein kinase, another member of the PI3K-like family, PI3K itself, and c-Abl, a nuclear tyrosine kinase, are not required for this response."
https://openalex.org/W1990208526,"Overexpression of Integrin Linked Kinase (ILK) in intestinal and mammary epithelial cells results in a highly invasive phenotype, associated with increased levels of expression of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9. This increase was at the transcriptional level as determined by MMP-9 promoter-CAT reporter assays. Mutations in the two AP-1 binding sites within the MMP-9 promoter completely inhibited the reporter activity. We have previously shown that ILK inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. Transient transfection of wild-type GSK-3β in ILK-overexpressing cells decreased MMP-9 promoter activity and AP-1 activity, indicating that ILK can stimulate MMP-9 expression via GSK-3β and AP-1 transcription factor. A small molecule inhibitor of the ILK kinase reduced the in vitro invasiveness of ILK-overexpressing cells as well as the invasiveness of several human brain tumor cell lines. Furthermore, both MMP-9 promoter and AP-1 activities were inhibited by the ILK inhibitor. Invasiveness of ILK-overexpressing cells was also reduced by inhibition of MMP-9. These data demonstrate that ILK can induce an invasive phenotype via AP-1-dependent upregulation of MMP-9."

Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).In response to stress signals such as Ca2+ or reactive oxygen species as well as most apoptosis signals, the mitochondrial membrane opens to allow solutes and water to enter the matrix in a phenomenon termed permeability transition (PT) (12Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 31Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this is a result of the opening of a multiprotein complex spanning the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria known as the PT pore complex (12Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 13Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The most abundant components of the PT pore are the voltage-dependent anion channel/porin and adenine nucleotide translocator, plus proteins such as cyclophilin D, creatine kinase, and others. Upon PT pore opening, mitochondria lose their mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) across the inner membrane, which is reported to be an early response to many apoptotic signals (32Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Beutner G. Brdiczka D. Remy R. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). BCL-2 family pro-apoptotic proteins that translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane such as BAX are reported in some models to physically interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel and adenine nucleotide translocator, and it has been proposed that this results in PT pore opening and cyt crelease (33Marzo I.

However, the exact mechanism of cyt crelease remains controversial and unresolved.Although one model of GrB action suggests that it directly cleaves and activates the downstream caspase-3 (6Atkinson E.A.

Shi L.F. Velde C.V. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an in vitro cell-free system, the addition of mitochondria to S100 increases GrB-induced nuclear chromatin condensation 15-fold, indicating that mitochondria have a powerful amplification effect on GrB function (37MacDonald G. Shi L.F. Velde C.V. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This activity requires proteolytically active GrB. These observations suggest a role for mitochondria in the GrB apoptotic response.In this study, we demonstrate that both APAF-1 and caspase 9, and therefore, a mitochondrial cyt c pathway, are required for efficient GrB-induced apoptosis of murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. GrB mediates cyt c release from isolated mitochondriain vitro through an S100 protein that we identify as the BCL-2 family member BID. Furthermore, GrB in the absence of BID or other S100 proteins can open the mitochondrial PT pore with the loss of ΔΨm. Thus, we have identified two mechanisms by which GrB disrupts mitochondrial function and promotes cell death.DISCUSSIONWe have examined how GrB mediates apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial function and have determined that GrB acts through two distinct mechanisms: (i) cleaving the cytosolic protein BID, resulting in the release of cyt c, and (ii) acting directly on mitochondria to cause PT and loss of ΔΨm. Since mitochondria appear to be dysregulated in GrB-mediated apoptosis, we examined whether GrB acts directly on the mitochondria or indirectly through other proteins to perturb mitochondrial function. One regulatory mechanism that is important for apoptosis is the activation of the downstream effector caspase cascade via activation of caspase 9 during integration into the holoenzyme (15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.D. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 9Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Caspase 3 is generally activated by caspase 9 in a mitochondrial-dependent pathway; however, it has been suggested that GrB can directly activate caspase 3 (36Yang X.H. Stennicke H.R. Wang B.K.

In this study, we show that the GrB mitochondrial-dependent pathway is the dominant apoptotic pathway usingapaf-1−/− and caspase9−/− MEF cells. Other death signals delivered to apaf-1−/− andcaspase 9−/− MEFs have been shown to reduce caspase 3 activation and to increase survival (18Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R.

As APAF-1 and caspase 9 require cyt c to form an active holoenzyme for caspase 3 processing (50Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar), this suggests that cytc release from mitochondria may be a key event in GrB-induced apoptosis. We were able to determine from the kinetics of the nuclear changes induced by GrB inapaf-1−/− and caspase9−/− MEFs that only ∼15–20% of the apoptotic signal of wild-type cells is seen in the first few hours of GrB and perforin treatment. Apoptosis occurs much more slowly; and by 24 h, apaf-1−/− andcaspase 9−/− MEF cell apoptosis increases to ∼40% of that seen in wild-type cells. These observations led us to conclude that mitochondria are the major regulators of GrB-induced apoptosis in MEFs. Whether the mitochondrial pathway will be as important in other cell types remains to be determined.Candidate proteins mediating the regulation of cyt c release come from the BCL-2 family, which contains both anti-apoptotic (BCL-2 and BCL-XL) and pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK, BID, etc.) proteins that either directly or indirectly affect mitochondrial function through heterodimerization (for reviews, see Refs. 52Korsmeyer S.J.

In our search for the proteins involved in regulating GrB-induced cytc release in vitro, we determined that BID was the only cytosolic protein required. BID has been shown to interact via its BH3 domain with the BCL-2 and BCL-XL domains and the BAX BH1 domain (56Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Millman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Precedence for BID in mitochondrial signaling comes from the Fas/CD95 death pathway, in which caspase 8-cleaved BID is responsible for cyt c release as well as the subsequent apoptotic cellular changes resulting from holoenzyme formation and activation of downstream caspases (19Li H.

In vitroBID BH3 mutants and BID-depleted cell extracts have reduced capability to release cyt c (20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Our observations that GrB-induced cyt c release requires BID and that APAF-1 and caspase 9 are necessary for efficient apoptosis support the idea that GrB may use a mitochondrial pathway similar to Fas/CD95 in which GrB cleavage of BID leads to the activation of downstream caspases.In the cell-free assay, we demonstrated that caspases were not required, as GrB and rBID induced cyt c release in the absence of any other S100 proteins. Also, caspase inhibitors failed to block cyt c release when S100 was present, supporting a model in which BID is directly cleaved by GrB. This is in agreement with previously published data in Jurkat cells, where cyt crelease following GrB and perforin treatment was found to be caspase-independent (44Heibein J.A. Barry M. Motyka B. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4683-4693PubMed Google Scholar), and BID was cleaved within 60 min in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (30Barry M. Heibein J.A. Pinkoski M.J. Lee S.F. Moyer R.W. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, we have also demonstrated that Z-VAD-fmk, while efficiently inhibiting cyt c release in HeLa cells, fails to block release in vitro using S100 from HeLa cells and liver mitochondria (37MacDonald G. Shi L.F. Velde C.V. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This indicates that in some cells, GrB operates primarily through a caspase-dependent mechanism, although in others such as Jurkat, it primarily targets BID. Why the caspase dependence of cyt c release in HeLa cells is not duplicated in the in vitro assay is not clear, but suggests that in a disrupted cell, GrB prefers BID as a substrate or that the caspase targeted by GrB is not present in the S100 fractions of the HeLa cells. We were also unable to determine whether the participation of caspases in cyt c release in HeLa cells is a result of direct processing of a caspase by GrB or is secondary to GrB-induced BID processing in a feed-forward amplification from the mitochondrial activation of downstream caspases. Whether in the presence or absence of active caspases, it appears that BID is a pivotal protein in GrB-mediated apoptotic cellular changes.The mechanism of cyt c release from mitochondria has not been determined; however, several theoretical models have been suggested such as the release through the PT pore (34Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) or a cytc-specific channel (61Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) or a nonspecific release from rupturing of the outer mitochondrial membrane due to swelling from PT (62Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). GrB-induced cyt c release through the PT pore is unlikely, as the release is not blocked by PT pore inhibitors CsA and bongkrekic acid. 2L. Shi, J. B. Alimonti, and A. H. Greenberg, unpublished data. The mechanism is also not due to outer membrane rupture, as we did not see a coordinated release of cyt c and other intermembrane proteins such as AIF. This suggests that BID must be acting on some other protein associated with the mitochondria. BID is a cytosolic protein until a death signal results in its cleavage to the truncated form (tBID) that is translocated to the mitochondria. Using rBID, we found that it is cleaved directly by GrB as predicted since BID contains a single GrB cleavage site (72IEPDS76for murine and 72IEADS76 for humans) and has been reported to be directly cleaved by GrB at this site (19Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar, 63Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesan G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G.

Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that mitochondrial membrane-bound death antagonists BCL-2 and BCL-XL and agonist BAX can function independently of each other, but compete for tBID as a ligand to block or induce cytc release (57Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 63Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesan G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G.

Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). When bound by tBID, BAX undergoes a conformational change enabling its integration into the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in cyt c release (64Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Naundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BAX-induced cyt c release has been shown to be independent of the PT pore (66Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), similar to our observations with GrB-induced cytc release. Another possibility for the action of BID can be found in its tertiary structure, which resembles BAX and the pore-forming domains found in the bacterial toxins diphtheria and colicin (63Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesan G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that BID can form pores in membranes under low pH conditions (67Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), so perhaps BID is sufficient to induce cyt c release by itself under certain conditions.It is noteworthy that cytochrome c release and PT, accompanied by loss of ΔΨm, were independent of one another even though both were detected at similar times in response to GrB in the in vitro cell-free assay. Both PT and ΔΨmsuppression occur in the absence of any cytosolic S100 protein, indicating that caspases are not required and that GrB acts directly on the mitochondrial outer membrane. The caspase independence of the GrB-mediated ΔΨm loss mechanism in a cell-free system is similar to our findings in intact HeLa cells (37MacDonald G. Shi L.F. Velde C.V. Lieberman J. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which was confirmed by Heibein et al. (44Heibein J.A. Barry M. Motyka B. Bleackley R.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4683-4693PubMed Google Scholar) in Jurkat cells. As CsA inhibits PT, we may assume that GrB acts on the PT pore or some other protein associated with the pore. The PT pore acts as a gated channel regulating mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, pH, volume, and ΔΨm (33Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Opening of the 1.5-kDa PT pore results in PT and the equilibration of solutes across the inner membrane. This can lead to uncoupling of the electron transport chain, loss of ΔΨm, inhibition of ATP synthesis, mitochondrial swelling, and an increased reactive oxygen species production. The general serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride can block GrB-mediated PT and ΔΨm loss; therefore, we determined whether the PT pore components voltage-dependent anion channel and adenine nucleotide translocator as well as some of the proteins shown to bind to or regulate the pore (BAX and BCL-2) were cleaved by GrB using Western analysis. However, we were unable to demonstrate that GrB cleaved any of these proteins (data not shown).Although our in vitro assays indicate that S100 (and therefore, any BID it contains) is not required for GrB to suppress ΔΨm, we found that rBID increases the loss of ΔΨm. This suggests either that the concentration of BID in S100 is too low to act on the PT pore after GrB processing or that S100 contains another protein(s) that interferes with tBID-induced suppression of ΔΨm. We are unable to determine whether or not rBID and GrB are acting at the same or distinct sites on the mitochondrial outer membrane.We can now view GrB-induced apoptosis as a three-phase process similar to other death signals in which the pre-mitochondrial phase is followed by convergence at the mitochondria, resulting in the release of pro-apoptotic factors that activate the post-mitochondrial effector phase.

Amino acids are essential nutrients for cell growth and maintenance. Mammalian cells have developed an adaptive response to changes in amino acid availability (1Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol... 1996; 53: 219-248Google Scholar). When the amino acid supply is limited, protein synthesis decreases, and there are increases in catabolism of cellular proteins, amino acid biosynthesis, and amino acid transport across the plasma membrane. Together these responses provide cells with amino acids needed for survival. A significant part of this adaptive response is the increased expression of thecat-1gene, which encodes the transporter for the essential cationic amino acids, lysine and arginine (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar). We have shown that the level of the Cat-1 protein and the transport of cationic amino acids increase in amino acid-depleted cells (3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). Because amino acid starvation inhibits cap-dependent initiation of protein synthesis (4Pain V.M. Biochimie ( Paris ).. 1994; 76: 718-728Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the cat-1 mRNA is translated in amino acid-depleted cells through a cap-independent mechanism. This translation would involve an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES1) within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). IRES sequences have been implicated in the translation of viral mRNAs in infected cells, where cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs is inhibited (5Jackson R.J. Kaminski A.

This study provides support for our hypothesis by demonstrating that the 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA contains an IRES sequence. Moreover, translation from this IRES is stimulated in amino acid-starved cells, when cap-dependent translation is decreased. These findings suggest a mechanism for synthesis of proteins required for amino acid accumulation in starved cells when total protein synthesis is inhibited. The 5′-end of the cat-1 mRNA was cloned using the RACE technique (15Zhang Y. Frohman M.A. Methods Mol. Biol... 1997; 69: 61-87Google Scholar). RACE was performed using polyadenylated RNA from FTO2B rat hepatoma cells. Five cDNA clones were isolated, with the largest containing an insert of 224 nucleotides of 5′UTR (cat1–224). The cat1–224 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers in Fig.1 A and cloned into the SalI/NcoI site of the pSVCAT/BiP/LUC plasmid (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) by replacing the IRES from the BiP mRNA. The resulting vector was named pSVCAT/cat1–224/LUC. The plasmid pSVhpCAT/cat1–224/LUC was constructed by replacing the BiP IRES within the pSVhpCAT/BiP/LUC (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) vector, at theNcoI/SalI sites. The pSVCAT/ICS/LUC vector contains 400 nucleotides of antisense antenapedia cDNA ofD. Melanogaster (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar) in the ICS region and was used as a negative control for IRES-mediated translation. The pUHD10–3cat1–224/LUC, pUHD10–3cat1–224mut/LUC, and pUHD10–3con/LUC expression vectors were generated by cloning the chimeric LUC cDNAs into the pUD10–3 expression vector cleaved at the XbaI site 3′ to the promoter region and the EcoRI site 5′ to the polyadenylation signal (3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). This vector contains a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter with very low promoter activity and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The cat1–224/LUC DNA contained 224 nucleotides upstream of the LUC ORF. The cat1–224mut/LUC contained the same sequence as cat1–224/LUC, but the 49-amino acid ORF was eliminated by mutating the initiating ATG to TTG using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. The con/LUC DNA contained 25 nucleotides of linker sequence upstream of the LUC ORF. The mRNAs transcribed from these expression vectors would contain 5′-UTR sequences of 249 bases for cat1–224 and cat1–224mut and 50 bases for the con. Plasmid DNA was transfected into C6 rat glioma cells using the calcium phosphate technique (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar). Stable mass-culture cell lines were generated by cotransfecting an expression vector containing the neo gene and selecting the transfectants in 0.1% G418. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Fed cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with fetal bovine serum dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Starved cells were incubated in KRB supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar, 3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). No difference in the regulation of the cat-1 gene by amino acid starvation was observed when KRB containing all amino acids was used in place of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar). Treatments were performed by culturing cells (5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) for 48 h in growth medium followed by culture under fed or starved conditions for the appropriate times. Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for LUC and CAT activities as described previously (17Leahy P. Crawford D.R. Grossman G. Gronostajski R.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 8813-8822Google Scholar). The activities were normalized to the protein content of the cell extracts, which was measured using the Bio-Rad assay. To measure [3H]arginine transport, cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/18-mm plate for 48 h. Transport in amino acid-fed and -starved cells was measured as described previously (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar,3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). Because system y+ amino acid transporters carry out the exchange of amino acids, 0.5 mm lysine was added to the amino acid-deficient medium, permitting the detection of maximum transport activity. The induction of expression from the endogenous cat-1 gene and the bicistronic mRNA vectors in amino acid-free KRB and KRB containing 0.5 mm lysine were identical (not shown). Western blot analysis was carried out as previously described (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar). Cat-1 was detected using a polyclonal antibody against a Cat-1 peptide (3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar) that was immunoaffinity-purified using the antigen. Asparagine synthase was detected using 3G6, a monoclonal antibody against human asparagine synthase (18Sheng S. Moraga D.A. Van Heeke G. Schuster S.M. Protein Expression Purif... 1992; 3: 337-346Google Scholar). eIF2α was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for eIF2α, and the phospho-eIF2α was detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-eIF2α[pS51] phosphospecific antibody (generous gifts from T. Dever). Total and phosphorylated (Ser-209) eIF4E were detected using polyclonal antibodies for eIF4E and phospho-eIF4E, respectively (Cell Signaling). The previously cloned cat-1 cDNA contained only 80 nucleotides of 5′-UTR sequence (19Aulak K.S. Liu J. Wu J. Hyatt S.L. Puppi M. Henning S.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 29799-29806Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that the cat-1 protein is translated using a cap-independent mechanism, the 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA was isolated using RACE (15Zhang Y. Frohman M.A. Methods Mol. Biol... 1997; 69: 61-87Google Scholar). The longest of the clones contained 224 base pairs of the cat-1 5′-UTR. This sequence contains an open reading frame of 49 amino acids, beginning 223 bases upstream from the cat-1 ORF (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the cat-1 5′-UTR sequence to mediate internal translation initiation was tested using vectors developed by the Sarnow laboratory that encode a bicistronic mRNA (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar). The CAT enzyme is translated from the first cistron by a cap-dependent scanning mechanism. The second cistron, encoding the firefly LUC enzyme, is translated only if it is preceded by an IRES in the ICS region (Fig. 1 B). The following three vectors were tested for IRES-mediated translation of the LUC gene: CAT/ICS/LUC as a negative control, CAT/BiP/LUC containing the BiP 5′-UTR as a positive control (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar), and CAT/cat1–224/LUC containing the cat-1 5′-UTR sequence instead of the BiP sequence. The plasmids were transfected into C6 rat glioma cells, and 48 h later cell extracts were prepared and assayed for LUC and CAT activities. The data are expressed as the ratio of LUC and CAT activities to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency (Fig. 2). The normalized LUC activity for CAT/cat1–224/LUC was 35 times higher than the CAT/ICS/LUC negative control and similar to CAT/BiP/LUC (Fig. 2), suggesting that the 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA contains an IRES element. Northern blot analysis of transfected cells demonstrated a single transcript hybridizing to both LUC and CAT hybridization probes (Fig. 2, inset), supporting the idea that the LUC and CAT activities derive from translation of the bicistronic mRNAs. To demonstrate that expression of the LUC gene does not result from readthrough of ribosomes from the CAT cistron, we constructed a vector encoding a bicistronic CAT/cat1–224/LUC mRNA with a stable RNA hairpin upstream of the CAT ORF (see Fig. 1 B and Ref. 16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar). RNA hairpins in the 5′-UTR of mRNAs have been shown to inhibit translation initiation at a downstream AUG (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell.. 1985; 40: 515-526Google Scholar). hpCAT/cat1–224/LUC gave normalized LUC activity that was 15-fold higher than CAT/cat1–224/LUC (Fig. 2 A). This increase was due to decreased CAT and unchanged LUC activities in hpCAT/cat1–224/LUC compared with CAT/cat1–224/LUC (Fig. 2, B andC). These results are consistent with the cap-dependent initiation of CAT and the cap-independent initiation of LUC translation from an IRES in the cat-1 5′-UTR. As previously shown (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar), the relative LUC activity from hpCAT/BiP/LUC was 5-fold higher than the activity from CAT/BiP/LUC (Fig.2 A). To further demonstrate that the cat-1 5′-UTR supports IRES-mediated translation under conditions where the cap-dependent translation of cellular mRNAs is inhibited, the normalized LUC activity was measured in cells treated with rapamycin. This compound partially inhibits cap-dependent translation by promoting the dephosphorylation and activation of 4E-BP1, a repressor of the cap-binding protein 4E (21Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J... 1996; 15: 658-664Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment caused an 80% decrease of CAT expression from CAT/cat1–224/LUC, but LUC activity did not change (Table I). The normalized LUC activity increased 5.1-fold (Table I), supporting internal translation initiation of LUC from the cat-1 5′-UTR. As expected (16Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature.. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar), a 5.6-fold increase in the normalized LUC activity was caused by rapamycin treatment of cells transfected with CAT/BiP/LUC as a positive control (not shown). These data support the conclusion that the 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA contains an IRES element that has high activity when cellular cap-dependent translation is inhibited.Table IRapamycin does not inhibit translation from the cat-1 IRESCATLUCLUC/CATunits/μg proteinunits/μg proteinControl167 ± 6509 ± 253.0 ± 0.1Rapamycin34.6 ± 0.5537 ± 3315.4 ± 0.8C6 cells were transfected with the pSVCAT/cat1–224/LUC plasmid and 36 h after transfection were incubated without (control) or with 50 ng/ml rapamycin for 18 h. Cell extracts were analyzed for LUC and CAT activities; the LUC and CAT activities (arbitrary units) and the LUC/CAT ratio are shown; values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab C6 cells were transfected with the pSVCAT/cat1–224/LUC plasmid and 36 h after transfection were incubated without (control) or with 50 ng/ml rapamycin for 18 h. Cell extracts were analyzed for LUC and CAT activities; the LUC and CAT activities (arbitrary units) and the LUC/CAT ratio are shown; values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The regulation of CAT/cat1–224/LUC mRNA translation by amino acid starvation was studied next. Rat C6 glioma cells were transfected either with CAT/cat1–224/LUC or CAT/BiP/LUC, along with a vector expressing the neo gene, and two stable mass-culture lines, C6/pSVcat1–224 and C6/pSVBiP, were generated, each containing ∼70 clones. These cell lines were cultured either in amino acid-containing or amino acid-free media, and the effects of starvation on CAT and LUC expression were examined. As expected, the cells expressed a single mRNA transcript containing both the CAT and LUC cistrons (not shown). Amino acid starvation of C6/pSVcat1–224 cells increased the normalized LUC activity after 6 h, reaching a 7-fold increase by 12 h (Fig. 3 A, left panel). This increase was due to increased LUC and decreased CAT activities (Fig. 3, B and C, left panels). No further increase in LUC activity was observed when amino acid starvation exceeded 12 h (not shown). These data support the conclusion that cat1–224/IRES-mediated translation of the LUC cistron increased during amino acid starvation. Is this translational regulation specific for the cat1–224 IRES? This was tested by examining the effect of amino acid starvation on C6/pSVBiP cells. In contrast to C6/pSVcat1–224 cells, both CAT and LUC activities decreased in amino acid-starved C6/pSVBiP cells (Fig. 3,B and C, right panel). The normalized LUC activity increased by only 1.7-fold (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the BiP/IRES-mediated translation of the LUC cistron is more efficient than the cap-dependent translation of the CAT cistron, but four times less efficient than the cat1–224 IRES, under conditions of amino acid starvation. A striking result in these studies was that following 12 h of amino acid starvation, cap-dependent translation of the CAT cistron decreased by 70% (Fig. 3), whereas IRES-mediated translation of the LUC cistron increased by 3.5-fold. What caused the dramatic decrease of CAP-dependent translation? It is well known that heat shock, serum deprivation, and viral infection inhibit cap-dependent translation by regulating the phosphorylation state of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E (22Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1996; 16: 5450-5457Google Scholar). Reduced phosphorylation of eIF4E correlates with inhibition of cap-dependent protein synthesis (23Schneider R. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 901-914Google Scholar). We therefore compared the phosphorylation state of eIF4E in amino acid-fed and -starved cells. As a negative control, we analyzed rapamycin-treated cells, because this drug does not change eIF4E phosphorylation (23Schneider R. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 901-914Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation induced dephosphorylation of eIF4E (75% decrease), whereas total eIF4E levels remained the same (Fig. 4). As expected, rapamycin had no effect (Fig. 4). The 75% decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation paralleled the 75% decrease in cap-dependent CAT expression from the CAT/cat1–224/LUC bicistronic mRNA following 12 h of amino acid starvation (compare Figs. 3 and 4). This is consistent with the idea that phosphorylated eIF4E is a key part of the eIF4F cap-binding complex that is required for the cap-dependent initiation of translation (22Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1996; 16: 5450-5457Google Scholar). Amino acid starvation is also known to cause increased phosphorylation of the α subunit of the initiation factor eIF2 (4Pain V.M. Biochimie ( Paris ).. 1994; 76: 718-728Google Scholar). This phosphorylation results in decreased formation of ternary complexes (initiator Met-tRNA, eIF-2, and GTP). We therefore tested the phosphorylation state of eIF2α during a time course of amino acid starvation, because it has been reported that eIF2α is phosphorylated transiently in response to different stimuli by specific kinases (24Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. Mol. Cell. Biochem... 1993; 127–128: 65-255Google Scholar). An increase in phospho-eIF2α levels occurred during the first hour of amino acid starvation (3.2-fold) followed by a gradual decrease thereafter (Fig. 4 B). The increased phospho-eIF2α levels can be due to either increased total eIF2α or increased phosphorylation. To determine the degree of eIF2α phosphorylation, we determined the ratio of phospho-eIF2α/total eIF2α during the time course of amino acid starvation (Fig. 4 B). The ratio increased by 2-fold during the first hour of amino acid starvation and then decreased in a pattern similar to the changes in phospho-eIF2α levels (Fig. 4 B). We therefore conclude that eIF2α phosphorylation transiently increased in amino acid-depleted cells. Because eIF2α phosphorylation rises and then declines before any increase in LUC activity is seen, we propose that phosphorylation of eIF2α does not directly regulate cat-1/IRES activity. The IRES-mediated translation of cat-1 mRNA during amino acid starvation could enable cells to increase Cat-1 protein levels under conditions where global protein synthesis is inhibited. Asparagine synthase protein levels, analyzed as a positive control, were increased by amino acid starvation (Fig.5 A). Cat-1 protein expressed from the endogenous gene increased by 58-fold at 12 h of amino acid starvation (Fig. 5 A), whereas mRNA levels increased by only 16-fold (not shown; see Ref. 3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). The fact that the Cat-1 protein was induced to a greater extent than the mRNA supports the translational regulation of cat-1gene expression. Cat-1 protein expressed from the endogenous gene and LUC expressed from pSVCAT/cat1–224/LUC increased with similar time courses (compare Figs.3 and 5 A), indicating a parallel regulation of translation. Furthermore, a 4.5-fold increase in high affinity arginine transport was observed after 12 h of amino acid starvation (Fig.5 B), demonstrating that cells depleted of amino acids induce Cat-1 protein synthesis to support cationic amino acid transport once amino acids become available. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′UTR of the cat-1 mRNA revealed the presence of a 49-amino acid ORF (Fig. 1 A). Because ORFs within the 5′-UTR of mRNAs are almost always associated with translational control of the mRNA (25Geballe A. Sachs M. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 595-614Google Scholar), we studied the role of the ORF in the translation of the cat-1 mRNA. We studied two monocistronic mRNAs. One (cat1–224/LUC) had the cat-1 5′UTR upstream of the LUC coding sequence. The other (cat1–224mut/LUC) had the initiating AUG of the upstream ORF mutated to UUG. Both mRNAs were expressed from the minimal cytomegalovirus promoter (3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar). C6 cells were transiently transfected with one of the expression vectors along with a vector expressing the β-galactosidase gene to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and the LUC and β-galactosidase activities were measured and expressed as the LUC/β-galactosidase ratio. In amino acid-fed cells, the cat1–224mut/LUC mRNA was translated 2.8 times more efficiently than the cat1–224/LUC mRNA (Fig.6 A). These data suggest that the upstream ORF is translated in amino acid-fed cells and inhibits translation from the downstream ORF. The studies with the bicistronic vectors show that the cat-1 5′-UTR contains an IRES that participates in the regulation of translation by amino acid availability. Is there similar regulation by the cat-1 5′-UTR in a monocistronic mRNA? To answer this question, we generated C6 cell lines stably transfected with cat1–224/LUC, cat1–224mut/LUC, or a control vector containing a 5′-UTR that will result in cap-dependent translation (con/LUC). These cell lines were cultured either in amino acid-containing or amino acid-free media, and the effects of starvation on LUC expression were examined. As expected, the cells expressed a single LUC-containing mRNA. The level of cat1–224mut/LUC mNRA increased in amino acid-starved cells but only by 30% (Fig. 6 B). Amino acid starvation of C6/cat1–224/LUC cells increased LUC activity after 6 h (1.9-fold), reaching a 5.4-fold increase by 18 h (Fig. 6 C, left panel). This demonstrates that the cat-1 5′-UTR regulates translation of a downstream ORF in a monocistronic mRNA. No further increase in LUC activity was observed when amino acid starvation exceeded 18 h (not shown). We next determined the effect of amino acid starvation on the translational efficiency of the cat1–224mut/LUC mRNA. Starvation of C6/cat1–224mut/LUC cells increased LUC activity by 6 h (2-fold), reaching a maximum increase (2.7-fold) by 18 h (Fig.6 C, right panel), suggesting that the ORF is not absolutely required for the regulation of translation by amino acid starvation. This increase was lower than the 5.4-fold increase observed with the cat1–224/LUC mRNA. The 2-fold difference in the LUC activity between the wild-type and mutant 5′-UTRs suggests that the upstream ORF does contribute to the increased translation of the cat-1 mRNA during amino acid starvation. The smaller increase in translation of cat1–224mut/LUC mRNA may be due to the higher level of translation in fed cells (Fig. 6, A andC). Finally, we compared the translation of the mRNAs containing the cat-1 5′-UTR to the control mRNA (con/LUC). Amino acid starvation of the C6/con/LUC cells caused a 40% decrease in LUC activity, consistent with translation of this mRNA via a cap-dependent scanning mechanism. LUC expression from this mRNA was at least 50-fold higher than from the mRNAs with the cat-1 5′-UTR. This is consistent with inefficient initiation of translation caused by the secondary structure of the cat-1 5′-UTR mRNA. This low level of expression was seen with both the cat1–224/LUC and cat1–224mut/LUC mRNAs. Consequently, the inefficient translation initiation from these mRNAs cannot be due solely to the presence of the ORF in the 5′-UTR. This is in agreement with the inhibitory effects of IRESs within the 5′-UTR of mRNAs on cap-dependent translation initiation (26Carter M. Kuhn K. Sarnow P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 615-635Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that the 5′-UTR of the cat-1 mRNA contains an IRES sequence. Moreover, we have shown that translation from this IRES is induced by amino acid starvation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an IRES that shows this regulation. We propose that some mammalian mRNAs use IRES-mediated translation to provide cells with proteins essential for survival when the nutrient supply is limited. Among these proteins is the Cat-1 arginine/lysine transporter, which also provides cells with the substrate for NO synthesis (27Hattori Y. Kasai K. Gross S.S. Am. J. Physiol... 1999; 276: H2020-H2028Google Scholar). Expression of the cat-1gene has been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level by hormones (28Wu J.Y. Robinson D. Kung H.J. Hatzoglou M. J. Virol... 1994; 68: 1615-1623Google Scholar, 29Liu J. Hatzoglou M. Amino Acids ( Vienna ).. 1998; 15: 321-337Google Scholar), nutrients (2Hyatt S.L. Aulak K.S. Malandro M. Kilberg M.S. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 19951-19957Google Scholar, 3Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 30424-30432Google Scholar) and growth factors (30Malandro M.S. Kilberg M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1996; 65: 305-336Google Scholar, 31Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev... 1998; 78: 969-1054Google Scholar). The translational regulation reported in this study further extends the complex regulatory mechanisms that control the cell's supply of arginine and lysine. We have shown in this study that amino acid starvation caused a 50-fold increase in Cat-1 protein levels and only a 4-fold increase in y+ amino acid transport. This difference may be due to the fact that this transporter is stimulated by intracellular cationic amino acids, a property called trans-stimulation (32White M.F. Gazzola G.C. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 4443-4449Google Scholar, 33White M.F. Christensen H.N. J. Biol. Chem... 1982; 257: 4450-4457Google Scholar). Arginine transport in this study was performed in cells starved of all amino acids but lysine. We speculate that the difference between cat-1 protein levels and y+ transport in starved cells is due to low cytoplasmic cationic amino acids that cause inadequatetrans-stimulation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Cat-1 protein synthesized during amino acid starvation is not functional, because it is not properly folded or is not transported to the plasma membrane. Translational regulation by amino acid availability has also been demonstrated for the yeast transcription factor GCN4 (1Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol... 1996; 53: 219-248Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this regulation is different from the one we observed for cat-1 mRNA. Amino acid starvation increases translation of GCN4 mRNA by 8-fold by a mechanism involving cap-dependent initiation and reinitiation at the GCN4 ORF, following ribosome scanning of four small ORFs in the 5′-UTR (1Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol... 1996; 53: 219-248Google Scholar). Removal of the ORFs increased basal expression of the GCN4 mRNA by 80-fold and abolished translational control by amino acid starvation (34Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell.. 1986; 45: 201-207Google Scholar). Thus the upstream ORFs inhibit basal translation and participate in the starvation-induced stimulation. Another example of translation by induced amino acid starvation was recently reported for the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, but the mechanism of translational control was not studied (35Doering C.B. Danner D.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol... 2000; 279: C1587-C1594Google Scholar). This is the first report that nutrient supply can regulate expression of a mammalian mRNA via an IRES-mediated mechanism. What features of the cat-1 IRES enable it to recruit ribosomes and regulate translation? Computer analysis suggests that the cat-1 IRES is very structured (not shown), a general feature of other cellular and viral IRESs (26Carter M. Kuhn K. Sarnow P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 615-635Google Scholar). However, studies of other IRESs have not revealed a consensus sequence (36Gingras A.C.

S. A... 2000; 97: 1536-1541Google Scholar). In fact, segments as short as 9 nucleotides may have independent IRES activity or affect the activity of the IRES in which they occur (37Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 1536-1541Google Scholar). The fact that amino acid depletion induced translation mediated by the cat1–224/IRES four times more than the BiP/IRES suggests that the cat1/IRES has special features that support enhancement of translation during starvation. The residues within the cat-1 IRES that are important in translational regulation will be the focus of future studies. What is the role of the 49-amino acid ORF in the cat-1 5′-UTR? A general feature of IRESs is the presence of ORFs (26Carter M. Kuhn K. Sarnow P. Sonenberg N. Hershey J. Mathews M. Translational Control of Gene Expression.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. 2000; : 615-635Google Scholar). It is believed that the ORFs are present within the IRES to inhibit cap-dependent translation. Our studies of the wild-type and mutant mRNAs have shown that the cat-1 ORF inhibits translation. This is in agreement with the very low levels of Cat-1 protein in amino acid-fed cells (Fig. 5). Amino acid starvation increased translation of monocistronic mRNAs containing the cat-1 5′-UTR whether they contained the 49-amino acid ORF, consistent with the idea that the regulation does not depend on the presence of the ORF. However, the extent of induction was 2-fold greater in the ORF-containing mRNA (Fig. 6 C). This could reflect a change in the regulation by amino acid starvation. Alternatively, it could be due to the fact that there is greater cap-dependent translation from the mutant than from the wild-type 5′-UTR. This translation will be inhibited by amino acid-starvation, causing a decrease in the overall induction seen with this construct. This is in agreement with the 3.5-fold induction of the LUC activity in the bicistronic mRNA, where the LUC cistron was translated exclusively by the IRES. Future studies will determine the mechanism (cap-dependent or IRES-mediated) via which the cat-1 mRNA is translated in amino acid-fed and -starved cells. Using the bicistronic mRNA system, we have shown that translation mediated by the ORF-containing cat-1/IRES increased 3.5-fold (Fig.3 C). Is the ORF translated within the bicistronic mRNA? Translation of the 49-amino acid ORF might occur either by reinitiation of cap-dependent translation of the first cistron or by initiation at the IRES at or before the AUG of the ORF. Using the hpCAT/cat1–224/LUC bicistronic mRNA, we have shown that the cat-1/IRES activity is independent of the cap-dependent translation of the first cistron (Fig. 2). Consequently if this 49-amino acid ORF is translated this must occur by initiation within the IRES. The structure of the cat-1 IRES and its role in the regulation of translation initiation by amino acid starvation will be the subject of future studies. The cellular proteins that interact with the IRESs and modulate translation are not known. We have shown that during amino acid starvation, cat-1 IRES-mediated translation increased, whereas cap-dependent translation decreased. The increased phosphorylation levels of eIF2α may contribute to the IRES-mediated stimulation of cat-1expression in starved cells. The inhibition of cap-dependent translation may also be due to changes in the activity of the cap binding complex, eIF4F. We showed that amino acid starvation decreased the amount of phosphorylated eIF4E, a component of eIF4F and a regulator of its activity (36Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar). However, eIF4E may not play a role in the increased translation from the cat-1 IRES. We showed that rapamycin, which reduces the amount of active eIF4E, caused an 80% decrease in cap-dependent protein synthesis but did not induce IRES-mediated translation, consistent with previous findings (38Johannes G. Carter M.S. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Sarnow P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 13118-13123Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the increased activity of the cat-1 IRES in amino acid-starved cells is due to the synthesis or activation of regulatory proteins. The 3-h lag in the increase of cat1–224/IRES-mediated translation in amino acid-deficient cells may represent the time required for synthesis or modification of protein(s) that interact with the IRES and/or the recruited ribosomes. In fact, cellular IRES-binding proteins have been shown to control the functional state of viral IRESs (14Pilipenko E.V. Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Khitrina E.V. Poperechnaya A.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 2028-2045Google Scholar). The elucidation of these regulatory mechanisms will be of great importance in our understanding of cell responses to nutritional stress. Nuclear proteins have also been implicated in IRES-mediated translation (36Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar). A few nuclear RNA-binding proteins, such as the polypyrimidine tract and poly(rC)-binding proteins, have been shown to enhance IRES-mediated translation (36Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1999; 68: 913-963Google Scholar, 39Blyn L.B. Swiderek K.M. Richards O. Stahl D.C. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 11115-11120Google Scholar). The cat-1 IRES contains three pyrimidine tracts (−47, −111, and −183, relative to the cat-1 ORF; see Fig. 1) that may bind to pyrimidine tract-binding proteins. IRES-mediated translation in mammals has also been described for viral mRNAs (5Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA.. 1995; 1: 985-1000Google Scholar) in infected cells where cap-dependent translation is inhibited. It is likely that these viral mRNAs are translated using a normal cellular mechanism that is activated by infection. Interestingly, the Cat-1 protein is the receptor for the type C ecotropic retrovirus (40Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature.. 1991; 352: 729-731Google Scholar, 41Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature.. 1991; 352: 725-728Google Scholar), whose mRNAs are translated via an IRES-dependent mechanism (42Deffaud C. Darlix J.L. J. Virol... 2000; 74: 846-850Google Scholar). Based on the common regulatory elements in the mRNAs of the type C ecotropic retrovirus and its receptor, Cat-1, it is intriguing to speculate on their coevolution. We thank Drs. B. Bode, W.

DC-HIL is a type I transmembrane protein that contains a heparin-binding motif and an integrin-recognition motif, RGD, in its extracellular domain (ECD). A soluble fusion protein (DC-HIL-Fc) of the ECD and an immunoglobulin Fc bound to the surface of an endothelial cell line (SVEC). This binding induced adhesion of SVEC to its immobilized form.

By contrast, an integrin inhibitor (RGDS tetramer) had no effect on binding to SVEC, but prevented adhesion of SVEC. This differential RGD requirement was confirmed by the finding that DC-HIL-Fc mutant lacking the RGD motif can bind to SVEC but is unable to induce adhesion of SVEC. Furthermore, DC-HIL appears to recognize directly these sulfated polysaccharides. These results suggest that DC-HIL binds to SVEC by recognizing heparan sulfate proteoglycans on endothelial cells, thereby inducing adhesion of SVEC in an RGD-dependent manner.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar). DC are distinguished from other APC (e.g.macrophages and B cells) by an unsurpassed potency in presenting antigens to naive T cells, thereby most efficiently initiating primary T cell-mediated immune responses (1Steinman R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar). DC are widely distributed but comprise only a minuscule fraction (typically <5%) of the total cell population of a given peripheral tissue. After capturing antigens, tissue DC undergo maturation, losing endocytic capacity but acquiring increased immunostimulatory capacity (2Jonuleit H. Knop J. Enk A.H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 289: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). During maturation, DC migrate from peripheral tissues to T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs where they activate T cells (2Jonuleit H. Knop J. Enk A.H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 289: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3van Wilsem E.J.G. Breve J. Kleijmeer M. Kraal G. J. Inv.

Thus, DC migration is a critical step in initiating antigen-specific immune responses.Several adhesion molecules (e.g. cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (5Strunk D. Egger C. Leitner G. Hanau D. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/CD11a (6Ma J. Wang J.H. Guo Y. Sy M.S. Bigby M.

Nature. 1993; 361: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and α6 integrins (9Price A.A. Cumberbatch M. Kimber I. Ager A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) regulate the migration of DC through the entire life cycle. For example, blood-circulating precursors of Langerhans cells (LC), which are DC that reside in epidermis, attach to the blood vessel wall prior to initiating transendothelial migration into the epidermis where they develop into APC with phenotypes distinct from other members of the DC family. The LC homing and anchoring in the epidermis are probably controlled by lymphocyte-associated antigen (5Strunk D. Egger C. Leitner G. Hanau D. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and E-cadherin (8Tang A. Amagai M. Granger L.G. Stanley J.R. Udey M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), respectively. Conversely, after antigenic stimulation, LC dissociate from surrounding keratinocytes by down-regulating E-cadherin expression (8Tang A. Amagai M. Granger L.G. Stanley J.R. Udey M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 10Udey M.C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar), then adhere via α6 integrins to the basement membrane (9Price A.A. Cumberbatch M. Kimber I. Ager A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with subsequent passage into the dermis, where they re-enter the afferent lymphatics or blood vessels. This endothelial migration is essential for completion of the DC life cycle. Despite this importance, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the adhesion of DC to endothelial cells.Study on the unique properties of DC at molecular levels has been hampered by the paucity of DC within tissues and the relative difficulty in maintaining their viability ex vivo. To overcome this problem, we have previously established long-lived DC lines, designated XS series, derived from the skin of newborn BALB/c mice (11Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). These XS cells retain many important features of LC, including their morphology, surface phenotype (B7–2, major histocompatibility class II, CD11b, ICAM-1, CD49d/e, and E-cadherin), responsiveness to cytokines, expression of cytokines and their receptors, and potent APC function (11Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xu S. Ariizumi K. Edelbaum D. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Having these cell lines, our goal is to illuminate the molecular properties that distinguish DC/LC from other APC, and our principal strategy has been to identify and define genes and gene products expressed selectively by DC and LC. We have previously isolated five novel molecules using a subtractive cDNA cloning method in which the cDNA library prepared from the XS52 DC line was subtracted with mRNA isolated from the J774 macrophage line. Two of these molecules, termed dectin-1 and dectin-2, are expressed selectively by XS52 DC (13Ariizumi K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 417: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). They are type II transmembrane glycoproteins that belong to the Ca2+-dependent (C-type) lectin superfamily and may serve as costimulatory molecules that are required for efficient activation of T cells by DC. We now focus on the third gene, originally designated as 2B4, which encodes a type I transmembrane protein that can function as a ligand for integrins most likely through recognition of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) abundantly expressed on endothelial cell surfaces (14Cavari S. Vannucchi S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on its expression pattern and function, we have renamed this molecule DC-associated, HSPG-dependent integrin ligand (DC-HIL). Here we report its structural, biochemical, and functional properties and discuss its potential roles in DC-endothelial cell adhesion.DISCUSSIONIn searching for DC-specific genes that provide unique properties of DC, a number of DC-specific or -associated, novel molecules have been identified, e.g. DC-SIGN (43Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), Langerin (44Valladeau J. Ravel O. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Moore K. Kleijmeer M. Liu Y. Duvert-Frances V. Vincent C. Schmitt D. Davoust J. Caux C. Lebecque S. Saeland S. Immunity. 2000; 12: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and DC-LAMP (31de Saint-Vis B. Vincent J. Vandenabeele S. Vanbervliet B. Pin J.J. Ait-Yahia S. Patel S. Mattei M.G. Banchereau J. Zurawski S. Davoust J. Caux C. Lebecque S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In fact, functional studies on these molecules demonstrated that they are involved in establishing distinct properties of DC. In addition to dectin-1 and dectin-2, we added to the current list of DC-associated molecules a new member, termed DC-HIL, that may contribute to unique mechanisms for transendothelial migration of DC.DC-HIL showed significant homologies with melanoma/melanosome-associated membrane proteins and lower degree with members of the LAMP family (Fig. 2). In addition, its structural and biochemical features are also in accordance with these membrane protein families, which include: 1) a proline-rich hinge region containing numerous O-glycans, 2) highly N-glycosylated forms, 3) lysosomal targeting motifs, 4) a tyrosine-based signaling motif in a cytoplasmic tail, 5) high accumulation in a perinuclear region (Fig. 6) (28Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and 6) relatively low expression on the cell surface (Fig. 5) (45Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 47Ramprasad M.P. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 93: 14833-14838Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because DC do not have melanosomes, we speculate that DC-HIL may be a newly identified member of the LAMP family and may play roles in the intracellular events.In this study we focused on characterizing the function of the ECD rather than the intracellular domain of DC-HIL. The ECD contains an RGD motif and a heparin-binding motif, both of which are frequently found in adhesion molecules, leading us to hypothesize a role as an adhesion molecule. Using the recombinant fusion protein DC-HIL-Fc, we found two independent functions. The soluble form of DC-HIL-Fc binds to limited cell types, including EC, and the immobilized form of DC-HIL-Fc promotes adhesion of SVEC. In further studies, we demonstrated that: 1) binding of DC-HIL to cells is inhibited by heparin and fucoidan; 2) DC-HIL recognizes heparin and fucoidan; 3) SVEC adhesion to immobilized forms absolutely requires RGD recognition; and 4) the adhesion is induced by the recognition of HSPG. Based on these findings, we propose dual roles of DC-HIL: first, recognition of HSPG, which functions to specify the target cells; second, a ligand for integrins, which mediates an RGD-dependent cell adhesion only when DC-HIL binds to cells. Although it is unclear at present how the interaction of DC-HIL and HSPG on EC induces an RGD-dependent cell adhesion, two possible molecular models are considered: First, the interaction activates integrins expressed on SVEC, resulting in recognition of the RGD. Second, the interaction induces conformational changes of DC-HIL, thereby exposing the cryptic RGD sequence, as suggested for von Willebrand factor and thrombospondin (48Denis C. Williams J.A. Lu X. Meyer D. Baruch D. Blood. 1993; 82: 3622-3630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required for determining which model accounts for the DC-HIL-induced cell adhesion.This working model shares some features with the two-step adhesion cascade for neutrophil/EC interactions, in which the primary adhesion involves three members of selectin family and their oligosaccharide ligands. Subsequently, secondary adhesion involves β2 (CD18) integrins on neutrophils and immunoglobulin gene superfamily counter-receptors on EC, primarily ICAM-1 (37Smith C.W. Rothlein R. Hughes B.J. Mariscalco M.M. Rudloff H.E. Schmalstieg F.C. Anderson D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, DC-HIL-mediated adhesion differs from this two-step model in that DC-HIL serves also as one of the counter-receptors for integrins. In this respect, DC-HIL is distinguishable from other adhesion molecules on the cell surface: e.g. Thy-1, Ly-5, and NCAM are all capable of interacting with heparin (50Parish C.R. Hogarth P.M. McKenzie I.F. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1988; 66: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 51Hueber A.O. Pierres M. He H.T. J.

Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), whereas they do not function as ligands for integrins. This feature of DC-HIL may exemplify that DC display not only common but also unique mechanisms for their transendothelial migration.Heparan sulfate, as products of the enzymatic degradation of HSPG, is rapidly released from cell surface and extracellular matrices under conditions of inflammation and tissue damages (53Wrenshall L.E. Stevens R.B. Cerra F.B. Platt J.L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 54Wrenshall L.E. Cerra F.B. Singh R.K. Platt J.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 871-880PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this heparan sulfate has been demonstrated to induce phenotypic as well as functional maturation of DC characterized by enhanced surface expression of major histocompatibility class II, CD80 (B7–1), and CD86 (B7–2), lowered rate of antigen uptake, and increased allostimulatory capacity (55Kodaira Y. Nair S.K. Wrenshall L.E. Gilboa E. Platt J.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although it is not defined how heparan sulfate induces maturation signals to DC, direct binding of heparan sulfate to its putative receptors on DC is thought to be one of the most possible mechanisms. Because a toll-like receptor, which is expressed on DC, binds to peptidoglycan, including lipopolysaccharide and heparan sulfate (56Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 57Ihrcke N.S. Platt J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), this receptor is proposed to be a candidate responsible for inducing maturation signals. It is thus tempting to propose that DC-HIL is a second candidate for such a receptor, which may transduce maturation signals to DC via the residues ITAM on its cytoplasmic tail.We were unable to block adhesion of XS52 DC to SVEC by pretreatment of SVEC with DC-HIL-Fc even at 75 μg/ml (data not shown). Because our anti-DC-HIL antibody does not recognize proteins expressed on the cell surface of XS52 DC (probably the epitope for the Ab is cryptic in the molecule), we have not examined blocking of SVEC adhesion by Ab. Successful blocking may require antibodies reactive with the DC-HIL proteins on cell surface. It thus remains uncertain to which extent DC-HIL contributes to the DC/EC adhesion under physiological conditions. Nevertheless, DC-HIL is potentially involved in endothelial adhesion of DC, and its preferential expression of the protein in DC suggests that it plays critical roles in the unique mechanisms for DC migration. Dendritic cells (DCs1) are a member of antigen-presenting cells (APC) family, which are characterized morphologically by the extension of long, lamellar dendrites (1Steinman R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar). DC are distinguished from other APC (e.g.macrophages and B cells) by an unsurpassed potency in presenting antigens to naive T cells, thereby most efficiently initiating primary T cell-mediated immune responses (1Steinman R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 271-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar). DC are widely distributed but comprise only a minuscule fraction (typically <5%) of the total cell population of a given peripheral tissue. After capturing antigens, tissue DC undergo maturation, losing endocytic capacity but acquiring increased immunostimulatory capacity (2Jonuleit H. Knop J. Enk A.H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 289: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). During maturation, DC migrate from peripheral tissues to T cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs where they activate T cells (2Jonuleit H. Knop J. Enk A.H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 289: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3van Wilsem E.J.G. Breve J. Kleijmeer M. Kraal G. J. Inv.

Thus, DC migration is a critical step in initiating antigen-specific immune responses. Several adhesion molecules (e.g. cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (5Strunk D. Egger C. Leitner G.

Med. 1997; 186: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) regulate the migration of DC through the entire life cycle. For example, blood-circulating precursors of Langerhans cells (LC), which are DC that reside in epidermis, attach to the blood vessel wall prior to initiating transendothelial migration into the epidermis where they develop into APC with phenotypes distinct from other members of the DC family. The LC homing and anchoring in the epidermis are probably controlled by lymphocyte-associated antigen (5Strunk D. Egger C. Leitner G. Hanau D. Stingl G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and E-cadherin (8Tang A. Amagai M. Granger L.G. Stanley J.R. Udey M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), respectively. Conversely, after antigenic stimulation, LC dissociate from surrounding keratinocytes by down-regulating E-cadherin expression (8Tang A. Amagai M. Granger L.G. Stanley J.R. Udey M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 10Udey M.C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar), then adhere via α6 integrins to the basement membrane (9Price A.A. Cumberbatch M. Kimber I. Ager A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with subsequent passage into the dermis, where they re-enter the afferent lymphatics or blood vessels. This endothelial migration is essential for completion of the DC life cycle. Despite this importance, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the adhesion of DC to endothelial cells. Study on the unique properties of DC at molecular levels has been hampered by the paucity of DC within tissues and the relative difficulty in maintaining their viability ex vivo. To overcome this problem, we have previously established long-lived DC lines, designated XS series, derived from the skin of newborn BALB/c mice (11Xu S. Ariizumi K. Caceres-Dittmar G. Edelbaum D. Hashimoto K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2697-2705PubMed Google Scholar). These XS cells retain many important features of LC, including their morphology, surface phenotype (B7–2, major histocompatibility class II, CD11b, ICAM-1, CD49d/e, and E-cadherin), responsiveness to cytokines, expression of cytokines and their receptors, and potent APC function (11Xu S.

Takashima A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1018-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Having these cell lines, our goal is to illuminate the molecular properties that distinguish DC/LC from other APC, and our principal strategy has been to identify and define genes and gene products expressed selectively by DC and LC. We have previously isolated five novel molecules using a subtractive cDNA cloning method in which the cDNA library prepared from the XS52 DC line was subtracted with mRNA isolated from the J774 macrophage line. Two of these molecules, termed dectin-1 and dectin-2, are expressed selectively by XS52 DC (13Ariizumi K. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 417: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). They are type II transmembrane glycoproteins that belong to the Ca2+-dependent (C-type) lectin superfamily and may serve as costimulatory molecules that are required for efficient activation of T cells by DC. We now focus on the third gene, originally designated as 2B4, which encodes a type I transmembrane protein that can function as a ligand for integrins most likely through recognition of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) abundantly expressed on endothelial cell surfaces (14Cavari S. Vannucchi S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on its expression pattern and function, we have renamed this molecule DC-associated, HSPG-dependent integrin ligand (DC-HIL). Here we report its structural, biochemical, and functional properties and discuss its potential roles in DC-endothelial cell adhesion. DISCUSSIONIn searching for DC-specific genes that provide unique properties of DC, a number of DC-specific or -associated, novel molecules have been identified, e.g. DC-SIGN (43Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar), Langerin (44Valladeau J. Ravel O. Dezutter-Dambuyant C. Moore K. Kleijmeer M. Liu Y. Duvert-Frances V. Vincent C. Schmitt D. Davoust J. Caux C. Lebecque S. Saeland S. Immunity. 2000; 12: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and DC-LAMP (31de Saint-Vis B. Vincent J. Vandenabeele S. Vanbervliet B. Pin J.J. Ait-Yahia S. Patel S. Mattei M.G. Banchereau J. Zurawski S. Davoust J. Caux C. Lebecque S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In fact, functional studies on these molecules demonstrated that they are involved in establishing distinct properties of DC. In addition to dectin-1 and dectin-2, we added to the current list of DC-associated molecules a new member, termed DC-HIL, that may contribute to unique mechanisms for transendothelial migration of DC.DC-HIL showed significant homologies with melanoma/melanosome-associated membrane proteins and lower degree with members of the LAMP family (Fig. 2). In addition, its structural and biochemical features are also in accordance with these membrane protein families, which include: 1) a proline-rich hinge region containing numerous O-glycans, 2) highly N-glycosylated forms, 3) lysosomal targeting motifs, 4) a tyrosine-based signaling motif in a cytoplasmic tail, 5) high accumulation in a perinuclear region (Fig. 6) (28Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and 6) relatively low expression on the cell surface (Fig. 5) (45Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M.

A. 2000; 93: 14833-14838Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because DC do not have melanosomes, we speculate that DC-HIL may be a newly identified member of the LAMP family and may play roles in the intracellular events.In this study we focused on characterizing the function of the ECD rather than the intracellular domain of DC-HIL. The ECD contains an RGD motif and a heparin-binding motif, both of which are frequently found in adhesion molecules, leading us to hypothesize a role as an adhesion molecule. Using the recombinant fusion protein DC-HIL-Fc, we found two independent functions. The soluble form of DC-HIL-Fc binds to limited cell types, including EC, and the immobilized form of DC-HIL-Fc promotes adhesion of SVEC. In further studies, we demonstrated that: 1) binding of DC-HIL to cells is inhibited by heparin and fucoidan; 2) DC-HIL recognizes heparin and fucoidan; 3) SVEC adhesion to immobilized forms absolutely requires RGD recognition; and 4) the adhesion is induced by the recognition of HSPG. Based on these findings, we propose dual roles of DC-HIL: first, recognition of HSPG, which functions to specify the target cells; second, a ligand for integrins, which mediates an RGD-dependent cell adhesion only when DC-HIL binds to cells. Although it is unclear at present how the interaction of DC-HIL and HSPG on EC induces an RGD-dependent cell adhesion, two possible molecular models are considered: First, the interaction activates integrins expressed on SVEC, resulting in recognition of the RGD. Second, the interaction induces conformational changes of DC-HIL, thereby exposing the cryptic RGD sequence, as suggested for von Willebrand factor and thrombospondin (48Denis C. Williams J.A. Lu X. Meyer D. Baruch D. Blood. 1993; 82: 3622-3630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required for determining which model accounts for the DC-HIL-induced cell adhesion.This working model shares some features with the two-step adhesion cascade for neutrophil/EC interactions, in which the primary adhesion involves three members of selectin family and their oligosaccharide ligands. Subsequently, secondary adhesion involves β2 (CD18) integrins on neutrophils and immunoglobulin gene superfamily counter-receptors on EC, primarily ICAM-1 (37Smith C.W. Rothlein R. Hughes B.J. Mariscalco M.M. Rudloff H.E. Schmalstieg F.C. Anderson D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1746-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, DC-HIL-mediated adhesion differs from this two-step model in that DC-HIL serves also as one of the counter-receptors for integrins. In this respect, DC-HIL is distinguishable from other adhesion molecules on the cell surface: e.g. Thy-1, Ly-5, and NCAM are all capable of interacting with heparin (50Parish C.R. Hogarth P.M. McKenzie I.F. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1988; 66: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 51Hueber A.O. Pierres M. He H.T. J.

Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), whereas they do not function as ligands for integrins. This feature of DC-HIL may exemplify that DC display not only common but also unique mechanisms for their transendothelial migration.Heparan sulfate, as products of the enzymatic degradation of HSPG, is rapidly released from cell surface and extracellular matrices under conditions of inflammation and tissue damages (53Wrenshall L.E. Stevens R.B. Cerra F.B. Platt J.L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 54Wrenshall L.E. Cerra F.B. Singh R.K. Platt J.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 871-880PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, this heparan sulfate has been demonstrated to induce phenotypic as well as functional maturation of DC characterized by enhanced surface expression of major histocompatibility class II, CD80 (B7–1), and CD86 (B7–2), lowered rate of antigen uptake, and increased allostimulatory capacity (55Kodaira Y. Nair S.K. Wrenshall L.E. Gilboa E. Platt J.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although it is not defined how heparan sulfate induces maturation signals to DC, direct binding of heparan sulfate to its putative receptors on DC is thought to be one of the most possible mechanisms. Because a toll-like receptor, which is expressed on DC, binds to peptidoglycan, including lipopolysaccharide and heparan sulfate (56Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 57Ihrcke N.S. Platt J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), this receptor is proposed to be a candidate responsible for inducing maturation signals. It is thus tempting to propose that DC-HIL is a second candidate for such a receptor, which may transduce maturation signals to DC via the residues ITAM on its cytoplasmic tail.We were unable to block adhesion of XS52 DC to SVEC by pretreatment of SVEC with DC-HIL-Fc even at 75 μg/ml (data not shown). Because our anti-DC-HIL antibody does not recognize proteins expressed on the cell surface of XS52 DC (probably the epitope for the Ab is cryptic in the molecule), we have not examined blocking of SVEC adhesion by Ab. Successful blocking may require antibodies reactive with the DC-HIL proteins on cell surface. It thus remains uncertain to which extent DC-HIL contributes to the DC/EC adhesion under physiological conditions. Nevertheless, DC-HIL is potentially involved in endothelial adhesion of DC, and its preferential expression of the protein in DC suggests that it plays critical roles in the unique mechanisms for DC migration. In searching for DC-specific genes that provide unique properties of DC, a number of DC-specific or -associated, novel molecules have been identified, e.g. DC-SIGN (43Geijtenbeek T.B.

https://openalex.org/W1975479233,"Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores activates capacitative Ca2+influx in smooth muscle cells, but the native store-operated channels that mediate such influx remain unidentified. Recently we demonstrated that calcium influx factor produced by yeast and human platelets with depleted Ca2+ stores activates small conductance cation channels in excised membrane patches from vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). Here we characterize these channels in intact cells and present evidence that they belong to the class of store-operated channels, which are activated upon passive depletion of Ca2+ stores. Application of thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, to individual SMC activated single 3-pS cation channels in cell-attached membrane patches. Channels remained active when inside-out membrane patches were excised from the cells. Excision of membrane patches from resting SMC did not by itself activate the channels. Load-ing SMC with BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), which slowly depletes Ca2+ stores without a rise in intracellular Ca2+, activated the same 3-pS channels in cell-attached membrane patches as well as whole cell nonselective cation currents in SMC. TG- and BAPTA-activated 3-pS channels were cation-selective but poorly discriminated among Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Na+, K+, and Cs+. Open channel probability did not change at negative membrane potentials but increased significantly at high positive potentials. Activation of 3-pS channels did not depend on intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Neither TG nor a variety of second messengers (including Ca2+, InsP3, InsP4, GTPγS, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, ATP, and ADP) activated 3-pS channels in inside-out membrane patches. Thus, 3-pS nonselective cation channels are present and activated by TG or BAPTA-induced depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in intact SMC. These native store-operated cation channels can account for capacitative Ca2+ influx in SMC and can play an important role in regulation of vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W27172419,"Adaptive mutation is an induced response to environmental stress in which mutation rates rise, producing permanent genetic changes that can adapt cells to stress. This contrasts with neo-Darwinian views of genetic change rates blind to environmental conditions. DNA amplification is a flexible, reversible genomic change that has long been postulated to be adaptive. We report the discovery of adaptive amplification at the lac operon in Escherichia coli. Additionally, we find that adaptive amplification is separate from, and does not lead to, adaptive point mutation. This contradicts a prevailing alternative hypothesis whereby adaptive mutation is normal mutability in amplified DNA. Instead, adaptive mutation and amplification are parallel routes of inducible genetic instability allowing rapid evolution under stress, and escape from growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2060742355,"The mechanisms of transcriptional activation in heterochromatin were investigated by using FISH to directly visualize changes in chromatin organization during activation of a heterochromatic λ5 transgene. A DNase I hypersensitive site was shown to relocate the transgene to the outside of the pericentromeric heterochromatin complex in the absence of transcription. Activation of transcription, which is dependent on the transcription factor EBF, occurs in a stochastic manner that resembles telomeric silencing in yeast, with the transcribed gene remaining closely associated with the heterochromatin complex. Reducing the dosage of EBF results in a reduced frequency of localization of the transgene to the outside of the heterochromatin complex and lower levels of transcription. These data provide evidence that transcription factors can initiate changes in higher order chromatin structure during the earliest stages of gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W1972424044,"A high proportion of human breast cancers, in contrast with normal mammary tissue, express the intracellular tyrosine kinase BRK. BRK expression enhances the mitogenic response of mammary epithelial cells to epidermal growth factor, and conferment of a proliferative advantage through this mechanism may account for the frequent elevation of BRK expression in tumours. Here we report that BRK expression in mammary epithelial cells, at pathologically relevant levels, results in an enhanced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor-related receptor erbB3 in response to epidermal growth factor. As a consequence, erbB3 recruits increased levels of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and this is associated with a potentiated activation of Akt. This effect of BRK on the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt activity may account for BRK's ability to enhance mammary cell mitogenesis, and raises the possibility that breast tumours expressing BRK may acquire a resistance to pro-apoptotic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2117737431,"Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen through integrin αIIbβ3 triggers actin rearrangements and cell spreading. Mice deficient in the SLP-76 adapter molecule bleed excessively, and their platelets spread poorly on fibrinogen. Here we used human platelets and a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system to better define the role of SLP-76 in αIIbβ3 signaling. CHO cell adhesion to fibrinogen required αIIbβ3 and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76. SLP-76 phosphorylation required coexpression of Syk tyrosine kinase and stimulated association of SLP-76 with the adapter, Nck, and with the Rac exchange factor, Vav1. SLP-76 expression increased lamellipodia formation induced by Syk and Vav1 in adherent CHO cells (p < 0.001). Although lamellipodia formation requires Rac, SLP-76 functioned downstream of Rac by potentiating adhesion-dependent activation of PAK kinase (p < 0.001), a Rac effector that associates with Nck. In platelets, adhesion to fibrinogen stimulated the association of SLP-76 with the SLAP-130 adapter and with VASP, a SLAP-130 binding partner implicated in actin reorganization. Furthermore, SLAP-130 colocalized with VASP at the periphery of spread platelets. Thus, SLP-76 functions to relay signals from αIIbβ3 to effectors of cytoskeletal reorganization. Therefore, deficient recruitment of specific adapters and effectors to sites of adhesion may explain the integrin phenotype of SLP-76−/− platelets. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen through integrin αIIbβ3 triggers actin rearrangements and cell spreading.

Although lamellipodia formation requires Rac, SLP-76 functioned downstream of Rac by potentiating adhesion-dependent activation of PAK kinase (p < 0.001), a Rac effector that associates with Nck. In platelets, adhesion to fibrinogen stimulated the association of SLP-76 with the SLAP-130 adapter and with VASP, a SLAP-130 binding partner implicated in actin reorganization. Furthermore, SLAP-130 colocalized with VASP at the periphery of spread platelets. Thus, SLP-76 functions to relay signals from αIIbβ3 to effectors of cytoskeletal reorganization. Therefore, deficient recruitment of specific adapters and effectors to sites of adhesion may explain the integrin phenotype of SLP-76−/− platelets. extracellular matrix bovine serum albumin phorbol myristate acetate radioimmune precipitation assay buffer Chinese hamster ovary cells focal adhesion kinase Integrins were originally identified as adhesion receptors for extracellular matrix proteins (ECM),1 but these αβ transmembrane heterodimers also transmit information into the cell. This process, referred to as “outside-in signaling,” promotes anchorage-dependent cellular responses including motility, growth, differentiation, and survival (1Giancotti F. Ruoshlati E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Most integrin α and β cytoplasmic tails consist of 20–70 amino acid residues and are devoid of enzymatic activity, implying that outside-in signals are transmitted by integrin-associated proteins. Several transmembrane proteins can interact with the extracellular domains of integrins, but attention has focused on proteins that interact with integrin cytoplasmic tails (2Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar,3Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These include α-actinin and talin, cytoskeletal proteins that link integrins to actin filaments (4Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Cell attachment to the ECM causes lateral clustering of integrin heterodimers into oligomers and evidence is accumulating that outside-in signaling is triggered, in part, by the co-clustering of integrin-associated adapters, enzymes and substrates into signaling complexes that localize within and modify the actin cytoskeleton (1Giancotti F. Ruoshlati E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 4Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

This model is directly relevant to integrin αIIbβ3 signaling in blood platelets. αIIbβ3 is a receptor for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor that mediates platelet aggregation and spreading on vascular ECM (6Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These responses are accompanied by major changes in platelet morphology and in organization of the actin cytoskeleton. For example, platelet attachment to fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor is accompanied by progressive actin polymerization, filopodial and lamellipodial extension, and eventually full spreading (7Nachmias V.T. Golla R. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.-D. Shattil S.J.

Recent work has identified at least three sets of signaling responses triggered by ligand binding to αIIbβ3 that potentially mediate these changes. One, detectable within seconds of cell attachment, involves tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Syk protein tyrosine kinase (10Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Bolen J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 46: 28859-28864Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The others are detectable only after 30–120 s and involve tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the FAK tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of the integrin β3 tail (11Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 12Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to phosphorylation of FAK and β3, Syk phosphorylation and activation are unaffected by blockade of actin filament barbed ends by cytochalasin D, suggesting that actin polymerization is not required. In fact, two of the most prominent Syk substrates in platelets, Vav1 and SLP-76, may function to promote actin polymerization downstream of αIIbβ3. Vav1 is an hematopoietic cell-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for cdc42 and Rac (13Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound forms of cdc42 and Rac promote filopodial and lamellipodial extension, respectively (14Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). SLP-76, the focus of the present work, is an hematopoietic cell-specific adapter protein that contains an N-terminal SAM domain, several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a central proline-rich region and a C-terminal SH2 domain (Fig.1). Studies in lymphoid cells indicate that three phosphotyrosines in SLP-76 (Y113, Y128, and Y145) are required for interactions with the SH2 domains of Vav1 and Nck (15Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar,16Wardenburg J.B. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of potential relevance to αIIbβ3signaling, Nck is an adapter that can influence cytoskeletal events by recruiting a Rac effector, the PAK1 serine-threonine kinase, to plasma membrane adhesion sites (17Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region of SLP-76 interacts with the SH3 domain of Gads, a Grb2-like adapter (18Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of SLP-76 interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated SLAP-130 (19da Silva A.J. Li Z. de Vera C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because all of these SLP-76 binding partners are present in platelets, SLP-76 might be in a pivotal position to transmit αIIbβ3 signals to the cytoskeleton. Consistent with this hypothesis, SLP-76-deficient mice exhibit a bleeding diathesis and defects in platelet function, including reduced spreading on fibrinogen. Retroviral reconstitution of SLP-76−/− bone marrow cells with SLP-76 corrects these platelet defects (23Judd B.A. Myung P.S. Leng L. Obergfell A. Pear W.S. Shattil S.J. Koretzky G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, the present study was carried out to determine more precisely the role of SLP-76 in outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling. Using a CHO cell model system and human platelets, we show here that SLP-76 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in fibrinogen-adherent cells in an αIIbβ3 and Syk-dependent manner. Furthermore, SLP-76 enhances lamellipodia formation triggered by an outside-in signaling pathway that involves αIIbβ3, Syk, Vav, and Rac. Whereas SLP-76 does not affect Rac activation, it does enhance adhesion-dependent activation of PAK. Moreover, through its interactions with SLAP-130, SLP-76 may help to localize VASP to αIIbβ3 adhesion sites at the edges of spreading platelets. Thus, SLP-76 functions to relay signals from αIIbβ3 to actin. Monoclonal antibodies: anti-Syk (4D10) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

Subconfluent cells in 100 mm dishes were transfected with up to 4 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. When necessary, pcDNA3 was added to maintain equal amounts of DNA in all transfections. Twenty-four hours later, the concentration of fetal calf serum was lowered from 10 to 0.5%, and cells were cultured for an additional 24 h before use in functional assays. A5 cell transfectants were resuspended using trypsin-EDTA, washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, resuspended to 3 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 45 min with 20 μm cyclohexamide. To test the effects of binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3, cells were incubated for an additional 15 min with 250 μg/ml fibrinogen, in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 (to activate integrins) or 10 μm Integrilin or 0.5 mm EDTA (to inhibit ligand binding to αIIbβ3) (29Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 10 min in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 Mm leupeptin, 0.25 mg/ml Pefabloc, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, clarified by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (27Miranti C.

For studies of cells adherent to fibrinogen, bacterial tissue culture plates were precoated with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 100 μg/ml fibrinogen. After blocking for 2 h at room temperature with heat-denatured BSA, 4.5 × 106 cells in 1.5 ml were added to each plate and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After 60 min, nonadherent cells from the BSA plates were sedimented at 14,000 rpm for 3 s in a microcentrifuge and lysed immediately in RIPA buffer. Cells adherent to fibrinogen were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on the plates directly, and then processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. When coprecipitation of two or more proteins was being assessed, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and inhibitors. Equal amounts of each lysate, typically 250–500 μg of protein in 500 μl, were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose (27Miranti C.

Membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk and probed with the indicated primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots were scanned in a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 5300C scanner, and labeled bands were quantified by calibrated densitometry using NIH Image software. Endogenous PAK was immunoprecipitated from Nonidet P-40 lysates and PAK kinase activity was determined using an in gel kinase assay with myelin basic protein as substrate (24Del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Active Rac was monitored using a pull-down assay involving a recombinant fragment of PAK that binds specifically to Rac-GTP (24Del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after CHO cell transfection, cells were plated on coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml fibrinogen and incubated in the presence of 0.5% fetal calf serum for an additional 18 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Adherent cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with primary antibodies to transfected proteins, secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy5, and rhodamine-phalloidin to stain F-actin. Lamellipodia formation in fibrinogen-adherent cells was quantified using an MRC 1024 Bio-Rad laser scanning confocal imaging system and expressed as the percentage of cells that contained one or more lamellipodium (27Miranti C. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Scoring was carried out in a blinded fashion by two independent observers, and at least 100 transfected cells were examined for every transfection combination in each experiment. Digital images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop, version 5.5. Fresh whole blood was obtained from normal volunteers, anticoagulated with ACD, and washed platelets were prepared (8Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To enable soluble fibrinogen to bind to αIIbβ3, platelets were resuspended to 3.5 × 108/ml and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 250 μg/ml fibrinogen in the presence of the β3activating antibody, LIBS-6 Fab (150 μg/ml). As a control, parallel samples were incubated in the presence of Ro 43–5054 (10 μm), a selective αIIbβ3antagonist that blocks fibrinogen binding (30Alig L. Edenhofer A. Hadváry P. Hürzeler M. Knopp D. Müller M. Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Weller T. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 4393-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To study the effects of adhesion to fibrinogen, platelets were incubated in fibrinogen-coated or BSA-coated dishes in the presence of 2 units/ml apyrase for 30 min (31Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then cells adherent to fibrinogen or suspended over BSA were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to SLP-76 or SLAP-130, and Western blots were probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, SLP-76, SLAP-130, or VASP (23Judd B.A. Myung P.S. Leng L. Obergfell A. Pear W.S. Shattil S.J. Koretzky G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For confocal microscopy, cells were plated onto fibrinogen-coated coverslips at 107/ml for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 200 nm phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to enhance spreading. Platelets were fixed, permeabilized, stained with antibodies to SLAP-130 and VASP, and examined by confocal microscopy (8Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.-D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets, fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 (23Judd B.A. Myung P.S. Leng L. Obergfell A. Pear W.S. Shattil S.J. Koretzky G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To study the mechanisms and consequences of integrin signaling to SLP-76, this adapter was transiently expressed in A5 CHO cells, which stably express αIIbβ3. To determine whether αIIbβ3 signals to SLP-76 in CHO cells as in platelets, A5 cells were first incubated with soluble fibrinogen in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2, an extrinsic activator of integrins (32Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Despite successful ectopic expression of SLP-76, no tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 was observed. In contrast, if SLP-76 was cotransfected with Syk, there was now a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 when fibrinogen binding was induced by MnCl2 (Fig.2 A). This response as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk itself were inhibited by compounds that block fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, including the selective αIIbβ3 antagonist, Integrilin, and the divalent cation chelator, EDTA. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A, fibrinogen binding was carried out for 15 min, but similar results were obtained at 30 s, the earliest time point tested. Identical results were obtained if fibrinogen binding was induced by a β3-specific-activating antibody, anti-LIBS6 Fab, instead of MnCl2 (not shown). In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 was observed when cells were plated on immobilized fibrinogen, even in the presence of 10 μmcytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization (Fig.2 B). As previously observed (27Miranti C. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), cytochalasin D blocked αIIbβ3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK but not Syk. These results indicate that SLP-76 is situated downstream of αIIbβ3 and Syk in a signaling pathway that becomes activated by fibrinogen binding, independent of actin polymerization. In antigen-stimulated T cells, SLP-76 phosphorylation is dependent on signals generated through T cell receptor subunits that bear ITAM motifs, and it is abolished by phenylalanine substitution of SLP-76 tyrosines 113, 128, and 145 (SLP-76-(3Y→F), see Ref. 15Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether these tyrosine residues are involved in αIIbβ3 signaling, SLP-76-(3Y→F) was expressed with Syk in A5 CHO cells. Despite levels of expression similar to wild-type SLP-76, adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76-(3Y→F) was reduced by an average of 66% (three experiments). Under the same conditions, tyrosine-phosphorylation of SLP-76-(3Y→F) induced by overexpression of an ITAM-bearing CD8γ chimera was virtually abolished (Fig.2 C). In addition, adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was still observed with a SLP-76 truncation mutant consisting of the N-terminal half of the molecule (amino acids 1–266) but not with SLP-76-(1–266)-(3Y→F) or with a mutant consisting of SLP-76 residues 157–533 (Fig. 2 D). Thus, SLP-76 tyrosine residues 113, 128, and/or 145 are major targets of Syk-dependent phosphorylation during outside-in αIIbβ3 signaling. However, in contrast to ITAM-based signaling, one or more additional tyrosines in SLP-76 are phosphorylated in response to integrin ligation. SLP-76-deficient mouse platelets exhibit reduced spreading on fibrinogen (23Judd B.A. Myung P.S. Leng L. Obergfell A. Pear W.S. Shattil S.J. Koretzky G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12056-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One early event during spreading is lamellipodia formation, a response that involves αIIbβ3, Syk, Vav1 and Rac (27Miranti C. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1421-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Because SLP-76 is situated downstream of αIIbβ3 and Syk, we asked whether SLP-76 expression affected the formation of lamellipodia. Twenty-four hours after transfection of Syk, Vav1, and SLP-76, A5 cells were plated on fibrinogen-coated coverslips for another 18 h and then examined by confocal microscopy. Identification of cells expressing the recombinant proteins was accomplished by three color fluorescence analysis, as shown in Fig.3 A. As observed previously (27Miranti C. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the percentage of fibrinogen-adherent CHO cells that exhibited one or more lamellipodium was greatly increased by coexpression of Syk and Vav1, and this response was dependent on the amount of Vav1 expressed (Fig. 3 B). Even in the presence of Syk alone however, SLP-76 caused a modest but consistent increase in lamellipodia formation (p < 0.03), and the enhancing effect of SLP-76 was maintained in the presence of Vav1 (p < 0.003, Fig. 3 B). Because tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 can bind directly to the SH2 domain of Vav1, we wondered if this interaction was necessary for the SLP-76 effect on lamellipodia. In the SLP-76-(3Y→F) mutant, the tyrosines needed for interaction with Vav1 (or Nck) are not present (15Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wardenburg J.B. Pappu R. Bu J.Y. Mayer B. Chernoff J. Straus D. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, unlike the case for wild-type SLP-76, Vav1, and Nck were not observed in SLP-76-(3Y→F) immunoprecipitates from fibrinogen-adherent A5 cells (Fig. 4). Despite this, SLP-76-(3Y→F) was fully able to enhance lamellipodia formation induced by Syk and Vav1 (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, a SLP-76 deletion mutant (Δ224–244) that lacks the polyproline binding site for Gads and a mutant (R448K) that abrogates the SLP-76 SH2 interaction with SLAP-130 (34Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar) were similarly able to enhance lamellipodia formation (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, SLP-76 truncation mutants containing either the N-terminal half () or the C-terminal half () of the molecule failed to support lamellipodia formation (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that one function of SLP-76 is to enhance lamellipodia formation during αIIbβ3 signaling. Furthermore, at least when ectopically expressed, the loss of any single known adapter function of SLP-76 does not prevent this effect. Lamellipodial extension involves actin polymerization in localized regions of the cortical cytoskeleton. Because SLP-76 is a multivalent adapter, it has the potential to influence the subcellular localization or function of several proteins that have been implicated in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. We focused attention on three such proteins, Rac, PAK, and VASP. Rac promotes actin polymerization and lamellipodial extension in many cell types, including platelets and A5 CHO cells (27Miranti C.

To determine the catalytic domain, we analyzed charged residues (Asp253, Lys261, Glu263, Asp279, Asp283, Asp287, Asp723, Asp727, and Asp731) in the putative PPi-binding site and two conserved acidic regions of mung bean V-PPase by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in yeast. Amino acid substitution of the residues with alanine and conservative residues resulted in a marked decrease in PPi hydrolysis activity and a complete loss of H+ transport activity. The conformational change of V-PPase induced by the binding of the substrate was reflected in the susceptibility to trypsin. Wild-type V-PPase was completely digested by trypsin but not in the presence of Mg-PPi, while two V-PPase mutants, K261A and E263A, became sensitive to trypsin even in the presence of the substrate. These results suggest that the second acidic region is also implicated in the substrate hydrolysis and that at least two residues, Lys261and Glu263, are essential for the substrate-binding function. From the observation that the conservative mutants K261R and E263D showed partial activity of PPi hydrolysis but no proton pump activity, we estimated that two residues, Lys261 and Glu263, might be related to the energy conversion from PPi hydrolysis to H+transport. The importance of two residues, Asp253 and Glu263, in the Mg2+-binding function was also suggested from the trypsin susceptibility in the presence of Mg2+.

The proton pumping reaction couples with the hydrolysis of PPi. V-PPase acidifies vacuoles together with vacuolar H+-ATPase in the plant cell and actively exports protons from the cytosol in the bacterial plasma membrane (1Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev.

V-PPase has the simplest structure among the proton pumps except for bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump. The molecular mass calculated from the cDNA sequences range from 80 to 81 kDa for V-PPases of land plants and algae (for a review, see Refs. 3Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys.

The simplicity of the enzyme structure and its substrate is an advantage to analyze the structure-function relationship. The enzyme activity is stimulated by K+ at relatively high concentrations. Also, Mg2+ is essential to form a Mg-PPi complex and to keep the active conformation of V-PPase (1Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Thus, V-PPase should have a specific binding site for its substrate (Mg-PPi), Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+ in addition to a H+ transport channel. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of V-PPases of various organisms revealed highly conserved regions (2Baltscheffsky M. Schultz A. Baltscheffsky H.

The aim of this study is to clarify the substrate-binding site of V-PPase by the method of site-directed and random mutagenesis. We prepared a line of constructs, in which charged residues in a putative substrate-binding site were replaced, expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then examined for enzymatic properties. V-PPase has been proposed to have three conserved regions (3Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Nakanishi Y. Matsuda N. Aizawa K.

In addition to a putative PPi-binding site in the first conserved region, we investigated the two acidic motifs in the first and third conserved regions. Each aspartic acid residue in the two acidic regions was substituted and examined for enzymatic properties. Here, the functional roles of these residues on the substrate hydrolysis, binding of free Mg2+, and a coupling reaction between PPi hydrolysis and proton transport were examined. The similarity of the conserved functional motifs of V-PPase with the P-type ATPase is also discussed. A EcoRI–SalI fragment of VVP2 cDNA encoding mung bean V-PPase (Ref. 19Nakanishi Y. Maeshima M.

For convenience of genetic manipulation, theAatII site of pKVVP2 plasmid in pKT10 vector was removed, and a SacI site at position 715 in the plasmid was introduced by substitution with a synonymous codon. The resulting pKVVP2/S plasmid was used as a seed for hypermutagenic polymerase chain reaction (26Vartanian J.P. Henry M. Wain-Hobson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 40 pg/ml pKVVP2/S plasmid, 250 nm primers (TableI, F668 and R1251), 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.001% gelatin, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm dATP, 0.1 mm dCTP, 1 mmdGTP, 1 mm dTTP, and 0.08 units/ml Taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was done using 20 cycles of a set of 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C. The obtained polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested and inserted into the SacI–AatII site of the pKVVP2/S plasmid. This library was amplified in E. coli and introduced into yeast BJ5458. A region that was mutagenized in each mutant was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using F668 and R1251 primers. Mutation points were defined by DNA sequencing. In most mutants, plural sites were mutated. Crude membrane fractions were prepared from yeast cells by the method of Kimet al. (27Kim E.J. Zhen R.G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Yeast cells were precultured at 30 °C for 2 days in AHCW/Glc medium that contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, 0.002% (w/v) adenine sulfate, 0.002% tryptophan, 2% glucose, 1% casamino acids (Nihon Pharmaceutical Co.), and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco). The cell culture was diluted 64-fold and then grown for 12 h to reach an exponential phase. After being washed with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 50 mm 2- mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 m glucose at 30 °C for 10 min, cells were treated with a zymolyase medium at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. The medium contained 0.05% zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Kogyo Co.), 0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 mglucose, 50 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.6, 5 mm DTT, 0.043% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, and 0.25× dropout solution composed of all amino acids and adenines (28Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were collected from the suspension by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and washed with 1m sorbitol. The spheroplasts were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-ascorbate, pH 7.6, 1.1 m glycerol, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (M r 40,000), 5 mm EGTA-Tris, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg/liter leupeptin and then homogenized with a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2,000 × gfor 10 min, the precipitate was suspended in the same buffer and centrifuged again. All of the supernatant fractions were pooled and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate (membranes) was suspended in 15% (w/w) sucrose and layered on a 35% (w/w) sucrose solution. Both sucrose solutions contained 10 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EGTA-Tris, 2 mm DTT, 25 mm KCl, 1.1 m glycerol, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg/liter leupeptin. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min, the interface portion was collected and diluted with 5 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.6, 0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA-Tris, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, and 5 mmMgCl2. Most of the V-PPase activity was recovered in this fraction. The precipitate after centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 30 min was resuspended in 5 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.6, 0.3 m sorbitol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA-Tris, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The suspension (V-PPase-enriched membrane fraction) was stored at −80 °C until use. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). PPi hydrolysis activity was measured in a reaction medium supplemented with 0.5 mm KF (24Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PPi-dependent H+ transport activity was determined as described previously (24Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Membrane preparations were preincubated with a reaction buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mmTris-Mes, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA-Tris, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm acridine orange, and then the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm Na4PPi. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by the standard procedure. Immunoblotting was carried out using polyclonal antibodies against V-PPase purified from mung bean (24Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an ECL procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To remove Mg2+ and PMSF, yeast membrane preparations were washed with 20 mmTris-Mes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm MgCl2. The membrane fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-Mes, pH 7.6, 10 μg/ml trypsin, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1% MOA Excellent (a mixture of alkylglucosides; Kao Co., Japan) and then incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an SDS-sample buffer containing 5 mm PMSF. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-V-PPase antibody. A yeast expression vector pKT10 was used to express a cDNA (VVP2) encoding mung bean V-PPase in yeast (Fig.1 A). For DNA manipulation, anEcoRI site in VVP2 was eliminated by substitution with synonymous codons. VVP2 was efficiently transcribed under the control of the promoter of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a medium supplemented with glucose (30Rosenberg S. Coit D. Tekamp-Olson P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The V-PPase-enriched membrane fraction was prepared by a stepwise sucrose gradient centrifugation and then subjected to immunoblotting with the polyclonal antibodies specific to V-PPase. Transformants produced a 73-kDa protein that was reacted with the antibodies (Fig.1 B). The recombinant V-PPase accounted for 2 to 3% of the total membrane protein. The membranes showed the PPihydrolysis activity that was insensitive to KF, an inhibitor of acid phosphatase (Fig. 1 C). The activity was 3.5 times enhanced by 50 mm KCl but not by 50 mm NaCl. The membrane vesicles prepared from VVP2 transformant gave the PPi-dependent H+ transport activity (Fig. 1 D). The pH gradient was collapsed by the addition of membrane-permeable ammonium ion, indicating the electrogenic H+ transport in the vesicles. The elimination of an EcoRI site from the original VPP2 sequence did not affect the expression level and the enzymatic activity. The results indicate that V-PPase expressed in yeast functions normally in the heterologous system. The sequence DVGADLVGKVE is a putative substrate-binding site of V-PPase (2Baltscheffsky M.

Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functional significance of the charged residues in this motif, we generated a series of V-PPase mutants, in which the residues were replaced with alanine (D253A, K261A, E263A) or conservative residues (D253E, K261R, E263D). A comparison of the primary structures of V-PPases of various organisms revealed that there are two consensus acidic regions, DNVGDNVGD (acidic region 1) and DTXGDPXKD (acidic region 2). The former is near the DVGADLVGKVE motif in loop e, and the latter is in loop m between the 13th and 14th transmembrane domains (Fig. 2). Both regions can be expressed as a common motif DXXXDXXXD. To test whether the aspartate residues in the two motifs are implicated in the interaction with the substrate and Mg2+, we generated a series of mutants substituted with alanine (D279A, D283A, D287A, D723A, D727A, and D731A) and glutamic acid (D279E, D283E, D287E, D723E, D727E, and D731E). These V-PPase mutants were assayed for the enzymatic activities. The V-PPase protein in each mutant was clearly detected as a 73-kDa protein in an immunoblot (Fig. 3 A). PPi hydrolysis and PPi-dependent H+ transport activities of the mutants were assayed at 1 mm (Fig. 3, B and D) or 0.3 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 3 C). The membrane preparation of the wild-type strain showed high activities compared with a low basal level in the control vector. All nine V-PPase mutants substituted with alanine (D253A, K261A, E263A, D279A, D283A, D287A, D723A, D727A, and D731A) lost the activity completely (Fig. 3,B–D). Conservative exchange with glutamate in seven mutants (D253E, D279E, D283E, D287E, D723E, D727E, and D731E) also caused a loss of function of H+ transport (Fig. 3, B andC). The PPi hydrolysis activity was decreased in these mutants. As a control, we obtained a V262A mutant from a random mutation library. This V262A mutant had the same V-PPase activity and protein level as the wild type. These results proved that aspartate residues in the putative PPi-binding site and the acidic motifs are involved in the binding and hydrolysis of the substrate. There was no difference in the protein level of V-PPase in the membranes among the mutants (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the loss of activity was not due to the absence or low expression of V-PPase. Interestingly, the K261R and E263D mutants retained 25 and 50% of the original PPi hydrolytic activity, respectively, at 1 mm MgCl2, but they had no H+transport activity. Thus, Lys261 and Glu263 may be involved in the energy transduction from PPi hydrolysis to H+ translocation. Furthermore, three other mutants (E263G, V259A, and C304R) with a single substitution of an amino acid were obtained by a random mutation technique. The E263G and C304R mutants gave no activity of PPi hydrolysis or H+ transport (Fig. 4). The V259A mutant had 60% of the original activity of PPihydrolysis but no H+ transport activity as well as K261R and E263D. V-PPase requires Mg2+ for activation, structural stabilization, and protection from protease digestion (1Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 7Gordon-Weeks R. Steele S.H. Leigh R.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,8Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, yeast vacuolar membranes containing V-PPase were treated with trypsin in the presence or absence of Mg2+, PPi, and Mg-PPi. Trypsin preferentially cleaves at the carboxyl sides of arginine and lysine residues. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Mg2+and Mg-PPi, but not PPi, at relatively high concentrations partially prevented digestion of V-PPase by trypsin. Thus, the trypsin susceptibility is a good marker for the structural change caused by the binding of Mg2+ and Mg-PPi. All V-PPase mutants were thoroughly digested by trypsin in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 5 B, panels none and 1 mmPP i). Therefore, the amino acid substitution did not affect the trypsin cleavage site. It should be noted that Mg2+ protected the enzyme from trypsin digestion in mutants of K261A, D279A, D283A, D287A, D723A, D727A, D731A, E263D, and D727E as compared with the wild type V-PPase (Fig. 5 B, 1 mmMg). Neither Mg2+ nor PPi has a direct inhibitory effect on trypsin, since V-PPase in the E263A mutant was completely digested even in the presence of 1 mmMg2+ and 1 mm PPi (Fig.5 B). This observation indicates that these amino acid substitutions increase the affinity of the enzyme for Mg2+. In other words, the charged residues of Lys261, Asp279, Asp283, Asp287, Asp723, Asp727, and Asp731 may have a negative effect on the Mg2+-binding property of V-PPase. In the presence of both Mg2+ and PPi, certain mutants were resistant to trypsin as was the wild type V-PPase. However, the K261A, E263A, and K261R mutants were sensitive to trypsin, and the other alanine mutants (D279A, D723A) and the glutamate mutants (D253E, D279E, D283E, D287E, and D723E) were partially sensitive under the assay conditions. These results suggest that Lys261 and Glu263 are essential for the substrate-binding function. The other aspartate residues at 253, 279, 283, 287, and 723 may also be implicated in the substrate-binding function or located near the substrate-binding site of V-PPase. V-PPase has been estimated to possess the binding sites for its substrate (Mg-PPi), Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+, independently, and a H+ transport pathway. In the present study, we examined the functional role of charged residues in the putative substrate-binding site (DVGADLVGKVE) and two conservative acidic regions of V-PPase by site-directed and random mutagenesis in combination with a heterologous expression system in S. cerevisiae. The V-PPase expressed in yeast exhibited the PPi hydrolysis and proton pump activities, and the enzyme protein was detected by immunoblotting. V-PPase translated in yeast was considered to be localized mainly in vacuolar membranes judging from the following three observations: vacuolar type H+-ATPase was detected in the same membrane fraction; a PPi-dependent H+ current was detected in intact vacuoles prepared from theVVP2-transformed yeast cells by the patch clamp technique 2Y. Nakanishi, I. Yabe, and M. Maeshima, unpublished data. ; and the amount of the V-PPase protein in a yeast strain that lacked the major vacuolar proteases was higher than that in the normal strain. The substitution of acidic residues in the putative substrate-binding motif and two acidic regions had a negative effect on the V-PPase activity (Fig. 3). This is a direct effect of amino acid substitution, since all V-PPase mutants expressed in yeast were accumulated in the membrane at equal levels. The PPihydrolysis activity was markedly decreased even in the case of conservative substitution (D253E, K261R, and E263D), although the V262A mutant retained the original activity. Thus, these residues (Asp253, Lys261, and Glu263) are essential for V-PPase activity. The present study showed that V-PPase might not interact with PPi in the absence of Mg2+, since PPi did not affect trypsin susceptibility even at 1 mm, but PPi plus Mg2+ makes V-PPase resistant to trypsin (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the trypsin susceptibility assay revealed that Lys261 and Glu263 are essential for the binding of the substrate (Fig.5). Fig. 6 B shows a scheme of our model. This work demonstrated the functional significance of acidic residues in the acidic regions (DNVGDNVGD287 and DTXGDPXKD731) (Fig. 2). The sequences are conserved among V-PPases of various organisms including R. rubrum (5Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva A. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and T. maritima (GenBankTMaccession number AE001702). Substitution of the aspartate residue at 279, 283, 287, 723, 727, and 731 with alanine or glutamate residue resulted in the complete loss of the activity (Fig. 3). The digestion assay with trypsin also supported the implication of aspartate residues at 279, 283, 287, and 723 in the binding of Mg-PPi(Fig. 5). These residues may be adjacent to the DVGADLVGKVE motif in the tertiary structure of V-PPase as discussed later. The present study also suggested the residues involved in energy coupling of V-PPase. The K261R and E263D mutants partially retained the PPi hydrolysis activity, 25 and 50% of that of the wild-type enzyme, respectively, but the mutants did not exhibit the H+ transport activity (Fig. 3). The V259A mutant also retained partial activity (60%) of PPi hydrolysis but no proton pump activity (Fig. 4). These three residues are located in the putative PPi-binding site. Thus, the conserved motif including Val259, Lys261, and Glu263 may be implicated in the initial step of the energy transfer from PPi hydrolysis to the H+translocation. In Arabidopsis V-PPase, Glu427 in the transmembrane domain has been demonstrated to be involved in the energy coupling by the site-directed mutagenesis (18Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The role of several charged residues in the transmembrane domains remains to be investigated for their role in H+ translocation. The presence of Mg2+ decreased the susceptibility of V-PPase to trypsin (Fig. 5 A), which is consistent with a previous report (8Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, V-PPase became resistant to trypsin in several V-PPase mutants (K261A, D279A, D283A, D287A, D723A, D727A, D731A, E263D, and D727E) compared with the wild type V-PPase, while the D253A and E263A mutants were completely digested by trypsin (Fig. 5). This suggests that the two residues Asp253 and Glu263 are essential for Mg2+ binding (Fig. 6). On the other hand, Lys261 and other aspartate residues in the acidic regions seem to interfere with V-PPase in the binding of Mg2+ (Fig. 6 B, broken lines). Probably, these aspartate residues weaken the interaction between Mg2+ and a binding site that includes Asp253 and Glu263 (Fig. 6 B). Since Asp253 and Glu263 may be involved in the binding of a Mg-PPi complex as mentioned above, the two acidic residues may be located in the substrate-binding pocket and also have an ability to interact with free Mg2+. Probably, there is another, high affinity binding site for free Mg2+independent of the substrate-binding site. However, those residues could not be detected in the present assay system of trypsin susceptibility in the presence of 1 mmMg2+. With respect to the conserved acidic regions, we found that V-PPases share common motifs with the P-type ATPases such as Ca2+-ATPase. In the P-type ATPase, the ATP-binding and ATP-hydrolyzing domain has been proposed to consist of several conserved motifs of DKTGT, DPPR (or DKVR), (T/S)GD(N/K), and GDGXNDA (32Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 33Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among these motifs, the TGDN and GDGXNDA motifs are conserved in V-PPases as a GDN motif including Asp283 in the first acidic region and a GDTIGD motif including Asp723 and Asp727 in the second acidic region (Fig. 7). It has been proposed that the TGDN motif is involved in ATP hydrolysis together with a DPPR motif in the P-ATPases and that the adenosine moiety of ATP interacts with the other motifs such as a KGAP motif of the P-ATPase (32Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 33Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the amino acid residues that are involved in the binding of adenosine moiety and the hydrolysis of phosphoanhydride bond of ATP can be topologically distinguished in the crystal structure of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (34Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). The DPPR (or DKVR) motif, which is located in the hydrolysis pocket, is present as DDRR272 in loop e and DNAK695 in loop mof V-PPases except for A. acetabulum V-PPase (3Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 13Ikeda M. Rahman M.H. Moritani C. Umami K. Tanimura Y. Akagi R. Tanaka Y. Maeshima M. Watanabe Y. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 139-140Google Scholar), but an adenosine-binding KGAP motif is not conserved in the V-PPase. Aravindet al. (35Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have proposed that two aspartate residues in the GDGXND X motif of the P-ATPases have a role in hydrolysis of a phosphoanhydride bond of ATP. The present study revealed not only the importance of the two acidic regions in addition to the PPi-binding motif proposed previously but also the functional and sequence similarity of V-PPases to the P-type ATPases. However, it cannot be concluded that V-PPase is a member of the P-type ATPase family, since V-PPase lacks a phosphorylation domain (DKTGTLT) that is common to the P-ATPases including plasma membrane H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase and other heavy metal-transporting ATPase (32Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear whether V-PPase forms an intermediate phosphorylation form during PPi hydrolysis. In summary, Lys261 and Glu263 of mung bean V-PPase are essential for the substrate-binding function, and Asp253 and Glu263 are essential for the Mg2+-binding function (Fig. 6). All aspartate residues (Asp253, Asp279, Asp283, Asp287, Asp723, Asp727, and Asp731) in the PPi-binding motif and two acidic regions may be involved in interaction with the substrate. It has also been reported that Glu305 and Asp504 ofArabidopsis V-PPase, Glu301 and Asp500 for mung bean V-PPase, respectively, are essential for PPi hydrolysis activity (18Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that these two acidic regions (279–287 and 723–731) and a common DXXADLVGKXE (253) motif form a core catalytic domain of the V-PPase together with a few other motifs. To verify our model, we need to perform a high resolution crystallographic study to determine the structure. We thank Drs. K. Nakamura, A. Morikami, K. Matsuoka, and H. Ueoka-Nakanishi of Nagoya University for stimulating discussions."

Three closely related members of the C/EBP family, C/EBPα, LAP/C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, are known to contribute to liver-specific gene transcription. Specific functions of these transcription factors have been described in the regulation of the acute phase response and during liver regeneration, where they seem to be involved in the process of hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 1Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Several inflammatory signals, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor α, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) contribute to the regulation of the acute phase response in hepatocytes. The activities of the C/EBP family members are differentially modulated in response to the various inflammatory stimuli on the mRNA and protein level. Upon induction of the acute phase response C/EBPα mRNA levels decrease in the liver, whereas LAP/C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ gene transcription is enhanced. For the regulation of LAP/C/EBPβ, however, post-translational mechanisms were described in addition to transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 2Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).

Phosphorylation occurs in vitro in response to an intracellular Ca2+ increase, through activation of the protein kinase C pathway and through activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase following induction of the Ras pathway. Although all these events lead to increased transactivation of LAP/C/EBPβ-dependent genes, only the MAP kinase pathway can be linked to the acute phase response. Moreover, stimulation with lipopolysaccharides, IL-6, IL-1, dexamethasone, and glucagon strongly induces LAP/C/EBPβ expression (7Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv.

Initially, LAP/C/EBPβ has also been cloned because it binds to IL-6-responsive elements in the promoters of acute phase response genes (11Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S.

Of the numerous cytokines and growth factors that are involved in regulating the acute phase response, IL-6 plays a major role (reviewed in Ref. 13Mackiewicz A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 225-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of IL-6 to its receptor induces homodimerization of the signal-transducing component gp130 (14Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N.

STAT3 then binds to target sequences in different promoters and enhances gene transcription. Binding sites for STAT3 are located in most promoters of acute phase genes, and originally STAT3 was identified as acute phase response factor (24Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S.

Analysis of the C/EBPδ promoter revealed that STAT3 contributes to higher gene transcription after IL-6 stimulation (27Cantwell C.A. Sterneck E. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell.

Besides DNA binding, cooperative interaction of STAT3 with Sp1 is essential for the regulation of the C/EBPδ promoter. In contrast, no information is available about the molecular mechanisms involved in the IL-6-dependent increase of LAP/C/EBPβ gene transcription. Therefore, we were interested in investigating how IL-6 controls the activation of this gene. In this analysis we show that IL-6 activates LAP/C/EBPβgene transcription using the two already characterized CRE-like sites in the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter (29Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell.

STAT3 activation through the gp130 signal transducer is essential for increased LAP/C/EBPβ transcription despite the lack of sequence-specific STAT DNA binding sites in this promoter region. Enhanced IL-6-dependent transcription of the LAP/C/EBPβ gene correlates with the binding of a new IL-6-inducible factor with a molecular mass of 68 kDa to the CRE-like sites in the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter. Functional dissection of the gp130 signal transducer molecule and the use of STAT1/STAT3 chimeras further demonstrated the essential role of STAT3 and identified specific regions of the protein that are required for the IL-6-dependent increase of LAP/C/EBPβ gene transcription. These results lead to a model of how tethering STAT3 to the promoter region contributes to IL-6-dependent gene transcription without direct DNA binding and thus indicate a new mechanism for STAT3-dependent gene transcription. C3H mice were stimulated intraperitoneally with 40 μg of human recombinant IL-6. At different time points after injection, the livers were removed and preparation of RNA and of liver nuclear extracts was performed. At each time point at least three animals were used in parallel. RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (30Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For preparation of nuclear extracts the pooled livers were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and liver nuclear proteins were prepared as described previously (30Trautwein C. Rakemann T.

Nuclear proteins were aliquoted and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Northern blot analysis was performed as described before, according to standard procedures (30Trautwein C. Rakemann T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 30 μg of total RNA was analyzed through a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel followed by transfer to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). The LAP/C/EBPβ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]CTP according to the instructions for Rediprime (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridization procedure was performed as described previously (30Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Pietrangelo A. Plümpe J. Montosi G. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22262-22270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed for autoradiography and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji) for quantification. LAP/C/EBPβ signals were normalized to the GAPDH signals and set to 1 for untreated animals. The values for IL-6 treatment were shown as -fold stimulation. The LAPPRO 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 constructs corresponding to increasing deletions in the 5′-flanking region of the LAP/C/EBPβ open reading frame linked to a luciferase reporter gene were described previously (29Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LAPPRO 8WTΔ construct carries a deletion of 27 nucleotides (−103 to −76) between the two CRE-like sites and the LAPPRO 8 MUT I+II construct carries mutations in both CRE-like sites (−109 to −107 = ACG → GTT and −65 to −61 = TGACG → GATCC) as described elsewhere (29Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A series of expression vectors for truncated STAT3 proteins and various STAT3-STAT1 chimeric proteins were constructed as described elsewhere (22Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Kurpkat G. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. J. Biol.

For the construction of cDNAs coding for STAT3-STAT1 chimeric proteins, additional unique restriction sites were introduced into the STAT cDNAs by site-directed mutagenesis or authentic restriction sites were used. The chimeric STAT cDNAs were constructed by exchanging the respective DNA fragments within the pBluescript vector context. The cDNAs were then subcloned into the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The STAT3D (EE → AA) construct was kindly provided by Toshio Hirano (32Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi H. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To create the 5′Gal4-STAT1NT and 5′Gal4-STAT3NT fusion constructs, the respective STAT amino-terminal NotI/SphI fragments were cloned into pSG424-Gal4(1–147) (33Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) cleaved with EcoRI andXbaI. Klenow fill-in reactions and mung bean digestions were used to clone the constructs in-frame. To create the STAT1NT-3′Gal4 and the STAT3NT-3′Gal4 fusion constructs the Gal4-(1–147) fragment of the pSG424-Gal4-(1–147) vector was amplified by polymerase chain reaction to introduce 5′-SphI and 3′-ApaI restriction sites, verified by sequencing, and then cloned into the respective pRcCMV-STAT expression vector behind the STAT amino-terminalNotI/SphI fragments. The pCMVβGal vector was used as internal standard. The pRcCMV-PIAS3 expression vector was kindly provided by Chan Chung (34Chung C.D. Liao J. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The Epo-receptor/gp130 chimeras were described before (19Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmen U. Landgraf C.

They consisted of the extracellular domain of the murine Epo-receptor fused to the human transmembrane domain and different cytoplasmic tyrosine modules of the IL-6 signal transducer gp130. The EpoR/MAP site corresponds to the Tyr-759 module and the EpoR/STAT3 site corresponds to the Tyr-767 module. The EpoR/STAT1 site comprised only the membrane-proximal part of gp130, fused to a peptide covering the Tyr-440 tyrosine motif of the IFN-γR. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. DNA transfection was performed using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (35Trautwein C. Walker D. Plümpe J. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown on 60-mm dishes to about 50% confluence when used for transfection experiments. The amount of reporter and expression vectors is indicated in the figure legends. The total amount of DNA was kept constant in each transfection experiment by adding pBSK+DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to 5 μg. All transfections contained 0.1 μg of the β-galactosidase reporter pCMVβGal as an internal standard. For stimulation experiments, cells were starved with 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h after transfection. Stimulation was performed with human recombinant IL-6 (Strathmann Biotech, Hannover, Germany) in the amounts and for the time points indicated or with 7 units/ml human recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) for 4 h. 1 unit of IL-6 is equivalent to 0.005 ng (Strathmann Biotech). To measure luciferase activity, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 350 μl of extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2 mm DTT) for 10 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 50 μl of the supernatant was assayed by addition of 300 μl of measuring buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm ATP). The light emission was measured in duplicate for 10 s in a Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold) by injecting 100 μl of 250 μm luciferin. Data are represented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments and are representative for three independent experiments. HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared by the modified Dignam C method (5Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 × g, 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 10 min (100 μl for 5 × 106 cells), transferred onto one volume of 50% sucrose in hypotonic buffer, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. Nuclei were resuspended in Dignam C buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) (50 μl for 5 × 106 cells) and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min. The extracts were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. For gel retardation assays nuclear extracts were used as indicated in the figure legends. Binding buffer consisted of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 34 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0,2 mm PMSF, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC)/μl, and 100 ng of bovine serum albumin/μl. The binding reaction was performed for 30 min on ice. Free DNA and DNA·protein complexes were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) and used as 32P-labeled probes. Oligonucleotides A to M were derived from the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter. Oligonucleotide A corresponds to −123 to −95 (GCG GCC GGG CAA TGA CGC GCA CCG ACC CG), oligonucleotide B to −102 to −75 (CCG ACC CGG CGG CGG GGC GGC GGG AGG G), oligonucleotide C to −90 to −68 (CGG GGC GGC GGG AGG GGC CCC GG), oligonucleotide D to −75 to −43 (GGC CCC GGC GTG ACG CAG CCC GTT GCC AGG CGC), oligonucleotide E to −123 to −107 (GCG GCC GGG CAA TGA CG), oligonucleotide F to −110 to −87 (GAC GCG CAC CGA CCC GGC GGC GGG), and oligonucleotide M to −123 to −99, mutated in −109 to −107 (GCG GCC GGG CAA TGG TTC GCA). The SIE consensus oligonucleotide corresponds to the sequence: 5′-GTG CAT TTC CCG TAA ATC TTG TCT ACA-3′. Supershift experiments were performed with antibodies against STAT3 or CREB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were modified in Fig. 4 as indicated. Prior to the incubation with the32P-labeled probe, nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.08% desoxycholic acid (DOC) for 20 min at 4 °C, then 0.15% Nonidet P-40 was added. For the depletion assay 2.5 μl of antibody to CREB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was coupled to 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose, saturated with 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm Pefabloc, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 4 h at 4 °C, washed twice in TNE buffer, and twice in gel shift sample buffer. Incubation with 3 μg of nuclear extract was performed at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose without antibody was treated under the same conditions and served as control. The supernatants were analyzed in gel shift experiments. Southwestern analysis was performed as described with some modifications (36Bock C.T. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Grossmann S.R. Mora R. Laimins L.A. J. Virology. 1989; 63: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of liver nuclear extracts prepared before and 1 h after stimulation of C3H mice with 40 μg of IL-6 was heated for 30 min at 60 °C in SDS sample buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gel was incubated in renaturing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 4 m urea, adjusted to pH 7.5) for 4 h at room temperature and then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a solution containing 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine (adjusted to pH 8.3) at 4 °C for 2 h at a constant current of 200 mA. The membranes were prehybridized in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 2× Denhardt's solution, adjusted to pH 7.2) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with 2.5 × 106 cpm32P-labeled oligonucleotide A for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation the membranes were washed several times in binding buffer and exposures were made to x-ray films. Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) in 1% SDS, 20% methanol, 400 mmglycine, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, at 4 °C for 2 h at 200 mA. The antibody directed against Gal4-(1–147) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the antibody directed against phospho-STAT3 was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). The antigen·antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). LAP/C/EBPβ was originally identified, because an increase in DNA binding was evident after IL-6 treatment in human hepatoma cells (11Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 12Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). IL-6 stimulates LAP/C/EBPβ at the transcriptional and post-translational level (2Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar,7Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for IL-6-mediatedLAP/C/EBPβ gene transcription are unknown. In an initial experiment, C3H mice were stimulated with IL-6 and LAP/C/EBPβ mRNA expression was studied by Northern blot analysis (Fig.1 A). LAP/C/EBPβ signals were normalized to the GAPDH signals and set to 1 for untreated animals. Quantification revealed an increase in LAP/C/EBPβ mRNA expression already after 30 min while maximum levels (3.8-fold) were found 6 h after stimulation (Fig. 1 A). At later time points LAP/C/EBPβ mRNA expression decreased again. After binding of IL-6 to its receptor, several pathways are activated. However, STAT3 activation has been shown to stimulate transcription of many acute-phase genes. Therefore, activation of STAT3, as already described before (39Rakemann T. Niehof M. Kubicka S. Fischer M. Manns M.P. Rose-John S. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1257-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was studied. IL-6 induced an increase in nuclear expression of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 30 min after injection as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). The nuclear expression of phospho-STAT3 remained high for the first 4 h and was no more detectable after 12 h. Gel shift experiments with an SIE element as STAT3 target sequence showed activation of DNA binding 30 min after IL-6 injection (Fig. 1 C). DNA binding remained high for up to 3 h and then subsequently decreased. No complex formation was found after 12 h. The specificity of STAT3 in the new appearing complex was verified by supershift experiments (data not shown) and has been shown before using a STAT3 DNA target sequence derived from the α2-macrolgobulin promoter (39Rakemann T. Niehof M. Kubicka S. Fischer M. Manns M.P. Rose-John S. Trautwein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1257-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, these experiments show a close correlation between an increase in LAP/C/EBPβ mRNA expression and STAT3 activation after IL-6 stimulation in the liver in vivo. As LAP/C/EBPβ mRNA expression increased after IL-6 stimulation in vivo, we performed experiments to identify regulatory sequences in the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter that mediate IL-6 induction. In transfection experiments luciferase reporter constructs with increasing deletions in the 5′-flanking region, located upstream of the start site of transcription in the LAP/C/EBPβ gene, were analyzed in HepG2 cells. The constructs were cotransfected with 50 ng of STAT3 expression vector, and cells were treated with 1000 units/ml IL-6 for 4 h (Fig.2 A). The relative luciferase activity of the respective LAPPRO reporter construct without stimulation was set to 1, and the changes after IL-6 treatment were shown as -fold stimulation. Strong induction (up to 20-fold) of the luciferase reporter gene was observed when the whole 1.4-kb 5′-region of the promoter was used (LAPPRO 1). IL-6-dependent stimulation of the 5′-flanking region was still found when deletions up to nucleotide −121 were analyzed. No increase in reporter gene activity after IL-6 treatment was evident with the LAPPRO 9 construct (truncated to position −71, see Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that the region located between nucleotides −121 and −71 in close proximity to the TATA box is involved in mediating IL-6-dependent transcription of the LAP/C/EBPβgene. The IL-6-dependent effect on the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter was further investigated by dose and time-kinetic experiments (Fig. 2, B and C). This analysis showed that a maximal effect on LAP/C/EBPβ promoter activity was found with 1000 units/ml IL-6 for 4 h. Our next interest was to analyze the relevance of the STAT3 signaling cascade for IL-6-mediated LAP/C/EBPβ transcription despite the finding that there is no STAT consensus sequence located in the LAP/C/EBPβ promoter region, which confers IL-6 inducibilit"
https://openalex.org/W1994196877,"The long-chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) holds that secretion is linked to a glucose-induced increase in malonyl-CoA level and accumulation of LC-CoA in the cytosol. We have previously tested the validity of this proposal by overexpressing goose malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) in INS-1 cells, but these studies have been criticized due to: 1) the small insulin secretion response (2–4−fold) of the INS-1 cells used; 2) unknown contribution of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel-independent pathway of GSIS in INS-1 cells, which has been implicated as the site at which lipids regulate insulin granule exocytosis; and 3) deletion of the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, but not the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence in the goose MCD construct, raising the possibility that a significant fraction of the overexpressed enzyme was localized to peroxisomes.

ATP-sensitive K+ glucose-stimulated insulin secretion long-chain acyl-CoA malonyl-CoA decarboxylase Hepes balanced salt solution The regulation of insulin secretion by glucose is mediated by metabolism of the sugar in pancreatic islet β-cells, resulting in an increase in the ATP:ADP ratio and closure of ATP-dependent K+(KATP)1channels. Subsequently, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open, intracellular Ca2+ rises, and insulin exocytosis is initiated (1Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, it has become clear that this is a minimal model of glucose sensing, because glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) still occurs when closure of the KATPchannel or the rise in intracellular Ca2+ are prevented (2Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar,3Komatsu M. Schermerhorn T. Aizawa T. Sharp G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10728-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that factors that complement changes in ATP:ADP ratios in regulation of insulin secretion may arise from post-mitochondrial metabolism of glucose, and interaction of glucose and lipid metabolism. The long-chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) model of GSIS holds that malonyl-CoA levels increase in response to increasing glucose concentrations, resulting in inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and fatty acid oxidation (4Corkey B.E.

Our laboratory has recently addressed the LC-CoA model using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of goose malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) in INS-1 cells (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M.

In these studies, we were able to partially block the glucose-induced increase in malonyl-CoA levels and lessen glucose-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Despite this perturbation of the link between glucose and lipid metabolism, GSIS remained unchanged. However, the findings and conclusions of this paper have been called into question at several levels (9Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130 Suppl. 2S: 299S-304SCrossref Google Scholar, 10Komatsu M. Yajima H. Yamada S. Kaneko T. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Aizawa T.

Concerns raised include: 1) the INS-1 cell line used in our studies exhibited only a 2–4−fold stimulation of insulin secretion as glucose was raised from 3 to 15 mm, as opposed to freshly isolated rat islets, which can exhibit a 10–15-fold response. 2) It is unclear if the so-called KATP channel-independent pathway of GSIS is operative in INS-1 cells. This pathway, which is revealed when β-cells are exposed to depolarizing K+, has been implicated as the site at which lipids regulate insulin granule exocytosis (10Komatsu M. Yajima H. Yamada S.

The current study was undertaken to address these outstanding concerns. This has been facilitated by our recent development of INS-1-derived cell lines (e.g. 832/13) with robustKATP-channel-dependent and -independent GSIS (12Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Under normal ionic conditions, 832/13 cells exhibit a 10-fold increase in insulin secretion when glucose is raised from 3 to 15 mm, and are also responsive to glucose when the KATP channel is by-passed by application of depolarizing K+ and diazoxide. Thus, these cells appear to be an improved model for evaluation of secretory mechanisms relative to parental INS-1 cells, which comprised a mixture of glucose-responsive and -unresponsive cells (12Hohmeier H.E.

In addition, since publication of our prior study, the human MCD cDNA has been cloned (13Gao J. Waber L. Bennett M.J. Gibson K.M. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant forms of the cDNA lacking the mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization sequences have been inserted into adenovirus vectors. With this cadre of improved reagents, we have re-examined the effect of MCD overexpression on GSIS, and find no impairment of robust GSIS in 832/13 cells, despite complete blockade of the glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA level. These findings extend our previous observations (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and are not consistent with the LC-CoA hypothesis as originally set forth. All materials were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. The INS-1-derived cell line 832/13 was used throughout this study (12Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 11.1 mmd-glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Fragments of the cDNA encoding human MCD lacking the mitochondrial localization sequence (amino acids 1–39) or the mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization sequences (amino acids 1–39 and 490–493; see Ref. 13Gao J. Waber L. Bennett M.J. Gibson K.M. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for complete sequence of human MCD) were cloned into the adenovirus vector pACCMV.pLpA (14Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used to prepare recombinant adenoviruses (AdCMV-MCD6 and AdCMV-MCDΔ5, respectively) as described previously (15Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The resulting viruses were plaque-purified (15Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and used to treat confluent 832/13 cells at varying titers as described in the figure legends. A virus containing the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (AdCMV-βGAL) was used as a control (16Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation with viruses, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, culture medium was added, and assays and analyses were undertaken 24 h later. MCD activity was determined as the rate of decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA as previously described (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In brief, the rate of acetyl-CoA formation was monitored by cleavage of its thioester bond by carnitine acetyltransferase. The thiol group of CoA was colorimetrically measured at 412 nm over 5–10 min, a time period over which the rate of product accumulation was linear. Activity was measured either in crude cell extracts or in cytosol-enriched fractions. Crude extracts were prepared by collection of cells in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm benzamidine, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor), and homogenization by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. A portion of these extracts was used to prepare cytosol-enriched fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, transfer of the supernatant into a new tube, and further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was collected for assay of MCD activity, and values were normalized to total protein. 832/13 cells were cultured in RPMI containing 3 mm glucose for 24 h following viral treatment. Cells were washed with HEPES-balanced salt solution (HBSS: 114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmol KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25.5 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.2) containing 3 mmglucose and incubated in the same buffer for 2 h. Following this preincubation, cells were switched to HBSS containing 3 or 15 mm glucose for 30 min. Cells were collected into 2-ml isopropylene tubes by adding 1.5 ml of ice-cold 3.5% (v/v) HClO4 to each plate and centrifugation of the collected extract at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing acid-soluble metabolites was neutralized to pH 2–3 with 5n KOH and to pH 6 with 2.5 m KHCO3. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant volume was measured, prior to its transfer to a 15-ml tube. For assay, each sample was divided into two 0.2-ml aliquots. 50 pmol of malonyl-CoA was added to one of the two samples, and malonyl-CoA levels were assayed in both samples according to the method of McGarry et al. (17McGarry J.D. Stark M.J. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8291-8293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using purified fatty acid synthase. 832/13 cells in 6-well plates were harvested by light trypsinization and kept in HBSS containing 3 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were contained in center wells (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) suspended from a rubber sleeve stopper (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) inserted into a glass scintillation vial. A reaction mixture consisting of 0.5 mmpalmitic acid complexed to 1% bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free), with ∼1 × 107 cpm/μmol [1-14C]-palmitic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) as tracer, 0.8 mml-carnitine, and glucose, at a final concentration of 3 or 15 mm, was added and the vials sealed. After 2 h the reaction was terminated by injection of 100 μl of 7% perchloric acid into the center well. The rate of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation was measured as released14CO2, which was trapped by adding 300 μl of benzethonium hydroxide to the bottom of the sealed vials, followed by an additional 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Then, the center wells and rubber stoppers were discarded, scintillation mixture was added, and14CO2 counted. For assay of insulin secretion, 832/13 cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plates and treated with the various recombinant adenoviruses. After 24 h, cells were washed in HBSS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 3 mmd-glucose followed by preincubation in 3 ml of the same buffer for 2 h. Insulin secretion was then measured by static incubation of the cells for 2 h in 1.5 ml of HBSS containing glucose, triacsin C, and oleate/palmitate (2:1 molar ratio) concentrations indicated in figure legends. When ATP-sensitive K+ channel-independent GSIS was examined, the K+ concentration in the HBSS during the static incubation was increased to 35 mm, while the Na+concentration was lowered to 89.8 mm, and 250 μm diazoxide was added. Because the human proinsulin gene is stably expressed in the 832/13 cell line (12Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), insulin was measured using the Coat-a-Count kit (DPC, Los Angeles, CA). The antibody in this assay recognizes human insulin and cross-reacts ∼20% with rat insulin. Data represent mean ± S.E. and different experimental groups were compared either with a one-tailed Student's t test or a one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keul's test for comparisons post-hoc. A probability level of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In our previous work, a recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding malonyl-CoA decarboxylase from the goose uropygial gland (AdCMV-MCDgoose) was used to partially attenuate increases in malonyl-CoA levels during glucose stimulation of INS-1 cells (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The cDNA used in this virus encoded a protein that lacked its N-terminal mitochondrial, but not the C-terminal peroxisomal localization sequence. These features, coupled with its non-mammalian origin, may have limited the ability of the modified goose MCD to degrade malonyl-CoA formed in the cytosol of rat cells, which is the critical pool for modulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I enzyme activity. To deal with this concern, we have constructed three new adenoviruses containing modified human MCD cDNAs. The first of these is analagous to the goose MCD construct in that it lacks its N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence (AdCMV-MCD6), and the second lacks both the mitochondrial and SKL targeting sequences (AdCMV-MCDΔ5). Finally, a control virus was constructed containing the MCD cDNA of a patient with two point mutations in the coding sequence that render the enzyme catalytically inactive (AdCMV-MCDmut) (13Gao J. Waber L. Bennett M.J. Gibson K.M. Cohen J.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the capacity of the different recombinant adenoviruses to increase MCD activity, 832/13 cells were treated with increasing doses of the viruses. Twenty-four h after viral treatment, total MCD activity was determined in unfractionated cell extracts. As is shown in Fig.1, each of the viruses encoding functional enzymes (AdCMV-MCDgoose, AdCMV-MCD6, or AdCMV-MCDΔ5) increased enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal values ∼20-fold higher than in either of the control groups (AdCMV-βGAL-treated or AdCMV-MCDmut-treated cells). Interestingly, the maximal MCD activity achieved was 10-fold higher in this study than in our previous report (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The reasons for this increased efficiency of expression of MCD in the current study are not known, but could relate to the fact that we treated the cells with a higher viral titer over a shorter time period than in our previous study. Alternatively, expression of the construct may have been more efficient in the novel 832/13 cells than in the parental INS-1 cells used previously (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). More relevant than total MCD activity in whole cell extracts is the amount of activity residing in the cytosolic compartment of cells. To estimate this, different batches of 832/13 cells were treated with the same titers of AdCMV-MCDgoose, AdCMV-MCD6, or AdCMV-MCDΔ5 adenoviruses, and used for preparation of cytosolic cell fractions 24 h after viral treatment. Fig. 2shows that the MCD activity in the cytosolic fraction of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 was increased by 120 and 50% compared with cells treated with AdCMV-MCDgoose or AdCMV-MCD6, respectively. Thus, while the three MCD viruses caused similar increases in MCD activity in whole cell extracts, AdCMV-MCDΔ5 containing the cDNA that lacks both its mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization sequences caused a larger increase in cytosolic activity than the other two constructs. In theory, AdCMV-MCDΔ5 may therefore be a more specific tool for perturbing the link between metabolism of glucose and lipids, because the pool of malonyl-CoA that is implicated in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling is formed in the cytosol (9Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130 Suppl. 2S: 299S-304SCrossref Google Scholar). In our previous study in which goose MCD was overexpressed in INS-1 cells, cellular malonyl-CoA levels were increased in response to changes in external glucose concentrations, although total malonyl-CoA levels were significantly lower in MCD overexpressing cells than in controls (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The incomplete blockade in malonyl-CoA formation could have led to an erroneous conclusion about its role in regulation of insulin secretion. We therefore investigated the ability of our new MCD adenoviruses to lower malonyl-CoA levels in 832/13 cells. As shown in Fig.3, malonyl-CoA levels were increased by 4.8-fold in AdCMV-βGAL-treated 832/13 cells as glucose was raised from 3 to 15 mm. This glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA levels was completely blocked in 832/13 cells treated with any of the three MCD viruses, AdCMV-MCDgoose, AdCMV-MCD6, or AdCMV-MCDΔ5. The more effective blockade of malonyl-CoA production is consistent with the higher levels of enzyme activity achieved in this study compared with the previous one (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the similar performance of the three viral constructs, all subsequent experiments were carried out exclusively with AdCMV-MCDΔ5. We next proceeded to evaluate the metabolic effects of the AdCMV-MCDΔ5 virus. [1-14C]Palmitate oxidation was measured in 832/13 cells treated with a titer of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 that raised MCD activity to ∼1.8 μmol/mg/min. As shown in Fig.4, incubation of AdCMV-βGAL-treated 832/13 cells at 15 mm glucose reduced the rate of [1-14C]palmitate oxidation to 31% of that in cells incubated in 3 mm glucose. Thus, glucose regulates fatty acid oxidation in 832/13 cells in a fashion similar to what has been reported for rat islets (18Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and INS-1 cells (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, the high glucose concentration was much less effective at suppressing fatty acid oxidation in cells treated with AdCMV-MCDΔ5, such that the rate remained at 63% of that in cells incubated in 3 mmglucose. There is a possibility that the most pronounced metabolic effects of MCD overexpression occur at higher viral titers than used in the experiment of Fig. 4. Alternatively, high viral titers could have compromised certain aspects of metabolic function, so that the effects on fatty acid oxidation may have been more pronounced at lower viral titers. To address this, we determined the titer dependence of the effect of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 on fatty acid oxidation. At one-fourth the viral titer used in the foregoing experiments (5 × 105 pfu/well corresponding to an MCD activity of 0.85 μmol/mg/min) the effect of MCD overexpression to impair glucose-mediated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation was already maximal. Moreover, it was neither increased nor decreased when the titer was increased stepwise over a 4-fold range (data not shown). This incomplete reversal of glucose suppression of fatty acid oxidation in AdCMV-MCDΔ5 expressing cells, despite the complete blockade of glucose-induced malonyl-CoA accumulation, suggests that factors other than the malonyl-CoA level are involved in regulation of fatty acid oxidation by high glucose. Having established that AdCMV-MCDΔ5 blocks glucose-induced malonyl-CoA production and attenuates the inhibitory effect of glucose on fatty acid oxidation, we proceeded to evaluate the effects of this new reagent on insulin secretion. In 832/13 cells treated with the control virus AdMV-βGAL, 15 mm glucose caused a 10-fold increase in insulin secretion relative to secretion at 3 mm glucose (Fig.5 A). Cells treated with AdCMV-MCDΔ5 exhibited the same robust response to stimulatory glucose, providing clear evidence that a rise in malonyl-CoA and complete blockade of fatty acid oxidation are not required events in GSIS. This lack of effect of MCD was not specific to AdCMV-MCDΔ5, as cells treated with AdCMV-MCD6 exhibited the same potent response to stimulatory glucose (data not shown). Insulin secretion was also studied in the presence of 35 mmK+ and 250 μm diazoxide, which allows measurement of the KATP channel-independent pathway of glucose sensing (2Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that his pathway is responsible for the LC-CoA-mediated potentiation of GSIS (10Komatsu M. Yajima H. Yamada S. Kaneko T. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Aizawa T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Yajima H. Komatsu M. Yamada S. Straub S.G. Kaneko T. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Sharp G.W.G. Aizawa T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of the high K+ concentration and diazoxide, 15 mm glucose had the same stimulatory effect (2.3-fold) on insulin secretion in AdCMV-βGAL or AdCMV-MCDΔ5-treated 832/13 cells (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that blockade of malonyl-CoA production has no effect on glucose sensing via the KATP channel-independent pathway. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of INS-1 cells with triacsin C, an inhibitor of LC-CoA synthetase, results in a 50% decrease in LC-CoA levels, with no effect on GSIS (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of combined treatment of 832/13 cells with the AdCMV-MCDΔ5 virus, which blocks malonyl-CoA accumulation, and triacsin C, which lowers LC-CoA levels. The combined addition of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 and triacsin C to 832/13 cells had no effect on the 10-fold stimulation of insulin secretion by 15 mm glucose under normal culture conditions (Fig. 5 A) or on the stimulation by glucose of insulin secretion via theKATP channel-independent pathway (Fig.5 B). Thus, complete blockade of malonyl-CoA accumulation and simultaneous lowering of the cellular LC-CoA pool has no effect on GSIS. Finally, we examined the possibility that limited endogenous lipid stores in insulinoma-derived clonal β-cells could impact our ability to demonstrate a link between glucose and lipid metabolism for regulation of GSIS. To test this possibility, 832/13 cells were preincubated for 48 h in 0.5 mmoleate/palmitate, prior to treatment with AdCMV-MCDΔ5. GSIS was then assayed after an additional 24 h of culture in 0.5 mmoleate/palmitate. These maneuvers were designed to increase cellular storage of lipids. As seen in Fig. 6, culture of 832/13 for 3 days in 0.5 mm oleate/palmitate resulted in attenuation of GSIS, such that these cells exhibited a 4-fold response to 15 mm glucose, compared with the 10-fold response of cells grown in normal medium. This blunting effect of chronic culture in fatty acids is similar to that previously described in isolated rat and human islets (19Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 20Zhou Y.P. Grill V. J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab. 1995; 80: 1584-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, glucose responsiveness was not different in AdCMV-βGAL versusAdCMV-MCDΔ5-treated cells that had been cultured in the presence of 0.5 mm oleate/palmitate. The impact of acute stimulation of 832/13 cells with free fatty acid was also tested in cells cultured both in regular RPMI and in RPMI supplemented with 0.5 mm oleate/palmitate. Again, GSIS was similarly potentiated by 0.5 mm oleate/palmitate in AdCMV-βGAL and AdCMV-MCDΔ5-treated cells, regardless of whether they were preincubated with the fatty acid mixture. Thus, neither an increment in cellular lipids nor acute exogenous administration of lipids uncovers a requirement for malonyl-CoA in regulation of insulin secretion. The idea that malonyl-CoA could be a coupling factor in β-cell stimulus-secretion originated from the observation that the levels of this intermediate rise prior to insulin secretion when HIT-T15 hamster insulinoma cells are exposed to glucose (4Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M. Regazzi R. Deeney J. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the glucose-induced rise in malonyl-CoA was coincident with inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and was assumed to result in an increase in cytosolic levels of LC-CoA. That LC-CoA could be an effector molecule in β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling was further suggested by the fact that perfusion of permeabilized HIT-T15 cells with LC-CoA-esters induced insulin secretion (7Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Rhodes C.J. Prentki M. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9363-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Additional supporting evidence for the LC-CoA model comes from the use of hydroxycitrate, which inhibits ATP-citrate lyase and consequently malonyl-CoA formation. Use of this agent to disrupt the link between glucose and malonyl-CoA formation was shown to inhibit GSIS from the perfused rat pancreas (18Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and fatty acid oxidation with agents such as etomoxir-stimulated GSIS from the perfused pancreas (18Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Finally, stable expression of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase-antisense construct in INS-1 cells resulted in lowering of malonyl-CoA levels, increased fatty acid oxidation, and inhibition of GSIS (21Zhang S. Kim K.H. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, we have previously demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of goose MCD in INS-1 cells reduced malonyl-CoA levels and partially alleviated inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by glucose (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Triacsin C, an inhibitor of LC-CoA synthetase was also shown to block glucose incorporation into lipids and lower LC-CoA levels, but neither the molecular nor the pharmacologic approaches to impairing LC-CoA formation had any effect on GSIS (8Antinozzi P.A. Segall L. Prentki M. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The current study has attempted to address perceived limitations of the prior work that have come to light (9Corkey B.E. Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130 Suppl. 2S: 299S-304SCrossref Google Scholar, 10Komatsu M. Yajima H. Yamada S. Kaneko T. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Aizawa T. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and to resolve the apparent discrepancy between our work and that of others. Key improvements in our experimental approach reported herein include. 1) The use of a new INS-1-derived cell line with robust KATPchannel-dependent or -independent pathways of glucose sensing (12Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). 2) The construction of new recombinant adenoviruses containing the cDNAs encoding human forms of MCD, including one in which both the mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization sequences were removed to enhance expression of the enzyme in the cytosolic compartment. 3) New studies involving preincubation of cells in a mixture of oleate and palmitate to boost cellular lipid stores. 4) Co-application of the molecular (AdCMV-MCDΔ5) and pharmacologic (triacsin C) reagents to maximally perturb malonyl-CoA and LC-CoA synthesis. These improvements have allowed us to demonstrate in a clear and unequivocal fashion that complete blockade of malonyl-CoA accumulation has no impact on the KATPchannel-dependent or independent pathways of GSIS. The co-application of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 and triacsin C also has no effect on insulin secretion, suggesting that robust glucose sensing is not linked to changes in total LC-CoA levels. Furthermore, preincubation of 832/13 cells for 3 days in 0.5 mm oleate/palmitate impaired glucose sensing, as has been described extensively in islets (19Lee Y. Hirose H. Ohneda M. Johnson J.H. McGarry J.D. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10878-10882Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 20Zhou Y.P. Grill V. J. Clin. Endocrin. Metab. 1995; 80: 1584-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, culture of cells in fatty acids does not uncover an effect of AdCMV-MCDΔ5 on GSIS. Finally, treatment of 832/13 cells with AdCMV-MCDΔ5 does not affect fatty acid potentiation of GSIS, supporting the view that this action of fatty acids is not related to their oxidation (18Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How can our findings be reconciled with those supporting the malonyl-CoA/LC-CoA model of glucose sensing? First, the rise in malonyl-CoA levels that occurs prior to insulin release is not proof of a causal relationship between the two phenomena. Also, the recently reported effect of palmitoyl-CoA on insulin secretion is modest, and the use of permeabilized cells in these studies raises questions about the physiological relevance of the experiment (7Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Rhodes C.J. Prentki M. Berggren P.O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9363-9368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, in view of the proposed critical role of mitochondrial metabolism in GSIS (22Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3833-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), abrogation of GSIS conferred by hydroxycitrate may be due in part to perturbed mitochondrial metabolism. It should also be noted that the inhibitory effect of hydroxycitrate on GSIS is not observed in isolated rat islets (23Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The enhanced GSIS that accompanies inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitors may be explained by the fact that these compounds, e.g.2-bromopalmitate or etomoxir, are modified fatty acids, which may act like native lipids to potentiate GSIS independent of their effects on fatty acid oxidation (18Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Finally, chronic lowering of malonyl-CoA levels in INS-1 cells with a stable transfection strategy may cause profound alterations in β-cell metabolism and function (21Zhang S. Kim K.H. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Of particular concern here is that chronic lowering of malonyl-CoA levels could result in depletion of stored lipids. It has been shown that depletion of β-cell lipids in nicotinamide-treated animals or humans (24Stein D.T. Esser V. Stevenson B.E. Lane K.E. Whiteside J.H. Daniels M.B. Chen S. McGarry J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25Dobbins R.L. Chester M.W. Daniels M.B. McGarry J.D. Stein D.T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or in hyperleptinemic rats (26Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M.Y. Lee Y. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) blocks insulin secretion in response to glucose and many other secretagogues. Interestingly, in both cases, GSIS is immediately restored by provision of free fatty acids. These findings clearly support an essential role for lipids in regulation of insulin secretion, possibly at the level of membrane lipid turnover or acylation of regulatory proteins. The latter possibility is also supported by recent studies in which insulin secretion was inhibited by addition of cerulenin, an inhibitor of protein acylation (11Yajima H. Komatsu M. Yamada S. Straub S.G. Kaneko T. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Hashizume K. Sharp G.W.G. Aizawa T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, while a minimal pool of lipids may be essential for normal regulation of insulin secretion, the current study provides strong evidence that glucose sensing can occur in the absence of a rise in malonyl-CoA and despite acute perturbation of lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2004715593,"Bovine odorant-binding protein (bOBP) is a dimeric lipocalin present in large amounts in the respiratory and olfactory nasal mucosa. The structure of bOBP refined at 2.0-Å resolution revealed an elongated volume of electron density inside each buried cavity, indicating the presence of one (or several) naturally occurring copurified ligand(s) (Tegoni et al. (1996)Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 863–867; Bianchet et al.(1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 934–939). In the present work, by combining mass spectrometry, x-ray crystallography (1.8-Å resolution), and fluorescence, it has been unambiguously established that natural bOBP contains the racemic form of 1-octen-3-ol. This volatile substance is a typical component of bovine breath and in general of odorous body emanations of humans and animals. The compound 1-octen-3-ol is also an extremely potent olfactory attractant for many insect species, including some parasite vectors likeAnopheles (Plasmodium) or Glossina(Trypanosoma). For the first time, a function can be assigned to an OBP, with a possible role of bOBP in the ecological relationships between bovine and insect species.1G851HN2 Bovine odorant-binding protein (bOBP) is a dimeric lipocalin present in large amounts in the respiratory and olfactory nasal mucosa.

Biochem. 1985; 149: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These 19-kDa soluble proteins are produced in large amounts in seromucous glands of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium and are secreted in the mucus that layers the surface of nasal mucosa (5Bignetti E. Cavaggioni A. Pelosi P. Persaud K.C. Sorbi R.T. Tirindelli R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). OBPs belong to the lipocalin family, which is composed of structurally related soluble proteins that bind different types of small hydrophobic molecules (6Tegoni M. Pelosi P. Vincent F. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Grolli S. Ramoni R. Cambillau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). These proteins are usually monomeric and are formed of a nine-strand β-barrel and a C-terminal α-helix (6Tegoni M. Pelosi P. Vincent F. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Grolli S. Ramoni R. Cambillau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 7Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Bovine OBP is a dimer in which the C-terminal domain (residues 125–159) is swapped between the two monomers, a peculiar feature that seems to be specific to the bovine species (8Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 9Bianchet M.A. Bains G. Pelosi P. Pevsner J. Snyder S.H. Monaco H.L. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). An elongated volume of electron density was observed in each of the two internal buried cavities. In the 2.0-Å resolution electron density we assigned this electron density to an unknown molecule of 8–10 non-hydrogen atoms (8Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), whereas Bianchet et al. (9Bianchet M.A. Bains G. Pelosi P. Pevsner J. Snyder S.H. Monaco H.L. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) tentatively assigned it to a terpenoid compound, citronnellyl acetate. Several structures of lipocalins have revealed the presence of specific or nonspecific copurified ligand in their binding sites, such as retinol in retinol-binding protein (10Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and pheromones in the major urinary protein (11Böcskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The structure of porcine OBP, instead, revealed an empty cavity (12Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Bonicel J. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7913-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The recent characterization of the binding properties of porcine OBP (pOBP) in solution and in the crystal (13Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) has established that a high degree of hydrophobicity coupled to a molecular mass between 160 and 200 daltons is the main requirement for a ligand to match the β-barrel cavities, independently of its odorous properties, chemical class, and molecular structure. Some of the ligands of pOBP have a very low olfactory threshold (13Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas others, for instance the toxic 7–11 carbon alkyl aldehydes (14Eckl P. Ortner A. Esterbauer H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 290: 183-192Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), cannot be considered real odorous compounds (15Pelosi P. Tirindelli R. Brand J.G. Teeter J.H. Cagan R.H. Kare M.R. Chemical Senses. 1. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 207-226Google Scholar). The K d values, obtained or estimated from direct and competitive equilibrium binding experiments, are in the micromolar range for most of the OBP ligands (1Pelosi P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 199-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol.

The peculiar binding properties of OBPs with respect to other lipocalins (low ligand specificity and low affinities) and the very high quantities of protein found in nasal epithelium have suggested that OBPs might function as odorant carriers and/or scavengers for olfactory receptors or that they might be involved in endogenous detoxification processes (19Boudjelal M. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this latter hypothesis it has been proposed that OBPs might deliver, to the appropriate degradative pathways, some toxic compounds produced during nasal epithelium turnover and inflammatory processes in charge of the nasal mucosa (19Boudjelal M. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and at present, no direct experimental evidence supports or excludes any of them. On the contrary, the present data suggest that the two functions might be carried out in parallel. In the present work, the unambiguous identification of the copurified natural ligand of bovine OBP as the insect attractant 1-octen-3-ol makes it possible to hypothesize a role for bOBP in the ecological relationships between bovine and several insect species. Single bovine nasal mucosa samples were collected during fall and winter from freshly slaughtered 16–18-month-old males of different geographical origins (Northern Italy and France). OBP was purified according to the procedure previously reported by Bignetti et al. (20Bignetti E. Damiani G. De Negri P. Ramoni R. Avanzini F. Ferrari G. Rossi G.L. Chem. Senses. 1987; 12: 601-608Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, purification consists of an ammonium sulfate fractionation of the soluble proteins in the extract of nasal mucosa, followed by two rounds of fast protein liquid anion exchange chromatography (Baker bond and Mono-Q) and a final acidic step. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its functionality was determined in binding tests with 1-aminoanthracene (AMA) as fluorescent probe (21Patel R.C. Lange D. McConathy J.M. Patel Y.C. Patel S.C. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Paolini S. Tanfani F. Fini C. Bertoli E. Pelosi P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The molar absorption coefficient of 47,000 (M−1cm−1/bOBP dimer) at 280 nm was determined according to the Edelhoc method (24Edelhoc H. Biochemistry. 1967; 22: 1948-1954Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar) as described by Paceet al. (25Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The natural ligand was extracted from samples of native and denatured OBP with different organic solvents (diethyl ether, methylene chloride, and hexane). The protein (a 7.0-mg/ml OBP solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) was previously denatured by overnight incubation at room temperature in the presence of 7.5 m urea. The ligand extraction was performed by vortexing mixtures of OBP-organic solvent in glass tubes (1:1 volumetric ratio), and the organic phases were analyzed by GC/MS. Aliquots of Tris buffer and Tris buffer containing 7.5 murea were treated with the same extraction procedure, and the organic phases were analyzed by GC/MS as blanks. Analyses were conducted on a Varian Saturn II trap spectrometer coupled to a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph. Mass spectra were recorded in electronic impact mode, with a mass range of 40–300 atomic mass units. A 30-m, 0.32-mm internal dimension, 0.5-μm df RTX-5MS column (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) was used for analysis, and the program temperature was from 50 °C (1 min) to 280 °C at 10 °C/min with helium as carrier gas at 10 p.s.i. pressure. Samples were injected in a septum programmable injector heated at 250 °C. Chemical ionization was conducted on a Nermag R10–10C quadrupole mass spectrometer, with ammonia as reactant gas at 10−4pressure in the source housing. Spectra were recorded with a mass range of 70–300 atomic mass units. The mass spectrometer was coupled to a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a Ross injector heated at 240 °C and a similar column used with the same program temperature. To determine the R or S configuration of the natural product, derivatization of standard and natural compound were conducted as follows. A solution of pyridine (50 mg/ml) in dry ether (15 μl) and a solution of S-lactyl chloride reagent (26Slessor K.N. King C.C.S. Miller D.R. Winston M.L. Cutforth T.L. J. Chem. Ecol. 1985; 11: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (25 mg/ml) in dry methylene chloride (30 μl) was added to a solution of standard commercially available 1-octen-3-ol (racemic orR-(−)) (50 ng) in hexane (30 μl) or natural extract in hexane (40 μl) placed in a micro-conic flask. Closed flasks were kept at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was then diluted with hexane (50 μl) and washed successively with water (50 μl), aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate (2 × 50 μl), and water (50 μl). The samples were directly analyzed by GC/MS. Four samples of bOBP coming from animals of different geographical origin yielded indistinguishable results. OBP crystals were obtained by micro-dialysis of a 10 mg/ml protein solution against 28–32% ethanol, in 50 mmcitrate, pH 5.4 at 4 °C. The crystals belong to the space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 55.9 Å,b = 65.5 Å, c = 42.7 Å, and β = 98.8°, and contain one homodimer in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected on a Mar-research 345 image plate placed on a Rigaku RU2000 rotating anode. Data collection was performed at room temperature, because cryocooling always yielded data sets that could not be used in refinement. Indexation and integration were performed with DENZO (27Otwinovski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.W. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. DLSCI/R34 Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 56-63Google Scholar); data scaling was performed with SCALA (28Collaborative Computing Project 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 766.Google Scholar); and data reduction was performed by TRUNCATE (28Collaborative Computing Project 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 766.Google Scholar) (see Table I). The bOBP·AMA complex was obtained by soaking the crystals in a synthetic crystallization solution containing 2 mm AMA overnight at 4 °C. Data collection, scaling, and reduction were performed as with native bOBP (see Table I).Table IData collection and final refinement statisticsbOBP/AMAbOBP/octenolData collectionResolution limit (Å)18–1.8055.0–1.80Data completion (I/ς[I] > I) %92.097.8I > ς[I] (all/last shell) aR sym = Σ (Σ‖I(h)i − 〈I(h)〉‖/Σ〈I(h)〉)/n;I(h)i is the observed intensity of thei-th measurement of reflection h, and 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity of reflectionh.

Open table in a new tab The refinement of bovine OBP containing its natural ligand or AMA made use of the previously determined bOBP structure as a starting model (8; 1OBP). The atomic structure of 1-octen-3-ol and of AMA were built with the program TURBO-FRODO (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar), and topology and force field data were defined in the suitable files of CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1997Google Scholar) by the automated procedure XDICT (G.L. Kleywegt). The models were then refined using CNS version 1.0 (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1997Google Scholar). Cycles of refinement were alternated with manual refitting into sigmaA-weighted electron density maps (31Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) with the graphic program TURBO-FRODO (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). The final model of native bOBP has R work and R freevalues of 20.3 and 22.7%, respectively (see Table I), and the final model of the bOBP·AMA complex has R workand R free values of 21.0 and 23.7%, respectively (Table I). The (F obs −F calc)exp(i a calc) maps did not show any uninterpretable features. The final models have a good geometry according to the PROCHECK criteria (32Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 91-97Crossref Google Scholar), with 91.1% of residues located in the most favorable area, 8.9% in additional allowed regions, and no residues in forbidden zones. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers1G85 (native) and 1HN2 (AMA). The fluorescence binding assay of AMA to bOBP and the competition between AMA and 1-octen 3-ol were realized according to the method published by Paolini et al.(22Paolini S. Tanfani F. Fini C. Bertoli E. Pelosi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. To avoid interference with the protein absorption band, the excitation wavelength was chosen at 380 nm, where an AMA absorption band is observed, instead of 295 nm (22Paolini S. Tanfani F. Fini C. Bertoli E. Pelosi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or 255 nm (23Briand L. Nespoulos C. Perez V. Rémy J.-J. Huet J.-C. Pernollet J.-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The stock solutions of AMA (1–10 mm) in ethanol were preserved in the dark at 4 °C and used within 4 days. The influence of the concentration of ethanol on the chasing process of AMA was tested and found to be negligible up to 1% v/v, a result in contrast with the behavior of rat OBP reported in Briand et al. (23Briand L. Nespoulos C. Perez V. Rémy J.-J. Huet J.-C. Pernollet J.-C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3079-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of the direct binding, the titration curves were prepared incubating different samples of bOBP (0.76 μm dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5% ethanol (v/v)) with various amounts of AMA ranging from 0.019 to 10 μm for 24 h at 4 °C. In the case of the competition curves, the bOBP samples were incubated with a fixed amount of 2 μm AMA and increasing concentrations of 1-octen-3-ol (0.39–50 μm). Fluorescence emission spectra between 450 and 550 nm were recorded at a fixed excitation wavelength of 380 nm using a PerkinElmer LS 50 luminescence spectrometer, and the formation of the bOBP·AMA complex was detected by the increase of the fluorescence emission intensity at 480 nm. The concentration of the complex was evaluated on the basis of a calibration curve obtained by incubating increasing concentrations of AMA (0.076–5 μm) with a saturating amount of bOBP (10 μm). The binding and competition curves were analyzed using the nonlinear fitting facility of Sigma Plot 5.0 (Cambridge Soft Corp., Cambridge, MA). The bOBP organic extract analyzed by gas chromatography yields a prominent peak (Fig.1 A). Comparison of control and native or denatured bOBP showed a single peak difference in mass spectra. After comparison with the Environmental Protection Agency/National Institutes of Health library, the electronic impact mass spectrum of this compound (ions atm/z 41, 43, 55, 57 (100% base pic), 72, 81, 99, 110) was found to correspond to a C8 monoethylenic alcohol (Fig. 1 C). This was confirmed with CI/NH3 data exhibiting ions at m/z 128 and 146 ((M + NH4)+), leading to a C8H16O formula. Ions atm/z 57 and 72 (McLafferty rearrangement) in the electronic impact mass spectrum and comparison of the retention times of standards indicated the presence of a secondary alcohol and led us to propose the structure of 1-octen-3-ol (Fig.1 C). Tentative separation of the racemic standard on a chiral gas chromatography column failed. The derivatization of 1-octen-3-ol yielded two peaks in the same gas chromatography conditions (50/50 ratio and electronic impact mass spectra with characteristic ions at m/z 115 and 127 atomic mass units). The derivatization of the natural compound under identical conditions also yielded two peaks with identical mass, retention time, and intensities (Fig. 1 B). As described previously, bOBP is a dimer consisting of 2 × 159 residues at neutral or basic pH and monomerizes at pH values below 4.5 (20Bignetti E. Damiani G. De Negri P. Ramoni R. Avanzini F. Ferrari G. Rossi G.L. Chem. Senses. 1987; 12: 601-608Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 2.0-Å resolution structure of bOBP has been reported elsewhere (8Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, each monomer is composed of a lipocalin-type nine-strand β-barrel comprising residues 15–121 (strands 1–8) and residues 145–149 (strand 9) from the other monomer (Fig.2 A). From residue 123 onwards, the topology diverges from the consensus lipocalin fold. The β-barrel is connected by an extended stretch of residues 123–126 to the α-helix protruding out of the β-barrel and crossing the dimer interface (Fig. 2 A). As a consequence, the α-helix of one monomer is placed close to where the α-helix of the other monomer would be if bOBP had a classical lipocalin fold, in a special arrangement called domain swapping (33Bennet J.M. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In the present structure, the two bOBP polypeptidic chains are visible from residues 1–159 and 3–157 for molecules A and B, respectively. Inside the β-barrel of each monomer, a large buried cavity of about 407 Å3 is observed (Fig. 2 A), at a location similar to that observed in other closed lipocalins, such as the major urinary protein (11Böcskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Both cavities contain an elongated patch of electron density map, which has been attributed to an 8–10 non-hydrogen atom linear compound in the structure at 2.0-Å resolution (8Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because of the significant improvements in resolution (1.8 Å), data treatment, map calculation, and refinement procedures, interpretable features came out in the difference maps within the buried cavities. Having determined the nature of the ligand by GC/MS, we could fit a molecule of 1-octen-3-ol in each difference electron density map. After CNS refinement, significant patches of electron density still remained in the difference Fourier maps. The two enantiomers of 1-octen-3-ol were then fitted in the most appropriate conformations, and their occupancies were refined in CNS. The resulting structure contains both enantiomers in a ratio close to 1, a result in accord with the GC/MS data (Fig. 2, C and D). In cavity A, the two isomers have very similar orientations and are quasi-superimposed (Fig. 2 C). The aliphatic chains of the two isomers are extended and remain close to each other. The hydroxyl groups point in the same direction, toward an area of the cavity where no hydrogen bond donor is available, however. The positions of the two 1-octen-3-ol enantiomers in the two cavities are slightly different (Fig. 2, C and D), because of a rotation around the ω atom. This movement leaves an empty space in the cavity, between the aliphatic chain of the ligands and the Oγ atom of Thr-38, which is filled by a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the Oγ atom (Fig. 2 E). The structure of the bOBP·AMA complex reveals two very well ordered AMA molecules in the buried cavities (Fig. 2 A). This indicates clearly that these cavities are the general binding site of bOBP, as in pOBP (6Tegoni M. Pelosi P. Vincent F. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Grolli S. Ramoni R. Cambillau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 13Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol.

Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The orientation of AMA in the binding pocket is comparable with that of 1-octen-3-ol, with the long axis perpendicular to the axis of the β-barrel (Fig. 2,A and B). The walls of these cavities are mostly composed of hydrophobic residues. The water-accessible surface area of bOBP alone or with its ligand was calculated for all the residues. The ligands cover 150 Å2 of each cavity surface. Residues Phe-36, Phe-89, Asn-103, Tyr-83, and Phe-54 display the larger loss of surface accessibility upon complexation (10–12 Å2) (TableII). The residues involved in the interaction with the ligand are identical in the two cavities and have similar variation of accessibility. Furthermore, all the residues of both cavities are superimposable, including Phe-89, which is found with two different conformations in each cavity (Fig. 2 E).Table IIInteractions of the natural ligand, the racemic 1-octen-3-ol, with the residues of bOBP internal cavitiesCavity ACavity BIle-2289Phe-361821Thr-3889Phe-40119Phe-541011Phe-56811Val-6976Ala-8145Tyr-83109Asn-8778Phe-891317Ala-10133Asn-1031717Leu-11588Thr-11623Gly-11723Phe-11999Total145154The difference in water-accessible surface between free and bound bOBP have been calculated for each residue (Å2). Open table in a new tab The difference in water-accessible surface between free and bound bOBP have been calculated for each residue (Å2). The fluorescence properties of AMA when surrounded by a hydrophobic environment have already been used to probe binding in pOBP (20Bignetti E. Damiani G. De Negri P. Ramoni R. Avanzini F. Ferrari G. Rossi G.L. Chem. Senses. 1987; 12: 601-608Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and porcine salivary OBP (34Loebel D. Scaloni A. Paolini A. Fini C. Ferrara L. Breer H. Pelosi P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We have determined the binding affinity of AMA for ligand-depleted bOBP by titrating at 480 nm the increase in fluorescence signal of AMA upon complexation to the protein (Fig. 3 A). The hyperbolic titration curve, with a maximum saturation level of 1.61 molecules of AMA per bOBP molecule, indicates a clear stoichiometry of two AMA molecules per bOBP dimer. The titration of non-extracted bOBP yields a stoichiometry of 1.85 AMA molecules per bOBP dimer (data not shown), indicating some degradation of bOBP during ligand extraction. The K d of AMA for bOBP is 1.0 μm, a value within the range found for most odors toward OBPs (7Flower D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 12Spinelli S.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 227-242Google Scholar). Because x-ray crystallography experiments indicated that AMA binds in the internal cavities of bOBP described in the previous paragraph, competition of AMA by odors should titrate the same binding site of bOBP, which is the functionally relevant one. We have determined the binding affinity of 1-octen-3-ol (racemic) by chasing saturating amounts of AMA bound to the internal cavities of bOBP. The decrease of AMA fluorescence at 480 nm was recorded as a function of 1-octen-3-ol concentration (Fig. 3 B). The competition curve has a hyperbolic decay with an apparentK d value of 9.6 μm. The almost complete displacement of AMA indicates a stoichiometry of two 1-octen-3-ol molecules per bOBP dimer. Taking into account the K dapp of 9.6 μm, the AMA K dAMA constant of 1.0 μm, the AMA concentration of 2 μm, the Equation 1 below yields a real K dodor value of 3.3 μm, for the true dissociation constant of 1-octen-3-ol for OBP. This value indicates that AMA is a better ligand than 1-octen-3-ol for OBP. Kdtrue=Kdapp×11+(1/KdAMA×[AMA])Equation 1 Identification of lipocalin-bound compounds based on mass spectroscopy coupled to x-ray structure determination has already been successful in the past, for example in the case of the major urinary protein, where four pheromonal components were identified as copurified ligands (11Böcskei Z. Groom C.R. Flower D.R. Wright C.E. Phillips S.E.V. Cavaggioni A. Findlay J.B.C. North A.C.T. Nature. 1992; 360: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This procedure failed, however, with aphrodisin, another pheromonal lipocalin (35Vincent F. Löbel D. Brown K. Spinelli S. Grote P. Breer H. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, by using the same type of procedure, we have identified a unique compound, the racemic 1-octen-3-ol, as the naturally occurring copurified ligand of bOBP. Furthermore, both R and S isomers were found to match nicely the electron density maps of the bOBP natural ligand at 1.8-Å resolution. The contacts between the ligand and amino acid residues of the β-barrel cavities have been characterized at the atomic level. The x-ray structure of the fluorescent probe AMA has revealed that it binds in the same cavity as 1-octen-3-ol. Although several reports of OBP fluorescence titration with AMA are available in the literature, we provide here the first direct evidence that AMA binds in the lipocalin internal pocket. This gives more weight to fluorescence experiments based on ligand displacement, such as those described here. All these results converge to unambiguously identify 1-octen-3-ol (R,S) as the natural copurified ligand of bOBP. Previous studies in solution (1Pelosi P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Pelosi P. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have shown that a high degree of hydrophobicity coupled to a molecular mass between 160 and 200 daltons is the main requirement for a ligand to fit the β-barrel cavities of OBP, irrespective of the chemical class, substituents, and molecular structure. These compounds can be odorous chemical messengers that strongly contribute to mediate the relationship between an individual animal and its environment, in food search, mating, etc. (36Krieger J. Breer H. Science. 1999; 286: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), or toxic compounds such as natural and synthetic pollutants (19Boudjelal M. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, among all potential ligands of OBPs, two groups can be distinguished: exogenous compounds inhaled from the environment and endogenous compounds produced by the animal. The endogenous compounds can be produced in the nasal mucosa itself as consequence of physiological epithelium turnover, inflammation, and injuries resulting from the action of physical (temperature and humidity), chemical (pollutants and oxidants passing through respiratory airways), and biological (parasites, bacteria, and viruses) aggression. They can also be produced and released by organs (lung, stomach, bloodstream, etc.) and flow through the nasal cavity as breath components. In this context, it is particularly striking to observe that 1-octen-3-ol has an endogenous origin in bovine species and in ruminants in general (37Takken W. Knols B.G.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It is produced in large quantities from fatty acids by lipoxigenases (38Husson F. Couturier A. Kermasha S. Belin J.M. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 1998; 5: 159-163Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) probably associated to the ruminal microflora and then released in the environment as a component of the breath of the animal (37Takken W. Knols B.G.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that 1-octen-3-ol has a relevant role in the olfactory chemoreception-driven behavior of many worldwide insect species, including parasite vehicles like Anopheles andGlossina (38Husson F. Couturier A. Kermasha S. Belin J.M. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 1998; 5: 159-163Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39van den Broek I.V.F. den Otter C.J. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These insects express in their antennae two receptors specific for the breath components 1-octen-3-ol and carbon dioxide, respectively. Their simultaneous stimulation drives host-seeking behavior toward bovines through their breath components (37Takken W. Knols B.G.J. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1999; 44: 131-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The identification of 1-octen-3-ol as the bOBP naturally observed ligand suggests that bOBP might be used by bovines to remove parts of 1-octen-3-ol from the breath flowing through the nasal cavities and to make them less appealing for several insect species. This would result in a general decrease of the number of insect bites and furthermore might partially protect the animal from parasitosis and infectious diseases carried by these insect vectors. This hypothesis on the possible role of OBP in the ecological relationships between bovine and insect species must be limited, at present, to the case of bovine species, because only in this case has the presence and the role of the breath component 1-octen-3-ol in the ecological relationships with insects been extensively documented. Besides, this function should not be taken as an alternative to the other roles previously proposed, such as that of a binder of exogenous compounds. All the possible putative roles of OBPs in mammalian physiology, toward either endogenous or exogenous compounds, are compatible with their above-mentioned capacity to bind several classes of small molecules, with their stability, and with their abundant production and presence in nasal mucosa."

Like many other peptide hormones, gastrin is synthesized as a large precursor molecule of 101 amino acids (Fig. 1), which is converted to progastrin (80 amino acids) by cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide. Progastrin is processed further by endo- and carboxypeptidases and by C-terminal amidation to yield the final end products glycine-extended gastrin17 and amidated gastrin17 (1Dockray G.J. Varro A. Dimaline R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 767-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although amidated gastrins were thought originally to be the only forms of the hormone with biological activity, glycine-extended gastrin17 has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of several cell lines (2Seva C.

Progastrin itself appears to act as a growth factor for normal colon, because transgenic mice expressing progastrin in the liver have increased concentrations of serum progastrin and a hyperplastic colonic mucosa (5Wang T.C.

In addition, the observation of increased numbers of aberrant crypt foci (6Singh P. Velasco M. Given R. Wargovich M. Varro A. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G390-G399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tumors (7Singh P. Velasco M. Given R. Varro A. Wang T.C.

However, the possibility should be borne in mind that progastrin, or a breakdown product, might have been acting indirectly on a tissue other than the colonic mucosa to release a second growth factor responsible for the effects observed in the colon. The possibility that colorectal carcinoma cells might utilize progastrin or progastrin-derived peptides as autocrine growth factors has recently received considerable attention (8Baldwin G.S. Shulkes A. Gut. 1998; 42: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The autocrine model predicts that a cell synthesizes a particular growth factor, which, after release into the surrounding medium, binds to specific receptors on the surface of the same cell and stimulates the proliferation of that cell. The observation that expression of antisense gastrin mRNA inhibits proliferation of colon-derived cell lines in vitro and in vivo (3Singh P. Owlia A. Varro A. Dai B. Rajaraman S. Wood T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4111-4115PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hollande F. Imdahl A. Mantamadiotis T. Ciccotosto G.D. Shulkes A. Baldwin G.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1576-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) provides strong evidence that progastrin or progastrin-derived peptides may act as autocrine growth factors in colorectal carcinoma. As predicted by the autocrine model, most colon carcinomas and derived cell lines synthesize gastrin mRNA and progastrin-derived peptides (see Ref. 8Baldwin G.S. Shulkes A. Gut. 1998; 42: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar for review) and increased concentrations of progastrin-derived peptides have been detected in the sera of patients with colorectal carcinoma (9Ciccotosto G.D. McLeish A. Hardy K.J. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the identity of gastrin receptors on colorectal carcinomas is still unclear (see Ref. 8Baldwin G.S. Shulkes A. Gut. 1998; 42: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar for review). Experiments on the role of progastrin and its receptors in the development of colorectal carcinoma have been limited by the scarcity of the prohormone. Small amounts of progastrin1–80 (less than 1 nmol/gm tissue) have been isolated from human tissues (10Rehfeld J.F. Johnsen A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but the largest progastrin-derived peptide available in bulk to date via organic synthesis is progastrin20–71 (10Rehfeld J.F. Johnsen A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The related prohormone procholecystokinin (pro-CCK)1 has been expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (11Wang W. Yum L. Beinfeld M.C. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1295-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have now developed a method for expression and purification of progastrin6–80 from Escherichia coli, to test directly its biological activities on colon-derived cell lines in vitro, to measure its affinity for gastrin and CCK receptors, and to investigate its structure. Previous structural studies on progastrin-derived peptides have been limited to investigation of the conformation of gastrin17and shorter fragments by circular dichroism and ultraviolet and NMR spectroscopy (Refs. 12Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E.

Binding of three Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions to human [Nle11]-gastrin13 and [Nle15]-gastrin17 was observed in trifluoroethanol (12Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1225-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but the affinities are presumably considerably lower in aqueous solution because no binding was detected by either circular dichroism (12Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or NMR spectroscopy (14Torda A.E. Baldwin G.S. Norton R.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1720-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In trifluoroethanol the dissociation constants for binding of Ca2+ to the three sites in [Nle15]-gastrin17 wereK 1 = 0.29 μm,K 2 = 0.29 μm, andK 3 = 7.1 μm. To determine whether the N- and C-terminal extensions of progastrin6–80increased its affinity for metal ions, samples of recombinant human progastrin6–80 were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Here we report that progastrin6–80 is biologically active and contains a single tightly bound calcium ion. With the exception of the well known zinc-dependent polymerization of insulin and proinsulin (15Blundell T.L. Dodson G.G. Dodson E. Hodgkin D.C. Vijayan M. Recent Prog. Horm.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Clones with the insert in the correct orientation were selected by restriction mapping. The predicted sequence of the fusion protein, which was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, consisted of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) joined to progastrin1–80 by a 6-amino acid linker (GSEFQA) arising from the multiple cloning site. The GST-progastrin fusion protein was purified from sarkosyl lysates ofE. coli by binding to glutathione-agarose as described by Frangioni and Neel (19Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain NM522 was transformed with the plasmid of interest and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. The overnight culture (40 ml) was used to inoculate the same medium (360 ml). When an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8 was reached, the expression of the GST-progastrin fusion protein was induced by treatment with 0.1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 6 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellet was washed in cold STE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in 24 ml of STE buffer containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme. After incubation on ice for 15 min dithiothreitol was added to 5 mm, and proteins were solubilized with 1.5% Sarkosyl (Sigma). After vortexing for 15 s, cells were sonicated for 2 × 30 s (power level, 4; duty cycle, 50%) in a model 250 sonifier (Branson Sonic Power Co., Danbury, CT). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and Triton X-100 was added to 2%. After vortexing for 10 s, washed glutathione-agarose beads (2 ml/10 ml lysate, 50% (v/v) suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) were added, and the suspension was gently mixed by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS by repeated low speed centrifugation and resuspension in PBS. Finally the beads with the GST-progastrin fusion protein attached were stored at −70 °C in storage buffer (1 ml/1 ml of beads, 50 mm Na+Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The protein content of samples at various stages of the purification was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels with a buffer system designed for peptides and proteins in the molecular mass range 5–70 kDa (20Gallagher S.R. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 10.1.11-10.1.12Google Scholar). Progastrin was cleaved from the GST-progastrin fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads by incubation with thrombin (8 units, Sigma) in cleavage buffer (1 ml/1 ml of beads, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following cleavage, the supernatant containing progastrin was separated from the beads by centrifugation. The beads were washed with elution buffer (1 ml/1 ml of beads, 1 m urea, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5), and the washes were combined with the initial supernatant. The recombinant human progastrin prepared above was applied to a C18 column (8 × 100 mm, Waters Associates, Milford, MA), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 20% acetonitrile. The progastrin was eluted with a gradient from 20–50% acetonitrile in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and dried on a Speed Vac (Savant, Hicksville, NY) for radioimmunoassay, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequencing. The concentrations of recombinant human progastrin in chromatographic fractions were measured by radioimmunoassay as previously described (9Ciccotosto G.D. McLeish A. Hardy K.J. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum (1137) was raised in rabbits against an undecapeptide consisting of the C-terminal gastrin decapeptide with an additional tyrosine residue at the N terminus for iodination (9Ciccotosto G.D. McLeish A. Hardy K.J. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A C-terminal flanking peptide standard curve was constructed with 125I-C-terminal flanking peptide as label. The ID50 was 1.3 ± 0.2 fmol/tube, and the intra-assay variation was <7%. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Sciex API-300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) fitted with a micro-ionspray ion source (flow rate, 0.2 μl/min), previously calibrated to an accuracy of ±0.01% using singly charged poly(propylene glycol) reference ions. Samples (2–4 μl) from reverse phase HPLC fractions were mixed with 1:1 acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid prior to analysis. Signal-averaged mass spectra obtained from 50–100 scans over 5–10 min using anm/z scan range of 100–3000 daltons/unit charge (Da/z) (half-height peak width, 0.6 Da/z) were subsequently analyzed using Sciex BioMultiview software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). N-terminal amino acid sequences were obtained by sequential Edman degradation using a Hewlett-Packard G1005A automated protein sequencing system, calibrated with phenylthiohydantoin-derivative standards prior to each sequencing run. Samples of recombinant human progastrin from reverse phase HPLC were concentrated on a Speed Vac to remove acetonitrile, treated with 10 mm EDTA in 8 m urea for 16 h at 4 °C, transferred to SpectraPor dialysis tubing (molecular mass cut-off, 3.5 kDa; Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX), and dialyzed against 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 10 μm EDTA and 0.005% Tween 20 for 6 days at 4 °C. Control samples were treated in parallel except that the EDTA/urea treatment was omitted. Samples of dialyzed progastrin and of the dialysis buffers were analyzed in triplicate for the presence of aluminum, calcium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, scandium, titanium, vanadium, and zinc by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy using a Varian Liberty Series II spectroscope fitted with an axial torch (Varian, Mulgrave, Australia). Concentrations of progastrin were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm, which was determined on a Cary 5 spectrophotometer (Varian, Mulgrave, Australia). Cell proliferation was measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine. The conditionally transformed mouse colon cell line YAMC (16Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) was plated onto sterile 14-mm coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1 unit/ml γ-interferon and grown overnight at 33 °C. The cells were then transferred to 39 °C and washed once in PBS, and the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine but without fetal calf serum or interferon. After 24 h cells were incubated for a further 18 h in the same medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and 100 μm bromodeoxyuridine, with or without the factors to be tested. The cells were then rinsed once with PBS, fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol at 4 °C, and washed three times in PBS. The cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% HCl for 10 min, washed once in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with a mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody. After three rinses in PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. After three further rinses the coverslips were mounted on slides with cytifluor and observed on a fluorescence microscope. COS7 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (21Mantamadiotis T. Baldwin G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1382-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, 0.7–1.0 × 106 COS cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown in 5% CO2 such that on the day of transfection the cells were 60% confluent. On the day of transfection, a DNA/DEAE-dextran solution was prepared by dropwise addition of 0.5 ml 2 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in PBS to 0.5 ml of 0.1% glucose in PBS containing 3.5 μg/ml pRFNeo plasmid DNA encoding either the human CCK-A or the human CCK-B receptor (22Kennedy K. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with PBS and gently rocked at 37 °C for 20 min in the DNA/DEAE-dextran solution. The solution was then replaced with 10 ml of 100 μm chloroquine, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3.5 h. After incubation, the solution was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum overnight. On the next day, the transfected cells were dislodged with 0.02% EDTA, replated onto a 24-well dish (20,000–50,000/well) and grown for a further 48 h prior to the receptor binding assay. Binding of progastrin to either the human CCK-A receptor or the human gastrin/CCK-B receptor was measured by competition for 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter CCK8 binding as described by Kopin and coworkers (23Kopin A.S. Lee Y.-M. McBride E.W. Miller L.J. Lu M. Lin H.Y. Kolakowski L.F. Beinborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3605-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Transfected COS7 cells were grown to 60–70% confluence as described above, washed once with PBS, and then incubated for 80 min at 37 °C in 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing125I-CCK8 (50,000 cpm, 14.5 fmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 150 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% bacitracin, and 0.1% BSA. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed with 300 μl of 1 m NaOH. Lysates were counted in a γ-counter (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland) at 77% efficiency. Estimates of IC50 values and of the levels of125I-CCK8 bound in the absence of competitor were fitted as previously described (24Yang Z. Hollande F. Baldwin G.S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 124: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the means ± S.E., except where otherwise stated. Parametric and nonparametric data sets were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and by Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks, respectively. If there was a statistically significant difference in the mean or median values of each set, the values were individually compared with the control value by Dunnett's or Dunn's methods, respectively. Differences withp values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Human progastrin was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (Fig.2). The fusion protein was isolated by binding to glutathione-agarose beads according to Frangioni and Neel (19Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Recombinant human progastrin was cleaved from the fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads by treatment with thrombin (Fig.2). Recombinant human progastrin was purified by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 3). The absorbance peak at fraction 21–22 matched very well with the peak of immunoreactivity observed with antiserum 1137, which was raised against an undecapeptide consisting of the C-terminal decapeptide of progastrin (residues 71–80) with an additional tyrosine residue at the N terminus for iodination (9Ciccotosto G.D. McLeish A. Hardy K.J. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The conclusion that the recombinant human progastrin contained the C terminus of progastrin was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of HPLC-purified recombinant human progastrin was 8427.1 ± 0.7 Da, which is in excellent agreement with the mass of 8427.1 Da predicted for human progastrin6–80. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of HPLC-purified recombinant human progastrin determined by Edman analysis was SQQPDAPL, which corresponded precisely to residues 6–13 of human progastrin. We conclude that the HPLC-purified recombinant human progastrin consists of residues 6–80 inclusive of human progastrin. Because the N-terminal sequence of human progastrin is SWKPRSQQPDAPL, it appears that thrombin has cleaved the peptide bond between the arginine residue at position 5 and the serine residue at position 6. Previous reports have indicated that human [Nle11]-gastrin13 and [Nle15]-gastrin17 bind three Mg2+or Ca2+ ions in trifluoroethanol (12Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2443-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Peggion E. Mammi S. Palumbo M. Moroder L Wunsch E. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1225-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The presence of metal ions in recombinant human progastrin6–80 was therefore investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that recombinant human progastrin6–80 contained 1.06 ± 0.08 mol calcium ions/mol (mean ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig.4). No other cations were detected consistently. The calcium ion was not removed by extensive dialysis at pH 7.6 against 10 μm EDTA (Fig. 4) or 100 μm EDTA (data not shown), by treatment with 8m urea containing 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 4), or by extensive dialysis at pH 5.5 against 100 μm EDTA (data not shown). Recombinant human progastrin6–80 stimulated proliferation of the conditionally transformed mouse colon cell line YAMC in a dose-dependent manner with maximal stimulatory effects seen in the range 10 to 100 pm (Fig.5 A). The stimulatory effect of recombinant human progastrin6–80 on YAMC cells was unaffected by either the CCK-A receptor-selective antagonist L364,718 or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor-selective antagonist L365,260 at concentrations as high as 10 μm (Fig. 5 B). Gastrin17gly also stimulated proliferation of YAMC cells in the concentration range 1 pm to 1 nm, as has been reported previously with a colorimetric assay (4Hollande F. Imdahl A. Mantamadiotis T. Ciccotosto G.D. Shulkes A. Baldwin G.S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1576-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Studies of progastrin binding were confined to CCK-A and gastrin/CCK-B receptors, which have both been fully characterized at the nucleotide sequence level. Binding of recombinant human progastrin6–80 to either the human CCK-A or human gastrin/CCK-B receptor was investigated by competition for the binding of 125I-CCK8 to transiently transfected COS cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant human progastrin6–80 had no effect on the binding of125I-CCK8 to the gastrin/CCK-B receptor even at concentrations as high as 100 nm (Fig.6) and consistently stimulated the binding of 125I-CCK8 to the CCK-A receptor. CCK8 and gastrin17 were used as positive controls for measurement of binding to the CCK-A and gastrin/CCK-B receptors. In the absence of progastrin dose-dependent displacement of 125I-CCK8 from specific binding sites on COS cells transfected with plasmids encoding either the CCK-A receptor or the gastrin/CCK-B receptor was observed in the presence of unlabeled CCK8 or gastrin17, respectively. The IC50 values determined by computer fitting of the data to a single site model were 12 ± 5 nm for the CCK-A receptor and 36 ± 15 nm for the gastrin/CCK-B receptor. These values are higher than previously reported values for the affinities of the human CCK-A receptor (3 nm for CCK8SO4 (25de Weerth A. Pisegna J.R. Huppi K. Wank S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) and human gastrin/CCK-B receptor (6 nm for gastrin17 (26Pisegna J.R. de Weerth A. Huppi K. Wank S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)) for their preferred ligands. The discrepancy may be due in part to the presence of more than one class of binding sites (22Kennedy K. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this paper the production and purification of recombinant human progastrin6–80 from E. coli is reported for the first time. Progastrin was synthesized as a fusion protein with GST (Fig. 1) and partially purified by utilizing the affinity of GST for glutathione-agarose (Fig. 2). After treatment of the bound fusion protein with thrombin, progastrin6–80 was released into the supernatant, which was separated from the glutathione-agarose-bound GST by centrifugation. Final purification of the supernatant by reverse phase HPLC resulted in preparations of recombinant human progastrin that were homogeneous by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2) and mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of recombinant human progastrin determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was 8427.1 ± 0.7 Da, in excellent agreement with the value of 8427.1 Da expected for human progastrin6–80. This peptide would be generated by cleavage between Arg5 and Ser6 in the progastrin sequence Trp-Lys-Pro-Arg-Ser-Gln, which is consistent with the preferred thrombin recognition sequence P4-P3-Pro-Arg/Lys-P1′-P2′, where P3 and P4 are hydrophobic amino acids, and P1′ and P2′ are nonacidic amino acids (27Chang J.-Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Isolation of progastrin1–35and progastrin6–35 from a human gastrinoma by Reeve and co-workers (28Huebner V.D. Jiang R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12223-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously revealed that the signal peptide of preprogastrin was 21 amino acids long and that an additional cleavage occurred between Arg5 and Ser6. Subsequently Rehfeld and Johnsen (10Rehfeld J.F. Johnsen A.H. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2047261592,"Agonist-promoted regulation of the uridine nucleotide-activated human P2Y4 receptor (P2Y4-R) and P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6-R) was studied. Incubation of P2Y4-R-expressing 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells with the cognate agonist UTP resulted in rapid desensitization of the inositol phosphate response and a 50% loss of cell surface receptors. In contrast, incubation of P2Y6-R-expressing cells with the cognate agonist UDP caused neither rapid desensitization nor rapid loss of cell surface receptors. Removal of UTP from the medium of UTP-pretreated cells resulted in rapid and complete recovery of surface P2Y4-R even after 12 h of agonist treatment. Although extended incubation with UDP also caused a loss of surface P2Y6-R, rapid recovery of surface P2Y6-R did not occur following removal of agonist. Pharmacological studies indicated that neither protein kinase C nor other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated kinases were involved in agonist-promoted desensitization or loss of surface P2Y4-R or P2Y6-R. Mutational analyses were carried out to identify domains involved in agonist-dependent regulation of P2Y4-R. Sequential truncation of the carboxyl-terminal domain revealed that sequence between amino acids 332 and 343 was necessary for UTP-promoted desensitization and internalization. Further mutational analyses of the three serines in this domain confirmed that Ser-333 and Ser-334 play a major role in these agonist-promoted changes in P2Y4-R. Experiments were carried out with [<sup>32</sup>P]P<sub>i</sub>-labeled cells to ascertain the role of phosphorylation in regulation of P2Y4-R. Incubation with UTP for 2 min caused a marked increase in phosphorylation of both the wild-type P2Y4-R and the P2Y4–343 truncation mutant. In contrast, no UTP-promoted phosphorylation of the P2Y4–332 truncation mutant was observed. Taken together, these results demonstrate differential regulation of uridine nucleotide-activated P2Y4-R and P2Y6-R and indicate that Ser-333 and Ser-334 in the carboxyl terminus of P2Y4-R are important for UTP-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization, and loss of surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2079231943,"Inflammation of the airways is a major feature of the inherited disease cystic fibrosis. Previous studies have shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α and interferon γ reduce the expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (CFTR) in HT-29 and T84 cells by acting post-transcriptionally. We have investigated the effect of the pro-inflammatory peptide interleukin 1β (IL-1β) on the expression of the CFTR in Calu-3 cells. IL-1β increased the production of CFTR mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Its action was inhibited by inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway, includingN-acetyl-l-cysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and a synthetic cell-permeable peptide containing the NF-κB nuclear localization signal sequence. Gel shift analysis showed that IL-1β activated NF-κB in Calu-3 cells, and transfection experiments using p50 and RelA expressing vectors showed that exogenous transfected NF-κB subunits increased the concentration of CFTR mRNA. Gel shift analysis with antibody supershifting also showed that IL-1β caused the binding of NF-κB to a κB-like response element at position −1103 to −1093 in the CFTR5′-flanking region. Transfection experiments using −2150 to +52CFTR reporter gene constructs showed that the activity of the CFTR promoter is enhanced by exogenous transfected NF-κB and IL-1β and that this enhancement is due, at least in part, to the −1103 to −1093 κB site. We conclude that the intracellular signaling that leads to increased CFTR mRNA in response to IL-1β in Calu-3 cells includes the binding of NF-κB to the −1103 κB element and a subsequent increase in CFTR promoter activity.

Med. 1983; 308: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Despite our increased understanding of the structure and function of CFTR, the mechanisms by which the absence or dysfunction of CFTR causes numerous disorders is less well documented. One of these puzzling disorders is the destruction of the lung by infective-inflammatory injury, which is the most common cause of morbidity in cystic fibrosis. Several clinical studies of the airways of young patients with cystic fibrosis have found excessive amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, even in the absence of any clinical lung disease or detectable infection (5Khan T. Wagener J. Bost T. Martinez J. Accurso F. Riches D. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 151: 1075-1082PubMed Google Scholar). At least two of these pro-inflammatory peptides, TNFα and INFγ, modulate the expression of the CFTR by acting post-transcriptionally (6Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Bajocchi G. Trapnell B.C. Pavirani A. Crystal R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Besancon F. Przewlocki G. Baro I. Hongre A.S. Escande D. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), onCFTR expression are poorly documented (8Cafferata E.G. Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Giordano L. Pivetta O.H. Santa-Coloma T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1500: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TNFα and IL-1β, which have overlapping and synergistic effects on cell function, should be considered to be proximal or primary cytokines, in many respects, because they are produced early in the response to infection and determine the pattern of later cytokine production and secretion in the inflammatory response. The signaling pathways mediated by the receptors for both IL-1β and TNFα are complex and involve multiple coordinated kinases, including JNK, SAP/p38 and ERK2 MAP kinases. These activate transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ). The receptor-signaling pathways ultimately converge upon the NF-κB-inducing kinase, which activates the IκB kinase complex. Phosphorylation of the NF-κB cytoplasmic inhibitory binding protein, IκB, by IκB kinase triggers its ubiquitination/degradation and allows the release of the active form of the NF-κB factor. Thus, we need to know whether IL-1β, like TNFα, modulates CFTRexpression, and whether this effect depends on transcription factors such as NF-κB. NF-κB is clearly involved in the inducible regulation of genes in the immune system and the inflammatory response. NF-κB consists of dimeric complexes of Rel/NF-κB proteins sequestered in the cytosol by the inhibitory proteins IκB. The phosphorylation and degradation of IκB leads to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it binds to specific cis-regulatory elements located in transcriptional regulatory regions of its target genes. Previous studies on CFTR transcription have shown that the cell specificity and the low concentration of CFTR are at least partly dictated by the genomic sequences 5′ upstream of the transcription initiation region (9Yoshimura K.

Analysis of the CFTR 5′-region revealed that the CFTR promoter is a TATA-less promoter, which probably explains why transcription is initiated at multiple start points (9Yoshimura K. Nakamura H.

Studies on theCFTR promoter have provided differing results on the location of the major transcription initiation site and the minimal promoter length (9Yoshimura K. Nakamura H. Trapnell B.C.

However, other more distal regulatory regions within the CFTR 5′-region may also be responsible for basal and protein kinase A-mediated gene expression (13Matthews R.P. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31869-31877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These regions include putative AP-1 elements (at positions −976 and −1058) close to a DNase I-hypersensitive region specific to cells expressing theCFTR (around −950) (10Koh J. Sferra T.J. Collins F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15912-15921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the effect of IL-1β on the expression of the CFTR in Calu-3 cells. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-1β stimulated the production of CFTR mRNA viaan NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and reporter transfection assays indicated that a κB element at position −1103 of the CFTR 5′-flanking region was involved in this regulation. Calu-3, HT-29, and T84 cells were obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD); Calu-3 and HT-29 cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5%CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and T84 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Life Technologies, France). The medium for Calu-3 cells was supplemented with nonessentials amino acids, pyruvate and HEPES. All media contained antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, 50 μg/ml each) and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). IL-1β and active and inactive forms of NF-κB NS 50 peptides were purchased from Calbiochem,N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Aliquots (15 μg) of total RNA isolated from Calu-3 or T84 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane (Promega, Charbonnières, France) by capillary blotting, fixed by heating, and hybridized under standard conditions with the Quick Hyb protocol provided by Stratagene (Ozyme, Les Ulis, France). The32P-labeled CFTR probe consisted of the 1.5-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of human CFTRcDNA labeled by random priming. The membrane was also hybridized with a human β-actin cDNA probe from Oncogene Science (France Biochem, Meudon, France). The mRNAs were quantified by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms using an ImageMaster VSD (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France) Cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, scraped off into cold PBS, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mm EDTA, and supplemented with an antiprotease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). IGEPAL CA 630 (Sigma) detergent was then added (0.05%, v/v), and the cells were left on ice for 10 min. The crude nuclei released by lysis were pelleted by centrifugation at 1100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed in lysis buffer A, and suspended in buffer C (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA and antiprotease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by vigorous pipetting. The lysis of nuclei was checked under a phase-contrast microscope. The nuclei were left on ice for 15 min, vortexed, and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration (∼5 mg/ml) was determined by the Lowry method, and the nuclear extracts were rapidly frozen and stored at −80 °C. Calu-3 cells were placed in medium without serum for 16–18 h, and IL-1β (Calbiochem, France) (2 ng/ml) was then added to the medium. Oligonucleotides, synthesized by Eurobio (France), were annealed, end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (50 μCi at 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies) and purified on micro-spin purification columns (Qiagen, France). Binding reactions were done by mixing ∼40 fmol of double-stranded, end-labeled oligonucleotides with 10 μg of nuclear extract proteins for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl. The mix contained EMSA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.2–1 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Unlabeled double-stranded competitors were added to the binding reaction mixture 10 min prior to adding labeled probe. Supershift analyses were done by incubating nuclear extracts with 1.5 ng of the appropriate antibody (anti p50, RelA, or cRel from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Tebu, France) for 30 min on ice prior to adding32P-labeled probe. Samples were loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA, without any loading dye, and electrophoresed at 125 V for 2.5 h. The separated DNA·protein complexes were visualized on gels by autoradiography at −80 °C for 4–16 h. All experiments were done at least three times. The (−2150/+52)pGL3 construct was obtained by subcloning the SacI/HindIII 2.2-kb fragment of the (−2150/+52)-luc construct, generously provided by Dr. G. S. McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Charbonnières, France). In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed on this plasmid using the Stratagene mutagenesis system following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the (−2150/+52)pGL3 constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, France). Two independent clones were tested in transfection experiments and gave similar luciferase activities. CMV-driven expression plasmids for p50 and RelA were kindly provided by Dr. Bauerle (Tularik, San Francisco, CA). A β-galactosidase-encoding vector, CMV-β-galactosidase, was purchased from CLONTECH. Plasmids for transfection were purified with the Qiagen endo-free plasmid Mega kit. To avoid any possible influence of the quality of plasmid preparation on transfection efficiency, each series of transfection experiments was performed using products from at least two different amplifications. Calu-3 and T84 cells were transiently transfected in six-well dishes with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) and 2 μg/well DNA in opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) for 20 h, according to the manufacturer's directions. The transfected cells were washed three times with cold PBS and scraped off into 240 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). Each lysate was mixed vigorously and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for reporter assays. The luciferase activity in 20- or 30-μl extract was evaluated with the Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) and a Berthold Biolumat LB9500 luminometer. Two pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and INFγ, have been reported to down-regulate CFTR expression in colonic cell lines (6Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Bajocchi G. Trapnell B.C. Pavirani A. Crystal R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Besancon F. Przewlocki G. Baro I. Hongre A.S. Escande D. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined whether this response to pro-inflammatory mediators was a general phenomenon by testing the ability of TNFα and IL-1β to modulate CFTR expression in colonic (HT-29) and pulmonary (Calu-3) cell lines. Cultures of HT-29 and Calu-3 cells were stimulated for 24 h with TNFα or IL-1β, and CFTR mRNA was measured by Northern hybridization analysis. TNFα reduced the amount of CFTR mRNA in HT-29, as it has already been described (6Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Bajocchi G. Trapnell B.C. Pavirani A. Crystal R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Besancon F. Przewlocki G. Baro I. Hongre A.S. Escande D. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but increased it slightly in Calu-3 cells (Fig.1 A). These results contrast with those obtained with IL-1β, which significantly increased the CFTR mRNA in both cell lines. The increase in CFTR mRNA in Calu-3 cells induced by IL-1β treatment was always greater than that induced by TNFα, under our experimental conditions. Treatment of Calu-3 cells with various doses of IL-1β (0.5, 1.0, and 2.5 ng/ml) increased the amount of CFTR mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B, upper bands), whereas the mRNA of the constitutively expressed control, β-actin, was stable under all conditions (Fig.1 B, lower bands). We investigated the time course of this effect by incubating Calu-3 cells with IL-1β (2 ng/ml) for 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 h and analyzing the CFTR mRNA by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 1 C (right panel) shows the kinetic of the CFTR mRNA increase in response to IL-1β. IL-1β caused a rapid increase in steady-state levels of CFTR mRNA and continued to exert its effect for up to 24 h thereafter. Thus, these data indicated that the effect of IL-1β on CFTR mRNA production is dose- and time-dependent. Because IL-1β is known to activate NF-κB in several cell types, we determined whether the IL-1β-induced expression of CFTR mRNA was mediated by an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. In the first series of experiments, the cells were incubated withN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), two radical scavengers that inhibit IκB phosphorylation/degradation and, consequently, NF-κB activation. In the second series of experiments, the cells were pretreated with a synthetic peptide containing the NF-κB nuclear localization signal (NLS) fused to a membrane-permeable hydrophobic region, which specifically prevents NF-κB nuclear translocation, or with its inactive analogue (15Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 16Pyatt D.W. Stillman W.S. Yang Y. Gross S. Zheng J.H. Irons R.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3302-3308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then stimulated with IL-1β. NAC and PDTC did not modulate the amount of constitutive CFTR mRNA but markedly reduced the IL-1β-mediated increase in CFTR mRNA (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained with cells pretreated with the NF-κB NLS but not those pretreated with its inactive form. These results suggest that IL-1β acts onCFTR expression, at least in part, via an NF-κB-dependent pathway. We investigated the link between IL-1β, NF-κB, and the expression of the CFTR using two experimental strategies. We first measured the NF-κB activity by EMSA using nuclear extracts from Calu-3 cells treated with IL-1β and a labeled consensus κB probe (mouse immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer, κB element). IL-1β activated NF-κB, as indicated by the appearance of DNA·NF-κB complexes (Fig.2). We also transiently transfected Calu-3 and T84 cells (a human intestinal cell line that also expresses the CFTR constitutively) with CMV-driven RelA (p65) and p50 expressing vectors, or the empty vector (mock control), and then subjected them to Northern blot analysis. We checked that this transfection procedure mimicked the endogenous activation of the NF-κB factor by looking for specific factors binding the κB element in the nucleus of the p50/p65-transfected cells (Fig. 2). The relative amounts of CFTR mRNA in NF-κB-expressing cells were greater than those of the control cells (Fig. 3). Hence, IL-1β activates NF-κB in Calu-3 cells, and the generation of active NF-κB can lead to the up-regulation of CFTRexpression.Figure 3Northern blot analysis of the CFTR mRNA in T84 and Calu-3 cells expressing exogenous transfected NF-κB p50 and RelA subunits. T84 and Calu-3 cells were transfected with 1.4 μg and 0.6 μg/well of CMV-P50- and CMV-RelA-expressing vectors or with 2 μg of CMV empty vector in 35-mm dishes for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis to detect CFTR (top) and β-actin (bottom) mRNAs. There was more CFTR mRNA in Calu-3 cells (left) and T84 cells (right) transfected with NF-κB-expressing vectors (p50/RelA) than in cells transfected with the control vector (mock).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies on the CFTR promoter have shown that the CFTR 5′-flanking region is sufficient to trigger the tissue-specific, low activity of the CFTR (9Yoshimura K. Nakamura H. Trapnell B.C. Chu C.S. Dalemans W. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Crystal R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5417-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Koh J. Sferra T.J. Collins F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15912-15921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the NF-κB factor acts on CFTR transcription, there must be an NF-κB response element in a region regulating the transcription of the CFTR gene, and in particular, in the 5′-flanking region. Analysis of the sequence of this region revealed a putative NF-κB response element between −1103 and −1093 (5′-GGGAATGCCC-3′) that differed by 1 bp from the consensus NF-κB response element (GGGNNTYYCC) (17Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether the action of NF-κB on CFTR mRNA production involved the binding of NF-κB to this putative cis-regulatory sequence. We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to determine the capacity of the −1103 to −1093 sequence to bind NF-κB proteins using the −1111 to −1090 region of CFTR as probe and nuclear extracts from Calu-3 cells treated with IL-1β (2 ng/ml) (Fig.4). Cells incubated with IL-1β formed a single shifted complex. This complex was displaced by excess unlabeled consensus κB element from the mouse immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer (B site), whereas the same excess of unlabeled consensus AP-2 element did not change the binding of the labeled probe (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). Thus, a specific IL-1β-induced factor that has a high affinity for the consensus κB element binds to the −1111 to −1090 probe. We attempted to identify the proteins that formed the shifted complex in a supershift analysis using antibodies to three members of the NF-κB/Rel family (p50, RelA (p65), and cRel). The formation of the shifted complex was prevented by anti-p50 or anti-RelA but not by anti-cRel antibodies (Fig. 4,lanes 7–9). NF-κB (probably the p50/RelA heterodimer) bound the −1103 κB element in vitro. Thus, this sequence could constitute a κB regulatory element in the CFTR 5′-flanking region. We investigated this and determined whether NF-κB acted on the transcription of theCFTR by constructing a human CFTRpromoter-luc plasmid, (−2150/+52)pGL3, and transfecting Calu-3 cells with it (Fig.5 A). Cotransfection experiments using this construct plus the CMV-p50- and RelA-expressing vectors, or the mock plasmids as control, showed a 2.0-fold increase in the promoter activity when the cells were cotransfected with the CMV-p50 and RelA plasmids. Thus the CFTR promoter activity was stimulated by NF-κB subunits. We then generated a site-specific mutation of the −1103 κB element in the (−2150/+52)pGL3 construct by changing two nucleotides within the −1103 to −1093 sequence (from 5′-GGGAATGCCC-3′ to 5′-GGGCATTTCT-3′). This base transition was sufficient to destroy the binding capacity of the NF-κB proteins (data not shown). The activity of mutated CFTR promoter was less strongly stimulated (1.4-fold induction) than was the wild type one when this reporter construct was cotransfected with p50- and RelA-expressing vectors (Fig. 5 A). Hence, the −1103 to −1093 κB element of the CFTR 5′-flanking region may take part in the up-regulation of the CFTR by exogenous transfected NF-κB factor. Finally, we performed transfection experiments with the (−2150/+52)pGL3 reporter gene constructs and stimulated cells with IL-1β to determine whether NF-κB activation mediated by IL-1β involved this κB element. IL-1β produced more luciferase activity in cells transfected with the wild type constructs than in cells transfected with the mutated one (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that IL-1β stimulation reproduced the results obtained with exogenous NF-κB factor The reproducible 1.4- to 2-fold induction of CFTR promoter activity after cotransfection with p50/p65 expressing vectors or after IL-1β treatment is within the range of induction reported for the same promoter after stimulation with forskolin (12McDonald R.A. Matthews R.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7560-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Matthews R.P. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31869-31877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The modest increase caused by Il-1β was abolished when the −1103 κB element was mutated. Thus, the transfection data support the Northern blot analyses presented in Figs. 2 and 3. Therefore, we believe that this inducibility of the CFTR promoter could be biologically important and conclude that the −1103 κB element of theCFTR takes part in the induction of CFTR mRNA production in response to IL-1β and in the subsequent NF-κB activation in Calu-3 cells. The development of an inflammatory response is a complex biological process that involves many changes in gene expression in populations of interacting cells, all with different time courses. In the microenvironment of the inflammation site, this complex cascade of events produces extracellular signals, such as IL-1β and TNFα, that tightly control the changes in gene expression. This response helps to restore the equilibrium disturbed by the initial injury (bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection), but excessive production of inflammatory mediators may have negative effects and can lead to the destruction of the damaged tissue. Such a failure to modulate the inflammatory response occurs in cystic fibrosis. The abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airways of CF patients reflects the dramatic lung inflammatory injury that is often lethal in cystic fibrosis. Several studies have focused on the effect of cytokines in the inflamed CF airways on the expression of the CFTR (6Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Bajocchi G. Trapnell B.C. Pavirani A. Crystal R.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,7Besancon F. Przewlocki G. Baro I. Hongre A.S. Escande D. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1398-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have shown that CFTR expression is modulated by inflammatory signals, suggesting that CFTR contributes to the change in cell functions caused by the inflammatory stress. We have now obtained evidence that IL-1β stimulates the production of CFTR mRNA in a dose-, time-, and NF-κB-dependent manner in a pulmonary cell line derived from the serous cells of submucosal glands. The EMSA and promoter-reporter gene transfection assays indicate that IL-1β causes NF-κB to bind to the CFTR5′-flanking region, leading to increased CFTR transcription. This is of particular interest, because molecules, such as forskolin, that increase intracellular cAMP were the only extracellular stimuli that increased CFTR transcription until now. The cells were incubated with IL-1β for close to 20 h in most experiments, so that the observed effect on CFTR expression reflects primary and possibly secondary Il-1β-induced transduction pathways. IL-1β and TNFα have broadly overlapping, often synergistic, effects on cell functions. Not surprisingly, these cytokines also share signaling pathways, such as those that activate the NF-κB transcription factor and the p38, JNK, and ERK MAP kinases. Our data for Calu-3 cells show that TNFα and IL-1β stimulate the expression of CFTR mRNA but to different extents. Surprisingly, the two cytokines have opposing effects in HT-29 cells, TNFα decreases CFTR mRNA expression, whereas IL-1β increases it. This finding suggests that IL-1β involves signaling events that are not shared with TNFα. One possible explanation is that TNFα and IL-1β signaling pathways stimulate different signals and/or activate the same signal but confer on it different properties under some conditions. Studies on the IL-1β signaling pathway have often focused on the complex cascade of intracellular molecular events that converge ultimately on the activation of other transcription factors, including AP-1 (18McKean D. Huntoon C. Bell M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and C/EBP (19Lacorte J.M. Ktistaki E. Beigneux A. Zannis V.I. Chambaz J. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23578-23584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the IL-1 receptor-mediated signaling pathway also activates the NF-κB transcription factor (20Leung K. Betts J.C. Xu L. Nabel G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1579-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Croston G. Cao Z. Goeddel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which is of central importance to immune and inflammatory responses. Our findings provide evidence that the IL-1β-induced expression of theCFTR is mediated by NF-κB activation and binding to theCFTR 5′-flanking region. Nonetheless, activation of NF-κB does not appear to be sufficient, by itself, to activateCFTR transcription, as indicated by the effects of TNFα in HT-29 and Calu-3 cells. Also, TNFα is a strong activator of NF-κB in both cell lines (data not shown), it inhibits CFTR mRNA expression in HT-29 cells and only slightly stimulates CFTRexpression in Calu-3 cells. These findings suggest that regulation ofCFTR transcription by IL-1β, which we unmasked in Calu-3 cells, involves different IL-1β-induced transcription factors in addition to NF-κB. This is supported by the presence of several putative binding sequences for IL-1-induced transcription factors in the CFTR 5′-flanking region, including two AP-1 response elements in the vicinity of the −1103 κB element (13Matthews R.P. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31869-31877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence for interactions between NF-κB and bZIP transcription factors, such AP-1 and C/EBP, influencing the ability of NF-κB to regulate gene expression in a selective manner (22Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 23Stein B. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between these factors could lead to a synergistic activation of the CFTR transcription. The subtle difference between the −1103 κB element and the consensus κB motif probably explains the slight difference in NF-κB binding affinity, between the −1103 κB element and the canonical κB element from the immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer (in vitro assay, data not shown). Nevertheless such variant NF-κB binding sites have been found to be important in gene transcription (26Lewis H. Kaszubska W. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because protein·protein interactions with other transcription factors are believed to stabilize their binding to DNA. Thus, interactions between NF-κB and other IL-1β-induced transcription factors could stabilize NF-κB binding to the CFTR5′-flanking region. The increased CFTR expression in response to NF-κB activation could be of pathophysiological significance in cystic fibrosis, because it was recently demonstrated that NF-κB is endogenously activated in CF cells. The endogenous activation of transcription factor NF-κB has been correlated with the constitutive inflammatory response in CF cells (27DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is suggested that the presence of the F508del-mutated CFTR proteins in the cells produces an endogenous stress that results in increased NF-κB activation and thus an increased production of endogenous pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study shows that the activation of NF-κB can also lead to increased CFTR activity in airway epithelial cells. Thus, the F508del protein could exert a positive influence on its own synthesis in some conditions by activating the NF-κB system.

https://openalex.org/W2135982229,"We have used the two-electrode voltage clamp technique and the patch clamp technique to investigate the regulation of ROMK1 channels by protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) in oocytes coexpressing ROMK1 and cSrc. Western blot analysis detected the presence of the endogenous PTP-1D isoform in the oocytes. Addition of phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PTP, reversibly reduced K+ current by 55% in oocytes coinjected with ROMK1 and cSrc. In contrast, PAO had no significant effect on K+ current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 alone. Moreover, application of herbimycin A, an inhibitor of PTK, increased K+ current by 120% and completely abolished the effect of PAO in oocytes coexpressing ROMK1 and cSrc. The effects of herbimycin A and PAO were absent in oocytes expressing the ROMK1 mutant R1Y337A in which the tyrosine residue at position 337 was mutated to alanine. However, addition of exogenous cSrc had no significant effect on the activity of ROMK1 channels in inside-out patches. Moreover, the effect of PAO was completely abolished by treatment of oocytes with 20% sucrose and 250 μg/ml concanavalin A, agents that inhibit the endocytosis of ROMK1 channels. Furthermore, the effect of herbimycin A is absent in the oocytes pretreated with either colchicine, an inhibitor of microtubules, or taxol, an agent that freezes microtubules. We conclude that PTP and PTK play an important role in regulating ROMK1 channels. Inhibiting PTP increases the internalization of ROMK1 channels, whereas blocking PTK stimulates the insertion of ROMK1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2017709046,"Here we demonstrate that ricin is able to interact with the molecular chaperone calreticulin both in vitro and in vivo. The interaction occurred with ricin holotoxin, but not with free ricin A chain; and it was prevented in the presence of lactose, suggesting that it was mediated by the lectin activity of the ricin B chain. This lectin is galactose-specific, and metabolic labeling with [3H]galactose or treating galactose oxidase-modified calreticulin with sodium [3H]borohydride indicated that Vero cell calreticulin possesses a terminally galactosylated oligosaccharide. Brefeldin A treatment indicated that the intracellular interaction occurred initially in a post-Golgi stack compartment, possibly the trans-Golgi network, whereas the reductive separation of ricin subunits occurred in an earlier part of the secretory pathway, most probably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Intoxicating Vero cells with ricin whose A chain had been modified to include either a tyrosine sulfation site or the sulfation site plus available N-glycosylation sites, in the presence of Na235SO4, confirmed that calreticulin interacted with endocytosed ricin that had already undergone retrograde transport to both the Golgi and the ER. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the interaction between ricin and calreticulin is an indirect one, the data presented are consistent with the idea that calreticulin may function as a recycling carrier for retrograde transport of ricin from the Golgi to the ER.

Kozlov J.V. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lord J.M. Hartley M.R. Roberts L.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 15-22PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of ricin, the modification catalyzed is the removal of a specific adenine residue from a highly conserved loop present in 28 S rRNA (3Endo Y. Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The adenine residue removed by ricin action is crucial for the binding of elongation factors, and a consequence of the toxin-mediated depurination is the cessation of protein synthesis, leading inevitably to cell death. Structurally, ricin is a disulfide-linked heterodimer in which the rRNAN-glycosidase (termed the ricin A chain (RTA)1) is covalently joined to a galactose-specific lectin (the ricin B chain (RTB)) (4Olsnes S. Pihl A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3121-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For ricin to act, RTA must enter cells to encounter ribosomes in the cytosol. Cell entry is mediated by RTB, through which the toxin binds to cell-surface galactosides. Some of the surface-bound ricin then enters cells by endocytosis and is initially delivered to the endosomal system (5van Deurs B. Pederson O.W. Sundan A. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 287-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Before endocytosed ricin can act, however, RTA must traverse an intracellular membrane to reach the ribosomes. This membrane translocation step is now known to be achieved by a proportion of the endocytosed toxin that undergoes intracellular transport beyond endosomes. Initially, the toxin is transported to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) and then, via retrograde vesicular transport through the Golgi stack, to the lumen of the ER (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Translocation of free RTA into the cytosol from the ER possibly occurs because the toxin is perceived as a candidate for ER-associated protein degradation (7Simpson J.C. Roberts L.M. Römisch K. Davey J. Wolf D.H. Lord J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Wesche J. Rapak A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34443-34449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Clearly, however, a proportion of translocated RTA must escape the subsequent proteolytic degradation to then be capable of intoxicating the cell. Electron microscopic analysis of the cellular fate of endocytosed ricin first showed that a proportion reaches the TGN (9van Deurs B. Tonnessen T.O. Pererson O.W. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how ricin achieves retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER lumen. Several bacterial toxins also follow this trafficking route, and structural features of some of these toxins have provided an explanation of how this transport step is achieved. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin have the tetrapeptide sequence -Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL), or a functionally related homolog, at the C terminus of the translocated catalytic polypeptide (10Gray G.L. Smith D.H. Baldridge J.S. Harkins R.N. Vasil M.L. Chen E.Y. Heyneker H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2645-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Mekalanos J.J. Swarth D.J.

Chem. 1982; 257: 5716-5721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that cholera toxin and P. aeruginosaexotoxin A utilize the KDEL receptor, which recycles between the TGN and the ER to retrieve escaped ER lumen resident proteins from all Golgi compartments (13Pelham H.R.B.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 467-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An outstanding question concerns how ricin, which lacks a C-terminal KDEL or related sequence, achieves Golgi-to-ER transport for its subsequent translocation into the cytosol? Our earlier work indicates that the lectin activity of RTB may be important in this regard (17Villafranca J.E. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 554-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamil R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary sequence analysis and x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that RTB forms two distinct globular domains with identical folding topologies (17Villafranca J.E. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 554-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamil R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol.

Xuong N.H. Hamil R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that mutationally abrogating one or other of these two galactose-binding sites does not abolish either the lectin activity of RTB or the cytotoxicity of the ricin holotoxin (19Wales R. Richardson P.T. Roberts L.M. Woodland H.R. Lord J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19172-19179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Wallbridge S. Saxena S.E. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous abrogation of both sites, however, does predictably abolish lectin activity and significantly reduces cytotoxicity (20Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Wallbridge S. Saxena S.E. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also shown that the ricin mutant unable to bind galactose did not kill macrophages, even though the mutant toxin (which wasN-glycosylated) could still bind to mannose receptors and was endocytosed by these cells (20Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Wallbridge S. Saxena S.E. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation that could account for these findings is that wild-type ricin normally has to be bound, or transferred, to a galactosylated component that itself undergoes retrograde transport, e.g. an endogenous KDEL-containing protein capable of recycling between the TGN and the ER (21Pelham H.R.B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine which, if any, Golgi/ER protein(s) might bind ricin holotoxin. Rat liver calreticulin is a potential candidate in that it contains a C-terminal KDEL motif and is galactosylated (22Peter F. Van N.P. Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10631-10637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that calreticulin interacts directly or indirectly with ricin both in vitro and in vivo. As such, it is a candidate for a Golgi-to-ER recycling cellular protein that might be opportunistically used by ricin to reach the ER lumen, an essential transport step in the entry process of this protein. Antibodies against calreticulin, calnexin, BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), and protein-disulfide isomerase were purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and antibody against Rab5 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against RTA, RTB, and fibroblast growth factor intracellular binding protein were raised in rabbits by standard immunization. Radioisotopes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Native RTA was from Inland Laboratories Inc. (Austin, TX). Plasmids encoding RTA, RTA-sulf1 (RTA modified to include a C-terminal tyrosine sulfation site (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)), or RTA-sulf2 (RTA modified to include a tyrosine sulfation site and overlapping N-glycosylation sites at the C terminus (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)) were expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity by two rounds of CM-Sepharose chromatography and quantified as described previously (23Wales R. Chaddock J.A. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ricin (10 mg) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.1 m lactose, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The reduced toxin was applied to a 100-ml DEAE-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in the same buffer but containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and washed to remove RTA and nonreduced ricin. RTB was eluted with a linear 0–0.5m NaCl gradient and stored at 4 °C. Equimolar mixtures of RTA (or RTA-sulf1/RTA-sulf2) and RTB were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 m lactose and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against the same buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol) overnight and then against PBS for 2 more nights. The extent of reassociation was determined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). A fresh liver from a male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat was homogenized by passage through a 150-μm mesh sieve (24Hino Y. Asano A. Sato R. Shimizu S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1978; 83: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) into ice-cold 0.5 m sucrose/KM buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.7) and 5 mm MgCl2), and the homogenate was adjusted to 25 ml with 0.5 m sucrose/KM buffer. Stepped sucrose gradients were prepared by successively layering 2 ml of 1.3m sucrose/KM buffer, 4.5 ml of 0.86 msucrose/KM buffer, 4 ml of homogenate, and 2.5 ml of 0.25 msucrose/KM buffer. After centrifugation at 29,000 rpm in an SW 40 swing-out rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 1 h at 4 °C, the ER-enriched fraction was collected from the 0.86/1.3 msucrose interface. After dilution to 0.5 m sucrose using KM buffer and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, microsomes were pelleted from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (ER resuspension buffer) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. 100 μl of rat liver microsomes (containing 4.05 mg/ml protein) was solubilized by mixing with an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100 and standing at room temperature for 20 min. The sample was then applied to a 1-ml column of agarose-bound ricin (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) that had been equilibrated with 50 ml of ER resuspension buffer to remove stabilizing sugars. The column was washed with 10 ml of ER resuspension buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Bound material was eluted with 5 ml of 0.1 m lactose in ER resuspension buffer and collected as a single fraction. An equal volume of ice-cold acetone was added to collected fractions, which were kept on ice for 30 min. After recovery by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, pellets were air-dried before being dissolved in 40 μl of ER resuspension buffer. Proteins present in each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and calreticulin was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 300 μl of rat liver microsomes (containing 2 mg/ml protein) was solubilized by adding an equal volume of 4% CHAPS in ER resuspension buffer and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. The sample was split into four 150-μl aliquots, and 10 μg of ricin was added to each in 150 μl of ER resuspension buffer, in 150 μl of 200 mm mannose in ER resuspension buffer, in 150 μl of 200 mm lactose in ER resuspension buffer, or in 150 μl of ER resuspension buffer containing 1.5 μl of 1 m CaCl2. All samples were tumbled at room temperature for 90 min; split into three 100-μl aliquots; and immunoprecipitated with anti-calreticulin, anti-calnexin, or anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibodies in a total volume of 1 ml of ER resuspension buffer. After tumbling at room temperature for a further 2 h, 90 μl of a 7% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added, and tumbling was continued for a further 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifugation; washed four times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 600 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100; and finally resuspended in 30 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed using a sheep antibody to ricin and ECL Western blotting. Vero cells were propagated and maintained under standard conditions (5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum). The day prior to an experiment, the cells were seeded onto six-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells seeded as described above were either washed twice with methionine/serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 4 h in the same medium containing 25 μCi of [35S]methionine or washed twice with sulfate/serum-free minimal essential Eagle's medium for suspension cells (SMEM) (BioWhittaker UK, Ltd., Wokingham, United Kingdom) and incubated for 4 h in the presence of 200 μCi of Na235SO4. Following labeling, cells were incubated for up to 4 h in the presence of toxin. Where appropriate, cells were pretreated with brefeldin A (BFA; 10 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to adding toxin. Vero cells were labeled by incubation for 24 h with 200 μCi of [3H]galactose. Alternatively, Vero cells were washed once with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 units/ml aprotinin. The cleared lysate was incubated for 1 h with 20 units/ml galactose oxidase (Sigma). Subsequently, the lysate was incubated with 10 mCi/ml sodium [3H]borohydride. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 mm lactose and 1 mm sodium borohydride. The lysate was then immunoprecipitated using immobilized anti-calreticulin antibodies. Precipitated protein was analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. A control sample was treated in the same way, but in the absence of galactose oxidase treatment. Cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 m lactose and then with PBS alone. Cells were lysed on ice by adding 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. After 5 min, cells were scraped from the dishes and centrifuged to remove nuclei. Extracts were incubated with rabbit antibodies that had been immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and once with PBS alone prior to resuspension in nonreducing sample buffer and analysis by SDS-PAGE. The productive intoxication pathway for ricin requires retrograde transport from the TGN to the ER lumen, from where RTA translocates into the cytosol (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,25Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To achieve this retrograde trafficking, ricin possibly interacts with a cellular component(s) normally capable of recycling between the Golgi and the ER. To examine whether any Golgi/ER components could interact with ricin in vitro via the RTB lectin activity, we passed solubilized rat liver microsomal preparations down an immobilized ricin column. Since the galactose-binding activity of RTB seems to be essential for optimal ricin cytotoxicity (20Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Wallbridge S. Saxena S.E. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Youle R.J. Murray G.J. Neville Jr., D.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), any lectin-interactive components were eluted from the column with lactose. Immunoprecipitation followed by ECL Western blotting showed that the lactose eluate contained calreticulin (Fig.1 A). The lactose eluate did not contain calnexin, protein-disulfide isomerase, or BiP, but we cannot exclude the possibility that these chaperones bind to ricin in a non-lectin association. Free RTA or ricin holotoxin was next added to the microsomal extracts; calreticulin was immunoprecipitated; and any interaction between calreticulin and toxin was demonstrated by probing reducing gels of the immunoprecipitates with anti-RTA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, RTA was detected only in calreticulin complexes containing ricin rather than free RTA, suggesting that the toxin was interacting with the chaperone via its B chain. The addition of either mannose or Ca2+ to the microsomal extracts did not prevent the association of toxin and calreticulin, whereas the addition of lactose did (Fig. 1 C). This suggests that the association with RTB required a galactosylated oligosaccharide on calreticulin (Fig. 1 C). Before looking for an interaction between ricin and calreticulin in vivo, we determined that we could visualize endocytosed ricin and, in particular, its reduced subunits in extracts from Vero cells treated with toxin. After incubation with toxin for the times indicated in Fig. 2, the cells were washed with 0.1 m lactose and lysed, and toxin was recovered from extracts by immunoprecipitation with either rabbit anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies and visualized on nonreducing gels by Western blotting using sheep anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies. As expected, the amount of total internalized ricin remained relatively constant over the time course due to toxin recycling between the medium and endosomes, whereas free subunits, released after intracellular cleavage within the ER or cytosol, accumulated in a time-dependent fashion. The relative accumulation rates for free RTA (Fig. 2 A) and RTB (Fig. 2 B) were approximately equal, suggesting that neither subunit was rapidly degraded following release from holotoxin or that both subunits were degraded to similar extents. The time course for the appearance of reduced toxin was consistent with the observed time course for cytotoxicity at the ricin concentration used, which showed that protein synthesis was significantly inhibited within 30 min and was almost abolished by 60 min (data not shown). Ricin toxicity is abolished by preincubating cells with BFA (27Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Yoshida T. Chen C. Zhang M. Wu H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) presumably by preventing passage of ricin through the Golgi stack to the ER, the site of toxin entry into the cytosol. Preincubation with BFA also blocks the sulfation of ricin containing an A chain with an introduced tyrosine sulfation site (designated RCA-sulf1 (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)), a modification that istrans-Golgi-specific (29Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the proposed model for cellular intoxication by ricin, the lectin activity of RTB is required for efficient retrograde transport of holotoxin to the ER (21Pelham H.R.B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence, it would be expected that that the reductive separation of RTA and RTB would also be prevented by BFA treatment. Cells were intoxicated with ricin for 2 h in the presence or absence of BFA, and extracts were immunoprecipitated using either anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies. Fig.3 shows that preincubation with BFA had only a small effect (typically a 15% reduction) on the total amount of ricin internalized, but almost completely abolished the appearance of the free toxin subunits, suggesting that reduction normally occurs in an early (pre-TGN) compartment of the secretory pathway such as the endoplasmic reticulum. This is consistent with the earlier observation that some of the RTA-sulf2 in ricin holotoxin (RTA-sulf2 is the ricin A chain modified to have overlappingN-glycosylation sites at the C terminus (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)), as well as reduced RTA-sulf2, becomes N-glycosylated during cell entry (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This shows that endocytosed ricin can reach oligosaccharyltransferase in the ER. It has been proposed that the retrograde transport of ricin from the Golgi to the ER might be mediated, at least in part, by the KDEL retrieval system (21Pelham H.R.B. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 183-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This model proposed that ricin might bind to a recycling KDEL-tagged glycoprotein because of the lectin activity of RTB, allowing ricin to “hitch a lift” to the ER as the KDEL protein is retrieved by KDEL receptors. Candidates for such a carrier include the abundant chaperones of the ER, several of which have putativeN-glycosylation sites (Grp94, calreticulin, calnexin, protein-disulfide isomerase, etc.). Vero cells were intoxicated with ricin and lysed in the presence of Triton X-100, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with selected anti-chaperone antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-RTA antibodies (Fig. 4 A). Controls showed that ricin was immunoprecipitated by either anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies, but not by irrelevant antibodies (anti-Rab5). As expected, a small amount of free RTA was also precipitated by anti-RTA antibodies. Anti-calreticulin antibodies also coprecipitated ricin (but not free RTA), but no toxin was seen in complexes using antibodies against calnexin or protein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 4 A) or BiP (data not shown). Coprecipitation of ricin with calreticulin was prevented in the presence of 0.1 m lactose, which had little or no effect on the direct immunoprecipitation of ricin with either anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies (Fig. 4 B). This observation is consistent with earlier findings that RTB plays an intracellular role during the intoxication process, in addition to its initial role in binding holotoxin to the target cell surface (20Newton D.L. Wales R. Richardson P.T. Wallbridge S. Saxena S.E. Ackerman E.J. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with this, Vero cells were treated with either free recombinant or native (glycosylated) RTA (which enters via fluid-phase uptake (30Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or free RTB for 4 h, washed, and then homogenized. Anti-RTA or anti-RTB antibodies precipitated the appropriate intracellular toxin subunit, whereas only RTB coprecipitated when calreticulin was precipitated with anti-calreticulin antibodies (Fig.5). Although equal concentrations of RTA and RTB were added to cells, the relative amounts of RTA and RTB precipitated predictably confirmed that the cellular uptake of RTB was much more efficient. This is because uptake of RTB is receptor-mediated, whereas free A chains enter cells in the fluid phase. To test that calreticulin was able to interact with ricin that had already been transported to the Golgi complex, where tyrosylsulfotransferase is found, the coprecipitation experiment was repeated, but using cells that had been intoxicated with ricin containing RTA-sulf1 (RTA that had been modified to contain a tyrosine sulfation site (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)) in the presence of Na235SO4. Fig.6 A shows that35S-labeled ricin holotoxin was immunoprecipitated by anti-RTA, anti-RTB, or anti-calreticulin antibodies and that the interaction was again abolished in the presence of lactose. To test that calreticulin remained in contact with ricin until it reached the ER (the location of oligosaccharyltransferase), coprecipitations were also performed using extracts from cells that had been intoxicated with ricin containing RTA-sulf2 (a recombinant RTA modified to contain overlapping C-terminalN-glycosylation sites (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)) in the presence of Na235SO4. Fig. 6 B shows that immunoprecipitation with either anti-calreticulin or anti-ricin antibodies yielded both non-glycosylated RTA and newly glycosylated RTA (6Rapak A. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). (To clearly see the gel mobility difference between RTA and glycosylated RTA, reducing SDS-PAGE was used in this case.) Significantly less RTA or glycosylated RTA was precipitated by anti-calnexin antibodies, but the data shown in Fig. 6 Bindicate th"

We showed that the membrane insertion of Elips, as proven by protease protection assays and washes with a chaotropic salt or alkali, depended strictly on chlorophylla but not on chlorophyll b or xanthophyll zeaxanthin. The amount of inserted Elips increased almost linearly with the chlorophyll a concentration, and the insertion efficiency was not significantly influenced by a light intensity between 1 and 1,000 μmol·m−2·s−1. In contrast, in vitro import of Elip precursors into greening plastids was enhanced by high intensity light. Thus, we conclude that although chlorophylls bound to Elips seem to not be involved in light harvesting, they are crucial for a stable insertion of these proteins into the plastid membrane.

In mature green plants, Elips and Elip-like proteins are induced in response to various stress conditions (reviewed in Ref. 3Adamska I. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Advances in Photosynthesis: Regulatory Aspects of Photosynthesis. 8. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar).The Elips in higher plants are nucleus-encoded proteins synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes in their precursor forms (pElips) and post-translationally imported into chloroplasts (1Meyer G. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prior to insertion into the thylakoid membranes pElips are processed to their mature forms by a stromal processing peptidase (5Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence (6Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A spontaneous insertion mechanism into thylakoid membranes has been reported for Elips in barley (6Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) andArabidopsis thaliana (7Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The insertion of these proteins into membranes occurred in the complete absence of signal recognition particle, SecA activity, nucleoside triphosphates, or a functional Sec system (7Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The Elips are polytopic thylakoid membrane proteins with three predicted transmembrane α-helices, where the helices I and III show very high homology to the corresponding regions of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (Lhcps) of photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII) (4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, Elip-related proteins with two (8Heddad M. Adamska I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or one (9Jansson S. Andersson J. Kim S.J. Jackowski G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) predicted transmembrane helix have been described fromArabidopsis. In barley, two multigene families of Elips were reported (2Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 493-499Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar): the high molecular mass Elips (pElips between 24 and 27 kDa) and the low molecular mass Elips (pElips between 16 and 18 kDa). While the high molecular mass pElips are processed to mature products of different sizes between 18.5 and 18.0 kDa, the low molecular mass pElips give end products of the same size of 13.5 kDa.Recent purification of Elips from light-stressed pea leaves has shown that these proteins bind chlorophyll (Chl) a and lutein (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, very unusual pigment-binding characteristics were reported for isolated Elips, such as a weak excitonic coupling between Chl a molecules and an extremely high lutein content as compared with other Chl-binding proteins (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar weak excitonic coupling between Chls was previously reported for the Chla/b-binding 22-kDa protein (PSII-S) from PSII (11Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this protein is the only known Cab family member present in etiolated seedlings and stable in the absence of Chls (12Funk C. Adamska I. Green B.R. Andersson B. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30141-30147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).No definite function has been yet described for Elips in higher plants. It was proposed that these proteins could act as ligand chaperones required for transient binding of pigments during biogenesis or turnover of Chl-binding proteins (13Adamska I. Ohad I. Kloppstech K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2610-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Adamska I. Kloppstech K. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pötter E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Such a function would be essential for the coordination between pigment biosynthesis and their ligation as well as for reducing toxic effects of nonbound Chl molecules.During greening of etiolated plants, accumulation of Elips in plastid membranes occurs only at the time when the abundance of their transcripts has already considerably declined (1Meyer G. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 493-499Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of a post-transcriptional control in Elip expression.In this work, the post-translational regulation of the expression of low molecular mass Elips from barley was investigated using an in vitro insertion system into plastid membranes. We showed that the efficiency of the pElip processing depended on the developmental status of etioplasts and increased with the etioplast age. Furthermore, the processing of pElips was not influenced during early stages of chloroplast differentiation in light. The stable insertion of Elips occurred within greening plastid membranes but not in Chl-free etioplast membranes. Since stromal or membrane factors are not required for Elip insertion (6Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the quantity and/or quality of pigments play a role during this process. We demonstrated that the stable insertion of Elips into etioplast membranes was promoted by the addition of Chl a but not Chl bor xanthophyll zeaxanthin and that this process did not depend on light intensity. However, when pElips were posttranslationally imported into plastids isolated from greening leaves of barley, amounts of membrane inserted Elips increased in a light intensity-dependent manner. This indicates that in addition to Chl a other factors that are induced and/or regulated by a high intensity light also control the accumulation of Elips in plastid membranes.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that a stable insertion of Elips into etioplast membranes did not occur in the absence of Chls. External addition of Chl a promoted this process, thus indicating that etioplasts contain the whole machinery, which is required for the insertion of Elips into membranes and that the only missing component in this system is Chl a. This observation supports the concept that the stabilization of Elips by pigments in thylakoid membranes is a part of a post-translational regulation of expression of these proteins. At which particular step this control occurs is not yet known. One possibility is that Elips are inserted into etioplast membranes but due to the absence of Chls they are degraded by “cleaning proteases.” It was reported that the LhcpII is rapidly degraded by protease(s) in the absence of Chls in the etiolated mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii y-1 (25Hoober J.K. Hughes M.J. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in etiolated higher plants (26Apel K. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Tziveleka L.A. Argyroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that Chls may play an active role during the insertion process itself. Earlier studies showed that the recombinant LhcpII expressed in E. coli was targeted to the bacterial inner membrane by the addition of a bacterial signal peptide (28Kohorn B. Auchincloss A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12048-12052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was concluded that Chls are not essential for LhcpII to become embedded in a lipid bilayer, but the process of insertion was observed to be inefficient in the absence of photosynthesic pigments. This function of pigments in the refolding of LhcpII was suggested as the driving force for translocating parts of this protein across the membranes (20Kuttkat A. Edhofer I. Eichacker L. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20451-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Paulsen H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 367-382Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Our data presented in Fig. 6, A and B, demonstrated that the stable insertion of Elips into etioplast membranes could be obtained by the addition of Chl a while Chl b had no effect on Elip insertion. In this respect, Elips differed from the LhcpII, which could be inserted into etioplast membranes reconstituted with Chl b as the only Chl component (20Kuttkat A. Edhofer I. Eichacker L. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20451-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the replacement of Chl b by Chla in reconstitution assays led to the absence of stably inserted forms of LhcpII (20Kuttkat A. Edhofer I. Eichacker L. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20451-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The absence of Chl b in thechlorina-f2 mutant of barley also led to the depletion of the major Lhcb1 and one of the minor Chla/b-binding proteins, the Lhcb6 (called also CP24), but not that of the Lhcb4 (called also CP29) (30Bellemare G. Bartlett S.G. Chua N.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7762-7767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the stability of these proteins in the absence of Chl b may depend on the Chl a/b ratio. This ratio was relatively low (between 0.9 and 1.6) for Lhcb1 and Lhcb6 and very high (around 3.0) for Lhcb4 (29Paulsen H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 367-382Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). More recent studies showed that the six major Lhcb1–6 proteins did not accumulate in the null chlorinach1–3 allele in Arabidopsis that completely lacked Chl b (32Espineda C.E. Linford A.S. Devine D. Brusslan J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10507-10511Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This mutation has been shown to be stronger than chlorina-f2 in barley and influenced the gene encoding Chl a oxygenase, an enzyme converting Chla into Chl b, leading to the ch1mutant phenotype. Based on these data, it can be expected that if Elips bind any Chl b molecules their content should be very low, and this would explain why integration of Elips did not depend on the presence of this pigment.The recent purification of Elips from light stress-treated pea leaves confirmed experimentally that these proteins bind pigments. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of pigments bound to purified Elips revealed the presence of Chl a and lutein, while Chl b and other carotenoids were not detected (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it was suggested that some pigments could easily dissociate from Elips and be lost during protein purification. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of Elips (4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and its comparison with the electron crystallographic structure reported for the LhcpII (33Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 34Green B.R. Kühlbrandt W. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) demonstrated that low and high molecular mass Elips from barley possess four conserved Chl-binding residues located in helices I and III. Based on the data presented for Lhcb4, these Chl-binding sites are selective for Chl a, whereas the peripheral sites located in helix II and in a short amphipathic C-terminal α-helix have mixed Chla/Chl b specificity (35Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Since peripheral Chl-binding sites are missing in Elips, these proteins might truly bind only Chl a. Another possibility is that Chl bmight not be bound by specific amino acid residues but rather held in place by pigment-pigment interactions as was reported for Lhcb4 (36Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and thus be less crucial for the stable Elip insertion into the membrane.It was shown in Figs. 4 and 6, A and B, that the stable insertion of Elips into etioplast membranes was more efficient with increasing concentrations of Chl a added to assays. It is unlikely that the availability of Chls represented a limiting step for stable insertion of Elips into etioplast membranes reconstituted with lower pigment concentrations. Rather, it can be assumed that some of Chl molecules were damaged due to photooxidation or aggregated during incubation of the integration assays and that this pigment fraction was not available for ligation with Elips. This explanation is supported by the observation that the direct addition of pigments to the membrane is ∼100 times less efficient in promoting insertion of LhcpII than the in situ synthesis of pigments from their precursors (20Kuttkat A. Edhofer I. Eichacker L. Paulsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20451-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).It is known that not only Chls but also carotenoids play an important role in the stabilization and folding of Chl-binding proteins (37Plumey F.G.

Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the Cbr (carotene biosynthesis-related) protein, an algal homolog of higher plant Elips (42Levy H. Tal T. Shaish A. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20892-20896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may represent zeaxanthin-binding proteins and that the stability of the Cbr might be regulated by the binding of this pigment (42Levy H. Tal T. Shaish A. Zamir A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20892-20896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrated that comparable amounts of Elips were stably integrated into the membrane in the presence or in the absence of externally added zeaxanthin. Based on the structural model of LhcpII (33Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), two xanthophyll-binding sites, the L1 and L2, have been located in the center of the complex, forming an internal cross-brace interacting with helices I and III. It was shown that the L1 and L2 sites in LhcpII have the highest affinity for lutein but can also bind violaxanthin or zeaxanthin with lower affinity (40Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution of Lhcb1 protein overexpressed in bacteria demonstrated that zeaxanthin and β-carotene were bound to L1 and L2 sites only when violaxanthin and lutein were either absent or present in limiting amounts (40Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Since etioplast membranes of barley contained significant amounts of lutein and violaxanthin, this could explain why the absence of zeaxanthin did not limit the stable insertion of Elips into the membrane.The spectroscopic analysis performed on purified native Elips from pea suggested that Chls bound to these proteins did not interact with each other (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The weak association of pigments with the protein and their low excitonic coupling supported the idea that Elips may represent a group of Chl-binding proteins with function(s) different from light harvesting (reviewed in Refs. 3Adamska I.

Jansson S. Niyogi K.K.

It was proposed that Elips in higher plants (41Król M. Spangford M.D. Huner N.P.A. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Jansson S.

The Elips could act as ligand chaperones required for transient binding of pigments during biogenesis or turnover of “typical” Chl-binding proteins. Such a function would be supported by our results demonstrating that amounts of Elips accumulated in membranes after in vitro import into greening plastids were enhanced at high light intensities, which are known to promote protein turnover in thylakoid membranes (44Li X.P.

Early light-induced proteins (Elips)1 are among the first light-induced proteins that accumulate transiently in developing plastid membranes (1Meyer G. Kloppstech K. Eur. J.

In mature green plants, Elips and Elip-like proteins are induced in response to various stress conditions (reviewed in Ref. 3Adamska I. Aro E.-M. Andersson B. Advances in Photosynthesis: Regulatory Aspects of Photosynthesis. 8. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar). The Elips in higher plants are nucleus-encoded proteins synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes in their precursor forms (pElips) and post-translationally imported into chloroplasts (1Meyer G. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Prior to insertion into the thylakoid membranes pElips are processed to their mature forms by a stromal processing peptidase (5Richter S. Lamppa G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7463-7468Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence (6Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A spontaneous insertion mechanism into thylakoid membranes has been reported for Elips in barley (6Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) andArabidopsis thaliana (7Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The insertion of these proteins into membranes occurred in the complete absence of signal recognition particle, SecA activity, nucleoside triphosphates, or a functional Sec system (7Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Elips are polytopic thylakoid membrane proteins with three predicted transmembrane α-helices, where the helices I and III show very high homology to the corresponding regions of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (Lhcps) of photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII) (4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, Elip-related proteins with two (8Heddad M. Adamska I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or one (9Jansson S. Andersson J. Kim S.J. Jackowski G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) predicted transmembrane helix have been described fromArabidopsis. In barley, two multigene families of Elips were reported (2Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 493-499Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Grimm B. Kruse E. Kloppstech K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar): the high molecular mass Elips (pElips between 24 and 27 kDa) and the low molecular mass Elips (pElips between 16 and 18 kDa). While the high molecular mass pElips are processed to mature products of different sizes between 18.5 and 18.0 kDa, the low molecular mass pElips give end products of the same size of 13.5 kDa. Recent purification of Elips from light-stressed pea leaves has shown that these proteins bind chlorophyll (Chl) a and lutein (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, very unusual pigment-binding characteristics were reported for isolated Elips, such as a weak excitonic coupling between Chl a molecules and an extremely high lutein content as compared with other Chl-binding proteins (10Adamska I. Roobol-Bóza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar weak excitonic coupling between Chls was previously reported for the Chla/b-binding 22-kDa protein (PSII-S) from PSII (11Funk C. Schröder W.P. Napiwotzki A. Tjus S. Renger G. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11133-11141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this protein is the only known Cab family member present in etiolated seedlings and stable in the absence of Chls (12Funk C. Adamska I. Green B.R. Andersson B. Renger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30141-30147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No definite function has been yet described for Elips in higher plants. It was proposed that these proteins could act as ligand chaperones required for transient binding of pigments during biogenesis or turnover of Chl-binding proteins (13Adamska I. Ohad I. Kloppstech K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2610-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14Adamska I. Kloppstech K. Ohad I. J. Biol.

Such a function would be essential for the coordination between pigment biosynthesis and their ligation as well as for reducing toxic effects of nonbound Chl molecules. During greening of etiolated plants, accumulation of Elips in plastid membranes occurs only at the time when the abundance of their transcripts has already considerably declined (1Meyer G. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Grimm B. Kloppstech K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 493-499Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggests the existence of a post-transcriptional control in Elip expression. In this work, the post-translational regulation of the expression of low molecular mass Elips from barley was investigated using an in vitro insertion system into plastid membranes. We showed that the efficiency of the pElip processing depended on the developmental status of etioplasts and increased with the etioplast age. Furthermore, the processing of pElips was not influenced during early stages of chloroplast differentiation in light. The stable insertion of Elips occurred within greening plastid membranes but not in Chl-free etioplast membranes. Since stromal or membrane factors are not required for Elip insertion (6Kruse E."

Ligation of CD47 induced actin polymerization and increased protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ) association with the cytoskeleton independent of antigen receptor ligation, but ligation of mutant forms of the molecule missing either the Ig domain or the multiple membrane-spanning domain did not. Simultaneous ligation of CD47 and CD3 led to additive effects on F-actin and synergistic effects on PKCθ cytoskeletal association. Disruption of membrane rafts by removal of cholesterol with cyclodextrin blocked CD47-induced actin polymerization, and mutant forms of CD47 that localized poorly to rafts failed to effect cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, raft association alone was not sufficient, because a raft-localized CD47 Ig domain bound to the membrane by a glycan phosphoinositol anchor was unable to induce actin polymerization. A mutant form of CD47 without its Ig domain that did not induce actin polymerization or localize to rafts still enhanced T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ and associated Ca2+ signaling but did not augment IL-2 secretion. Thus, CD47 synergy with TCR to increase [Ca2+]i is independent of actin and rafts but is insufficient to explain CD47 cooperation with TCR in IL-2 synthesis. Full synergy with TCR requires CD47 localization to membrane rafts where ligation leads to TCR-independent signals causing actin polymerization and PKCθ translocation.

Molecular cloning of CD47 cDNA revealed that it is an unusual Ig family member, with an Ig variable-like extracellular domain, a domain with five putative membrane spanning segments (MMS domain)1 and a short cytoplasmic tail (1Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Antibodies against CD47 modulate several β3 integrin functions, such as adhesion, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis in neutrophils (2Senior R.M. Gresham H.D. Griffin G.L. Brown E.J. Chung A.E. J. Clin.

Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, CD47 can synergize with antigen to activate thymocytes and T cells, a function that appears to be integrin-independent (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Ticchioni M. Deckert M. Calandra D. Mary F. Bernard G. Brown E. Bernard A. J. Immunol. 1996; 158: 677-684Google Scholar). Although the potential significance of this synergy is suggested by the decreased number of circulating T cells in CD47-deficient mice (5Lindberg F.P. Bullard D.C. Caver T.E. Gresham H.D. Beaudet A.L. Brown E.J. Science. 1996; 274: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), its molecular mechanism is unknown. Cross-linking CD47 on T cells can induce a TCR-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i (8Waclavicek M. Majdie O. Stulnig T. Berger M. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Pickl W.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5345-5354PubMed Google Scholar), and synergy between CD47 and TCR ligation is found in early events in T cell activation, such as ζ chain phosphorylation and ZAP-70 activation. These data suggest the possibility that CD47 cooperation with TCR in these immediate consequences of TCR ligation accounts for its synergistic effect (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), in contrast to costimulation by CD28, which cooperates at later steps in the signaling cascade leading to IL-2 synthesis (9Bachmann M.F.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggest that these two cell surface molecules may cooperate with TCR by quite distinct pathways. Indeed, it has been proposed that the major effect of CD47 ligation may be simply to more efficiently present antigens to TCR. Cytoskeletal components play critical roles in modulating T cell-APC contact, early events of TCR activation, and assembly of signaling complexes important to subsequent phenotypic responses (reviewed in Refs. 13Penninger J.M.

Rapid cortical actin polymerization and reorganization occurs with TCR ligation, and disruption of actin cytoskeletal dynamics prevents effective T cell activation (16Valitutti S. Dessing M. Aktories K. Gallati H. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 17Geppert T.D. Lipsky P.E. Cell Immunol. 1990; 131: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal rearrangements are known to be important in costimulatory CD28 and LFA-1 receptor movements during cell activation and formation of supramolecular activation clusters or immunological synapses (13Penninger J.M. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Acuto O. Cantrell D. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, TCR-stimulated alterations in the function of Vav, Rac, Cdc42, and WASP can influence cytoskeletal architecture suggesting bidirectional “cross-talk” between the cytoskeleton and TCR-initiated signaling cascades. Recently, membrane rafts, specialized domains in the plasma membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids have been implicated in T cell activation. During activation, TCR transiently associates with membrane rafts, which are enriched in critical signaling components such as Src family kinases, LAT, and G proteins. CD28 and several raft-associated costimulatory molecules enhance association of TCR with rafts during coligation (19Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A.

Multiple mechanisms for modulation of cortical actin appear linked to rafts (26Laux T. Fukami K. Thelen M. Golub T. Frey D. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1455-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 27Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M. Driessens M.H. Insall R.H. Roth M.G. Luby-Phelps K. Marriott G. Hall A. Yin H.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that raft-dependent effects on actin may be critical for T cell activation. The recent recognition that ligation of CD47 stimulates T cell spreading (28Green J.M. Zhelesniak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that the structural requirements for spreading are identical to those for synergy with the TCR to produce IL-2 suggested that these two events may reflect signaling from CD47 to the cytoskeleton important for T cell activation. Now we have shown that CD47 ligation on surfaces stimulates an increase in F-actin and has a similar structure activity profile to cell spreading and to T cell activation. Association of CD47 with membrane rafts shares this structure-function profile, and CD47 enhancement of cell spreading and actin polymerization require its localization to membrane rafts. Moreover, CD47 ligation induces association of PKCθ with the cytoskeleton, and CD47 synergizes with TCR for translocation of this important component of signaling for T cell activation. In contrast, CD47 participation in PLCγ and Ca2+ signaling is not dependent on its raft localization or its ability to induce actin polymerization and cell spreading. Thus, the effects of CD47 on tyrosine phosphorylation and Ca2+ are distinct from its effects on PKCθ and not sufficient to explain its synergy with TCR in T cell activation. Our data lead to the conclusion that there are two distinct effects of CD47 in T cell signaling. Raft association and actin polymerization are not required for CD47 synergy in the early activation events of TCR signaling such as increase in [Ca2+]i but are required for synergy in induction of PKCθ translocation, JNK activation, and IL-2 synthesis. We propose that CD47 can interact with signaling cascades both in and out of membrane rafts and that signaling within rafts is required for its synergy with TCR in T cell activation.

Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). SIRPα1-Fc fusion protein was produced by transient transfection of COS cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein was harvested from culture supernatants by standard methods using protein A-Sepharose and confirmed to exist as a dimer by Western blot with anti-human IgG-Fc (molecular mass, 130 kDa). Coverslips were coated as previously described (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25-mm microscope coverslips were placed into 6-well plates and precoated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific antibodies (Cappel, Durham, NC) in 20 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0. Additional protein binding sites were blocked by treatment with 2% BSA in RPMI 1640 overnight at 4 °C. After washing wells three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the individual stimulating Abs were added in 1 ml of volume each and incubated overnight at 4 °C. OKT3 supernatant was used at various dilutions of supernatant with high = 10% and low = 0.03–0.1%. All other Abs were used at 1 μg/ml. Tissue culture wells were coated similarly with goat anti-mouse IgG-Fc or goat anti-human IgG-Fc and blocked with 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline. Monoclonal Abs were incubated at 1 μg/ml in 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline in wells precoated with anti-mouse Fc. In some cases the final mAb was omitted as a control. SIRPα1-Fc fusion protein or hIgG (as control) were incubated at 1 μg/ml in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in wells precoated with anti-human Fc. For quantitation of changes in F-actin content, 1 × 105 cells in RPMI with 0.1% BSA were added to 96-well plate wells coated with various antibodies for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed by addition of an equal volume of 7.4% formaldehyde at 0 °C. After 30 min at 4 °C, supernatants were removed, and wells were refilled with 50 μl of staining solution including of Alexa-594 phalloidin and 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. After 20 min at 25 °C, wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and read on a Molecular Devices ƒMax fluorescence microplate reader at dual ex/em wavelengths for Alexa-594 and Hoechst. Average cell F-actin content was determined by comparing phalloidin and DNA staining in individual wells. Standard curves of cell number versus Hoechst or Alexa-594 phalloidin staining prepared from serial dilutions of cells added to poly-l-lysine-coated plates showed linear, specific staining over at least a 20-fold range from 5–100 × 103 cells/well. Results were expressed as phalloidin fluorescence/Hoechst fluorescence. All measurements were performed in quadruplicate wells. Cells were suspended at 2.5 × 105/ml in RPMI with 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and 0–10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed. For reconstitution of membrane cholesterol content, cells were subsequently incubated with 1.33 mg/ml cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes in RPMI with 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and then washed. Cells were then applied to prepared 96-well plates for assessment of spreading activity and F-actin content. Fractions were prepared essentially as described by Villalba et al. (36Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106/sample) were applied to stimulatory substrates in 6-well plates for 15–60 min in RPMI with 0.1% BSA. At each time point, cells were harvested and suspended in 1.15 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (42 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) for 45 min. Samples were kept at 0–4 °C throughout the isolation. Cells were then passed through a 30-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 200 ×g to remove nucleii and large debris. Resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was solubilized in 1 ml of 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 145 mm NaCl buffer for 30 min and recentrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Final pellets were considered detergent insoluble cytoskeleton and were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer. PKCθ content was determined by Western blot using goat anti-PKCθ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Quantitation was performed on scanned blots using Adobe Photoshop. The location of cell surface proteins in sucrose density gradients was evaluated by Western blotting of gradient fractions or by using tracer 125I-labeled antibodies as described (28Green J.M. Zhelesniak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In tracer studies, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml (saturating concentration) 125I-mAb (Iodobeads; Pierce) in growth medium for 30 min at 4 °C and washed. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Brij58 on ice. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 40% using 60% sucrose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and this was layered over a volume of 60% sucrose. 25 and 5% sucrose layers were added to form a step gradient, and these gradients were centrifuged at 170,000 ×g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the top of the gradient, as well as the pellet, for Western blotting or assessment of radioactivity in a γ counter. Jurkat cells (0.5–1.5 × 107 cells/point) were incubated on Ab-coated surfaces at 37 °C for 5–15 min, as indicated in the text. For analysis of PLCγ1 phosphorylation, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmEDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 nm calyculin, and 250 μm sodium vanadate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. PLCγ1 was immunoprecipitated overnight by incubation at 4 °C with rabbit anti-PLCγ1 Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and GammaBind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as previously described (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For the JNK assays, samples were processed according to the kit manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA). Briefly, lysate from 2 × 106 cells/sample was mixed with glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads, and a kinase reaction was performed with the bound material. Products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with a phospho-Ser63-specific rabbit anti-c-Jun polyclonal antibody. Equal loading of samples was confirmed by Coomassie staining prior to probing. The positive control for PLCγ phosphorylation was 0.5 mm pervanadate and for JNK activation was 20 ng/ml PMA/2 μm ionomycin for the last 15 min of treatment. Production of IL-2 by adherent cells was assessed as described previously (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 105) were plated in wells coated with anti-CD47, anti-CD8, anti-FLAG, SIRPα1-Fc, or control mAbs together with various concentrations of anti-CD3 in RPMI medium. Anti-CD3 dilutions are indicated as percentages of hybridoma supernatant. After 18–24 h, IL-2 in harvested supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using mAbs 5344.111 and B33–2 and recombinant human IL-2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to construct a standard curve or by incorporation of [3H] thymidine (0.4 μCi/well; specific activity, 6.7 Ci/mmol; ICN) by CTLL-2 cells as previously described (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Jurkat or JinB8 cells at 2 × 107cells/ml in RPMI complete medium were incubated with 3 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester at 37 °C for 20 min. The cell suspension was diluted 10-fold with complete medium and kept at 37 °C for another 20 min. After the incubation periods, cells were washed three times in ice-cold calcium buffer (25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCL, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in the same buffer and kept on ice until use. For evaluation of ligation of CD47 on a substrate with or without coligation of CD3, fura-2-loaded cells were washed and resuspended in calcium buffer and allowed to adhere to Ab-coated coverslips mounted in a Leiden coverslip dish in a PDMI-2 microincubator (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) at 37 °C while viewed through a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Samples were illuminated with light of alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using a FL-4000 imaging system (Georgia Instruments, Roswell, GA), and the emission images were collected with a Dage MTI CCD72 camera and intensifier connected to a Matrox MVP image processing card in a personal computer and stored on a Panasonic TQ3031F optical memory disc recorder. Recordings were made from the point of addition of cells to the coverslip with 340- and 380-nm images recorded every 10 s. The 10-min time point was used for routine analysis based on evaluation of the kinetics of the CD47 response (see Fig. 6). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Error bars in graphs depict the S.E. The statistical significance of each set of results was evaluated by performing a one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett or individualt tests as appropriate. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Previous studies showed that both Ig and MMS domains were required for CD47-stimulated cell spreading and for synergy with TCR in IL-2 synthesis (6Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Reinhold M.I. Green J.M. Lindberg F.P. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. Internat. Immunol. 1999; 11: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggested that similar signaling pathways might activate both functions. Because the cytoskeleton is a critical determinant of cell shape and spreading as well as T cell activation, we hypothesized that CD47 ligation might signal actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. As shown in Fig.1 A, ligation of CD47 caused total cell F-actin content to increase more than when CD18 (β2 integrin LFA-1) was engaged. Because Jurkat cells do not spread on anti-CD18-coated surfaces (12Reinhold M.I. Green J.M. Lindberg F.P. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. Internat. Immunol. 1999; 11: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the F-actin content of these cells was used as a nonactivated control. CD47-induced increase in F-actin was less than that induced by optimal stimulation of CD3 (Fig. 1 A). However, CD47 ligation increased F-actin content in both TCR-expressing and TCR-deficient Jurkat cells to the same extent (Fig. 1 A) showing that, in contrast to CD47-induced Ca2+ flux (8Waclavicek M. Majdie O. Stulnig T. Berger M. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Pickl W.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5345-5354PubMed Google Scholar), this response is not TCR-dependent. Ligation of the costimulatory molecule CD28, which does not stimulate spreading on its own, failed to stimulate a significant elevation of F-actin above the level of CD18-adherent cells. Ligation of CD47 mutants in which the Ig domain had been replaced either with the CD8 extracellular Ig domain (CD8-MMS) or the FLAG epitope (FLAG-MMS) using anti-CD8 or anti-FLAG failed to increase F-actin content (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating that the Ig domain was necessary for this effect of CD47 ligation. To determine whether a membrane-associated CD47 Ig domain was sufficient for actin polymerization, the CD47-deficient Jurkat line JinB8 (12Reinhold M.I. Green J.M. Lindberg F.P. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. Internat. Immunol. 1999; 11: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was studied (Fig. 1 B). Whereas ligation of wild type CD47 transfected into JinB8-induced actin polymerization, ligation of mutants in which the MMS domain was replaced by t"

We examined the essential domain of giantin required for Golgi localization by mutational analysis. The Golgi localization of giantin was not affected by the deletion of its CMD or by substitution with the CMD of syntaxin-2, a plasma membrane protein. The giantin CMD fused to the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-2 could not retain the chimera in the Golgi apparatus. Sequential deletion analysis showed that the COOH-terminal sequence (positions 3059–3161) adjacent to the CMD was the essential domain required for the Golgi localization of giantin. We also examined two other Golgi-resident proteins, golgin-84 and syntaxin-5, with a similar membrane topology as giantin. It was confirmed that the cytoplasmic domain of about 100 residues adjacent to the CMD was required for their Golgi localization. Taken together, these results suggest that the COOH-terminally anchored Golgi proteins with long cytoplasmic extensions have the Golgi localization signal(s) in the cytoplasmic sequence adjacent to the CMD. This is in contrast to previous observations that a transmembrane domain is required for Golgi localization by other Golgi proteins transported from the endoplasmic reticulum.

It is organized by three functionally distinct subcompartments, thecis-Golgi network, the Golgi stack, and thetrans-Golgi network (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). During transport through the Golgi complex, exportable proteins are sequentially modified by processing ofN- and O-linked oligosaccharides (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage (3Oda K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 153: 209-216Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), sulfation (4Hirose S. Oda K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7426-7430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so on. These modifications are accomplished by enzymes localizing on the luminal side of the specified subcompartments.Localization of these Golgi enzymes has been thought to be signal-dependent. Type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic tail, including glycosyltransferases, contain the Golgi retention signals in and around their transmembrane domains (TMDs)1 (for review see Ref.5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for how the TMDs of Golgi enzymes could participate in their Golgi retention; the oligomerization or kin recognition model (6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the lipid-sorting or bilayer thickness model (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Golgi localization signals of type I membrane proteins are probably contained in the cytoplasmic tail, as demonstrated for TGN38 (9Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the proprotein processing enzyme furin (10Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), both of which are localized to the trans-Golgi network by tyrosine-containing motifs. These proteins, irrespective of type I or II, have the common feature in the membrane topology that the majority of their protein masses protrude from the membrane into the lumen.Giantin is an integral Golgi-resident protein (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) that has no cleavable signal sequence at the NH2 terminus but contains a single hydrophobic sequence at the COOH terminus that could participate in membrane localization (13Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J.

Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that giantin is cytoplasmically oriented and anchored to the Golgi membrane by the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (CMD for “COOH-terminal membrane-anchoring domain”). Although containing 24 amino acid residues (enough for spanning the lipid bilayer of membranes), the CMD is not considered to be a typical TMD, because giantin has no luminal side sequence following the CMD. Linstedtet al. (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that newly synthesized giantin was first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and then transported to the Golgi complex in the same manner as is well known for Golgi-associated membrane proteins such as glycosyltransferases. They also suggested that attachment of the CMD to the ER was essential for the Golgi localization of giantin.The yeast Sed5p is a t-SNARE that is primarily localized to the Golgi and involved in vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi complex (17Hardwick K.G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Syntaxin-2, which is also a t-SNARE, is, however, localized to the plasma membrane (18Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Both Sed5p and syntaxin-2 are COOH-terminally anchored proteins with the same membrane topology as giantin. The different localization of these proteins, despite the same length of their CMDs, raises the possibility that the Golgi localization signal of giantin and Sed5p is contained in a cytoplasmic domain rather than in the CMD. In fact, it was reported that Sed5p requires a cytoplasmic domain in addition to the CMD for targeting to the Golgi (19Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study we carried out mutational analysis of giantin to determine a domain responsible for its targeting and retention to the Golgi, demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain of about 100 residues adjacent to the CMD is essential for the localization of giantin to the Golgi complex.DISCUSSIONGiantin is an integral membrane protein of which the single hydrophobic domain CMD at the COOH terminus functions as the anchor to the Golgi membrane (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 13Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the localization of giantin to the Golgi involves at least three steps: insertion into the ER membrane, controlled incorporation into transport vesicles, and retention within the Golgi (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CMD of giantin was suggested to be essential for the insertion into the ER membrane and transport to the Golgi, because deletion of the CMD caused no attachment of giantin to the ER, resulting in its distribution into the cytoplasm (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to our results, which demonstrated that giantin lacking the CMD is still associated with the ER and transported to the Golgi, although we agree with the proposal that newly synthesized giantin is initially associated with the ER and then transported to the Golgi, like conventional membrane proteins of the secretory pathway (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Giantin appears to have another cytoplasmic domain, in addition to the CMD, for the initial association with the ER membrane, because the mutant D5 without a COOH-terminal domain after position 2804 was completely associated with the ER membrane (Fig. 3). Although the mutant D5 was not transported to the Golgi, the mutant D8ΔM (2619–3162) was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 4). In addition, the mutant D9ΔM (2804–3162) was neither associated with the ER nor transported to the Golgi, whereas the counterpart D9 with the CMD was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that giantin contains domains with the following characteristics. 1) A cytoplasmic domain between positions 2619 and 2804 interacts with the ER membrane but is not sufficient to target the protein to the Golgi. 2) The Golgi targeting domain is contained in the sequence 2804–3162. 3) The lack of the cytoplasmic domain (2619–2804) for the ER interaction can be compensated by the CMD, and the presence of either domain of the two is prerequisite for the ER association and subsequent transport to the Golgi. It is also clear that the CMD of giantin does not function as the primary determinant for Golgi localization, as supported by the finding that its deletion or substitution with the CMD of syntaxin-2 causes no effect on the Golgi localization of giantin. This is in contrast to other Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins of which the TMD is involved in their Golgi localization (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Exit from the ER is now considered to be a selective event involving sorting and concentration, in contrast to a constitutive “bulk flow” process as suggested previously (32Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a diacidic sorting signal is required for efficient ER export (33Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,34Bannykh S.I. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This motif, which contains the amino acids Asp or Glu separated by a variable residue ((D/E)X(E/D)), is found in the cytoplasmic tail of a number of transmembrane proteins and is suggested to facilitate interaction with the COPII coat machinery. The di-acidic exit motif is located within or close to the Tyr-based sorting motif YXXØ (where Ø is a bulky hydrophobic residue). Thus, it is likely that the ER accumulation of giantin mutants observed here is due to the lack of the ER exit motif. In fact, the motif is not found in the sequence of mutant D5 (1–2803), whereas it is found in positions 2898–2906 (YLMAISDKD) and in two other positions, 3053–3055 (ETE) and 3086–3088 (EEE), all or one of which is contained in the competent mutants D6–D9 and I–III with or without the CMD.It has been suggested that the TMD of Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins is involved in Golgi retention or localization; the TMD-dependent localization probably reflects the lipid composition and thickness of target membranes (5Munro S.

Although not containing any obvious distinguishing sequence motif, the Golgi TMDs are on average five residues shorter than those of plasma membrane proteins. The relevance of this difference in TMD length to retention is supported by mutational analysis; lengthening the TMD of Golgi enzymes results in their transport to the plasma membrane (5Munro S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is, however, unlikely that the TMD or CMD of giantin is critically involved in Golgi localization. Giantin has the same residue number in the CMD as that of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin-2, and replacement of the CMD by that of syntaxin-2, or even the lack of the CMD, does not influence the Golgi localization of giantin.In this study we also examined two other COOH-terminally anchored proteins, golgin-84 and the t-SNARE syntaxin-5, which are localized to the Golgi with the same membrane topology as giantin. Because giantin has been shown to tether COPI vesicles to the Golgi membrane (35Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), golgin-84 was suggested to play a similar role in tethering transport vesicles to a target membrane (22Bascom B.A. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the three COOH-terminally anchored proteins have the common feature for Golgi localization; each cytoplasmic domain of ∼100 amino acid residues close to the CMD or TMD is primarily required for the targeting and retention to the Golgi. This is essentially the same result obtained for the yeast Sed5p (17Hardwick K.G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-5 required for the Golgi localization is highly conserved in that of Sed5p (36Sacher M. Stone S. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17134-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The importance of a similar cytoplasmic domain for the Golgi retention was also demonstrated for the Golgi enzyme Mnt1p (37Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the trans-Golgi network-localized t-SNARE syntaxin-6 (38Watson R. Pessin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Syntaxin-6 has a cytoplasmic H2 domain adjacent to the TMD, which is predicted to form a 63-residue amphipathic α-helical structure and play a major role in Golgi localization (38Watson R. Pessin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the plasma membrane syntaxin-1 was suggested to have no signal for the ER attachment or the Golgi localization in the cytoplasmic domain (39Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In addition to giantin and golgin-84, there are many other coiled-coil proteins that are peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi, including GM130/golgin-95 (40Nakamura N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8328-8337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Golgin-97, golgin-245/p230, and several other proteins are found to contain a conserved COOH-terminal sequence (about 50 amino acids), which is designated the GRIP domain (44Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Rab6-interacting domain (45Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), or Golgi localization domain (46Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet D. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The domain contains a consensus sequence including a Tyr-based motif. In fact, the deletion of the domain or substitution of Tyr by Ala in the Tyr-based motif resulted in failure of the proteins to correctly localize to the Golgi (44Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 45Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 46Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet D. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain functions in targeting these coiled-coil proteins to the Golgi. It is of interest to know whether giantin also contains such a motif in the corresponding domain. The consensus sequence proposed for the GRIP domain, however, is not found in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (domain III) of giantin or in that of golgin-84 (g84D2) or syntaxin-5 (S5D2). At present we cannot find a possible consensus sequence or motif among the domains of giantin, golgin-84, and syntaxin-5, except for the common structural feature that they contain a coiled-coil domain. This suggests the possibility that the COOH-terminal coiled-coil domain may play an important role in the interaction of giantin (as well as golgin-84 and syntaxin-5) with the Golgi membrane, although details of the mechanism remain to be solved. The Golgi complex plays a crucial role in intracellular transport and modification of exportable proteins and lysosomal proteins. It is organized by three functionally distinct subcompartments, thecis-Golgi network, the Golgi stack, and thetrans-Golgi network (1Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). During transport through the Golgi complex, exportable proteins are sequentially modified by processing ofN- and O-linked oligosaccharides (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage (3Oda K. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 153: 209-216Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), sulfation (4Hirose S. Oda K. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7426-7430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and so on. These modifications are accomplished by enzymes localizing on the luminal side of the specified subcompartments. Localization of these Golgi enzymes has been thought to be signal-dependent. Type II membrane proteins with a short cytoplasmic tail, including glycosyltransferases, contain the Golgi retention signals in and around their transmembrane domains (TMDs)1 (for review see Ref.5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed for how the TMDs of Golgi enzymes could participate in their Golgi retention; the oligomerization or kin recognition model (6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Nilsson T. Hoe M.H. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the lipid-sorting or bilayer thickness model (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Golgi localization signals of type I membrane proteins are probably contained in the cytoplasmic tail, as demonstrated for TGN38 (9Reaves B. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and the proprotein processing enzyme furin (10Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 111: 2851-2859Google Scholar, 11Schafer W. Stroh A. Berghofer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), both of which are localized to the trans-Golgi network by tyrosine-containing motifs. These proteins, irrespective of type I or II, have the common feature in the membrane topology that the majority of their protein masses protrude from the membrane into the lumen. Giantin is an integral Golgi-resident protein (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) that has no cleavable signal sequence at the NH2 terminus but contains a single hydrophobic sequence at the COOH terminus that could participate in membrane localization (13Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Toki C. Fujiwara T. Sohda M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that giantin is cytoplasmically oriented and anchored to the Golgi membrane by the COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (CMD for “COOH-terminal membrane-anchoring domain”). Although containing 24 amino acid residues (enough for spanning the lipid bilayer of membranes), the CMD is not considered to be a typical TMD, because giantin has no luminal side sequence following the CMD. Linstedtet al. (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that newly synthesized giantin was first inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and then transported to the Golgi complex in the same manner as is well known for Golgi-associated membrane proteins such as glycosyltransferases. They also suggested that attachment of the CMD to the ER was essential for the Golgi localization of giantin. The yeast Sed5p is a t-SNARE that is primarily localized to the Golgi and involved in vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi complex (17Hardwick K.G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Syntaxin-2, which is also a t-SNARE, is, however, localized to the plasma membrane (18Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Both Sed5p and syntaxin-2 are COOH-terminally anchored proteins with the same membrane topology as giantin. The different localization of these proteins, despite the same length of their CMDs, raises the possibility that the Golgi localization signal of giantin and Sed5p is contained in a cytoplasmic domain rather than in the CMD. In fact, it was reported that Sed5p requires a cytoplasmic domain in addition to the CMD for targeting to the Golgi (19Banfield D.K. Lewis M.J. Rabouille C. Warren G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the present study we carried out mutational analysis of giantin to determine a domain responsible for its targeting and retention to the Golgi, demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain of about 100 residues adjacent to the CMD is essential for the localization of giantin to the Golgi complex. DISCUSSIONGiantin is an integral membrane protein of which the single hydrophobic domain CMD at the COOH terminus functions as the anchor to the Golgi membrane (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 13Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schroter H. Wiemann C. Renz M. J. Autoimmun. 1994; 7: 67-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Toki C. Fujiwara T. Sohda M. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the localization of giantin to the Golgi involves at least three steps: insertion into the ER membrane, controlled incorporation into transport vesicles, and retention within the Golgi (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CMD of giantin was suggested to be essential for the insertion into the ER membrane and transport to the Golgi, because deletion of the CMD caused no attachment of giantin to the ER, resulting in its distribution into the cytoplasm (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to our results, which demonstrated that giantin lacking the CMD is still associated with the ER and transported to the Golgi, although we agree with the proposal that newly synthesized giantin is initially associated with the ER and then transported to the Golgi, like conventional membrane proteins of the secretory pathway (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Giantin appears to have another cytoplasmic domain, in addition to the CMD, for the initial association with the ER membrane, because the mutant D5 without a COOH-terminal domain after position 2804 was completely associated with the ER membrane (Fig. 3). Although the mutant D5 was not transported to the Golgi, the mutant D8ΔM (2619–3162) was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 4). In addition, the mutant D9ΔM (2804–3162) was neither associated with the ER nor transported to the Golgi, whereas the counterpart D9 with the CMD was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that giantin contains domains with the following characteristics. 1) A cytoplasmic domain between positions 2619 and 2804 interacts with the ER membrane but is not sufficient to target the protein to the Golgi. 2) The Golgi targeting domain is contained in the sequence 2804–3162. 3) The lack of the cytoplasmic domain (2619–2804) for the ER interaction can be compensated by the CMD, and the presence of either domain of the two is prerequisite for the ER association and subsequent transport to the Golgi. It is also clear that the CMD of giantin does not function as the primary determinant for Golgi localization, as supported by the finding that its deletion or substitution with the CMD of syntaxin-2 causes no effect on the Golgi localization of giantin. This is in contrast to other Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins of which the TMD is involved in their Golgi localization (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Exit from the ER is now considered to be a selective event involving sorting and concentration, in contrast to a constitutive “bulk flow” process as suggested previously (32Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a diacidic sorting signal is required for efficient ER export (33Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,34Bannykh S.I. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This motif, which contains the amino acids Asp or Glu separated by a variable residue ((D/E)X(E/D)), is found in the cytoplasmic tail of a number of transmembrane proteins and is suggested to facilitate interaction with the COPII coat machinery. The di-acidic exit motif is located within or close to the Tyr-based sorting motif YXXØ (where Ø is a bulky hydrophobic residue). Thus, it is likely that the ER accumulation of giantin mutants observed here is due to the lack of the ER exit motif. In fact, the motif is not found in the sequence of mutant D5 (1–2803), whereas it is found in positions 2898–2906 (YLMAISDKD) and in two other positions, 3053–3055 (ETE) and 3086–3088 (EEE), all or one of which is contained in the competent mutants D6–D9 and I–III with or without the CMD.It has been suggested that the TMD of Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins is involved in Golgi retention or localization; the TMD-dependent localization probably reflects the lipid composition and thickness of target membranes (5Munro S.

It is of interest to know whether giantin also contains such a motif in the corresponding domain. The consensus sequence proposed for the GRIP domain, however, is not found in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain (domain III) of giantin or in that of golgin-84 (g84D2) or syntaxin-5 (S5D2). At present we cannot find a possible consensus sequence or motif among the domains of giantin, golgin-84, and syntaxin-5, except for the common structural feature that they contain a coiled-coil domain. This suggests the possibility that the COOH-terminal coiled-coil domain may play an important role in the interaction of giantin (as well as golgin-84 and syntaxin-5) with the Golgi membrane, although details of the mechanism remain to be solved. Giantin is an integral membrane protein of which the single hydrophobic domain CMD at the COOH terminus functions as the anchor to the Golgi membrane (12Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 13Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Funct. 1997; 22: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the localization of giantin to the Golgi involves at least three steps: insertion into the ER membrane, controlled incorporation into transport vesicles, and retention within the Golgi (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CMD of giantin was suggested to be essential for the insertion into the ER membrane and transport to the Golgi, because deletion of the CMD caused no attachment of giantin to the ER, resulting in its distribution into the cytoplasm (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to our results, which demonstrated that giantin lacking the CMD is still associated with the ER and transported to the Golgi, although we agree with the proposal that newly synthesized giantin is initially associated with the ER and then transported to the Golgi, like conventional membrane proteins of the secretory pathway (16Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Giantin appears to have another cytoplasmic domain, in addition to the CMD, for the initial association with the ER membrane, because the mutant D5 without a COOH-terminal domain after position 2804 was completely associated with the ER membrane (Fig. 3). Although the mutant D5 was not transported to the Golgi, the mutant D8ΔM (2619–3162) was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 4). In addition, the mutant D9ΔM (2804–3162) was neither associated with the ER nor transported to the Golgi, whereas the counterpart D9 with the CMD was localized to the Golgi (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that giantin contains domains with the following characteristics. 1) A cytoplasmic domain between positions 2619 and 2804 interacts with the ER membrane but is not sufficient to target the protein to the Golgi. 2) The Golgi targeting domain is contained in the sequence 2804–3162. 3) The lack of the cytoplasmic domain (2619–2804) for the ER interaction can be compensated by the CMD, and the presence of either domain of the two is prerequisite for the ER association and subsequent transport to the Golgi. It is also clear that the CMD of giantin does not function as the primary determinant for Golgi localization, as supported by the finding that its deletion or substitution with the CMD of syntaxin-2 causes no effect on the Golgi localization of giantin. This is in contrast to other Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins of which the TMD is involved in their Golgi localization (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Exit from the ER is now considered to be a selective event involving sorting and concentration, in contrast to a constitutive “bulk flow” process as suggested previously (32Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a diacidic sorting signal is required for efficient ER export (33Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,34Bannykh S.I. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 8: 21-25Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This motif, which contains the amino acids Asp or Glu separated by a variable residue ((D/E)X(E/D)), is found in the cytoplasmic tail of a number of transmembrane proteins and is suggested to facilitate interaction with the COPII coat machinery. The di-acidic exit motif is located within or close to the Tyr-based sorting motif YXXØ (where Ø is a bulky hydrophobic residue). Thus, it is likely that the ER accumulation of giantin mutants observed here is due to the lack of the ER exit motif. In fact, the motif is not found in the sequence of mutant D5 (1–2803), whereas it is found in positions 2898–2906 (YLMAISDKD) and in two other positions, 3053–3055 (ETE) and 3086–3088 (EEE), all or one of which is contained in the competent mutants D6–D9 and I–III with or without the CMD. It has been suggested that the TMD of Golgi-resident type II and III membrane proteins is involved in Golgi retention or localization; the TMD-dependent localization probably reflects the lipid composition and thickness of target membranes (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Although not containing any obvious distinguishing sequence motif, the Golgi TMDs are on average five residues shorter than those of plasma membrane proteins. The relevance of this difference in TMD length to retention is supported by mutational analysis; lengthening the TMD of Golgi enzymes results in their transport to the plasma membrane (5Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 6Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is, however, unlikely that the TMD or CMD of giantin is critically involved in Golgi localization. Giantin has the same residue number in the CMD as that of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin-2, and replacement of the CMD by that of syntaxin-2, or even the lack of the CMD, does not influence the Golgi localization of giantin. In this study we also examined two other COOH-terminally anchored proteins, golgin-84 and the t-SNARE syntaxin-5, which are localized to the Golgi with the same membrane topology as giantin. Because giantin has been shown to tether COPI vesicles to the Golgi membrane (35Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jämsä E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), golgin-84 was suggested to play a similar role in tethering transport vesicles to a target membrane (22Bascom B.A. Srinivasan S. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that the three COOH-terminally anchored proteins have the common feature for Golgi localization; each cytoplasmic domain of ∼100 amino acid residues close to the CMD or TMD is primarily required for the targeting and retention to the Golgi. This is essentially the same result obtained for the yeast Sed5p (17Hardwick K.G. Pelham R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-5 required for the Golgi localization is highly conserved in that of Sed5p (36Sacher M. Stone S. Ferro-Novick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17134-17138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The importance of a similar cytoplasmic domain for the Golgi retention was also demonstrated for the Golgi enzyme Mnt1p (37Lussier M. Sdicu A.-M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the trans-Golgi network-localized t-SNARE syntaxin-6 (38Watson R. Pessin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Syntaxin-6 has a cytoplasmic H2 domain adjacent to the TMD, which is predicted to form a 63-residue amphipathic α-helical structure and play a major role in Golgi localization (38Watson R. Pessin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the plasma membrane syntaxin-1 was suggested to have no signal for the ER attachment or the Golgi localization in the cytoplasmic domain (39Vogel K. Cabaniols J.-P. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to giantin and golgin-84, there are many other coiled-coil proteins that are peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi, including GM130/golgin-95 (40Nakamura N.

Golgin-97, golgin-245/p230, and several other proteins are found to contain a conserved COOH-terminal sequence (about 50 amino acids), which is designated the GRIP domain (44Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Rab6-interacting domain (45Barr F.A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The domain contains a consensus sequence including a Tyr-based motif. In fact, the deletion of the domain or substitution of Tyr by Ala in the Tyr-based motif resulted in failure of the proteins to correctly localize to the Golgi (44Munro S. Nichols B.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 45Barr F.A. Curr.

It is of interest to know whether giantin also contains such a motif in the corresponding domain.

https://openalex.org/W2091052257,"Plasmin, a broad spectrum proteinase, is inactivated by an autoproteolytic reaction that results in the destruction of the heavy and light chains of the protein. Recently we demonstrated that a 61-kDa plasmin fragment was one of the major products of this autoproteolytic reaction (Fitzpatrick, S. L., Kassam, G., Choi, K. S., Kang, H. M., Fogg, D. K., and Waisman, D. M. (2000)<i>Biochemistry</i> 39, 1021–1028). In the present communication we have identified the 61-kDa plasmin fragment as a novel four kringle-containing protein consisting of the amino acid sequence Lys<sup>78</sup>–Lys<sup>468</sup>. To avoid confusion with the plasmin(ogen) fragment, angiostatin® (Lys<sup>78</sup>-Ala<sup>440</sup>), we have named this protein A<sub>61</sub>. Unlike angiostatin, A<sub>61</sub> was produced<i>in vitro</i> from plasmin autodigestion in the absence of sulfhydryl donors. A<sub>61</sub> bound to lysine-Sepharose and also underwent a large increase in fluorescence yield upon binding of the lysine analogue, <i>trans</i>-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Circular dichroism suggested that A<sub>61</sub> was composed of 21% β-strand, 14% β-turn, 18% 3<sub>1</sub>-helix and 8% 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. A<sub>61</sub> was an anti-angiogenic protein as indicated by the inhibition of bovine capillary endothelial cell proliferation. Plasminogen was converted to A<sub>61</sub> by HT1080 cells and bovine capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, a plasminogen fragment similar to A<sub>61</sub> was present in the serum of humans as well as normal and tumor-bearing mice. These results establish that plasmin turnover can generate anti-angiogenic plasmin fragments in a nonpathological setting."

A leucine residue is strictly conserved in the middle of the M2 region of all subunit isoforms and is located at position 263 of the α1 subunit.

Buhr A. Tretter V. Sigel E. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we investigated the properties of chimeric α1β3 receptor subunits coexpressed with α1 subunits. The results indicated an importance of Ala252 and Leu253 for thetert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding affinity. Here, we show that substitutions of β3A252 and β3L253 result in reduced picrotoxin affinity. For β3L253F affinity is more than 100-fold reduced, and a huge transient opening of the channel upon removal of picrotoxin was evident. Such a transient channel opening has not been observed for any other mutation before, and our mathematical model suggests that this is a consequence of the strongly decreased affinity for picrotoxin. Residue Val256, neighboring Phe257, the homologue on the α1 subunit, has been shown to covalently interact with other noncompetitive blockers acting at the picrotoxin binding site (14Perret P.

Leucine 253 of the β3 subunit (β3L253) may therefore be part of the contact site for picrotoxin together with α1V256. In addition, we report that single point mutation β3L253F confers abnormal gating properties to α1β3 receptors. These include spontaneous opening of the channels and a very high GABA sensitivity for channel gating, Thus, our work points to the involvement in GABAA receptor channel gating of more N-terminally located amino acid residues than previously suggested. Residues are numbered according to the mature rat sequences. The cDNAs coding for the α1, β3, and chimeric subunits of the rat GABAA receptor channel have been described elsewhere (22Jursky F.

This solution contained the transcripts coding for the different subunits at concentrations of 75 nm. RNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized plasmids encoding the desired protein using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. A poly(A) tail of ∼300 residues was added to the transcripts by using yeast poly(A) polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cRNA combinations were coprecipitated in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Transcripts were quantified on agarose gels after staining with Radiant Red RNA Stain (Bio-Rad) by comparing staining intensities with various amounts of molecular weight markers (RNA Ladder; Life Technologies, Inc.). Electrophysiological experiments were performed by the two-electrode voltage clamp method at a holding potential of −80 mV. GABA and picrotoxin (Fluka) were applied for 20 s, and a washout period of 3–15 min was allowed to ensure full recovery from desensitization. The perfusion solution (6 ml/min) was applied through a glass capillary with an inner diameter of 1.35 mm, the mouth of which was placed about 0.4 mm from the surface of the oocyte. The rate of solution change under our conditions has been estimated 70% within less than 0.5 s (25Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Möhler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Current responses have been fitted to the Hill equation: I =I max/(1+(EC50/[A])n) whereI is the peak current at a given concentration of GABA (A),I max is the maximum current, EC50 is the concentration of agonist eliciting half-maximal current, andn is the Hill coefficient. Currents were measured using a modified OC-725 amplifier (Warner Instruments Corp.) in combination with a xy recorder or digitized using a MacLab/200 (AD Instruments). We analyzed the gating behavior of the mutated channel using a kinetic model that omits all states that only become marginally populated (26Hill T.L. Free Energy Transduction in Biology: The Steady-state Kinetic and Thermodynamic Formalism. Academic Press, New York1977: 193-200Crossref Google Scholar). For arguments described later, the model consists of four states: two different states for closed channels (C, R), one state for open channels (O) and one state for channels blocked by picrotoxin (O.PTX). The triangular three state model in the absence of picrotoxin (O, C, R) requires six microscopic rate constants. They are calculated using the experimentally determined current decay constants from the open to the closed states (τ1 and τ2), the equilibrium constant for the spontaneously open state, and the law of detailed balancing. The remaining rate constants were used to adjust the simulation to the data. The binding of picrotoxin to the receptors adds four new rate constants to the system. They have to provide the reopening constant measured in the presence of picrotoxin (τ), and they have to satisfy the law of detailed balancing. The additional two rates were used to fit the data. Therefore, from the 10 rate constants in total there are only four that can be used to reconcile the simulations with the data. The kinetics of application and washout of picrotoxin is not taken into account. They are assumed to happen instantaneously. This assumption is justified because the processes studied here develop at a much slower time scale. The integration of the differential equation system was performed using the subroutines of the Matlab 5.2.0 library (MathWorks Inc.). Fig. 1 shows the structure of wild type and chimeric subunits. The chimera consist of N-terminal sequences of the β3 subunit fused to C-terminal sequences of the α1 subunit. They differ from each other in the residues forming the ion channel pore region. Each of the chimeras was coexpressed together with the α1 subunit in Xenopus oocytes. Mature receptors incorporated in the surface membrane were analyzed by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Heteromeric α1CH7 receptors failed to respond to GABA (<10 nA), and an apparent outward current could be measured during application of 1 mm picrotoxin alone (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, a strong transient inward current was detected during washout of picrotoxin in the absence of GABA (Fig. 2 A). Wild type α1β3 receptors were activated by GABA and showed no response to the application of picrotoxin alone (Fig.2 B). Injection of cRNA coding for CH7 alone did not result in ion currents induced by picrotoxin or GABA (data not shown), indicating that the channel with these unusual properties was formed from α1CH7. Three additional chimeras were coexpressed together with the α1 subunit to localize residues important for the unusual gating behavior. Only α1CH74 also displayed the picrotoxin washout current found in α1CH7 receptors (Table I). An amino acid comparison between the chimera revealed that a threonine-valine-phenylalanine motif was common to CH7 and CH74 and absent in the other two constructs. Three mutant subunits were constructed by individually introducing these three residues of α1 into the homologous positions of β3, with the aim to identify the amino acid residue responsible for the abnormal properties.Figure 2Electrophysiological properties of α1CH7 and of α1β3receptors. Currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions at −80 mV from oocytes injected with α1 and CH7 (A), with α1 and β3(B), or with α1 and β3L253F (C) subunits. 1 mm GABA and 1 mm picrotoxin (Ptx) were applied for 20 s each (A andB, bars) or 1 min (C). Two additional identical experiments in each case gave similar results. The same behavior of the channels was observed by using lower concentrations of picrotoxin in three additional experiments and shorter application times in 17 additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IProperties of wild type and chimeric receptorsSubunit combinationGABA-induced currentPicrotoxin wash-out currentα1β3+−α1CH3+−α1CH4+−α1CH74−+α1CH7−+Responses to 1 mM GABA or 1 mM picrotoxin are shown. Open table in a new tab Responses to 1 mM GABA or 1 mM picrotoxin are shown. Wild type and mutant β3 subunits were coexpressed together with the α1 subunit in Xenopus oocytes. All three mutant receptors expressed GABA-activated chloride currents. Receptors with a leucine to phenylalanine substitution in the channel pore-forming region at position 253 (α1β3L253F) could be activated by very low concentrations of GABA (30 nm). Repeated applications elicited increasingly smaller current amplitudes even when a washout period of up to 15 min was used (data not shown). For this reason it was technically not possible to measure the apparent affinity of GABA for channel opening in α1β3L253F. Dose response curves for wild type α1β3, α1β3V251T, and α1β3A252V revealed 3.5- and 6.0-fold increases in the apparent affinities to GABA for these mutated receptors (Table II), respectively.Table IIProperties of wild type and mutant GABAA receptor channelsSubunit combinationGABA EC50Hillμmα1β38.4 ± 3.7 (n = 8)1.2 ± 0.2α1β3V251T2.4 ± 1.4 (n = 5)1.2 ± 0.1α1β3A252V1.4 ± 0.5 (n = 4)1.1 ± 0.2α1β3L253Famplitude not reproducible Open table in a new tab Application of 1 mmpicrotoxin in the absence of GABA did not induce any apparent outward or inward currents in α1β3V251T and α1β3A252V receptors. In contrast, in oocytes expressing α1β3L253F receptors, picrotoxin application resulted in apparent outward currents (Fig.2 C) similarly to oocytes expressing α1CH7. The mutated channel α1β3L253F also showed a huge transient inward current upon washout of picrotoxin (Fig.2 C). At 1 mm picrotoxin, the amplitude of the transient inward current was 11 times (average of three determinations) the amplitude of the apparent outward current. To exclude that the current properties upon injection of cRNAs coding for α1 and β3L253F resulted from homomeric β3L253F, we also expressed this mutated subunit alone. No detectable signal could be obtained with 300 μmpicrotoxin (two independent batches of oocytes). A voltage ramp protocol was used to measure ion currents in mutant α1β3L253F channels before and during and the application of picrotoxin and about 5 s after its removal (Fig. 3 A). The voltage ramp had a duration of 0.13 s, such that the amplitude of the inward current showed little change during the application of the ramp. Picrotoxin application resulted in a reduction of the membrane conductance, indicating that part of the receptors are spontaneously in an open conformation. All three curves obtained had the same intersection at −38 ± 1 mV (three experiments). Therefore, it can be concluded that the spontaneous current and the transient inward current have the same ion permeability. Replacing the 95 mmCl− with 9.5 mm Cl− and 84.5 mm acetate− in the outside medium resulted in an about 60 mV shift to the right in the reversal potential of the transient inward current (not shown), in line with a chloride selective conductance. From the reversal potential of −38 mV determined at an extracellular chloride concentration of 95 mm, an intracellular chloride concentration of ∼23 mm may be estimated. The same voltage ramp protocol was used before and during the application of a subsaturating concentration of GABA to oocytes expressing the wild type α1β3 receptor (Fig. 3 B). The intersection of the two curves was found at −25 ± 2 mV (three experiments), indicating an intracellular chloride ion concentration of about 37 mm. The difference in the intracellular chloride concentration in oocytes expressing wild type and the point mutated receptor can be explained by a more negative membrane potential of the oocyte than the chloride reversal potential. Under conditions where the permeability for this ion is increased, the membrane potential drives chloride ions out of the cell. As mentioned above, the channel opens to a certain degree spontaneously producing an inward current. The initial response to the application of picrotoxin is an apparent outward current reflecting channel closure. The picrotoxin concentration dependence of the peak current amplitude is illustrated in Fig. 4 A. It increases between 10 and 1000 μm picrotoxin and shows no saturation up to 1 mm picrotoxin (Fig. 4 C). The maximum apparent outward current may, however, be estimated, assuming an infinite membrane resistance for the case where all channels are in the closed state. Assuming that most channels are in the open state upon removal of picrotoxin, it can be estimated that less than 9% of the channels are spontaneously open prior to the application of picrotoxin. The shape of the late apparent outward current response during perfusion with picrotoxin depends on the concentration of picrotoxin used (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of low concentrations, only a transient inhibition of the current could be detected, followed by reopening of the channels. The time course of this reopening seemed picrotoxin concentration independent in the range of 10–300 μm. Because of the small amplitudes of this component, it could only be estimated. Assuming a mono-exponential time course reopening was characterized by a τ in the range of ∼6–13 s (not shown). A large transient inward current was observed during washout of picrotoxin. The concentration dependence on picrotoxin of this current is illustrated in Fig. 4 C. Its amplitude increases using increasing concentrations of picrotoxin and does not saturate up to 1 mm picrotoxin. Half of the amplitude observed at 1 mm picrotoxin was observed at about 300 μm(Fig. 4 C). Fig. 5 Ashows that the size of this current increases with the duration of picrotoxin application. For this experiment 300 μmpicrotoxin was applied during different time intervals between ∼1 and 60 s. The time dependence of the increase in inward current amplitude is well fitted with a mono-exponential function with τ = 9.1 ± 2.2 s (n = 3). Reclosure of the channel after transient opening was independent of the picrotoxin concentration and followed a bi-exponential time course with τf = 5.5 ± 2.8 s and τs = 23.3 ± 12.0 s (means ± S.D., three experiments at five different concentrations each). The picrotoxin sensitivity of GABA-activated currents was also measured for wild type α1β3 receptors and mutant α1β3V251T and α1β3A252V receptors. A GABA concentration eliciting 10–15% of the maximum current was used in these experiments. Because α1β3V251T and α1β3A252V receptors displayed an increased apparent affinity to GABA (Table II), a lower concentration of agonist had to be used for these two mutant receptors. α1β3A252V receptors displayed an about 10-fold reduced sensitivity to picrotoxin compared with wild type and α1β3V251T receptors (Fig.6). To explain the following two phenomena, namely the reopening of the channels during continuous application of picrotoxin and the transient inward current after its removal, we performed computer simulations based on the model shown in Fig.7. Rate constants used are given in the figure legends of Figs. 4 B. It is assumed that about 5% of the channels are spontaneously open, which determines the equilibrium state of the system and the initial conditions for the simulations. The channels switch between this open state and the closed states giving rise to the observed inward resting current. Washout of picrotoxin is assumed to lead to fast dissociation from the receptor without rebinding. This results in the immediate emptying of all bound states. The number of picrotoxin less closed states is then given by the relaxation process upon picrotoxin removal. The double exponential decay determined in the experiments requires a minimal model which consists of three states: an open state (O) and two closed states (C and R). Applying picrotoxin to the system leads to a pronounced reduction in the number of open channels. The resulting initial decrease of the inward current (apparent outward current) is followed by the relaxation into a new equilibrium state. We propose that only the state (O.PTX) (binding of picrotoxin to the open channels) is kinetically relevant because after withdrawal of picrotoxin these channels are able to produce a transient inward current. If in contrast picrotoxin binding to closed channels would be dominant, no transient inward current could be observed, because the channels would already be closed. Fig. 5 B presents simulations of experiments where the duration of 300 μm picrotoxin application is varied. Because the equilibrium is on the side of the state (O.PTX) because of the excess of picrotoxin, the longer the transient filling of the state (O.PTX), the larger the transient inward current amplitude after removal of picrotoxin. Fig. 4 B shows simulations of the current during perfusion with different concentrations of picrotoxin. The amplitude of the initial apparent outward current is limited at high picrotoxin concentration because of saturation of channel closure. The following relaxation process into the new equilibrium state depends only weakly on the concentration of picrotoxin (largest relaxation constant τ = 13–16 s), which is in agreement with the experiments. The simulations revealed that the closed state (R) serves as a reservoir for states C and O so that after binding of the channels to picrotoxin the two latter states become partly refilled by channels from state R. Obviously the higher the concentration of picrotoxin, the larger the population of the state (O.PTX), and as a consequence the amplitude of the rebound current augments with increasing picrotoxin concentration. The true k 2 that describes the transition rate from O.PTX to O is obscured by the rate of solution change (see “Experimental Procedures”). The model is constructed in such a way that the decay of the inward current after removal of picrotoxin is double exponential with time constants τ1 = 8 s and τ2 = 12 s. Both, the picrotoxin concentration dependence (Fig. 4 B) and the time dependence (Fig. 5 B) of the responses of the mutated channel to picrotoxin exposure and removal predicted by the model should be compared with the experimentally observed behavior (Figs. 4 Aand 5 A). Except for the initial peak of the apparent outward current predicted from the model and almost absent in the experimental traces, the agreement between model and experiment is remarkable. The difference is probably mostly due to the limited rate of solution change (see “Experimental Procedures”), which has not been taken into account in the simulations. We studied alterations in the channel lining part of the recombinant α1β3 GABAAreceptor. A mutant ion channel was found that displayed a transient chloride current upon removal of the channel blocker picrotoxin. A single point mutation is able to confer this unusual property to the receptor, namely, of leucine 253 in the M2 region of the β3 subunit to a phenylalanine, which is present in the homologous position of all α subunits. The point mutated β3 was coexpressed together with the α1subunit. These receptors can open spontaneously in the absence of GABA and are blocked by picrotoxin in a dose-dependent fashion. Washout of picrotoxin results in a strong transient inward current. The amplitude of this current is dependent on the concentration of picrotoxin and the time of its application. The point mutated receptors could be activated by very low concentrations of GABA. Obviously, this mutation strongly affects gating of the channel and its interaction with picrotoxin. It is interesting to compare the newly identified position with other positions within M2 that are important for receptor function and modulation. Based on radioligand binding experiments to chimeric receptors, it has been suggested that β3L253 is important for the binding of another channel blockertert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (22Jursky F. Fuchs K. Buhr A. Tretter V. Sigel E. Sieghart W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This position is 12 amino acid residues N-terminal to the one on the β3subunit implicated in the action of loreclezole (27Wingrove P.B. Wafford K.A. Bain C.J. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4569-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It is located 6 residues C-terminal to the predicted cytoplasmic entry point into the membrane and is 6 residues N-terminal to the conserved leucine in the center of the M2 region. Point mutations of this leucine also resulted in spontaneous currents (17Tierney M.L. Birnir B. Pillai N.P. Clements J.D. Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr.

Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 875-882PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous channel activity has also been reported with expression of the rat or mouse β1 subunit alone (28Sigel E. Baur R. Malherbe P. Möhler H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Krishek B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Mol.

Sternini C. Olsen R.W. Tobin A.J. Neuron. 1989; 3: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Using the mentioned amounts of cRNA, no spontaneous currents were observed for homomeric wild type β3 and mutant β3L253F receptors. In all the mentioned cases an off-current upon picrotoxin washout was never reported. Our model presented below will predict why this is not the case. The structure of the GABAA receptor in M2 is presumably close to that of other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. The above cited studies and studies of the homologous nicotinic acetylcholine receptor suggested that the centrally conserved leucine is structurally critical for channel gating and might even be a part of the channel gate (32Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Other studies place the gate more N-terminal to the cytoplasmic end of the channel pore (13Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because α1β3L253F receptors display an altered channel gating our results support this proposal. Valine 256 on the α1 subunit has been proposed to be exposed to the channel lumen (13Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and to be in direct contact with picrotoxin (13Xu M. Covey D.F. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1858-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 14Perret P. Sarda X. Wolff M. Wu T.-T. Bushey D. Goeldner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25350-25354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A homologous residue has also been implicated in the action of the cyclodiene insecticide resistance in invertebrate GABA receptor subunit Rdl (15Ffrench-Constant R.H. Rocheleau T.A. Steichen J.C. Chalmers A.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Because of the 5-fold symmetry of the channel pore, it is likely that the homologous residue on the β3 subunit, alanine 252, is also facing the channel pore and might be close to the bound picrotoxin entity. Our results indeed show that replacement of alanine by valine in this position (β3A252V) results in an about 10-fold reduced affinity for picrotoxin. Mutation of the adjacent leucine 253 to phenylalanine even more drastically reduces the picrotoxin affinity. It cannot completely be ruled out that the substitution might have some indirect effects on the picrotoxin binding pocket. However, it is tempting to speculate that picrotoxin is in direct contact with β3L253. In apparent contrast to this speculation, Xu and Akabas (12Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) found that the homologous phenylalanine 257 on the α1 subunit after cysteine substitution is not accessible to sulfhydryl reagents. However, this residue is on the same side of the α-helix as reactive positions and is also adjacent to them. Side chains other than cysteine might be at least partially accessible to the channel lumen and could be in contact with the picrotoxin molecule. We propose a kinetic model for α1β3L253F describing its interaction with picrotoxin. It makes a number of predictions that are discussed in the following. Mutant α1β3L253F receptors assume an open and two closed states in the absence of GABA. The open state is inferred from the presence of spontaneously open channels, and the closed states are required because of the double exponential decay of the transient inward current upon picrotoxin removal. Picrotoxin is mostly bound to open channels that become nonconducting because of the bound channel blocker resulting in an apparent outward current. Reopening of channels in the presence of picrotoxin finds a simple explanation with the help of our model. The binding of picrotoxin to the open (O) and closed channel (C) is faster than the transition between the two closed states (R and C). After emptying states O and C by adding picrotoxin, the channels in the desensitized state R serve as a reservoir that slowly releases channels to the open state via state C. The equilibrium of this process is reached in about 1 min (Figs. 4 and 5). The regain of open channels is responsible for the increase of the inward current in the presence of picrotoxin. The huge transient inward current after picrotoxin washout is the result of the decreased affinity (fast transition of O.PTX to O), and it depends on both the duration of picrotoxin exposure and on its concentration (Figs. 4 and 5). Because of the almost instantaneous transition of O.PTX to O upon picrotoxin removal, the amplitude of the initial washout current is approximately proportional to the population of state O.PTX. Therefore, we can use this amplitude to estimate the overall equilibrium affinity constant to picrotoxin. It is higher than 300 μm in the present case for α1β3L253F receptors, although the local affinity constant of the reaction between O and O.PTX is 20 μm in our model. The former value should be compared with 3 μm picrotoxin that reduces GABA induced currents in α1β3 to about 50% (Fig.4 C). As mentioned above, substitution of the centrally conserved leucine in GABA receptors in some cases also resulted in the formation of spontaneously open channels. Our model shows that the large amplitude of the fast transient inward current requires a faster transition from O.PTX to O as compared with all other transition rates of the model. Increasing the time constant for this process reduces the amplitude and slows down the time course for the transient population of the open state. Both effects are observed for other GABAA receptors with substitution of the centrally conserved leucine (18Pan Z.-H. Zhang D. Zhang X. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6490-6495Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Thompson S.-A. Smith M.Z. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. Wafford K.A. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Dalziel J.E. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Birnir B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 875-882PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the model suggests that for these mutated GABAAreceptors the dissociation of picrotoxin from the blocked channel (k 2) is slowed down. The relative amplitude of this fast transient inward current is also limited by the fraction of channels that are in the open state in the absence of picrotoxin. The larger this fraction of spontaneously open channels is, the smaller the predicted inward current. Both factors may contribute to a different degree to the lack of an transient inward current in the initially cited cases of spontaneous currents. In summary, we report two important observations. The first is that we describe two point mutations in the M2 region of the β3subunit close to the putative cytoplasmic end that both result in an increase of apparent GABA affinity. One of these, β3L253F results additionally in spontaneous channel opening and is thus structurally critical for channel gating. Our results therefore strongly suggest that the region important for channel gating has to be extended at least four amino acid positions toward the N terminus as compared with previous conclusions (18Pan Z.-H. Zhang D. Zhang X. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6490-6495Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The second observation is that these point mutations result in a reduced affinity for picrotoxin. The residue α1V256 has been shown to covalently interact with other noncompetitive blockers acting at the picrotoxin binding site (14Perret P. Sarda X. Wolff M. Wu T.-T. Bushey D. Goeldner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25350-25354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutation of the homologous residue β2A252 shows a 10-fold effect. However, mutation of the neighboring residue β3L253 has drastic effects on picrotoxin affinity and may therefore together with α1V256 form part of the contact site for picrotoxin. We thank Dr. F. Jursky (Bratislava) for contributions to the construction of the chimera and R. Baur (Bern) for help especially in microinjection of Xenopus oocytes."

We have previously reported that activation of a temperature sensitive Bcr-Abl PTK in the multipotent haemopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix for short periods resulted in subtle changes including, a transient suppression of apoptosis and no inhibition of differentiation. In contrast, activation of the Bcr-Abl PTK for 12 weeks results in cells that display a delay in differentiation at the early granulocyte stage. Flow cytometric analysis also indicates that the expression of cell surface differentiation markers and nuclear morphology are uncoupled. Furthermore, a significant number of the mature neutrophils display abnormal morphological features. Prolonged exposure to Bcr-Abl PTK results in interleukin-3 independent growth and decreased p53 protein levels. FDCP-Mix cells expressing a dominant negative p53 and p53null FDCP-Mix cells demonstrate that the reduction in p53 is causally related to the delay in development. Returning the cells to the restrictive temperature restores the p53 protein levels, the growth factor dependence and largely relieves the effects on development. We conclude that prolonged Bcr-Abl PTK activity within multipotent cells results in a reduction of p53 that drives a delayed and abnormal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2153331536,"Mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase consists of two highly conserved cytoplasmic domains (C1a and C2a) separated by a less conserved connecting region, C1b, and one of two transmembrane domains, M2. The C1a and C2a domains form a catalytic core that can be stimulated by forskolin and the stimulatory G protein subunit α (Gαs). In this study, we analyzed the regulation of type 7 adenylyl cyclase (AC7) by C1b. The C1a, C1b, and C2a domains of AC7 were purified separately. Escherichia coli SlyD protein, a cis-transpeptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase), copurifies with AC7 C1b (7C1b). SlyD protein can inhibit the Gαs- and/or forskolin-activated activity of both soluble and membrane-bound AC7. Mutant forms of SlyD with reduced PPIase activity are less potent in the inhibition of AC7 activity. Interestingly, different isoforms of mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase can be either inhibited or stimulated by SlyD protein, raising the possibility that mammalian PPIase may regulate enzymatic activity of mammalian adenylyl cyclase. Purified 7C1b-SlyD complex has a greater inhibitory effect on AC7 activity than SlyD alone. This inhibition by 7C1b is abolished in a 7C1b mutant in which a conserved glutamic acid (amino acid residue 582) is changed to alanine. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by 7C1b is further confirmed by using 7C1b purified from an E. coli slyD-deficient strain. This inhibitory activity of AC7 is also observed with the 28-mer peptides derived from a region of C1b conserved in AC7 and AC2 but is not observed with a peptide derived from the corresponding region of AC6. This inhibitory activity exhibited by the C1b domain may result from the interaction of 7C1b with 7C1a and 7C2a and may serve to hold AC7 in the basal nonstimulated state. Mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase consists of two highly conserved cytoplasmic domains (C1a and C2a) separated by a less conserved connecting region, C1b, and one of two transmembrane domains, M2. The C1a and C2a domains form a catalytic core that can be stimulated by forskolin and the stimulatory G protein subunit α (Gαs). In this study, we analyzed the regulation of type 7 adenylyl cyclase (AC7) by C1b. The C1a, C1b, and C2a domains of AC7 were purified separately. Escherichia coli SlyD protein, a cis-transpeptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase), copurifies with AC7 C1b (7C1b). SlyD protein can inhibit the Gαs- and/or forskolin-activated activity of both soluble and membrane-bound AC7. Mutant forms of SlyD with reduced PPIase activity are less potent in the inhibition of AC7 activity. Interestingly, different isoforms of mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase can be either inhibited or stimulated by SlyD protein, raising the possibility that mammalian PPIase may regulate enzymatic activity of mammalian adenylyl cyclase. Purified 7C1b-SlyD complex has a greater inhibitory effect on AC7 activity than SlyD alone. This inhibition by 7C1b is abolished in a 7C1b mutant in which a conserved glutamic acid (amino acid residue 582) is changed to alanine. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by 7C1b is further confirmed by using 7C1b purified from an E. coli slyD-deficient strain. This inhibitory activity of AC7 is also observed with the 28-mer peptides derived from a region of C1b conserved in AC7 and AC2 but is not observed with a peptide derived from the corresponding region of AC6. This inhibitory activity exhibited by the C1b domain may result from the interaction of 7C1b with 7C1a and 7C2a and may serve to hold AC7 in the basal nonstimulated state. subunit α of the G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase adenylyl cyclase cis-transpeptidylprolyl isomerase sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Changes in intracellular cAMP concentration regulate a variety of physiological responses, such as sugar and lipid metabolism, olfaction, and cell growth and differentiation. Cyclic AMP directly activates diverse molecules including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cyclic nucleotide-gated Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/K+ channels, and cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchangers of Rap-1 (1de Rooij J.

To date, there are nine isoforms of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase and one soluble adenylyl cyclase found in mammals (4Tang W.-J. Hurley J.H. Mol.

All nine isoforms of mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases share a common structure including two ∼40-kDa cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2), each following an ∼20-kDa hydrophobic domain (M1 and M2) (see Fig. 1) (4Tang W.-J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). When expressed separately and then mixed in vitro, the conserved portions of the C1 and C2 domains, C1a and C2a, form a soluble enzyme that exhibits most of the regulatory properties of the membrane-bound enzyme (7–22). This soluble enzyme can be activated by subunit α of G protein (Gαs)1 and by the diterpene, forskolin, and can be inhibited by subunit α of Gi and by adenosine analogs termed P-site inhibitors. Such soluble enzyme models have yielded high resolution structures of the C2a homodimer of AC2 (2C2a) and the 5C1a/2C2a heterodimer (23Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H.

These structures suggest a catalytic mechanism and basic mode of regulation. The catalytic site of adenylyl cyclase is formed in one of two small pockets at the interface of C1a and C2a. Forskolin binds the other pocket to shift the alignment of C1a and C2a. The activation of extracellular signals, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, triggers the exchange of guanine nucleotide in Gαs, resulting in conformational changes in the switch regions of Gαs. The switch 2 region of Gαs interacts with both C2a (α2 and α3/β4 regions) and C1a (N-terminal loop of β1) to promote the proper alignment between C1a and C2a (9Yan S.Z. Huang Z.H. Rao V.D.

Amino acid residues from both C1a and C2a domains contribute to the “two-metal”- mediated catalysis, a catalytic mechanism also used in many DNA polymerases and nucleotidyltransferases (25Aravind L.

The C1b region links C1a to the M2 region of mammalian adenylyl cyclase and is far less conserved than the C1a and C2a regions among the nine isoforms of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase (Fig.1). Although C1b is not required for catalysis, it is essential in several regulatory functions, such as calmodulin activation of AC1 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase modulation of AC6 (27Vorherr T.

In this paper, we use the soluble adenylyl cyclase from the C1a and C2a domains of AC7 and its membrane-bound counterpart to address the regulatory role of AC7 C1b. Forskolin was from Calbiochem. Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus and [α-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Quick-Change kit for site-directed mutagenesis was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Big-dye kit for automatic DNA sequencing was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Reagents for yeast two-hybrid analysis were fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The coding sequence for AC7 C1b was amplified by 18 cycles of polymerase chain reaction using the human AC7 as the template, Vent DNA polymerase, and primers 5′-GGTCGAATTCCCCGGAGCCAGCAGCCACCCCCGCCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCAAAGCTTCTAGTGGCGGGCCCGGGGGATGGGTGCCAG-3′ (7C1b from amino acids 483 to 596). The resulting DNAs were digested withEcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pProEx-HAH6, which was digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pProEx-HAH6-7C1b. Plasmid used to express 7C1b(E582A) was constructed by Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis using pProEx-HAH6-7C1b as the template. Mutagenic oligonucleotides contained 25–30 complementary nucleotides flanking each side of the codon(s) targeted for mutation. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The yeast two-hybrid vectors, pLexA-W1 and pB42AD-W1, were constructed by Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis using pLexA and pB42AD as the templates (CLONTECH) so that the coding of the DNA binding domain of LexA and activating domain of B42 can fuse in-frame with the multiple cloning site of the pProEx-HAH6 vector. To construct pLexA-W1-7C1a and pLexA-W1-7C2a, the HindIII-bluntedEcoRI fragments of 7C1a and 7C2a coding sequences were excised from pProEx-HAH6-7C1a and pProEx-HAH6-7C2a and ligated into pLexA-W1, which was digested with EcoRI andPvuII. A similar strategy was used for constructing pB42AD-W1-7C1b except that the filled in XhoI site of pB42AD-W1 was used. To express 7C1b and 7C1b mutants, pProEx-HAH6-7C1b and pProEx-HAH6-7C1b(E582A) were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), and the cells were grown in T7 medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. When A 600 reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 30 μm final concentration. After 4 h, the induced cells were collected and lysed. The recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-NTA and Q-Sepharose columns similar to the purification of 1C1a and 2C2a as described (7Yan S.Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.H. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). E. coli SlyD was copurified with 7C1b. 7C1b-SlyD and 7C1b(E582A)-SlyD complexes were further purified using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex 200 column and identified based on molecular weight and immunoblot. The concentration of proteins was determined using the Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). To obtain 7C1b free of SlyD, pProEx-HAH6-7C1b was transformed into E. coli RY-3041, a BL21(DE3) slyD − strain, and grown toA 600 = 0.45. For induction, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 30 μm, and the incubation temperature was lowered to 22 °C. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5m NaCl, 0.025% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, followed by a 4-min sonication (1 s on, 3 s off) and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Lysate was loaded on a Ni-NTA affinity column (10 ml of resin) pre-equilibrated to the same buffer as used for lysis (without lysozyme). The column was washed with 100 ml of low imidazole (same buffer with 15 mmimidazole) and then eluted with a 15–200 mm imidazole gradient (3-min fractions and 2 ml/min flow rate). 7C1b was detected by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing relatively pure 7C1b were concentrated to 1 ml by Amicon positive pressure filtration with Millipore filter YM10 membrane. A combination of membrane dialysis (Spectra/Por 16 mm, molecular weight cut off 10,000) and Amicon filtration were used to bring NaCl and imidazole concentrations to less than 2 and 0.2 mm, respectively. To express SlyD and its mutant proteins, the plasmids for the expression of wild type SlyD and SlyD mutants (L11R and Δ107–111) in plasmid pJF118EF were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) wild type andslyD −(MCX) strains, respectively. The resulting cells were grown in modified T7 media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C to an A 600 = 0.4. Protein expression was then induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 19 h after infection, 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The cells were then spun down, and the cell pellet was frozen at −80 °C. SlyD and its mutant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA and Q-Sepharose column in the manner similar to that of 7C1b. The yields of SlyD and its mutant proteins were about 10–20 mg with greater than 95% purity from each liter of E. coliculture. Adenylyl cyclase assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ATP at 30 °C for 20 min as described previously (7Yan S.Z. Hahn D. Huang Z.H. Tang W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10941-10945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To express wild type and mutated forms of Gαs, pQE60 that carried wild type or mutant forms of Gαs were transformed to BL21(DE3) that carried pUBS520, and the induction and purification of recombinant Gαs were performed as described previously (33Yan, S.-Z., and Tang, W.-J. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). Recombinant Gαs was activated by 50 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. Expression of soluble and membrane-bound AC7 and purification of 7C1a and 7C2a were performed as described (34Yan, S.-Z., and Tang, W.-J. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity of Sf9 cell membranes was completed as described previously (35Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer. Identity of the peptides was verified by mass spectrometry. Peptides were dissolved in water and used at final concentration as indicated. Yeast EGY48 strain that carried pSH18-34 was transformed with pLexA-W1-7C1a or pLexA-W1-7C2a. The resulting transformants were then transformed with pB42AD-W1-7C1b. The yeast clones that carried all three plasmids were grown in synthetic defined media lacking uridine, histidine, and tryptophan and containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose at 30 °C until the cells reached a density of A 600 = 1. β-Galactosidase assay was performed with 1 ml of cells as described previously (36Ausubel F.M. Brant R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley $ Sons, Inc., New York1992: 13.6.1-13.6.4Google Scholar). We made C1a (amino acids 263–476) and C2a (amino acids 864–1080) from human AC7 that effectively could be expressed and purified (Fig.2 A) (34Yan, S.-Z., and Tang, W.-J. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). To compare soluble adenylyl cyclase with its native enzyme, a recombinant baculovirus was constructed to express membrane-bound AC7 (34Yan, S.-Z., and Tang, W.-J. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar). Both membrane-bound AC7 and soluble 7C1a-7C2a complex were substantially stimulated by Gαs and forskolin, consistent with the observation that a coexpressed Gs-coupled receptor could raise cAMP formation over 20-fold in mammalian cells overexpressing AC7 (34Yan, S.-Z., and Tang, W.-J. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar, 37Yoshimura M. Ikeda H. Tabakoff B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Significant synergy was observed in both membrane-bound AC7 and soluble 7C1a-7C2a complex when Gαs and forskolin were coapplied (Fig. 3).Figure 3Comparison of soluble 7C1a-7C2a and membrane-bound AC7 activated by Gαsand forskolin. Adenylyl cyclase activities of soluble 7C1a-7C2a (A) and membrane-bound AC7 (mAC7) (B) are shown. Adenylyl cyclase activity of 7C1a-7C2a (0.4 μmeach) and membrane-bound AC7 (80 μg) were activated by Gαs and forskolin. The concentration of Gαsin the assay is 240 nm.

We constructed a vector to express a polypeptide chain from amino acids 457 to 596 of human AC7 named 7C1b. Adding lysates ofE. coli containing 7C1b, we observed 30% inhibition in Gαs and forskolin-stimulated 7C1a-7C2a activity (data not shown). However, no detectable 7C1b protein was found by immunoblot, suggesting that 7C1b may undergo proteolysis at its N terminus. To test this hypothesis, we constructed and expressed four N-terminal truncation mutants of 7C1b. Lysates of E. coli containing one of four mutants, 7C1b-Δ2 (amino acids 483–596 of human AC7), exhibited 30% inhibition in 7C1a-7C2a activity stimulated by Gαs and forskolin and had the highest immunoreactivity. Thus, 7C1b-Δ2 was used in the subsequent study and renamed as 7C1b. C1b contains a short stretch of sequence that is relatively conserved among nine isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 1). We made 7C1b mutants with single point mutations in this region and screened for one that expressed similar to wild type 7C1b but lost its ability to inhibit 7C1a-7C2a activity. Upon assaying E. coli lysates containing 7C1b mutants, we found that 7C1b(E582A), a mutant with a conserved glutamic acid at residue 582 that changed to alanine, fit these criteria (Fig. 1, data not shown). We characterized both wild type 7C1b and 7C1b(E582A) in our subsequent study. 7C1b and 7C1b(E582A) proteins were purified through three chromatographic steps. After purification through Ni-NTA, Q-Sepharose, and Superdex 200 columns, the expected 16-kDa 7C1b and 7C1b(E584A) were obtained with the yield of 2.2 mg from 1 liter of E. coliculture (Fig. 2 B). A 25-kDa protein was copurified with 7C1b at about 4-fold molar excess after purification through the Ni-NTA column. A stoichiometric quantity of 25 kDa and 7C1b was obtained after purification through the Q-Sepharose and Superdex 200 gel permeation columns. Based on the gel permeation column, the molecular size of 7C1b is approximately 40 kDa, which is not a high molecular mass aggregate. This suggests that 7C1b forms a complex with the 25-kDa protein in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. The N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the 25-kDa protein resulted inXXVAXDLLVVLAYQ that matched the N-terminal sequence of SlyD. SlyD, a 25-kDa protein with a histidine-rich C-terminal region, can bind the Ni-NTA column effectively (38Roof W.D. Fang H.Q. Young K.D. Sun J. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1031-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Pluckthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The predicted pI of SlyD and 7C1b are 4.8 and 8.5, respectively, which may lead to the charge-charge interaction of these two proteins. In the subsequent study, we refer to our purified 7C1b and 7C1b(E582A) preparations as 7C1b-SlyD or 7C1b(E582A)- SlyD. SlyD protein, one of several gene products originally identified assuppressor of phage lysis, is a member of the FK506-binding protein family and exhibitscis-trans peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity (38Roof W.D. Fang H.Q. Young K.D. Sun J. Young R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1031-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Pluckthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We tested whether SlyD protein could affect the activity of the 7C1a-7C2a complex using purified SlyD protein (Figs.2 C and 4). In the presence of Gαs, forskolin, or the combination of Gαsand forskolin, we observed up to 80% inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by SlyD in a dose-dependent manner. To address whether PPIase activity is required for this inhibition, we purified and tested two SlyD mutant proteins, SlyD(L11R), which has no detectable PPIase activity, and SlyD(Δ107–111), which has only 20% PPIase activity (Fig. 2 C) (47Hottenrott S. SlyD aus E. coli. Ph. D. thesis. Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany1999Google Scholar). SlyD(L11R) showed no inhibition to 7C1a-7C2a, and SlyD(Δ107–111) had reduced potency, suggesting that PPIase activity plays a role in SlyD inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 4). We then tested whether SlyD could modulate the activity of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases. Using the membrane preparations from Sf9 cells that expressed individual isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, we observed that SlyD protein could inhibit the activity of both AC2 and AC7 while having little effect on the activity of AC1. Interestingly, SlyD could increase the activity of AC5 and AC6 (Fig.5 A). These effects could not be observed with the PPIase-defective mutant, SlyD(L11R) (Fig.5 B). Thus, we conclude that the effect mediated by SlyD is both isoform-specific and involves PPIase activity. To address the role of 7C1b in regulating AC7, we used 7C1b-SlyD and 7C1b(E582A)-SlyD. As a control, we used an equal quantity of purified SlyD compared with that in our 7C1b-SlyD preparations and based on protein concentration and SDS-PAGE. In the concentration range of 0.1–0.6 μm Gαs, 7C1b-SlyD exhibited 40–50% more inhibition than SlyD alone (Fig.6 A). The inhibition is dose-dependent (Fig. 6 B). Such inhibition in excess of the SlyD control was not observed with 7C1b(E582A)-SlyD (Fig.6). At a high concentration of Gαs (2.2 μm) or in the presence of both Gαs and forskolin, no C1b-mediated inhibition of 7C1a-7C2a was observed (Fig. 6 A, data not shown). When the activity of membrane-bound AC7 was analyzed, we observed no additional effect of 7C1b-SlyD that was not accountable by SlyD protein (data not shown). To demonstrate 7C1b inhibition in the absence of SlyD, we expressed and purified 7C1b in RY3041, an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain that is defective in the expression of SlyD. Expression of 7C1b in theslyD − strain was comparable with the expression in the BL21(DE3) strain based on the immunoblot of the lysate. Following the Ni-NTA column, we obtained 7C1b protein as seen on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblot. However, the purified 7C1b could no longer be detected after only a few hours in the cold room, making further purification steps impossible. After testing a panel of stabilizing agents, we determined that 0.025% Triton X-100 in combination with 0.5 m NaCl stabilized the protein sufficiently to conduct further concentration and buffer exchange steps. We further determined that the salt concentration could be reduced to < 2 mm if the protein was frozen in dry ice quickly after salt removal and stored at −80 °C. This finding allowed us to obtain 7C1b that is ∼50% pure but free of SlyD (Fig.7 A). The partially purified 7C1b inhibited the activity of 7C1a-7C2a (Fig.7 B). As a control for the detergent in the buffer, we boiled our 7C1b preparation (100 °C for 3 min), which abolished the inhibition (data not shown). This further supports an inhibitory role for 7C1b. To address the role of 7C1b further, we made 28-mer peptides derived from the most conserved region of C1b across three adenylyl cyclases (Fig. 1). FGSI and ISLL peptides (named by their first four amino acid sequences) were derived from two closely related adenylyl cyclases AC7 and AC2, respectively. FGSI peptide inhibited the adenylyl cyclase activity of 7C1a-7C2a activated by forskolin and/or Gαs (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, the addition of FGSI and ISLL resulted in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity of soluble and membrane-bound AC7 in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 8 B and9 A). FLLT peptide was derived from the region corresponding to FGSI in a distantly related isoform, AC6, and had little effect on the enzymatic activity of soluble and membrane-bound AC7 (Figs. 8 B and 9 A). FLLT is active because it inhibited the activity of membrane-bound AC6 as described previously (Fig. 9 B) (29Chen Y. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FGSI but not ISLL was a potent inhibitor of membrane-bound AC6 (Fig.9 B). Taken together, these data indicate that C1b is capable of inhibiting the activity of adenylyl cyclase, and peptides from a particular region of C1b may confirm isoform specificity.Figure 9Effects of ISLL, FGSI, and FLLT peptides derived from the C1b region of AC7, AC2, and AC6 on adenylyl cyclase activity of membrane-bound AC7 (mAC7) and membrane-bound AC6 (mAC6). The adenylyl cyclase activity of mAC7 (A) and mAC6 (B) (80 μg each) activated by 100 μm forskolin and 0.24 μmGαs was performed in the indicated peptide concentration. The specific activities of mAC7 and mAC6 were 17 and 8 nmol·min−1·mg−1, respectively. The means ± S.E. are representative of at least three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To initially assess interaction of 7C1b to 7C1a and/or 7C2a, we used the yeast two-hybrid system where transactivation of the lacZ reporter indicates potential interaction (40Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). We observed light blue colonies on medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) for yeast strain EGY48(pSH18-34) that contained 7C1a or 7C2a fused to the DNA binding domain of LexA (LexA-DB-7C1a or LexA-DB-7C2a, respectively) (data not shown). When the 7C1b-B42AD fusion was coexpressed in yeast strains containing LexA-DB-7C1a or LexA-DB-7C2a, a >2-fold increase was observed in the β-galactosidase activity (standard β-galactosidase unit multiplied by 1000: 7C1a with control plasmid = 36 ± 1 while 7C1a with 7C1b = 84.6 ± 0.4 and 7C2a with control = 40 ± 2 while 7C2a + 7C1b = 85.8 ± 0.5). This finding suggests that 7C1b can interact with both 7C1a and 7C2a. The catalytic core of mammalian adenylyl cyclase consists of two cytoplasmic domains, C1a and C2a (22Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The catalytic site is located at the interface of C1a and C2a and includes residues from both domains (24Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 26Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The activation of adenylyl cyclase does not seem to involve a major conformational change in either C1a or C2a upon the binding of Gαs. Instead, catalysis is activated by an induced juxtaposition of these two domains to properly form the catalytic cleft at their interface. Interestingly, the structure of 2C2 homodimer and 5C1a/2C2a heterodimer reveals significant contact between C1a and C2a (23Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 26Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because C1a and C2a are tethered by the transmembrane domains (M1 and M2) in their native membrane-bound configuration, the question arises of how C1a and C2a are kept in an inactive conformation in the resting state of the enzyme. The C1b region joins C1a to C2a by connecting C1a to the second transmembrane domain (M2), which then connects to C2a (Fig. 1). Thus, C1b is in an ideal location to dynamically regulate the interaction between C1a and C2a and thus modulate the catalytic rate. Using both C1b protein and peptides derived from C1b, our data show that AC7 C1b can inhibit AC7. We also observed that both C1b and peptides derived from C1b inhibit soluble 7C1a-7C2a more potently than they inhibit membrane-bound AC7. Such a difference is probably due to the presence of endogenous C1b in the membrane-bound AC7. How does C1b inhibit the activity of AC7? Our yeast two-hybrid analysis suggests that AC7 C1b can bind 7C1a and 7C2a. Using 7C1b-SlyD, our coimmunoprecipitation experiment shows that 7C1b can bind both 7C1a and 7C2a, which is in agreement with our yeast two-hybrid analysis. 2S.-Z. Yan, J. Beeler, and W.-J. Tang, unpublished observation. Using antibody that can immunoprecipitate 7C2a, the active 7C1a-7C2a-Gαscomplex can be coimmunoprecipitated.2 Interestingly, 7C1b-SlyD can compete with Gαs to bind the 7C1a-7C2a complex, suggesting that one possible mechanism for 7C1b-mediated inhibition is blocking the binding of Gαs to 7C1a-7C2a complex.2 However, the presence of SlyD in our 7C1b preparation precludes drawing any definitive conclusion. It would be interesting to determine whether 7C1b directly interacts with 7C1a and 7C2a and whether the interaction of 7C1b to 7C1a and 7C2a is involved in 7C1b-mediated inhibition. It is worth noting that Scholich et al. (20Scholich K. Wittpoth C. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9602-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that AC5 C1b can interact with 5C2a by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Unfortunately, they did not test the interaction of AC5 C1b with its C1a domain. C1b is one of the key regions for isoform-specific regulation. An amphipathic region that is only present in AC1 C1b is involved in the binding and activation of Ca2+/calmodulin (27Vorherr T. Knopfel L. Hofmann F. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Splicing variants of AC8 that have different C1b sequences are differentially sensitive to calmodulin (41Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AC6 C1b has a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site that confers feedback inhibition by cAMP (29Chen Y. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The C1b region may also be involved in inhibition by calcium and Gαi in AC5 and regulation by calcineurin in AC9 (17Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We show here that peptides from the C1b region of different isoforms of adenylyl cyclase can inhibit the activity of a subset of adenylyl cyclase isoforms. This isoform-specific inhibition by peptides may provide a tool with which to address the physiological functions of each isoform of adenylyl cyclase in the intact cells (43Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We were surprised to find that the catalytic activity of certain isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase can be stimulated or inhibited by SlyD. Using mutant forms of SlyD, we find that this isoform-specific regulation may be due to PPIase activity of SlyD. This raises the possibility that mammalian PPIases may regulate the activity of selective isoforms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase directly. There are three gene families of eukaryotic PPIases: FK506-binding protein, cyclophilins, and parvulins (44Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PPIase is known as a folding helper enzyme; however, growing evidence suggests that PPIases may serve to regulate biological activity after the proper folding of proteins (31Lee J.P. Palfrey H.C. Bindokas V.P. Ghadge G.D. Ma L. Miller R.J. Roos R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3251-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,45Schiene C. Fischer G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Thus, an understanding of how SlyD regulates mammalian adenylyl cyclases may not only provide a novel molecular tool for modulating adenylyl cyclase activity in an isoform-specific manner but may also lead to a new area of research in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by PPIases. We are grateful for the help in oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing from P. Gardner (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago), protein sequencing from Andrew Bohm (Boston Biomedical Research Institute), plasmids for the expression of SlyD and its mutants from Bill Roof (Texas A&M University), and insightful suggestions from R. Iyengar (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and Ryland F. Young (Texas A&M University)."
https://openalex.org/W1975735163,"MRG1 (melanocyte-specific gene 1 (MSG1)-related gene), a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that interacts with p300/CBP, TATA-binding protein and Lhx2, is the founding member of a new family of transcription factors. Initial characterization of this newly discovered transcription factor has underscored its potential involvement in many important cellular processes through transcriptional modulation. We previously demonstrated that MRG1 can be induced by various biological stimuli (Sun, H. B., Zhu, Y. X., Yin, T., Sledge, G., and Yang, Y. C. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 13555–13560). As a first step in understanding its role in different biological processes, we investigated mechanisms that regulate transcription of the mouse MRG1 gene in fibroblasts. Transient transfection of Rat1 fibroblast cells with sequential 5′-deletions of mouse MRG1 promoter-luciferase fusion constructs indicated that the −104 to +121 region contains the full promoter activity. Deletion and site-directed mutations within this region revealed that the Ets-1 site at −97 to −94 and the Sp1 site at −51 to −46 are critical for MRG1 expression in fibroblasts. Gel mobility shift and supershift assays performed with Rat1 nuclear extracts identified nucleoprotein complexes binding to the Ets-1 site and the Sp1 site. In Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack the Sp and Ets family of transcription factors, expression of Sp1, Sp3, and Ets-1 or Elf-1 functionally stimulated MRG1 promoter activity in a synergistic manner. These results suggest that multiple transcription factors acting in synergy are responsible for MRG1 expression and the responsiveness of cells to different biological stimuli.

Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Goldman P.S. Tran V.K. Goodman R.H. Recent Prog. Horm.

MRG1 also interacts with a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, Lhx2, to enhance Lhx2-dependent transcription possibly through recruitment of p300/CBP and TATA-binding proteins (8Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The interaction of MRG1 with Lhx2 is dependent on the N-terminal region of MRG1, a region not conserved in MSG1. MSG1 interacts with Smad4 and enhances Smad-mediated transcription in a p300/CBP-dependent manner (4Yahata T. Caestecker M.P. Lechleider R.J. Andriole S. Roberts A.B. Isselbacher K.J. Shioda T.J. J.

The Smad interaction domain resides in the N terminus of MSG1 and thus is unique to MSG1. Based upon these findings, it has been speculated that MRG1 family proteins bind p300/CBP through their conserved C-terminal regions (the CR2 region) while interacting with DNA-binding proteins through the unique N-terminal regions, thus regulating the p300/CBP-dependent transcriptional activation of different target genes (4Yahata T. Caestecker M.P. Lechleider R.J. Andriole S. Roberts A.B. Isselbacher K.J. Shioda T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8825-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Besides their structural differences, MRG1 and MSG1 show a distinct pattern of expression that may also determine their functional specificity (1Shioda T. Fenner M.H. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12298-12303Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Dunwoodie S.L. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S.P. Mech.

A. 1998; 95: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). MSG1 transcripts are predominantly expressed in cultured human and mouse epidermal melanocytes, whereas MRG1 transcripts are detected in all of the human and mouse cell lines and adult tissues examined (1Shioda T. Fenner M.H. Isselbacher K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12298-12303Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Dunwoodie S.L. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S.P. Mech.

A. 1998; 95: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similarly, MRG1 and MSG1 expression profiles during early development are distinct from each other (2Dunwoodie S.L. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S.P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). MSG1 is predominantly expressed in a subset of mesoderm derivatives, whereas MRG1 transcripts are restricted to anterior visceral endoderm prior to gastrulation. Interestingly, MRG1 is expressed during heart development and its expression can be detected throughout embryogenesis from 8.5 days post-conception, which is consistent with the ubiquitous expression of this gene in adult tissues. These results suggested that MRG1 and MSG1 might play different roles during mouse embryogenesis. MRG1 was cloned in our laboratory as part of an effort to isolate cytokine-inducible genes. Overexpression in Rat1 cells results in loss of cell contact inhibition, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice, suggesting that MRG1 is a transforming gene (10Sun H.B. Zhu Y.X. Yin T. Sledge G. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Bhattacharya et al. demonstrated that MRG1 is up-regulated by hypoxia and deferoxamine (3Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and represses HIF-1α-mediated transactivation through competitive interaction with the CH1 domain of p300/CBP. Elevated expression of MRG1 in hypoxic cells has been postulated to negatively regulate the cellular response to hypoxia, which is cytokine-regulated. The promoter region of human MRG1 has been reported but not analyzed in detail (11Leung M.-K. Jones T. Michels C.L. Livingston D.M. Bhattacharya S. Genomics. 1999; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the transcription factors that regulate it have not been identified. We have now isolated the mouse MRG1 genomic sequence and analyzed the promoter activity by deletion mapping and transient expression in cells. The basal mouse MRG1 promoter maps to region to −104 to +121, which is highly conserved in the human and mouse genes. Deletion analysis in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis shows that an Ets-1 site at −97 to −94 and an Sp1 site at −51 to −46 are critical for MRG1 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) show that Sp1 and Sp3 bind the Sp1 element, whereas transcription factors binding to the Ets-1 element are yet to be identified. Cotransfection in insect cells that lack Sp and Ets factors demonstrates that Sp1, Sp3, Ets-1, or Elf-1 are important for MRG1 gene expression and therefore for the responses of cells to different biological stimuli. NIH3T3, Rat1, and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Schneider's Drosophila cell line 2 (SL2) was maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at room temperature with atmospheric CO2. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Antibodies to nuclear proteins Sp1, Sp3, and STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A 129/SvJ mouse liver genomic library in Lambda FIXII (Stratagene) was screened using the 2.1-kb MRG1 cDNA as the probe. The probe was random-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It kit (Stratagene). A 5-kbHindIII fragment from one of the positive clones was subcloned into the HindIII site of a cloning vector, pUC19, resulting in plasmid pUCHi. Sequence analysis showed that the fragment contains a 2.7-kb 5′-flanking region, the first and the second exons, the introns, and most of the third exon. To identify putativecis-regulatory elements, 1 kb of the mouse MRG1 gene 5′-flanking region was analyzed with the Mat Inspector program (12Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). The transcription start site was predicted by the neural network promoter prediction (NNPP) program (13Reese M.G. Harris N.L. Eckman F.H. Large Scale Sequencing Specific Neural Networks for Promoter and Splice Site Recognition.Biocomputing: Proc..in: Lawrence Hunter Terri E.Klein 1996 Pacific Symposium. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore01-1996: 2-7Google Scholar). The −1036 to +121 region relative to the transcription start site was PCR-amplified using primers: P-1036, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCCAACCCGTCAGGCAAGA; and P+121, 5′-GGGGTACCCGAGGTTGGCGCCGAGGTCTT. The PCR product was digested withHindIII and KpnI and inserted in a promoterless luciferase reporter vector pXP2 (14Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pXP-1036/+121. To construct pXP-2700/+121, a 2.5 kbHindIII/BamHI fragment digested from genomic subclone pUCHi and 0.21kb BamHI/KpnI fragment from −1036/+121 PCR product was ligated and inserted betweenHindIII and KpnI site of pXP2. pXP-762/+121, pXP-338/+121, pXP-92/+121 were generated by means of restriction enzyme digestion. PXP-200/+121, pXP-104/+121, pXP-72/+121, pXP-56/+121, and pXP-44/+121 were generated by PCR using P+121 as 3′-end primer and the following 5′-end primers: P-200, 5′-CCAAGCTTCGGTCCGGAGACCTGCT; P-104, 5′-CCAAGCTTGCTGATGTTCCGGGATC; P-72, 5′-TTAAGCTTGCCGCCGGGGAGGC; P-56, 5′-TTAAGCTTCGCTCCGCCCTTCC; P-44, 5′-CCAGCTTCCTGAGATCCTTATAT, respectively. Constructs generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. pXP-56mSp1 and pXP-104mEts were generated by PCR using P+121 as 3′-end primer and the following primers as 5′-end primers: P-56mSp1, 5′-TTAAGCTTCGCTTTGCCCTTCC; P-104mEts, 5′-CTAAGCTTGCTGATTAAGGGATCCGTGT. Specific mutation for the Sp1 site in the −104/+121 region was generated by PCR. Briefly, two simultaneous PCR reactions, using pXP-2700/+121 as template were performed. The first one used primer P-104 or P-104mEts as a 5′-end primer and PmSp1B (5′-GATCTCAGGAAGGGCAAAGCGACAGCCTCC) as a 3′-end primer; the second one used PmSp1A (5′-GGGAGGCTGTCGCTTTGCCCTTCCTGAGAT) as a 5′-end primer and P+121 as a 3′-end primer. Amplified fragments from each PCR reaction were purified, mixed, and subjected to a second round of PCR using two external primers (P-104 or P-104mEts with P+121). The amplified PCR product was inserted into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and verified by sequencing. The MRG1 promoter fragment was released by digestion withHindIII and KpnI and inserted into theHindIII and KpnI sites of pXP2. One day prior to transfection, NIH3T3 or Rat1 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.25 μg of pCMVβ (CLONTECH) using Superfect Transfection Reagents (Qiagen). 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined with Luciferase assay systems (Promega). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). For transfection of HepG2 cells, cells were plated onto 24-well plates at 4.0 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.6 μg of the reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pCMVβ using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). The medium was changed 24 h after transfection. After another 24 h, cell extracts were prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described above. For transfection of SL2 cells, 1 day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 6-well plates at 2.0 ×106 cells/well and transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (16Dennig J.

Variable amounts of the expression plasmids were adjusted with the control plasmid pPacO. The medium was changed 24 h after addition of DNA, and the cells were harvested for luciferase assays 48 h after transfection. Luciferase values were normalized against total protein concentrations determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts from Rat1 cells were prepared as described (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9119) Google Scholar). Synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 0.2 ng of the labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm) was added to 10 μg of nuclear extracts in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA·protein complexes were separated from the free probe by electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography in the presence of intensifying screens (DuPont) at −80 °C. For supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody was incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 1 h in binding buffer, followed by an additional incubation for 30 min at room temperature with labeled oligonucleotides. For competition analysis, unlabeled DNA was incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 20 min before the addition of the labeled probe. The oligonucleotides used as EMSA probes were annealed prior to labeling. The sequences of the upper strands of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: MRG1 Sp1 (−56/−42), 5′-TTAAGCTTCGCTCCGCCCTTCC; MRG1 Ets-1 (−101/− 85), 5′-GATGTTCCGGGATCCGT. The following oligonucleotides were used for competition analysis: mutated MRG1 Sp1 (−56/−42), 5′-TTAAGCTTCGCTTTGCCCTTCC; mutated MRG 1 Ets-1 (−101/−85), 5′-GATGTTAAGGGATCC; consensus ETS/PEA3 oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGAACTTCCTGCTCGAGATC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); MRG1 −56/−34, 5′-TCGTCCCGCCTTCCTGAGATCC; and SIE (sis-interacting element), 5′-GTCGACATTTCCGTAA ATCTTGT (20Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the ubiquitous expression of MRG1, we analyzed its promoter activity. A 5-kbHindIII fragment from a mouse MRG1 genomic clone, which contains 2.7 kb upstream sequence from the transcription start site and all of the coding regions, was subcloned into the pUC19 vector. Similar to the human MRG1 gene (11Leung M.-K. Jones T. Michels C.L. Livingston D.M. Bhattacharya S. Genomics. 1999; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the mouse gene consists of three exons, separated by two small introns (data not shown). The transcription start site was predicted according to the neural network promoter prediction (NNPP) program (13Reese M.G. Harris N.L. Eckman F.H. Large Scale Sequencing Specific Neural Networks for Promoter and Splice Site Recognition.Biocomputing: Proc..in: Lawrence Hunter Terri E.Klein 1996 Pacific Symposium. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore01-1996: 2-7Google Scholar). Potential regulatory elements have been identified through the Mat Inspector program (12Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). These include C/EBP sites at −998 and −758; Sp1 sites at −748, −698, −648, −348, −178, and −51; AP4 site at 718; AP2 site at −218; Ets binding sites at −278, −97, and −44; MZF-1 site at −65; and an E-box at −148 (Fig. 1 A) (the corresponding GenBank™ accession number for mouse MRG1 gene is AF295547). Extensive identity exists between mouse and human proximal promoter regions (Fig. 1 B), introns and exons (data not shown), indicating that the MRG1 gene is well conserved during evolution. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there is an overall 80% identity between mouse and human MRG1 genes in the proximal promoter region between −190 and +121. Sequences further upstream are more diverse, suggesting −190 to +121 may play an important role in MRG1 expression. To assess the promoter activity of the MRG1 5′-flanking region, deletion mutants were generated using the firefly luciferase reporter vector, pXP2 (14Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). Each resulting recombinant plasmid DNA was then transiently transfected into Rat1 fibroblasts with pCMVβ to monitor transfection efficiency. Among the constructs tested, pXP-104/+121 still had the full promoter activity, whereas pXP-44/+121 lost most of the promoter activity (Fig.2 A), indicating that the region between −104 and −44 contains critical elements for MRG1 expression. This region contains an Sp1 site (CCGCCC) at −51, an Ets-1 site (TTCC) at −97, and an MZF-1 site (GGGA) at −65. Rat1 cells were chosen, because we previously utilized this cell line to demonstrate that MRG1 expression can be induced by serum, insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor (10Sun H.B. Zhu Y.X. Yin T. Sledge G. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The same experiments were also performed in NIH3T3, and HepG2 cells, and the results were similar, consistent with the ubiquitous expression of MRG1 in different cell types (data not shown). We then constructed more detailed deletions within this region (Fig.2 B). As compared with pXP-104/+121, construct pXP-92/+121 with only 12-bp sequence deleted at the 5′-region had a significantly lower promoter activity. This 12-bp region contains an Ets-1 binding site. pXP-56/+121 still had about 26% promoter activity of pXP-104/+121. However, further deletion of 12 base pairs from −56/+121 (pXP-44/+121), which contains the Sp1 binding site, greatly reduced the promoter activity. Similarly, mutations of the Sp1 site in pXP-56/+121 from CCGCCC to TTGCCC decreased the promoter activity to the level of pXP-44/+121 (Fig. 2 B). It should also be noted that deletion of the region between −92 and −57 also resulted in a significant decrease in the promoter activity. This region contains an MZF-1 binding site (GGGA sequence at −66 to −62). These results demonstrated that the Ets-1 site, Sp1 site, and the region between −92 and −56 are important for the mouse MRG1 promoter activity. To further define the specific elements in the proximal −104 region that contribute to the proximal promoter activity, we generated a series of MRG1 promoter constructs with mutations in Ets-1 and Sp1 elements from pXP-104/+121. Ets-1 motif TTCC was mutated to TTAA, whereas Sp1 motif CCGCCC was mutated to TTGCCC. Upon transfection into Rat1 cells, constructs containing a specific mutation of Sp1 or Ets-1 element resulted in about 90 and 50% decreases in the promoter activity, respectively (Fig.3). The results were similar in the NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line. In HepG2, disruption of the Sp1 site decreased 75% of the promoter activity. In all cases, mutations of both sites resulted in a 90–98% loss of the proximal promoter activity (Fig. 3), demonstrating that both Ets-1 and Sp1 elements are important for the MRG1 proximal promoter activity. To determine the biochemical composition of protein complexes binding to the proximal Sp1 or Ets-1 element of the MRG1 promoter, nuclear extracts from Rat1 fibroblast cells were analyzed by EMSA using a labeled Sp1 or Ets-1 oligonucleotide probe. As illustrated in Fig.4 A, three DNA·protein complexes (A, B, and C witharrows) were detected using labeled Sp1 probe (lane 2). These DNA·protein complexes were specific, because they disappeared in the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled Sp1 competitors (lanes 3 and 4), and inclusion of an excess amount of unlabeled mutated Sp1 oligonucleotide did not affect the formation of these complexes (lane 5). Because members of the Sp1 multigene family share the same binding consensus sequence (GC or GT box) (21Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), we performed supershift experiments to determine the identity of the three complexes. As shown in Fig. 4 B, anti-Sp1 antibody inhibited complex A formation (lane 2), whereas complexes B and C were supershifted in the presence of anti-Sp3 antibody (lane 3). In the presence of both antibodies, complexes B and C were supershifted and the intensity of complex A decreased (lane 4). Anti-STAT3 was included as a negative control and was found not to affect the mobility of these complexes (lane 5). The gel shift pattern was similar when performed using nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicated that Sp1 is a component of complex A and complexesB and C contain Sp3, a typical gel shift pattern as previously described for the Sp1 site (21Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The potential interaction of the Ets-1 element with nuclear proteins was also evaluated by EMSA (Fig. 4 C). Transcription factors in the Ets family recognize the sequence (A/G)(T/A)(G/A)(A/T)TCC(G/T)(G/C)Y with a similar structure in the DNA binding domain. The TCC sequence is absolutely essential for Ets family members to bind DNA, with the specificity between different members determined by surrounding nucleotides (22Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 23Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The −104/+121 region contains two Ets core consensus sequences: one at −97 to − 94 (most closely matched Ets-1 recognition sequence) and the other one at − 45 to −42. With MRG1 Ets-1 element (−101/−85) as a probe, three complexes were formed (lane 1) and could be competed by unlabeled −101/−85 oligonucleotide (lane 2), suggesting they are specific. Conversely, unlabeled oligonucleotide bearing a mutated Ets-1 element (TTCC mutated to TTAA) was unable to compete for binding (lane 3), indicating the core TTCC motif is critical for the formation of DNA·protein complexes. However, the unlabeledsis-interacting element (SIE) oligonucleotide (20Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), containing a core TTCC motif, could not compete for the complex formation (lane 6), suggesting that flanking sequences are also important for the formation of DNA·protein complexes. Interestingly, the other TTCC-containing oligonucleotide from the MRG1 promoter (−56 to −34) could compete for the formation of complexA but not complexes B and C. Mutations of the TTCC motif in region −56 to −34 did not significantly affect the promoter activity in Rat1 cells (data not shown). Most importantly, the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Ets/PEA3 binding oligonucleotide (lane 5) inhibited the formation of all three complexes almost as effectively as did MRG1–101/−85 oligonucleotide. These results strongly suggested that −101/−85 contains an Ets-1 binding site. However, addition of monoclonal antibodies directed against various members of Ets factor family (Ets-1, Ets-2, PU.1, Erg-1, Fli-1, and Elk-1) did not change the gel shift pattern (data not shown). The exact identity of proteins in each of the DNA·protein complexes therefore remains to be determined. To directly determine whether Sp1- and Ets-related proteins could functionally modulate MRG1 promoter activity, Drosophila SL2 cells, which are deficient in Sp1-, Sp3-, and Ets-related proteins (16Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 17Coury A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) were utilized. The reason for using insect instead of mammalian cells is because Sp1-, Sp3-, and Ets-related factors are expressed in virtually all mammalian cells, which could affect the interpretation of cotransfection experiments. We introduced MRG1 proximal promoter construct pXP-104/+121 along withDrosophila expression vectors pPacSp1 or pPacUSp3 intoDrosophila SL2 cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, both pPacSp1 and pPacUSp3 stimulated pXP-104/+121 promoter in a dose-dependent manner, with pPacSp1 being the more potent activator. Stimulation was about 35-fold with 2.5 μg of pPacSp1. To further investigate whether Sp3 could enhance transcriptional activation by Sp1, pXP-104/+121 (5 μg), pPacSp1 (1 μg), and pPacSp3 (1–4 μg) were cotransfected into Drosophila SL2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, transcriptional activation by Sp1 could clearly be enhanced by Sp3. Moreover, when the Sp1 binding site was mutated, no potentiation was observed with Sp1, Sp3, or the combination of Sp1 and Sp3. These results indicated that the Sp1 element is required for mediating the transactivation effect of both Sp1 and Sp3 on the MRG1 promoter (Fig.5 C). To assay the functional effect of Ets-related proteins on MRG1 expression, pXP-104/+121 or pXP-104mEts-1 (5 μg) was introduced intoDrosophila SL2 cells together with the Drosophilaexpression plasmids for Ets factors, pPacUEts-1 (1 μg), o"
https://openalex.org/W1977848619,"The hematopoietic cell-specific etsfamily transcription factor PU.1 regulates many lymphoid and myeloid genes. We have determined that PU.1 is critical for lineage-specific expression of the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. CD45 is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells at all stages of development, except for mature red cells and platelets. Although CD45 is normally expressed in all leukocyte lineages, it is critically regulated by PU.1 only in myeloid cells. Whereas myeloid cells from PU.1 null mice failed to express CD45, lymphoid cells were CD45+ by flow cytometry. Additionally, mRNA for CD45 was absent from PU.1-deficient myeloid cells. To understand the molecular basis for these observations, we characterized a transcriptional regulatory region of the murine CD45 gene containing exons 1a, 1b, and 2. Distinct transcriptional initiation sites for CD45 were demonstrated in T and B cellsversus myeloid cells. A transcriptional initiation site in exon 1b (P1b) was principally utilized by myeloid cells. A PU.1 binding site was identified upstream of exon 1b by sequence analysis and DNA binding assays. Using this region of the CD45 locus we demonstrated that PU.1 directly transactivated reporter gene expression. Finally, retrovirus-mediated restoration of PU.1 expression to PU.1-deficient myeloid cells resulted in expression of cell surface CD45 and restored phosphatase activity, confirming the role of PU.1 in the positive regulation of this well known signaling molecule. We conclude that CD45 is regulated differentially in myeloid and lymphoid cells and that sequences critical to direct myeloid expression include a PU.1 binding site upstream of the P1b transcriptional initiation site.

Src family kinase polymerase chain reaction 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid The transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is one of the most abundant hematopoietic cell surface proteins (1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD45 is found exclusively on hematopoietic cells, from primitive CD34+cells through mature cells of all leukocyte lineages, except platelets and mature erythrocytes. Expression of different CD45 isoforms is generated by nontranscriptional means that include alternative usage of a subset of the 32 coding exons and by post-translational modifications. The pattern of isoform expression is highly regulated and varies according to cell type during differentiation and activation (for a review see Ref. 1Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). CD45 function has been studied almost exclusively in terms of its role in signal transduction through the lymphoid antigen receptors. Engagement of these receptors results in activation of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs)1 (3Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 4Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The activity of these kinases has been shown to be dependent upon their phosphorylation state, and certain family members are regulated by CD45. Gene targeting of CD45 revealed its critical role in T cell development. T cells of CD45 null mice were arrested at the CD4+CD8+ stage without further maturation. Although the myeloid compartment of the CD45 null mouse initially appeared normal, subsequent studies of CD45 null macrophages have revealed defects in integrin-mediated adhesion. The CD45-deficient macrophages contained hyperphosphorylated SFKs Hck and Lyn, suggesting that these were CD45 substrates in myeloid cells (5Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir, McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion by CD45 via its regulation of SFK activity appears to be its best documented function in myeloid cells at present. Although it is not the only phosphatase present, the abundance of CD45 in myeloid cells implies its probable importance; in fact, CD45 accounts for 20% of total phosphatase activity in resting neutrophils (6Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Downey G.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5409-5417PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental and cell type-specific expression of CD45 is well established, but the transcriptional mechanisms conferring this regulation remain unclear. Studies in T and B cell lines have demonstrated that CD45 transcription can initiate at three mutually exclusive positions in exon 1a (P1a), exon 1b (P1b), and downstream of exon 1b (P2), but all use the same translational start site contained in exon 2 (7Hall L.R. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2781-2787PubMed Google Scholar, 8Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Boyse E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A single report has identified a pyrimidine-rich nucleotide cluster just 5′ of the P2 initiation site that possibly has a role in both basal and activator functions in B and T cells (10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whether multiple transcription initiation sites reflect the capacity for lineage and specific cell type regulation and which if any additional DNA elements control transcription of CD45 is not known. We have now identified a required role for the Ets family transcription factor PU.1 in the regulation of CD45 in myeloid cells. PU.1 is a hematopoietic specific transcription factor found in primitive progenitors and in myeloid and B cells (11Voso M.T. Burn T.C. Wulf G. Lim B. Leone G. Tenen D.G. Dev. Biol. 1994; 91: 7932-7936Google Scholar, 12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 13Chen H.-M. Zhang P. Voso M.T. Gonzalez D.A. Glass C.K. Zhang D.-E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1995; 85: 2918-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The etsfamily of proteins share a common DNA-binding domain that recognizes purine rich sequences, usually containing a 5′-GGAA-3′ core (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 14Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.-E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have shown that PU.1 is implicated in the regulation of multiple lymphoid- and myeloid-specific genes and the loss of PU.1 in mice results in a number of myeloid and B cell lineage defects (Refs.15Anderson K.L.

In this report, we demonstrate that CD45 is transcriptionally regulated by PU.1 in a cell lineage-restricted manner. CD45 expression was detected in T but not myeloid cells obtained from PU.1 null mice. Differential transcriptional start site usage in T and B cellsversus myeloid cells was found. Characterization of the region of the CD45 locus containing exons 1a, 1b, and 2 identified exon 1b as the principal CD45 transcriptional start site in myeloid cells. Moreover, our studies showed that PU.1 bound to a specific site upstream of exon 1b and could transactivate reporter gene expression. Finally, retrovirally mediated reintroduction of PU.1 in PU.1 null myeloid cells restored both CD45 expression and activity, confirming the essential role of PU.1 in the regulation of this important signaling molecule. C57BL/6 × 129 PU.1 gene-disrupted mice were produced as previously reported (17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J.

Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples labeled “normal” were either heterozygous or homozygous for the normal PU.1 allele. The PU.1 null myeloid cell line 503 that was originally isolated from neonatal PU.1 null liver has been described (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E.

This cell line was utilized for previously described retroviral transduction studies in which PU.1 was restored (19Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Perkin H. Hermanson G. Anderson C. Jolly D.J. Maki R.A.

A CD45 antibody recognizing all isoforms of the molecule was obtained from Pharmingen (clone 30-F11, Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). CD3, CD4, CD8, CD18, Gr-1, and irrelevant isotype control antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. All flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACScalibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). Total RNA was prepared, and 0.5 or 1.0 μg was treated with DNase and subjected to reverse transcription and PCR as previously described (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers used to detect the common 3′ end of CD45 have been previously reported (20Schmitt R.M. Bruyns E. Snodgrass H.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 728-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A control reaction for DNA amplification in the absence of reverse transcription was included for each sample and reaction. Spleen and thymus were removed and processed from 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice as previously described (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate T lymphocytes from the splenocytes, the cells were stained with CD90 (Thy1.2) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the CD90-positive cells were isolated using a magnetic column. The remaining CD90-negative cells were then stained with CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) in a similar fashion to isolate a pure population of B lymphocytes. Cell purity was measured by flow cytometry using B220, CD3, Thy1.2, CD8, CD4, and the appropriate isotype control antibodies directly conjugated to R-phycoerythrin or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). cDNAs were synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA and a specific murine CD45 exon 2–3 junction primer (spanning a ∼50-kilobase intron) as previously described (10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 1–5 μl of a 20-μl reverse transcription reaction was subjected to 25 cycles of PCR using the exon 2–3 primer and a 5′ primer hybridizing to sequences corresponding to previously described potential CD45 transcription initiation sites P1a, P1b, and P2 (10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Location and sequence of primers are shown in Fig. 4. One-fourth to one-third of the PCR reaction was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Controls for DNA contamination and nonspecific amplification contained template without reverse transcription and demonstrated no detectable bands. A portion of the murine CD45 locus surrounding exons 1a, 1b, and 2 was amplified from T cell line EL-4 genomic DNA and cloned into the plasmid KS+ (Stratagene Inc., San Diego, CA) for sequence analysis. For PCR amplification the following primers were used: 5′ end, 5′-GTCGACGAATTCACTGATGCACAGAGGAGAGTC-3′, and 3′ end, 5′-CTCGAGACCCATGGTCATATCTGGAGATCAGC-3′. The CD45 5′ regulatory region was next cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pXP2 (21Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-467PubMed Google Scholar) using the SalI and XhoI sites. Mutation of the core GGA residues in site 1 (shown in Fig. 4) was performed by overlap extension PCR, as previously described (22Klemsz M. Maki R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For transfections, HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% Fetalclone I (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT). Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After 48 h, cells were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 2 μg of both the reporter plasmid and the PU.1 expression plasmid were mixed with 6 μl of Lipofectin in a final volume of 100 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 15 min at room temperature, the cells were given 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% Fetalclone I and 100 μl of DNA-lipid solution. 48 h later, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using standard protocols and a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. Competitive DNA binding assay was performed as previously described (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The method for preparation of cell lysates for phosphatase assay was as described (23Ng D.H.W. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. Johnson P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 179: 177-185Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with addition of 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and 0.5% CHAPS (Bio-Rad) to the lysis buffer. 1–2 × 106 cells were incubated at 4 °C in lysis buffer for 30 min. Extracts were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. After pelleting agarose, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. 5 μg of CD45 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and samples were rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. 20 μg of protein A/G PLUS-agarose conjugate was subsequently added, and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Samples were diluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to 2.5 × 104 cell equivalents/μl, based on initial cell counts. Tyrosine phosphatase assay kit 2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and the assay of phosphatase activity was performed as directed by the manufacturer using 2.5 × 105 cell equivalents/test well. Samples were run in triplicate, and the results were combined from three separate experiments. Phosphatase activity of PU.1 null and PU.1-restored cells was expressed as a percentage of the activity of an equal number of neutrophils cultured from PU.1-normal neonatal mice. We have reported that freshly isolated liver or bone marrow from neonatal PU.1 null mice yields reduced numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and few detectable mature myeloid cells (17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). However, when cells isolated from these sources are cultured in interleukin-3-containing medium for 5–14 days, chloroacetate esterase+, Gr-1+, CD18+ polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) can be identified. Myeloid cells with the same cell surface profile begin to appear by days 3–5 in PU.1 null mice that are kept alive with antibiotics (15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Pio F. Torbett B.E. Maki R.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells freshly isolated from PU.1 null neonatal liver were examined for the expression of the panleukocyte marker CD45 by flow cytometry using an antibody that recognizes all forms of murine CD45 (see “Experimental Procedures”). As might be expected based on the reported paucity of leukocytes, CD45 was not detectable (data not shown). Surprisingly, however, CD45 was not expressed by the myeloid cells cultured in vitro from PU.1 null neonatal liver (Fig.1 A). In contrast, these cells expressed the β2 integrin component CD18 (Fig.1 A), a well known marker of myeloid cells. To determine whether the absence of cell surface CD45 could be explained by the loss of gene transcription, PU.1-deficient myeloid cells were then analyzed for the presence of CD45 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. We used previously designed primers (20Schmitt R.M. Bruyns E. Snodgrass H.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 728-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) that amplify a 3′ portion of CD45 sequence known to be present in all forms of the molecule (2Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, CD45 was undetectable in PU.1-deficient myeloid cells at the mRNA level as well. We previously demonstrated that the CD45 isoform B220 is expressed on PU.1 null cells committed to B cell development. B lymphopoiesis in these mice is highly aberrant, does not progress beyond a very early stage, and generates few detectable cells in the PU.1 null mouse (17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Detectable thymic development in PU.1 null mice does not occur until 5–8 days after birth, at which time TCR+, CD3+, CD4, and CD8 double- and single-positive cells can consistently be found in numbers about 5–10-fold less than normal littermates (Ref. 17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar and Fig.2). T cells from 11- and 12-day-old PU.1 null mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown, we found that essentially all thymocytes were also CD45+ as well as CD3+ (Fig. 2). Thus, it appeared that CD45 transcription might be differentially regulated in a lineage-specific fashion, because this molecule was expressed by PU.1 null lymphoid cells but not myeloid cells. Intriguingly, although myeloid and B cells normally express PU.1, T cells have not been shown to express PU.1, suggesting that a distinct transcriptional mechanism for CD45 operates in this lineage. Moreover, although PU.1 appeared to be critical for CD45 expression in myeloid cells, it did not appear to be required for B cell CD45 expression. Three distinct CD45 transcriptional initiation sites have been identified in the 5′-untranslated region of this gene and are designated P1a, P1b, and P2. P1a and P1b are located in exon 1a and 1b, respectively, and P2 is found just 5′ of exon 2 (Refs. 9Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Pancoast T.C. Boyse E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24Johnson N.A. Meyer C.M. Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6220-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and shown in Fig.3 A). It has been shown by primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease mapping that usage of exons 1a and 1b is mutually exclusive and is the result of alternative initiation of transcription. However, all CD45 transcripts utilize the same ATG codon present in exon 2 to begin translation (9Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Pancoast T.C. Boyse E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a PCR-based assay previously described by DiMartino et al.(10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we identified CD45 transcriptional initiation sites in primary B cells, T cells, and myeloid cells. Thymic T cells derived from either wild type or PU.1 null mice as well as wild type splenic Thy1.2+ T cells demonstrated initiation from all three potential start sites (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, wild type CD19+ splenic B cells were able to initiate transcription from P1a, P1b, and P2 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, wild type neutrophils and macrophages did not utilize the P1a site but did use the P1b and, inefficiently, the P2 site for initiation (Fig.3 B). As expected, PU.1 null myeloid cells demonstrated no PCR products, consistent with their failure to express CD45 (Fig.3 B). Thus, in contrast to the three potential start sites for transcriptional initiation that can be utilized by T and B cells, myeloid cells have only two defined start sites. To determine whether PU.1 directly regulated the murine CD45 gene, we cloned and analyzed the region of the CD45 genomic locus including exons 1a, 1b, and 2. (9Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Pancoast T.C. Boyse E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Johnson N.A. Meyer C.M. Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6220-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the first 140 base pairs upstream of the P1b major murine transcriptional start site and downstream of the P1a transcriptional start site, we identified by sequence analysis two potential PU.1 binding sites, designated as sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 4 A). Both sites contained the critical core residues, 5′-GGAAGT-3′ (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), and these potential PU.1 binding sequences are conserved between the murine and human CD45 genomic locus (24Johnson N.A. Meyer C.M. Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6220-6229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PU.1 bound to either of these sites, oligonucleotides for each site were generated, and band shift analyses were performed using in vitro translated PU.1 as well as nuclear extracts from macrophages that express PU.1. These data showed that PU.1 had high binding affinity for site 1 (−124 to −107; Fig.4 A) and very weak affinity for site 2 (−68 to −51; Fig.4 A) (data not shown). To demonstrate specific binding to site 1, competition analyses were performed using site 1, mutant site 1, and site 2 oligonucleotides as cold competitors (Fig.4 B). As shown, the site 1 oligonucleotide efficiently competed with the labeled site 1 probe, but an oligonucleotide with a mutation of the core GGA residues of site 1 was unable to compete. Site 2 oligonucleotides were able to compete efficiently only at 500-fold molar excess, further confirming the lower affinity of PU.1 for this sequence as compared with site 1. To further delineate the binding of PU.1 to site 1, we performed methylation protection analysis and observed that both core GG residues were protected from methylation (data not shown), which is consistent with our previous studies on how PU.1 and other Ets domain proteins interact with DNA (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Because we verified that PU.1 could bind to sites in the amplified CD45 5′-untranslated region, we next tested whether PU.1 could directly regulate reporter gene activity through site 1. A wild type and site 1 mutated CD45 5′ regulatory region were each cloned into the luciferase reporter gene plasmid, pXP2. HeLa cells, which express neither CD45 nor PU.1, were cotransfected with these amplified CD45 5′ regulatory region plasmids with and without the PU.1 expression plasmid PU.1PJ6 (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). As shown, cotransfection of the wild type amplified CD45 5′ regulatory region with PU.1 resulted in an 8–9-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 4 C). Cotransfection of the mutant CD45 reporter plasmid with PU.1 resulted in only a 2-fold increase over background (Fig. 4 C). Thus, these studies demonstrate that PU.1 can bind to and transactivate through site 1 (−124 to −107; Fig.4 A), which is located upstream of the major point of transcriptional initiation for the CD45 gene in myeloid cells. To elucidate the role of PU.1 in CD45 expression and myeloid development, we reintroduced PU.1 by retroviral transduction into the PU.1 null myeloid cell line 503 (12Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar,15Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Conners K. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Torbett B.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 3702-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Pio F. Torbett B.E. Maki R.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 503 is an interleukin-3-dependent PU.1 null neonatal liver-derived myeloid cell line that expresses Gr-1 (40–50%), chloroacetate esterase (>90%), and CD18 (80%). 503 cells have phenotypic and functional characteristics consistent with aberrantly or incompletely matured neutrophils (16Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Pio F. Torbett B.E. Maki R.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the myeloid cells that can be generated in short term interleukin-3 cultures of PU.1 null liver (Fig. 1), 503 cells do not express CD45 (Fig. 5 A). However, in further support for the role of PU.1 in the regulation of CD45 transcription in myeloid cells, we observed both CD45 message (data not shown) and surface protein expression following PU.1 restoration to 503 cells (503-PU; Fig. 5 A). Finally, phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated CD45 was restored in two PU.1-restored 503 clones at 94 and 80% of normal neutrophil activity, whereas PU.1-deficient 503 cells exhibited only 8% of normal activity (Fig. 5 B). Our combined results provide clear evidence that PU.1 is directly and critically involved in the expression of CD45 specifically in myeloid cells. In this study we have investigated the role of PU.1 in regulating transcription of the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 in myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Gene disruption of PU.1 in mice resulted in the loss of CD45 expression on myeloid cells but not lymphoid cells. Of the three transcriptional start sites initially described in T and B cells (8Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Boyse E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5364-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Saga Y. Tung J.-S. Shen F.-W. Pancoast T.C. Boyse E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4889-4895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), termed P1a, P1b, and P2, myeloid lineages primarily utilized P1b, and to a lesser extent P2, for transcriptional initiation. We have identified two potential PU.1 binding sites 5′ of the P1b and P2 CD45 transcriptional start sites, of which one appears critical for directing CD45 gene expression in myeloid cells. Moreover, mutation of the strongest PU.1 binding site in the CD45 5′ regulatory region abolished transactivation of a luciferase reporter in transfection assays. These results indicate that the expression of CD45, which is ubiquitously expressed on hematopoietic cells, is differentially controlled in myeloid and lymphoid cells and demonstrate that PU.1 is necessary for CD45 expression in myeloid cells. Lineage-specific mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the same gene are rarely reported but not unique. Very recently, characterization of the promoter of the RAG2 gene has shown that different transcriptional factors are responsible for B cell-specificversus T cell-specific expression of this lineage- and developmental stage-specifically regulated gene. Whereas a similar upstream region was required for promoter activity in both B and T cells, mutations of this region affected transcriptional activity differentially. Furthermore, B cell-restricted BSAP was critical for RAG2 promoter activity in B lineage cells (25Lauring J. Schissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2601-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Monroe R.J. Chen F. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12713-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that freshly isolated primary B and T cells initiate transcription from three different sites in the CD45 genomic locus containing exons 1a, 1b, and 2, consistent with previous data from T and B cell tumor lines (10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, in primary neutrophils and macrophages, only the P1b site and to a lesser extent the P2 site appear to be utilized for transcriptional initiation. To date, other regulatory elements in the CD45 genomic locus, such as TATA- and CCAAT-like sequences, have not been identified. A single report suggests that a pyrimidine-rich nucleotide cluster just 5′ of the P2 initiation site might have a role in both basal and activator functions in B and T cells (10DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whether similar pyrimidine-rich sequences have a role for transcriptional initiation of the more prominent start sites located at P1a and P1b is unclear. Additionally, our results do not exclude the possibility that more distal regulatory elements exist that have not yet been described. Our previous studies of PU.1 null mice have demonstrated that CD45 was expressed on cells committed to the B cell lineage (17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). This observation might reflect the preferential use of the P1a start site in cells committed to the B cell lineage in the absence of PU.1. Alternatively, given our demonstration of the use of the P1b and P2 start sites by B cells, it is tempting to speculate that other Ets family members may be involved in CD45 expression in lymphoid cells. Spi-B is most closely related to PU.1, sharing a 67% amino acid homology in the DNA-binding domain. This protein is expressed in both T and B cells (27Ray D. Bosselut R. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.-M. Chen H.-M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), unlike PU.1, which is not detectably expressed in committed T cells (17McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemsz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5647-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). It has been documented that Spi-B null mice express CD45 (B220) and do not have T cell abnormalities as do CD45 null mice (29Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K. Wakeham A.

Smith A.J.H. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), suggesting that their expression of CD45 is normal (28Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.-M. Chen H.-M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This outcome might be expected if both Spi-B and PU.1 could be used by B cells for CD45 expression. It is also possible that other PU.1-related Ets proteins may be responsible in these lineages, such as the recently described Spi-C, which is expressed in B cells (31Bemark M. Martensson A. Liberg D. Leanderson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10259-10267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Hashimoto S. Nishizumi H. Hayashi R. Tsuboi A. Nagawa F. Takemori T. Sakano H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or other as yet undiscovered PU.1-like Ets proteins. Alternatively, it may be that an entirely different class of transcription factors regulates CD45 expression in B and T cells, similar to the example of RAG2 gene regulation in B versus T cells cited above (25Lauring J. Schissel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2601-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Monroe R.J. Chen F. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12713-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this regard, it will be important to determine whether the PU.1 site(s) are critical for CD45 expression from P1b in B and T cells. The role of CD45 in hematopoietic cells is best understood in T and B cell lineages. CD45 has been shown to regulate SFK-mediated antigen receptor signaling in T cells and B cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 33Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and hyperphosphorylated SFKs Lck and Fyn were observed in T cells from CD45 null mice (34Stone J.D. Conroy L.A. Byth K.F. Hederer R.A. Howlett S. Takemoto Y. Holmes N. Alexander D.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5773-5782PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously believed that dephosphorylation of SFKs by CD45 was always a kinase-activating event that counterbalanced the phosphorylation-induced inactivation by Csk; however, this idea has recently been disputed (33Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, macrophages derived from CD45-deficient mice contained hyperphosphorylated and hyperactivated Hck and Lyn, indicating that these SFKs were substrates that were normally negatively regulated by CD45 in myeloid cells. Defects in integrin-mediated adhesion, which is known to be critical for functions associated with normal innate immunity, were demonstrated in CD45-deficient macrophages (5Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir, McFarland E. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have identified many functional deficits that exist in PU.1-deficient myeloid cells, including abnormal adherence and chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and killing of microbes (16Anderson K.L. Smith K.A. Pio F. Torbett B.E. Maki R.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exactly how the absence of CD45 relates to these abnormalities is not yet clear. With this report, we have extended the list of PU.1-regulated genes beyond myeloid growth- and function-specific genes, such as CD11b, gp91phox, and myeloid CSF receptors, to include signal transducing molecules such as the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. Tyrosine kinases and phosphatases have been implicated in influencing cellular events ranging from proliferation to motility to generation of antimicrobial activity (reviewed in Refs. 35Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar and 36Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). We have documented direct transcriptional regulation of CD45 by PU.1, and significantly, this regulation occurs exclusively in myeloid cells. Understanding the means by which this lineage-restricted gene regulation is accomplished may provide critical insight into the mechanisms that control the defining events of lineage development and confer normal myeloid function.

However, relatively little is known about the role of specific amino acids of the RBD in the binding to RNA. We have devised a phage display-based screening method for the rapid identification of amino acids in hnRNP C1 that are essential for its binding to RNA. The identified mutants were further tested for binding to poly(U)-Sepharose, a substrate to which wild type hnRNP C1 binds with high affinity. We found both previously predicted, highly conserved residues as well as additional residues in the RBD to be essential for C1 RNA binding. We also identified three mutations in the leucine-rich C1-C1 interaction domain near the carboxyl terminus of the protein that both abolished C1 oligomerization and reduced RNA binding. These results demonstrate that although the RBD is the primary determinant of C1 RNA binding, residues in the C1-C1 interaction domain also influence the RNA binding activity of the protein. The experimental approach we described should be generally applicable for the screening and identification of amino acids that play a role in the binding of proteins to nucleic acid substrates.

Among them, the hnRNP C1 protein is one of the most avid pre-mRNA-binding proteins, and it has been shown to preferentially bind to uridine-rich RNA sequences (5Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3519-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 7Wilusz J. Feig D.I.

In vitro selection/amplification from pools of random sequence RNA (SELEX procedure) demonstrated that C1 binds avidly to sequences containing a stretch of five or more uridines, its high affinity “winner sequence,” with an apparent dissociation constant (K d) of about 170 nm (10Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported that C1 protein also binds specifically and with high affinity to several U snRNAs (11Temsamani J. Pederson T. J. Biol.

C1 also binds U6 snRNA, which contains an elongated uridylated stretch at the 3′ end and induces disruption of U4:U6 snRNA base pairing (13Forne T. Rossi F. Labourier E. Antoine E. Cathala G. Brunel C. Tazi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16476-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The RNA binding activity of hnRNP C1 has been thought to be mainly conferred by its single RNP motif RNA-binding domain (RBD) comprising the amino-terminal 94 amino acids (9Gorlach M. Wittekind M.

The RBD (also referred to as RRM, which stands for RNA-recognition motif) is the most prevalent RNA-binding motif in eukaryotes (1Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev.

It is an evolutionarily conserved domain present in pre-mRNA-, mRNA-, pre-rRNA-, and snRNA-binding proteins, including hnRNP proteins, splicing factors, and polyadenylation factors (1Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 15Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The RBD is comprised of ∼80–100 amino acids in which two consensus sequences, an octapeptide termed RNP1 and a hexapeptide termed RNP2, about 30 amino acids apart, and many other hydrophobic amino acids are particularly highly conserved (15Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 17Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D.

Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). The RBD is folded into a compact domain structure of βαββαβ (21Wittekind M. Gorlach M. Friedrichs M. Dreyfuss G. Mueller L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6254-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R.

A. 1991; 88: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The four-stranded antiparallel β sheets are packed against the two perpendicularly oriented α helices. The highly conserved RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences are juxtaposed on the central β3and β1 strands, respectively. NMR studies of hnRNP C1 RBD bound with its high affinity RNA substrate suggest that the β sheets, the loops connecting the strands of the sheets, and the contiguous NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the RBD together form an exposed platform for direct and specific RNA binding (9Gorlach M. Wittekind M. Beckman R.A. Mueller L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Crystal structure studies of U1A RBD complexed with its cognate U1 snRNA stem-loop II further support the view that the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 and the COOH-terminal extension of the RBD interact with RNA extensively (24Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R. Teo C.H. Nagai K. Nature. 1994; 372: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis has been carried out on RBDs of many RNA-binding proteins, and these studies have pinpointed several amino acids, particularly in the conserved RNP1 and RNP2, as essential residues for the RNA binding activity of this domain. For example, residues Asn9, Thr11, Tyr13, Gln54, Phe56, and Gln83 of U1A, which corresponds to Asn15, Arg17, Phe19, Phe52, Phe54, and Asn83, respectively, in the hnRNP C1, were identified as such essential amino acids (25Lutz-Freyermuth C.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More recent studies, however, have shown that C1 lacking the canonical RBD retained considerable RNA binding in vitro to U1, U2, and U6 snRNA as well as to its SELEX winner sequence (12Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. Iyer G.V. LeStourgeon W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21359-21367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that instead of the RBD, the major determinant for C1 RNA binding is a highly basic domain that consists of residues from Val140 to Asn161 and immediately precedes a leucine zipper motif. The zipper motif forms a coiled-coil structure that mediates C1 oligomerization. In general, the basic zipper motif present in C1 protein is reminiscent of the DNA-binding bZIP motifs found in many transcription factors. However, compared with the essential role of the RBD, the importance of bZIP motif in RNA binding by intact C1 has not been fully established, because site-directed mutagenesis failed to generate expressible proteins for functional assays (12Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. Iyer G.V. LeStourgeon W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21359-21367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe a method to systematically identify, in the context of full-length C1 protein, amino acids that are essential for RNA binding. It is based on a functional screening of a randomly mutagenized C1 expression library constructed in phage. This screen identified many conserved and thus expected residues in the RBD to be essential for C1 RNA binding. It also implicated previously unidentified amino acids, particularly, residues in the C1-C1 interaction domain (CID), to influence its binding to RNA. Additionally, these identified mutations in CID resulted in a defect in C1-C1 interaction, indicating a connection between the ability of C1 to form oligomers and the RNA binding activity of this protein. This functional screening method should be generally applicable to any protein of interest to identify amino acids that are required for the binding to its cognate nucleic acid or protein ligands. To generate random point mutations in the coding region of the hnRNP C1 protein, error-prone PCR was performed using the standard protocol according to Leung et al. (30Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) with several modifications. The entire coding region of human hnRNP C1 cDNA (873 base pairs) was amplified by using the plasmid pHC12 (31Swanson M.S. Nakagawa T.Y. LeVan K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1731-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as the template and by using primers 5′-TCGAATTCGATGGCCAGCAACGTT-3′ and 5′-CAGGCTCGAGACCCCACTATGTGCTTAA-3′, which contain EcoRI or XhoI restriction enzyme site, respectively. Mutation frequency was estimated to be about 0.25–0.4% when using the following PCR conditions. Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 10 ng of template, 80 pmol of each primer, 1 mm of each dNTP, 16.6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 67 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6.1 mm MgCl2, 6.7 μm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Four identical but separate PCR reactions were subjected to 28 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. The pooled PCR products were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol precipitated, cut with EcoRI andXhoI, and purified on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. The purifiedEcoRI-XhoI fragments were then ligated into theEcoRI-XhoI cleaved Uni-Zap XR vector arms (Stratagene). The ligation mixture was packaged using the Gigapack II Packaging Extract kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions to generate a Uni-Zap λ phage library containing C1 cDNAs with random mutations. The titer of this library is ∼1 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml. To screen the mutant library, Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue bacteria were infected at ∼200 plaque-forming units/plate and plated onto 50 LB plates (100 mm) with top agarose. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, each plate was overlaid with a nitrocellulose filter impregnated with 10 mmisopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. Following incubation for 6–8 h at 37 °C, the filter was lifted, replaced with another isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside-treated nitrocellulose filter, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The first set of filters was immunoblotted with the anti-C1 monoclonal antibody 4F4 and then with 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 as previously described (32Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1204-1997Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After washing, the immunoblotted filters were exposed to x-ray film. The second set of filters was incubated in screening buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmdithiothreitol) for 30 min at room temperature with constant agitation, blocked with 3% nonfat dried milk and 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline without MgCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. After a brief wash with screening buffer, the filters were incubated in 100 ml of screening buffer containing denatured salmon sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Then, about 10 pmol of 32P-labeled oligo(dT)25(25-mer) was added to the screening buffer, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. After washing five times with screening buffer, the filters were exposed to x-ray films. Plaques scoring positive for 4F4 and negative for oligo(dT)25 were isolated and excised using ExAssist helper phage and SOLR E. coli strain as the host cell (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The mutated bases within the C1 cDNA from these clones were identified by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemicals). Samples from each ddNTP terminated reaction were run as single base ladders on polyacrylamide gels to facilitate rapid identification of mutations. Wild type and mutant hnRNP C1 proteins were produced in vitro using TnT T7/T3 polymerase coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The constructs used for TnT were either in pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene) and transcribed by T3 RNA polymerase or in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. To produce recombinant proteins from E. coli, wild type and mutant C1 cDNA fragments were subcloned into EcoRI andXhoI cleaved pET-28b vector to produce His-tagged proteins (Novagen) or pGEX-5X-3 vector to produce GST-tagged proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli (Novagen) for expression and purification of the fusion proteins according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The MT2N mutant was constructed using PCR to generate two partial COOH-terminal fragments. The more 5′ terminal of these fragments spanned the unique BsrGI site in C1. The 3′ primer for this fragment generated the V194N mutation and a silent mutation that formed an XhoI site at amino acids 198 and 199. The second fragment was amplified by PCR to contain the same engineered XhoI site, the L201N mutation, and the remaining COOH-terminal end of C1 followed by an XbaI site. These fragments were digested with BsrGI-XhoI andXhoI-XbaI, respectively, and both were subsequently inserted into BsrGI-XbaI cleaved pcDNA3-Myc-C1 plasmid (33Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) that contained the amino-terminal portion of the C1 cDNA. The mutations were confirmed using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemicals). Binding ofin vitro transcribed and translated hnRNP C1 and mutants to AGpoly(U) type 6 beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out as previously described (6Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). 5 μl of in vitro produced proteins were used in each binding reaction. The poly(U)-binding buffer contains 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and various concentrations of NaCl as indicated. In vitro protein interaction assays were carried out as previously described (34Zhang Y. O'Connor J.P. Siomi M.C. Srinivasan S. Dutra A. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5358-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST or GST-C1 proteins (2 μg) bound to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated protein in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5% aprotinin). Following incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were then eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. In vitro transcription and purification of U2 snRNA were done as previously described (35Fischer U. Sumpter V. Sekine M. Satoh T. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The32P-labeled and polyacrylamide gel-purified RNA probe (2 × 104 cpm) was incubated with the indicated recombinant His-tagged C1 proteins (25–250 nm) in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA (Sigma), and 5% glycerol at room temperature for 20 min. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with ¼× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) that had been prerun at 100 V for 1 h. Gels were run at 100 V until bromphenol blue (loaded into an empty lane) migrated about 10 cm into the gel. The gel was then dried for autoradiography. For cross-linking, gel mobility shift reactions were prepared with cold RNA probe, but instead of loading onto gels, glutaraldehyde (final concentration, 0.01%) was added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 110 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (36Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot was carried out essentially as previously described (32Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1204-1997Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), using 4F4 at a 1:1,000 dilution. To identify hnRNP C1 mutants that do not bind RNA, a λ phage expression library constructed from randomly mutated hnRNP C1 cDNA was screened with a high affinity nucleic acid probe. To generate random point mutations in C1, error-prone PCR was performed using the entire coding region of C1 as the template. Under the conditions used, this technique has been shown to produce mutation frequency of about 0.25–0.4% over 30 cycles of PCR amplification (30Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar, 37Zhou Y.H. Zhang X.P. Ebright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), based on ∼10−4errors/nucleotide synthesized by Taq DNA polymerase (38Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13365) Google Scholar). To assure that library clones expressed full-length or near full-length C1 protein, a set of replica library filters was screened with 4F4 that binds to an epitope close to the carboxyl terminus of C1. 2G. Dreyfuss, unpublished data. Thus, clones not producing full-length C1 will not be detected with 4F4. Another replica set of library filters was probed with 32P-labeled oligo(dT)25. We used oligo(dT)25 instead of poly(U), the more typically used high affinity substrate for C1 (6Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 10Gorlach M. Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23074-23078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because it is more stable and produces lower background than poly(U) (data not shown). Furthermore, in in vitro bead binding assay, oligo(dT)25 binds to C1 as well as poly(U) does. 3L. Wan and G. Dreyfuss, unpublished data. Fig.1 (A and B) shows filter duplicates probed with 4F4 and oligo(dT)25, respectively. Phage plaques that are positive with 4F4 but negative with oligo(dT)25 represent phage that likely express full-length C1 proteins but contain mutations that reduce RNA binding. After screening ∼10,000 clones, we obtained 60 clones that lost oligo(dT)25 binding capacity. The phagemids containing mutated hnRNP C1 coding regions were in vivo excised out of the λ phage, and the entire coding region of each clone was sequenced (39Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52239) Google Scholar). The sequencing gels were run as single nucleotide ladders to facilitate rapid identification of mutations. A portion of such a sequencing gel illustrating representative mutations found is shown in Fig. 1 C. For example, in clone 3, a guanine is mutated to a thymine, which results in Gln to His change at amino acid 56 (Q56H), and in clone 5, a cytosine is changed to a thymine resulting in a silent mutation at the amino acid level. The loss of oligo(dT)25 binding activity of this clone is attributed to the presence of a second mutation (data not shown). Among a total of 60 clones identified in the screening and sequenced, we found mutations at 29 amino acid positions. Mutations in a few positions were identified multiple times (data not shown). To verify that the mutants scored by the filter binding screening of the library indeed produced RNA binding defective hnRNP C1, the mutant C1 proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation and tested for binding to poly(U) beads at 0.1m NaCl. The results of the binding assays for several of these mutants are shown in Fig. 2. Compared with wild type C1 protein, mutants F19S and Q56H completely abolished poly(U) binding, and mutants S16F and G51Y significantly reduced binding. These results demonstrate that the filter binding screening successfully identified RNA binding defective mutants of hnRNP C1. The various C1 mutants we characterized, and their relative poly(U) binding avidity is listed in Fig.3 B. The positions of the mutations on the βαββαβ domain structure of the RBD are indicated in Fig. 3 A. Most of the mutations lie within the two RNP consensus motifs that form the two central β-sheets. The mutations within RNP consensus motifs, e.g. F19(S/L), G21V, F52L, and Q56H, showed no binding or severely impaired binding in the poly(U) bead binding assay. Mutations located in close proximity to the RNP consensus motifs, e.g. S16F and H49(Y/R/N), were less defective in binding to poly(U). A cluster of mutations near the COOH-terminal end of the RBD identified in the library screening (D81N, N83(D/Y), and E87G) had the same affinity as wild type C1 for poly(U) as measured by the in vitro bead binding assay. Amino acid residues Phe37, Gly41, and Ala66are well conserved in several RBD-containing proteins, and they are located in the two α-helices (Fig. 3 A). Mutations in these three positions were identified as RNA binding defective in the initial library screening. However, these mutants displayed wild type binding activity in the poly(U) bead binding assay (Fig. 3 B). For two reasons, the poly(U) bead binding assay is probably less sensitive than the library screening with oligo(dT)25 in detecting a slight decrease in binding affinity. First, the nucleic acid substrate used for screening, oligo(dT)25, is 25 nucleotides in length, whereas poly(U) beads present polyribouridylic acid chains of about 100 nucleotides. Second, the amount of poly(U) used (3 μm) was in excess over in vitro produced mutant C1 proteins (0.5 nm), whereas a relatively low concentration of oligo(dT)25 (0.1 nm) was used in the library screening. Nevertheless, the above mutations were generally expected in a successful library screening, because most of these residues are conserved in many RBD containing proteins (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that residues located in the β-sheet (22Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H. Li J. Evans P.R.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3289-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) are involved in RNA interaction. Our library screening identified amino acid changes that have not been previously predicted to be involved in the interaction with RNA. For example, multiple mutations were observed at Val28(V28(G/I)) and at Asp71 (D71(V/G)). These residues are located at the termini of the loop structures connecting the β-sheets and the α-helices and thus are likely to be critical for the global folding of the RBD. Of particular interest, we discovered three mutations affecting C1 binding to RNA that map outside of the RBD in the CID (Fig. 3 B). In isolated HeLa nuclear hnRNPs, the C1 and C2 proteins are present at a stoichiometry of (C1)3C2 possibly as tetramers (40Barnett S.F. Friedman D.L. LeStourgeon W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed C1 proteins spontaneously form C1 tetramers (41McAfee J.G. Soltaninassab S.R. Lindsay M.E. LeStourgeon W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CD spectra analysis of C1 deletion mutants revealed that a leucine-rich coiled-coil domain (Leu180–Glu207) mediates C1-C1 interaction (29McAfee J.G. Shahied-Milam L. Soltaninassab S.R. LeStourgeon W.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have also mapped CID to the same region. 4V. Pollard and G. Dreyfuss, unpublished data. However, it has not been previously known that in the context of full-length C1 protein, the coiled-coil motif is a determinant of C1 protein-protein interaction. Because three point mutations (L187Q, Q192P, and L201P) found in the search for RNA binding defective mutant C1 were located within the CID, we tested the effect of these mutations on C1-C1 interaction. CID is predicted to be comprised of four heptad repeats (Fig. 4 A). Hydrophobic residues at positions 1 and"

In this report, the E2A gene products are shown to be targets for regulation by the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. Two novel G1 cyclin-dependent kinase sites are identified on the N-terminal domain of E12/E47. One site displays homology to a preferential D-type cyclin-dependent kinase site (serine 780) on the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (pRB) and, consistent with this homology, is more efficiently phosphorylated by cyclin D1-CDK4 than by the other cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) that were tested. The second kinase site is phosphorylated by both cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin A/E-CDK2 complexes. Mutation studies indicated that phosphorylation of the cyclin D1-CDK4 site, or more potently, of both the cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin A/E-CDK2 sites, negatively regulates the growth suppressor function associated with the N-terminal domain of E12/E47. Transient expression studies showed that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 or E negatively regulates sequence-specific activation of gene transcription by E12/E47. Analysis of site mutants, however, indicated that inhibition of E12/E47 transcriptional activity did not require the N-terminal G1cyclin-dependent kinase sites.

This result suggests that homodimers of the E2A gene products are essential for B cell development but that their role in forming active heterodimers with tissue-specific bHLH proteins may be played by other members of the E protein family (1Murre C. Bain G. van Dijk M.A. Engel I. Furnari B.A. Massari M.E. Matthews J.R. Quong M.W. Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

In the absence of ectopically expressed E2A gene products, expression of this reporter is restricted to B cells (18Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The reporter is activated in NIH3T3 cells when ITF-1 (E47/E2-5) is expressed ectopically (18Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The function of E2A gene products as transcriptional activators is critical for the completion of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and normal B cell development. In e2a gene null mice, B cell development is severed between the pre-B and pro-B cell stages, and rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes is interrupted (15Bain G. Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S. Feeney A.J. van Roon M. van der Valk M. te Riele H. Berns A. Murre C.

Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The importance of the E2A gene products for initiation of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is underscored by experiments showing that ectopic expression in T cells induces immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (6Schlissel M. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Since transcriptionally active E2A gene products are found in B cells during most stages of their development, it is likely that they also perform critical functions in cells that are more mature than pro-B cells, although the nature and importance of these functions has not been well explored.The DNA-binding and dimer assembly domain (the bHLH) of E12/E47 maps to the extreme C-terminal region of the proteins, leaving a large N-terminal domain. The transcriptional activation domains of the E2A gene products have been mapped to this N-terminal domain and are conserved among members of the E protein family (19Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Massari M.E. Jennings P.A. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One activation domain has been structurally characterized as a loop followed by an α-amphipathic helix and is referred to as a loop-helix motif (19Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Within an acidic stretch of residues immediately N-terminal to the bHLH are two sites that are phosphorylated by casein kinase II and protein kinase A (21Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In electrophoretic mobility shift studies, the DNA binding ability of E47 homodimers was blocked by phosphorylation of these residues, whereas the DNA binding ability of MyoD/E47 heterodimers was unaffected (21Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, phosphorylation of E47 at these sites was observed only in non-B cells (21Sloan S.R. Shen C.P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting a unique mechanism for restricting the transcriptional activity of E12/E47 homodimers to B cells.Recent studies have indicated that the E2A gene products activate transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP/WAF/SD11 (22Prabnu S. Ignatiova A. Park S. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 27: 5888-5896Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct mechanism through which E12/E47 can regulate cell growth. In addition, other functions for E12/E47 in the regulation of cell growth that are not directly associated with the activation of gene transcription have been described. These functions have been structurally mapped to the N-terminal segment of E12/E47 and include regulation of apoptosis (23Inaba T. Inukai T. Yoshihara T. Seyschab H. Ashmun R.A. Canman C.E.

Recent studies have shown thate2a gene null mice develop T cell lymphomas and that ectopic expression of E12/E47 in these lymphoma cells induces their death (27Engel I. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In colony-forming assays, deletion mutants of E47 that contained the N-terminal region suppressed growth of NIH3T3 fibroblasts as well as wild-type E47 (29Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The growth suppressor activity of E47 contrasts that of MyoD (30Crescenzi M.

Philipson L. Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and other bHLH proteins, as E47 does not require the bHLH domain for this function. Growth suppression by E47 is induced during entry into or progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (29Peverali F.A. Ramqvist T. Saffrich R. Pepperkok R. Barone M.V. Philipson L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4291-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), suggesting that the G1cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) may negatively regulate this function under appropriate growth conditions.In this report, we identify the E2A gene products as novel targets for regulation by G1 cyclin-dependent kinases. Two novel G1 cyclin-dependent kinase sites are identified on the N-terminal domain of E12/E47, and evidence is presented that phosphorylation of these sites negatively regulates the growth suppressor activity of E47. One of the sites displays a strong preference for phosphorylation by cyclin D1-dependent kinase, a characteristic previously associated only with certain kinase sites of another class of growth suppressors, the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB) family. In addition, ectopic expression of cyclin D1 or E is shown to regulate negatively site-specific transcriptional activation by E12/E47 but through a mechanism that does not require the N-terminal cyclin-dependent kinase sites. Together, the results suggest that the products of the e2agene are targets through which the G1cyclin-dependent kinases may regulate the proliferation and gene expression of certain cell types.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureC3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (given by H.

Wild-type and mutant E47 His6-tagged expression constructs were prepared by using sequences coding for residues 9–559. Sequence coding for residues 1–912 of mouse CDK4 was used to prepare the His6-tagged CDK4 expression construct.Site-directed MutagenesisA method was devised to generate site mutants based on two separate PCRs. The gene was divided into two fragments flanking the mutation site and extending to vector sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene. To generate the 5′ fragment, a forward (sense) primer containing a vector restriction site 5′ to the gene (e.g. BglII) and a backward (antisense) primer starting with the mutant nucleotide and extending into the gene were used in one PCR. To generate the 3′ fragment, a forward (sense) primer starting 1 nucleotide down from the mutant and a backward (antisense) primer starting from a vector restriction site 3′ to gene (e.g. XbaI) were used in a second PCR. A protocol modified from that described by Liang and Pardee (45Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4687) Google Scholar) was used to perform the PCRs. Reactions were carried out by a Techne Progene thermal cycler programmed to perform 35 cycles of a three-stage process and a final elongation step. The 1st stage was set at 95 °C for 40 s, 2nd stage set at 59 °C for 2 min, and 3rd stage set at 72 °C for 1 min. Reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform to remove proteins and dNTPs. The 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments were digested byBglII and XbaI, respectively, whereas the vector was digested by both BglII and XbaI and then further digested with CIP (New England Biolabs). The two fragments and vector were combined and incubated with ligase, which resulted in a blunt-end ligation at the site of the mutation and sticky-end ligations at the BglII and XbaI sites. Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), a thermophilic DNA polymerase that generates blunt ends instead of overhangs, was used for the PCRs. Competent XL-1 blue cells were transformed with the ligation reactions as described elsewhere (46Ausubel F.M. Bent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley — Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from randomly selected clones with the Wizard SV Mini-prep DNA Isolation Kit (Promega) and digested with both BglII and XbaI to check for inserts. Positive clones were then sequenced to confirm mutations and correct junctions.DNA SequencingPlasmid DNA was denatured under alkaline conditions and used as template for sequencing by the Sanger method (Sequenase version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech/U. S. Biotechnology Corp.). Sequence reactions were then run on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel in TBE buffer (46Ausubel F.M. Bent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley — Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). The gel was fixed, dried under vacuum, and then exposed to x-ray film. Sequences were read directly from the autoradiographs.Transient Expression AssaysCells were transfected at 80% confluency with a standard calcium phosphate method (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and incubated for 18 h. After transfection, cells were grown in low mitogen medium (DMEM supplemented with 3% horse serum) for another 48 h. Cells were then harvested for CAT activity. CAT assays were performed as described elsewhere (47Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). CAT activities were then quantified from TLC plates by PhosphorImager analysis. To control for nonspecific effects on [μE5 + μE2 + μE3]x4-TATA-CAT reporter activity, parallel experiments were performed with a constitutively active reporter, pRSV-CAT. Relative CAT activities were then determined by normalizing CAT values from [μE5 + μE2 + μE3]x4-TATA-CAT reporter with respective values obtained with the control reporter (pRSV-CAT).Generation of Recombinant ProteinsProteins were prepared by protocol modified from that described elsewhere (Qiagen His6 Protein Expression Manual). TB-1 competent cells expressing pREP4 were transformed with expression constructs by a standard protocol, and small scale protein preparations were performed to isolate high protein-expressing clones. Clones were grown overnight in LB medium containing both ampicillin and kanamycin and were then used for large scale protein preparations. For large scale protein preparations, bacteria were grown for 1 h in LB medium at 37 °C and then induced to express protein with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–5 h. Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold TES (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in sonication buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 8 m urea). Lysates were sonicated, clarified, and then loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) columns that were prewashed with wash buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 8 m urea). Columns were washed several times with wash buffer, and His6-tagged proteins were eluted with 150 mm imidazole in wash buffer. Proteins were then dialyzed twice against 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. Samples were aliquoted and flash-frozen.Preparation of Active Cyclin-CDK ComplexesThe four steps used in the preparation of active cyclin-CDK complexes included generation of baculoviruses, titration of baculoviruses, coinfection with cyclin and CDK baculoviruses, and purification of active cyclin-CDK complexes. The baculovirus expressing HA-tagged CDK2 (34Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M.

Morgan (University of California, San Francisco).Generation of BaculovirusesThe baculoviruses expressing cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin D1, and CDK4 were generated with the Baculovirus Protein Expression Kit from PharMingen. Monolayers of Sf9 insect cells (2 × 106) passaged into T25 flasks were cotransfected with transfer vectors (driven by the polyhedrin promoter) that contain the gene of interest and BaculoGoldTM DNA (linearized viral DNA) by a calcium phosphate method for 4 h. The use of BaculoGoldTM DNA results in the generation of baculoviruses that express only the protein of interest, thus eliminating the need to select positive expressing clones. After transfection, cells were grown in fresh medium and incubated for 5 days. The medium was collected, and 1 ml was used to infect 2 × 107 Sf9 cells seeded on a 15-cm tissue culture plate. After 3 days of infection, the medium was collected, and the titer of the virus was initially measured by end point dilution assay. Multiple rounds of amplification were performed until viral stocks reached titers greater than or equal to 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/cell.Titration of BaculovirusesSince cells are infected with two viruses simultaneously, infection efficiencies may differ from one virus to another. Infection efficiencies of cyclin and CDK viruses were normalized by comparing relative protein expression levels at different virus concentrations. Sf9 cells were passaged into 24-well plates containing 2 × 105 cells/well. Amplified virus was added to the wells at dilutions values of 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, and 1:1000. After 2 days of infection, cells were then harvested, and lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining gels with Coomassie Blue R-250 solution (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Both approaches resulted in a decrease rather than an increase in BK channel activity by ATP, suggesting that in the absence of cPLA2, phosphorylation of other regulatory elements, possibly the BK channel protein itself, results in inactivation rather than activation of the channel. The absence of changes in activity in the presence of the non-substrate ATP analog 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate verified that ATP hydrolysis was required for channel activation by ATP. Experiments with an activator and inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) support the hypothesis that PKC can be involved in the activation of BK channels by ATP; and in the absence of PKC, other kinases appear to phosphorylate additional elements in the regulatory pathway that reduce channel activity. Our data point to cPLA2-α (but not cPLA2-γ) as one target protein for phosphorylation that is intimately associated with the BK channel protein.

This concept suggests that changes in ion channel properties are not dependent on continued occupation of a receptor by an agonist, but rather arise via some long-lasting metabolic modification such as protein phosphorylation (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Armstrong D.L. Rossie S. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: ix-xxCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this process to occur, the receptor and ion channel do not have to be intimately associated, but communicate some signal transduction pathway activated by occupancy of the receptor. Such a signal transduction pathway, which may involve several steps, ultimately results in a modification that alters the activity and persists until this modification is reversed (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been shown to be important in the modulation of a number of ion channels, particularly those in the central nervous system (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Armstrong D.L.

One important type of central nervous system ion channel that has been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is the large conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (BK) channel, with at least six functionally distinct types having been described within the central nervous system (5Reinhart P.H. Chung S. Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). BK channels are important to such widely diverse central nervous system functions as neural regulation of the heart originating in the nucleus tractus solitarius and sleep, which is dependent on repetitive rhythmic activity originating in the reticular formation of the thalamus (6Dekin M.S. Getting P.A. J. Neurophysiol. ( Bethesda ). 1987; 58: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Golomb D. Wang K.J. Rinzel J. J. Neurophysiol. ( Bethesda ). 1994; 72: 1109-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8McCormick D.A. Pape H.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1990; 431: 291-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). BK channels are also involved in neuropeptide secretion, regulation of presynaptic calcium signals, and neurotransmitter release (9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because of the physiologic importance of BK channels, we have been particularly interested in the cellular signaling mechanisms responsible for controlling the activity of BK channels (10Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1996; 270: C636-C644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).It is well documented that BK channels that have been reconstituted in lipid bilayers can be either activated or inhibited by the addition of ATP, protein kinases, or protein phosphatases (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H.

In fact, BK channels have been classified as either type I or II based on their response to the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Type II BK channels in mammalian brain reconstituted in lipid bilayers are activated by ATP and ATP analogs via an endogenous protein kinase activity intimately associated with the channel. For these channels, it appears the kinase involved is protein kinase C (PKC)1 since activators of PKC enhance the response to ATP, whereas inhibitors of PKC reverse the response to ATP (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BK channels in GH3 cells appear to belong to the class that is activated in the presence of ATP with or without the addition of exogenous protein kinase, whereas BK channels in GH4 cells appear to be inactivated by ATP or protein kinases and activated by protein phosphatases (14White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Investigators examining BK channels that are activated in response to ATP in lipid bilayers concluded that there must be an endogenous protein kinase activity intimately associated with these channels (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because BK channels in lipid bilayers are at infinite dilution, the phosphorylation target could be either the channel protein itself or a regulatory protein that is intimately associated with the ion channel. The possibility that the action of the kinase may be on a regulatory protein rather than (or in addition to) the channel protein itself is intriguing. One important regulatory protein for BK channels in GH3 cells is cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (10Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1996; 270: C636-C644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, it has been thought that optimal activation of cPLA2 requires both Ca2+i and phosphorylation (16Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Qiu Z.H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 18Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It was also thought that cPLA2 resided in the cytosol and translocated to the cell membrane only in response to large increases in [Ca2+]i. It is now clear that the mechanisms involved in the regulation of cPLA2, including the relative importance of phosphorylation, [Ca2+]i, and the site of subcellular localization, show considerable variability in different cell types and even between different agonists in the same cell type. However, in most cells, there is a significant pool of cPLA2 constitutively associated with the membrane capable of producing arachidonic acid (17Qiu Z.H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2000; 40: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, recent evidence suggests that there is more than one isoform of cPLA2 (21Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that responds to intracellular calcium and other stimuli differently.In this investigation, we sought to determine whether cPLA2could be a potential target for phosphorylation, resulting in subsequent activation of BK channels. To test this hypothesis, we studied the response of wild-type BK channels in GH3 cells to ATP, to the poorly hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, and to the non-hydrolyzable substrate AMP-PNP. These results were compared with responses from BK channels that had been exposed to either aristolochic acid or antisense oligonucleotides to cPLA2 prior to the addition of ATP. Since PKC has been reported to be involved in the activation of reconstituted BK channels as well as the phosphorylation of cPLA2, we examined the possibility that PKC could be associated with the ATP response of BK channels in GH3cells. Finally, since two isoforms of cPLA2,viz. cPLA2-α (86 kDa) and cPLA2-γ (60 kDa), have now been identified, we also sought to verify that the cPLA2-α isoform is the one closely associated with BK channels in GH3 cells (21Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe major findings in this investigation are as follows. 1) ATP results in a significant activation of BK channels in wild-type GH3 cells. 2) Inhibition of cPLA2 by aristolochic acid blocks the activation of BK channels by ATP in wild-type GH3 cells. 3) Reducing the expression of cPLA2 with antisense oligonucleotides also suppresses the activation of BK channels by ATP. 4) Activation of PKC results in a significant potentiation of the activation in BK channels produced by ATP. 5) Inhibition of PKC in wild-type GH3 cells results in a significant decrease in BK channel activity when ATP is added. 6) Inhibition of cPLA2 blocks the activation of BK channels by PKC. 7) cPLA2-α appears to be the isoform associated with BK channels in GH3 cells.Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are important in the modulation of central nervous system BK channels. (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Levitan I.B. Adv.

However, modulation of BK channels by phosphorylation is complicated. BK channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers can be either activated or inhibited by the addition of ATP, protein kinases, or protein phosphatases (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 12Campbell W.B. Gebremedhin D. Pratt P.F. Harder D.R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In fact, BK channels have been classified as either type I or II based on their response to phosphorylation (4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Type II BK channels in mammalian brain reconstituted in lipid bilayers are activated by ATP and ATP analogs via an endogenous protein kinase activity intimately associated with the channel. For these reconstituted channels, it appears that the kinase involved is similar to protein kinase C since activators of PKC enhance the response to ATP, whereas inhibitors of PKC reverse the response to ATP (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H.

(online). 1999; 19 (:1–7): RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown a close association between BK channels and a several other regulatory proteins that directly alter BK activity. BK channels in GH3 cells appear to belong to the class that is activated in the presence of ATP with or without the addition of exogenous protein kinase, whereas BK channels in GH4 cells (a subclone of GH3 cells) appear to be inactivated by ATP or protein kinases and activated by protein phosphatases (9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L.

To test this hypothesis, we studied the responses of wild-type BK channels to ATP in GH3 cells.BK Channels in GH3 Cells Are Activated by MgATP and ATPγS, but Not by AMP-PNPMgATP and ATPγS caused theP o of BK channels in wild-type GH3 cells to increase significantly. The non-substrate ATP analog AMP-PNP did not result in any significant change in P o, further suggesting that the effects produced by ATP require ATP hydrolysis for channel activation (30Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This is different from the ATP-sensitive ion channels found in a variety of tissues in which ATP functions as a ligand to alter channel properties by binding reversibly to an allosteric site, but without ATP hydrolysis (30Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the increase noted for ATPγS was significantly larger than that noted for MgATP presumably because there was a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation equilibrium established in the MgATP experiments, whereas the reaction of ATPγS is only slowly reversible (9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B. Science. 1991; 253: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 13Reinhart P.H. Chung S. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation could be due to a direct kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the channel by ATP. Alternatively, since PLA2 production of arachidonic acid is also a potent activator of BK channels in excised patches and since PLA2 can be activated by phosphorylation, ATP activation of BK channels could be due to kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PLA2 rather than direct phosphorylation of BK channels. Although these data clearly show that ATP hydrolysis and subsequent protein phosphorylation are required for activation of BK channels in GH3 cells, the target for phosphorylation is still unclear.Inhibition of cPLA2 Blocks the Activation of BK Channels by ATP in Wild-type GH3 CellsInvestigators examining BK channels that are activated in response to ATP in lipid bilayers concluded that there must be an endogenous protein kinase activity intimately associated with these channels (1Reinhart P.H.

However, the phosphorylation target could be either the channel protein itself or a regulatory protein that is intimately associated with the ion channel (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that one important regulatory protein for BK channels in GH3 cells is cPLA2 (11Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal activation of cPLA2requires both Ca2+i and phosphorylation (16Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Qiu Z.H. Gijon M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In this investigation, we sought to determine whether cPLA2could be a potential target for phosphorylation, resulting in subsequent activation of BK channels. To test this hypothesis, we used a pharmacologic and an antisense approach to lower cPLA2activity in wild-type GH3 cells. Aristolochic acid caused a significant reduction in P o for BK channels. This observation is consistent with our previous reports (11Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of MgATP caused the P o to decrease, although this decrease was not statistically significant. The addition of aristolochic acid to patches in which BK channels were activated by ATP resulted in a significant decrease in activity. These data suggested that cPLA2 was one target for phosphorylation by ATP. Because aristolochic acid is a pharmacologic inhibitor of cPLA2 and could possibly be producing its effect on the MgATP response via some other mechanism, we examined the effects of MgATP on excised patches derived form cells treated with cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides. As previously reported, treatment of wild-type GH3 cells in the present investigation with antisense oligonucleotides resulted in an ∼90% decrease in the expression of cPLA2 by both biochemical and Western blot analyses (11Denson D.D. Worrell R.T. Middleton P. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of excised patches from antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells resulted in a modest, albeit significant decrease in BK channel activity. These data support the hypothesis that ATP phosphorylation of cPLA2 is one important pathway for the activation of BK channels by ATP. Our data further suggest that, in the absence of cPLA2, there may be additional targets for phosphorylation that act to inhibit BK channel activity like the inhibition seen in GH4 cells (14White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).PKC Is Involved in the Activation of BK Channels by ATPType II BK channels in mammalian brain reconstituted in lipid bilayers are activated by ATP and ATP analogs via an endogenous protein kinase activity intimately associated with the channel. For these channels, it appears that the kinase involved is similar to protein kinase C since activators of PKC enhance the response to ATP, whereas inhibitors of PKC reverse the response to ATP (1Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 9Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC could activate cPLA2 either directly or via an alternative kinase pathway, we studied the effect of MgATP on BK channels in the presence of the specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Treatment of excised patches with GF 109203X had no effect on the P o of BK channels. However, the addition of MgATP to cells treated with GF 109293X resulted in a significant decrease in P o. This decrease was similar to that observed in cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides, where the addition of MgATP also decreased theP o. On the other hand, treatment of cells that had been exposed to MgATP with PMA, an activator of PKC, resulted in a significant increase in P o. On the other hand, for BK channels in cells treated with cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides, exposure to PMA did not result in any significant change in P o. These results suggest that 1) PKC is necessary for ATP activation of BK channels; 2) in the absence of PKC, other kinases appear to phosphorylate additional elements in the regulatory pathway that reduce channel activity; 3) PLA2 is partially phosphorylated and active in GH3 cells under basal conditions; and 4) PLA2 is a target for PKC phosphorylation. (However, our data cannot exclude the possibility that mitogen-activated protein kinase also plays a role in the activation of cPLA2, as suggested by Leslie and co-workers (16Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gijon M.A. Spencer D.M. Siddiqi A.R. Bonventre J.V. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20146-20156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).)cPLA2-α Rather than cPLA2-γ Appears to Be the Isoform Associated with BK Channels in GH3CellsRecently, a novel membrane-associated cPLA2isoform (cPLA2-γ) has been described (21Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (in contrast to the original isoform, termed cPLA2-α). cPLA2-γ is associated with the plasma membrane, but it lacks the [Ca2+]i-dependent phospholipid-binding domain found in cPLA2-α, so its activation is entirely [Ca2+]i-independent. Although cPLA2-γ shares significant sequence homology with cPLA2-α, the absence of the phospholipid-binding domain reduces the size to ∼60 kDa, so cPLA2-γ can be easily distinguished on Western blots from the ”classical“ type IV cPLA2 (cPLA2-α). Several lines of evidence argue against cPLA2-γ being the isoform associated with BK channels in GH3 cells. First, a GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank search using the sequences for the sense and antisense oligonucleotides used in this study did not identify cPLA2-γ (or any other sequence besides cPLA2-α). Second, Western blots do not have a band at 60 kDa, where cPLA2-γ should run. Finally, PCR amplification of GH3 cell mRNA using primers that would amplify any cPLA2 isoforms in GH3 cells resulted in the amplification of only cPLA2-α. This is entirely consistent with the tissue distribution of cPLA2-γ, which showed very little of this isoform in brain or brain-derived tissues (21Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These data support our claim that the results with cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides were, in fact, due solely to the depletion of cPLA2-α.A Portion of the cPLA2-α Pool in GH3Cells Resides in the Cell Membrane of Wild-type CellsUntil recently, it has been thought that cPLA2 resides almost exclusively in the cytosol and translocates to the cell membrane (and other membranes) only when stimulated by large increases in [Ca2+]i. If this were true, then it would be difficult to reconcile with our observation that cPLA2activity appears to be constitutively associated with the small patches of plasma membrane excised with our patch pipettes. An explanation of this apparent discrepancy involves the observation by Osterhout and Shuttleworth (26Osterhout J.L. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8248-8254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that at least a portion of the cellular pool of cPLA2-α resides in the cell membrane and appears to be activated without increases in [Ca2+]i. Our data showing that the relative amount of cPLA2-α is higher in GH3 cell membranes than in the cytosol are consistent with this previous observation. It should be noted that although the PLA2 assay employed here does not distinguish between secretory and cytosolic PLA2, the Western blot analysis and PLA2 amplification data described earlier suggest that cytosolic PLA2 is the major form of the enzyme present in GH3 cells. Some investigators have suggested that the membrane-associated cPLA2-α is stabilized in the membrane by interaction with certain anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (32Leslie C.C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We do not question the validity of the widely reported [Ca2+]i-dependent activation of some fraction of the type IV cPLA2 that is known to be associated with the [Ca2+]i-dependent translocation of the enzyme to the membrane. Our data suggest, however, that activation of PLA2 associated with BK channels may specifically involve a pool of cPLA2 that is already located at or near its substrate in the membrane and is bound to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or other phospholipids.In summary, our data point to cPLA2-α as one target protein for phosphorylation that is intimately associated with the BK channel protein. Although we cannot unequivocally rule out the BK channel protein itself as an additional target for phosphorylation, the data that show a decrease in BK channel activity in the presence of ATP and the absence of cPLA2 suggest that direct phosphorylation of the channel protein would serve to decrease rather than increase activity. Long-term modulation of ion channels is beginning to be appreciated. This concept suggests tha"

The primary transcript of the B-myb gene is spliced alternatively in two mRNAs which either contain or lack a sequence corresponding to the so-called exon 9A of c-myb. Recent studies showed that full-length B-Myb containing the exon 9A encoded amino acids is a cell cycle regulated transcription factor whose activity is stimulated by cyclin A/Cdk 2-dependent phosphorylation at the carboxyl-terminus of B-Myb. We have now investigated in more detail the transactivation potential of the shorter isoform of B-Myb lacking exon 9A. Here, we show that B-Myb lacking exon 9A has no transactivation activity even in the presence of cyclin A. This inactivity of the shorter isoform of B-Myb is not due an improper subcelluar localization. Our work suggests that B-Myb lacking exon 9A may act as an inhibitor for full-length B-Myb mediated transactivation. Furthermore, by analysing the transactivation potential of Gal4/B-Myb fusion proteins we have identified the amino-terminal part of the exon 9A as the principal transactivation domain of full-length B-Myb. The results presented here demonstrate that B-myb encodes both an activator and an inhibitor of transcription and, thus, reveal an additional level of regulation of B-Mybactivity beside the known cyclin dependent mechanisms."
