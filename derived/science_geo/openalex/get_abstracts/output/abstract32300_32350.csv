https://openalex.org/W2097514615,"PADGEM (platelet activation dependent granule-external membrane protein) is an integral membrane protein of the alpha granules of platelets and Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells that is expressed on the plasma membrane upon cell activation and granule secretion. Activated platelets, but not resting platelets, bind to neutrophils, monocytes, HL60 cells, and U937 cells. This interaction is inhibited by anti-PADGEM antibodies, PADGEM, and EDTA; anti-GPIIb-IIIa, anti-thrombospondin, anti-GPIV, and thrombospondin produce no effect. Neutrophils and U937 cells, in contrast to Jurkatt cells, contain PADGEM recognition sites, as shown by binding of PADGEM contained in phospholipid vesicles. These results indicate that PADGEM mediates adhesion of activated platelets to monocytes and neutrophils. Therefore, PADGEM shares not only structural but also functional homology with ELAM-1 and MEL-14, members of a new family of vascular cell adhesion molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2072528655,"Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is greatly dependent on the viral trans-activator protein Tat. Tat functions through the TAR element, which is represented in both viral DNA and RNA. At present, there is no definitive evidence that determines whether Tat acts through a DNA or RNA form of TAR. We have used an intramolecular mutagenesis approach to change selectively the RNA secondary structure of TAR without affecting its primary sequence. We show that a specific RNA secondary structure for TAR is needed for biological activity. Furthermore, transcripts that only transiently form a native TAR RNA hairpin, which is not maintained in the mature mRNA, are completely trans-activated by Tat, suggesting that TAR is recognized as a nascent RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2014916785,"PROTECTIVE immunity against malaria is induced by vaccination of hosts with irradiation-attenuated sporozoites. This immunity is mediated in part by neutralizing antibodies that are directed mainly against the repeat domain of the circumsporozoite protein1–4. Early experiments showed, however, that B-cell-depleted mice that are immunized with sporozoites can resist challenge, indicating that T-cell effector mechanisms may also have a role in protection5. This idea was supported by the recent observation that protective immunity also requires T-cells expressing the CDS antigen (CD8+ T cells) 6,7, whose target is probably the developing liver-stage parasites8–10. Moreover, an oral Salmonella vaccine that expresses the circumsporozoite protein is able to protect against murine malaria in the absence of antibodies11. Here we report the identification of an epitope contained within amino acids 249–260 of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein that is recognized by H–2Kd-restricted cytotoxic T cells12,13. Passive transfer into mice of cytotoxic-T-cell clones that recognize this epitope conferred a high degree of protection against challenge. These results provide the first direct evidence that CD8+ T cells that are specific for a defined epitope can confer protection against a parasitic infection."
https://openalex.org/W1542228742,"This paper describes the amino acid sequence of the rat substance P receptor and its comparison with that of the rat substance K receptor on the basis of molecular cloning and sequence analysis. From a rat brain cDNA library constructed with an RNA expression vector, we identified a cDNA mixture containing a functional substance P receptor cDNA by examining electrophysiologically a receptor expression following injection of the mRNAs synthesized in vitro into Xenopus oocytes. A receptor cDNA clone was then isolated by cross-hybridization with the bovine substance K receptor cDNA. The clone was confirmed by selective binding of substance P to the cloned receptor expressed in mammalian COS cells. The deduced amino acid sequence (407 amino acid residues) possesses seven putative membrane spanning domains and shows a sequence similarity to the members of G-protein-coupled receptors. The rat substance P and substance K receptors are very similar in both size and amino acid sequences, particularly in the putative transmembrane regions and the first and second cytoplasmic loops. This similarity is in marked contrast to the sequence divergence in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions and the third cytoplasmic loop. The observed sequence similarity and divergence would thus contribute to the expression of similar but pharmacologically distinguishable activities of the two tachykinin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1989726308,Peptide binding and lymph node T cell activation studies have been used to characterize T cell recognition of an encephalitogenic T cell autoantigen from myelin basic protein in ()F1 mice. Amino acids that determine interactions with either the restriction element of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or the encephalitogenic T cell receptor are defined. This information enables the design of peptides that bind MHC yet do not cross-react with the autoantigen. A peptide analog of the encephalitogenic epitope is shown to be “heteroclitic” for MHC binding and activation of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro. This analog is not immunogenic for encephalitogenic T cells in vivo and is shown to inhibit disease that is induced by the autoantigen itself.
https://openalex.org/W2159106985,"New fluorescent Na+ indicators, SBFI (short for sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate) and SBFP (short for sodium-binding benzofuran phthalate) (Minta, A., and Tsien, R. Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19449–19457), were tested in Jurkat tumor lymphocytes and in REF52 rat embryo fibroblasts. Both dyes could be introduced by direct microinjection. However, when cells were incubated with the tetra(acetoxymethyl) esters of the dyes, only SBFI gave intracellular loading that was reasonably responsive to [Na+]i. Because some compartmentation of the SBFI was visible and because the indicator properties are somewhat affected by cytoplasm, the relationship between intracellular free Na+ ([Na+]i and the 340/385 nm excitation ratio of the indicator was calibrated in situ using poreforming antibiotics to equilibrate cytosolic [Na+] ([Na+]i) with extracellular [Na+]. The excitation ratio was sufficiently sensitive to resolve small changes, ≤1 mM, in [Na+]i in single cells. Basal [Na+]i values in lymphocytes and serum-starved fibroblasts were 9.4 and 4.2 mM, respectively. As expected, large increases in [Na+]i were elicited by blocking the Na+ pump with ouabain or withdrawal of extracellular K+. Mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin acting on the lymphocytes, or serum or vasopressin in fibroblasts, caused [Na+]i to increase up to 2-fold. In fibroblasts, the rise in [Na+]i was due at least partly to a stimulation of Na+ influx, which was not wholly through the Na+/H+ exchanger. The mitogen-induced increases in [Na+]i and the rate of Na+ influx are consistent with earlier estimates based on measurements of total [Na+] or tracer fluxes. However, the absolute values for free [Na+]i are much lower than previous values for total intracellular Na+, suggesting that much of the latter is bound or sequestered."
https://openalex.org/W1974450466,"The Xenopus oocyte contains three maternal basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) transcripts, the largest of which encodes the complete bFGF polypeptide. We show that the smallest transcript is transcribed in the opposite direction of the largest transcript and overlaps part of the coding sequence of bFGF. This antisense transcript encodes a highly conserved 25 kd polypeptide. In addition, the antisense transcript causes modification of the mRNA encoding bFGF during maturation of the oocyte, converting half of the adenine residues to inosine in the region of overlap between the sense and antisense transcripts. As this activity acts only on double-stranded RNA, the two mRNAs must be hybridized in the oocyte. We discuss a possible role for the antisense transcript in regulating the stability of the bFGF mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1979687902,"Multiple carbohydrate structures on the outer-membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the gram-negative pathogen H. influenzae undergo high frequency, reversible loss, indicative of phase variation. Characterization of a genetic locus, lic-1, responsible for expression of two LPS epitopes displaying phase variation, showed it to comprise four genes. The first gene mediates phase variation. At its 5′ end, within the open reading frame, are a variable number of tandem repeats of the tetramer CAAT. By shifting upstream initiation codons in or out of frame, these 4 bp units create a translational switch. The phenotype of organisms corresponds to the number of 4 bp units. Phase variation between three levels of expression (++++, +, and −) of lic-1-derived epitopes is caused by differences in the three phases of translation of the 5′ terminus of this gene. Phase variation also allows for selection of organisms displaying certain LPS epitopes in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1998683445,"The zona pellucida surrounding mouse oocytes is an extracellular matrix composed of three sulfated glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. It has been demonstrated that a monoclonal antibody to ZP3 injected into female mice inhibits fertilization by binding to the zona pellucida and blocking sperm penetration. A complementary DNA encoding ZP3 was randomly cleaved and 200- to 1000-base pair fragments were cloned into the expression vector lambda gt11. This epitope library was screened with the aforementioned contraceptive antibody, and the positive clones were used to map the seven-amino acid epitope recognized by the antibody. Female mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide containing this B cell epitope coupled to a carrier protein to provide helper T cell epitopes. The resultant circulating antibodies to ZP3 bound to the zona pellucida of immunized animals and produced long-lasting contraception. The lack of ovarian histopathology or cellular cytotoxicity among the immunized animals may be because of the absence of zona pellucida T cell epitopes in this vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W1981399829,"pT181 is the prototype of a family of staphylococcal plasmids that regulate their replication by means of antisense RNAs (countertranscripts) that block expression of the plasmid-coded initator protein. In this paper, we show that the pT181 countertranscripts induce premature termination (attenuation) of the initiator mRNA by promoting the formation of a termination-causing hairpin just 5′ to the initiator start codon. In the absence of the countertranscripts, an upstream sequence, the preemptor, pairs with the proximal arm of the terminator hairpin, preventing termination and permitting transcription of the initiator gene. This system thus differs from the classical attenuators in that attenuation is driven by antisense RNAs rather than by tRNA-induced stalling of ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1481801182,"Abstract The yeast vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase was isolated by two different methods. A previously reported purification of the enzyme (Uchida, E., Ohsumi, Y., and Anraku, Y. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1090-1095) was repeated. This procedure consisted of isolation of vacuoles, solubilization with the zwitterionic detergent ZW3-14, and glycerol gradient centrifugation of the solubilized vacuoles. The fraction with the highest specific activity (11 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed mg-1 min-1) included eight polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of 100, 69, 60, 42, 36, 32, 27, and 17 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme may be more complex than the three-subunit composition proposed from the original purification. The 69-kDa polypeptide was recognized by antisera against the catalytic subunits of two other vacuolar ATPases and labeled with the ATP analog 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, indicating that it contains all or part of the catalytic site. A monoclonal antibody was prepared against this subunit. Under nondenaturing conditions, the antibody immunoprecipitated eight polypeptides, of the same molecular masses as those seen in the glycerol gradient fraction, from solubilized vacuolar vesicles. All eight of these polypeptides are therefore good candidates for being genuine subunits of the enzyme. The structure and function of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase were further characterized by examining the inhibition of ATPase activity by KNO3. In the presence of 5 mM MgATP, 100 mM KNO3 inhibited 71% of the ATPase activity of vacuolar vesicles, and the 69- and 60-kDa subunits (and possibly the 42-kDa subunit) were removed from the vacuolar membrane to a similar extent. At concentrations of less than 200 mM KNO3, the stripping of the ATPase subunits and the inhibition of ATPase activity were dependent on the presence of MgATP, suggesting that this is a conformation-specific disassembly of the enzyme. The yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is a multisubunit enzyme, consisting of a combination of peripheral and integral membrane subunits. Its structure and subunit composition are very similar to other vacuolar ATPase, and it shares some characteristics with the F1F0-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2085956911,"We have used antisense 2′-OMe RNA oligonucleotides carrying four 5′-terminal biotin residues to probe the structure and function of the human snRNP. Nine oligonucleotides, complementary to multiple regions of U4 and U6 snRNAs, bound stably and specifically to snRNP. This allowed for efficient and selective removal of from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Binding of oligonucleotides to certain snRNA domains inhibited splicing and affected the U4-U6 interaction. Pre-mRNA and splicing products could also be affinity-selected through binding of the oligonucleotides to snRNPs in splicing complexes. The results suggest that U4 snRNP is not released during spliceosome assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1613621455,"Plastid protein coding regions in plants are generally flanked by 3' inverted repeat (IR) sequences. In a previous work (Stern, D. B., and Gruissem, W. (1987) Cell 51, 1145-1157), we have shown that their role may be in RNA stabilization and as a processing signal that establishes the mature mRNA 3' end. In this report we have investigated the stability and protein interaction of chloroplast mRNA 3' IR-RNA sequences in more detail. Progressive deletions into the 3' IR-RNA sequences for the chloroplast cytochrome b6/f subunit IV (petD) mRNA reduce the stability of the RNA, indicating that the potential to form a stem/loop is a minimum requirement for petD 3' IR-RNA stability in vitro. Specific point mutants also destabilize the processed 3' IR-RNA, suggesting an important role for the primary sequence. Gel mobility shift and UV-cross-linking analysis has shown that 3' IR-RNAs of petD and two other chloroplast mRNAs (rbcL and psbA) interact with proteins in vitro. Comparison of the bound petD 3' IR-RNA proteins with proteins that bind to rbcL and psbA reveals that binding of certain proteins is gene-specific. Also, precursor and processed petD 3' IR-RNAs bind different sets of proteins. A single nucleotide transversion (T----A) near the base of the stem eliminates the binding of a 29-kDa protein to the petD 3' IR-RNA precursor. We discuss the possible role of 3' IR-RNA-protein interactions in plastid mRNA 3' end maturation and differential mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1503342286,"The role of chromosomally derived micF RNA as a repressor of outer membrane protein OmpF of Escherichia coli was examined for various growth conditions. Levels of micF RNA as determined by Northern analyses are found to increase in response to cell growth at high temperature, in high osmolarity or in the presence of ethanol. After a switch to higher growth temperature, the levels of ompF mRNA and of newly synthesized OmpF decrease with time in E. coli strain, MC4100 but these decreases are not observed in isogenic micF deletion strain, SM3001. In addition, while levels of ompF mRNA are substantially reduced in both strains in response to high osmolarity or ethanol at 24 degrees C, the reduced levels in the parental strain are still 4-5-fold lower compared with the micF deletion strain. These findings indicate that chromosomally derived micF RNA plays a major role in the thermal regulation of OmpF and represses OmpF synthesis in response to several environmental signals by decreasing the levels of ompF mRNA. Analyses of the effect of a multicopy micF plasmid on the levels of OmpF and ompF mRNA after an increase in temperature indicated that multicopies of micF RNA markedly inhibited OmpF synthesis but did not accentuate ompF mRNA decrease. These data suggest that multicopy micF inhibits OmpF synthesis primarily through translational inactivation of ompF mRNA and that a limiting factor in addition to micF RNA is necessary to destabilize ompF mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1608731392,"We have used purified proteolytic fragments of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to characterize three related functional sites of the molecule that support interaction with platelet glycoprotein Ib, collagen, and heparin. A fragment of 116 kDa was found to be dimeric and consisted of disulfide-linked subunits which, after reduction and alkylation, corresponded to the previously described 52/48-kDa fragment extending from residue 449 to 728. Fragment III-T2, also a dimer, was composed of two pairs of disulfide-linked subunits, two 35-kDa heavy chains (residues 273-511) and two 10-kDa light chains (residues 674-728). The 116-kDa fragment, but not the constituent 52/48-kDa subunit, supported ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation and retained 20% (on a molar basis) of the ristocetin cofactor activity of native vWF; fragment III-T2 retained less than 5% activity. All three fragments, however, inhibited vWF interaction with glycoprotein Ib. Both 116-kDa and 52/48-kDa fragments inhibited vWF binding to heparin with similar potency, while fragment III-T2 had no effect in this regard. Only the 116-kDa fragment inhibited vWF binding to collagen. These results indicate that dimeric fragments containing two glycoprotein Ib-binding sites possess the minimal valency sufficient to support ristocetin-induced aggregation. The sequence comprising residues 512-673, missing in fragment III-T2, is necessary for binding to heparin and collagen and may be crucial for anchoring vWF to the subendothelium. Immunochemical and functional data suggest that the same sequence, although not essential for interaction with glycoprotein Ib, may influence the activity of the glycoprotein Ib-binding site. Only binding to collagen has absolute requirement for intact disulfide bonds. Thus, the three functional sites contained in the 116-kDa domain of vWF are structurally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1934766143,"Abstract Purified mitochondria of Leishmania tarentolae contain 3'-terminal uridylyltransferase and RNA ligase activities which can be solubilized by detergent lysis of the organelle. Run-off transcription of maxicircle and minicircle DNA also occurs in intact and Triton-lysed mitochondria, using [32P]GTP as the labeled precursor. Heparin inhibits the solubilized terminal uridylyltransferase activity but does not affect the labeling of endogenous RNAs in intact mitochondria with [32P]UTP. Clarification of the mitochondrial Triton lysate causes an increase in terminal uridylyltransferase activity with exogenous substrates. These two activities are candidates for involvement in a post-transcriptional RNA editing process of mitochondrial transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W1561203846,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) consists of two noncovalently joined α and β subunits similar to the other glycoprotein hormones. To study the function of the individual disulfide bonds in subunit assembly and secretion, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the 12 cysteine (Cys) residues in the β subunit of hCG to either alanine or serine. Both cysteines of proposed disulfide pairs were also mutated. These mutant hCG β genes were transfected alone or together with the wild-type α gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Only 3–10% assembly could be achieved with derivatives containing single Cys mutations at positions 26, 110, 72, and 90, whereas no assembly was detected with the other 8 mutants. However, double mutations of pairs 26–110 or 23–72 showed increased dimer formation (11 and 36%, respectively). The secretion rate of individual mutants varied significantly. Whereas the Cys-23 and 72 mutants were secreted normally (t½ = 140–190 min), the Cys-26 mutant was secreted faster (t½ = 70 min), and the other 9 mutants were secreted slower (t½ = 280–440 min); mutations of both Cys at 26 and 110 caused much faster secretion (t½ = 34 min). Although the secretion rate of these mutants differed, they were quantitatively recovered in the medium except for mutant Cys-88, Cys-23-72, and Cys-34-88 (40, 55, and 10% secreted, respectively). Thus, interruption of any disulfide bond in the hCGβ subunit alters the structure sufficiently to block dimer formation and in some cases slow secretion, although the stability for most of the mutant hCG β subunits is not greatly affected. The data indicate that interruption of any hCGβ disulfide bond generates different structural forms that are unable to assemble with the α subunit, and that the structural requirements for stability and assembly are different."
https://openalex.org/W1594786514,"Abstract The ArsA protein, the 63-kDa catalytic subunit of an oxyanion-translocating ATPase, was purified by successive chromatography using Q-Sepharose, red agarose, and phenyl-Sepharose to a specific activity in excess of 1 mumol of ATP hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. ATPase activity was dependent on the presence of the oxyanionic substrates. Inhibitors of other classes of ion-translocating ATPases had no effect on ArsA ATPase activity, including N,N'-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide, azide, vanadate, and nitrate. The apparent Km for ATP was determined to be 0.13 mM. The optimal pH range for ATP hydrolysis was 7.5 to 7.8. ATPase activity required Mg2+ at a molar ratio of 2 ATP:1 Mg2+. Limited proteolysis by trypsin was used to study conformational changes produced upon binding of substrates to the ArsA protein. In the absence of substrates, the ArsA protein was rapidly cleaved by trypsin to a major product of 30 kDa. ATP was partially protected from trypsin digestion, while the anionic substrate antimonite alone had no effect on proteolysis. Combination of the two substrates nearly completely protected the ArsA protein from proteolysis. Proteolytic cleavage correlated with loss of anion-stimulated ATPase activity and substrate protection from cleavage correlated with retention of activity. These results demonstrate that ATP and antimonite together produce a conformational change which is different from that of the ArsA protein in the presence of either substrate alone and suggest interaction between the oxyanion and ATP binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2077617326,"Diverse nonneuroendocrine (non-NE) cells were forced to express synaptophysin (SY), the major and typical transmembrane glycoprotein of small (30-80 nm) neurotransmitter vesicles of NE cells, using microinjection of RNA synthesized in vitro from cDNA or transient and stable transfections with cDNA brought under SV40 promoter control. The glycoprotein synthesized in non-NE cells is indistinguishable from SY of NE cells and is integrated with similar, if not identical, orientation in the membranes of a specific, novel type of small cytoplasmic vesicle that structurally resembles synaptic vesicles and in which SY is the only major protein detected. A non-N-glycosylated form of SY generated by site-directed mutagenesis showed the same behavior and specific distribution in small vesicles. The results show that the information contained in this protein alone is sufficient to secure its sorting into a special type of vesicle in a heterotypic context, i.e., in the absence of other NE-specific components."
https://openalex.org/W1531280250,"Abstract We have shown previously that growth hormone (GH) promotes the phosphorylation of its receptor on tyrosyl residues (Foster, C. M., Shafer, J. A., Rozsa, F. W., Wang, X., Lewis, S. D., Renken, D. A., Natale, J. E., Schwartz, J., and Carter-Su, C. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 326-334). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that a tyrosine kinase is specifically associated with the GH receptor. GH-receptor complexes were first partially purified from GH-treated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, a GH-responsive cell, by immunoprecipitation using anti-GH antiserum. 35S-Labeled proteins of Mr = 105,000-125,000 were observed in the immunoprecipitate from GH-treated cells labeled metabolically with 35S-amino-acids. These proteins were not observed in immunoprecipitates from cells not exposed to GH or when non-immune serum replaced the anti-GH antiserum, consistent with the proteins being GH receptors. GH receptors appeared to be phosphorylated, as evidenced by the presence of 32P-labeled bands, comigrating with the 105-125 kDa 35S-labeled proteins, in the immunoprecipitate of GH-treated cells labeled metabolically with [32P]Pi. When partially purified GH receptor preparation was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP (7-15 microM) for 10 min at 30 degrees C in the presence of MnCl2, a protein of Mr = 121,000 was phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosyl residues. As expected for the GH receptor, this protein was not observed in immunoprecipitates when cells had not been treated with GH nor when non-immune serum replaced the anti-GH antiserum. GH-receptor complexes were also purified to near homogeneity by sequential immunoprecipitation with phosphotyrosyl-binding antibody followed by anti-GH antiserum. When cells were labeled metabolically with 35S-amino acids, the 35S label migrated almost exclusively as an Mr = 105,000-125,000 protein. This protein also incorporated 32P into tyrosyl residues when incubated in solution with [gamma-32P]ATP. These results show that highly purified GH receptor preparations undergo tyrosyl phosphorylation, suggesting that either the GH receptor itself is a tyrosine kinase or is tightly associated with a tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1520401591,"Abstract Decay accelerating factor (DAF) is a glycophospholipid-anchored membrane glycoprotein that protects mammalian host cells from inadvertant complement lysis. The effects of inhibiting mucin-type O-glycosylation on the cell surface expression of DAF were studied by introducing an expression vector for human DAF into wild-type Chinese hamster ovary and ldlD cells. The ldlD cells express reversible defects in the addition of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to oligosaccharide chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Mucin-type O-glycosylation of proteins is inhibited in ldlD cells and can be selectively corrected by the addition of GalNAc to the culture medium. The attachment of a phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C-sensitive glycolipid anchor to DAF and its efficient sorting to the cell surface in ldlD cells were independent of galactose and GalNAc additions to glycolipids and proteins. Attachment of galactose and GalNAc to DAF's glycolipid anchor were apparently not required for its normal function. However, in the absence of O-glycosylation DAF was proteolytically cleaved soon after reaching the cell surface, and a large fragment of DAF was released into the culture medium. This rapid proteolysis/release resulted in the expression of very low steady state levels of O-glycosylation-deficient DAF as measured by immunoblotting. These results, in conjunction with those obtained from studies of three other membrane glycoproteins expressed in ldlD cells, suggest that O-linked sugars on membrane glycoproteins may frequently play a role in determining the level of cell surface expression of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1578332600,"It has been shown that human endothelial cells (HEC) are stimulated to migrate and proliferate by granulocyte (G)- and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) (Bussolino, F., Wang, J. M., Defilipii, P. Turrini, F., Sanavio, F., Edgell, C.-J. S., Aglietta, M., Arese, P., and Mantovani, A. (1989) Nature 337, 471-473). The rapid intracellular events initiated by these cytokines on binding to their receptors on HEC are not defined. Addition of G- or GM-CSF to HEC produced a rapid activation of Na+/H+ exchanger resulting in an increase in intracellular pH (pHi). Both cytokines induced an alkaline displacement in the pHi dependence of the exchanger without affecting the affinity for external Na+ (Nao) and the rate of exchanger. Ethylisopropylamiloride, a selective inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger, inhibited the intracellular alkalinization, the migration, and proliferation induced by G- and GM-CSF. The data indicate that G- and GM-CSF initiate a rapid exchange of Na+ and H+ by means of the Na+/H+ exchanger and that this ethylisopropylamiloride-sensitive ions flux is important to the biological effects of these cytokines on HEC."
https://openalex.org/W1537460308,"Thirty-four human sera containing parietal cell autoantibodies (PCA) specifically immunoprecipitated two antigens, with apparent molecular masses of 60-90 kDa and 100-120 kDa under nonreducing conditions and 60-90 kDa and 120-150 kDa under reducing conditions, from porcine gastric membrane extracts. A third antigen of 92 kDa was only observed in immunoprecipitates analyzed under reducing conditions. By immunoblotting, 24 of the 34 PCA-positive sera reacted with only the 60-90-kDa antigen, three reacted with a broad 60-120-kDa smear, one reacted only with a 92-kDa antigen and six did not react. Reactivity with the 60-90-kDa antigen was observed with gastric membranes from dog, pig, rat, and rabbit. Twenty PCA-negative sera did not react with these components by immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. PCA reactivity with the 60-90-kDa antigen was abolished when the gastric membranes were (a) digested with Pronase, (b) reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol, (c) treated with sodium periodate, or (d) digested with N-glycanase. The 60-90-kDa and 100-120-kDa components were insensitive to neuraminidase treatment. N-glycanase digestion of 125I-labeled antigens purified by immunoprecipitation and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis collapsed the 60-90-kDa antigen to a sharp 34-kDa band; the 100-120-kDa component was unaffected. These observations suggest that (i) parietal cell antigens comprise three components of 60-90, 92, and 100-120 kDa; (ii) the epitopes differ in conformational sensitivity; (iii) the 60-90-kDa antigen is a conserved molecule comprising a 34-kDa core protein extensively glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides; (iv) sialic acid residues are not present in the 60-90- and 100-120-kDa molecules, and (v) the carbohydrate and protein moieties of the 60-90-kDa molecule are required for antibody binding."
https://openalex.org/W1989126735,"A method was developed for selectively isolating genes from localized regions of the human genome that are contained in interspecific hybrid cells. Complementary human DNA was prepared from a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid that contained less than 1% human DNA, by using consensus 5′ intron splice sequences as primers. These primers would select immature, unspliced messenger RNA (still retaining species-specific repeat sequences) as templates. Screening a derived complementary DNA library for human repeat sequences resulted in the isolation of human clones at the anticipated frequency with characteristics expected of exons of transcribed human genes—single copy sequences that hybridized to discrete bands on Northern (RNA) blots."
https://openalex.org/W1487546257,"Abstract The biologic activity of C1 esterase, activated forms of factor XII and kallikrein at sites of vascular inflammation may be regulated by C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) elaborated by endothelial cells. Therefore, we investigated whether human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture produce C1 INH. Passaged HUVEC contain 1.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms of C1 INH/10(8) cells (mean +/- S.D.; n = 7) which was immunochemically similar to plasma C1 INH measured by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Methylamine-treated lysates of HUVEC contained a functional inhibitor of purified kallikrein (2.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms activity/10(8) cells, mean +/- S.D.; n = 4). The HUVEC-derived kallikrein inhibitory activity was mostly C1 INH because it was reversed by chemically treating the lysate with chloroform and was neutralized by anti-C1 INH antibody. A lysate of HUVEC derived from an umbilical cord from a patient with Type I hereditary angioedema contained less than 30% of the normal levels of C1 INH antigen and activity. Immunohistochemical staining of HUVEC demonstrated a diffuse pattern of staining for C1 INH. HUVEC C1 INH was also expressed on the endothelial cell surface as detected by binding of anti-C1 INH antibody to intact monolayers and was elaborated progressively into the overlying media over the first 24 h in culture. HUVEC incubated with [35S] methionine secreted a metabolically labeled protein having a molecular mass of 92 kDa immunoisolated using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to human C1 INH. A mRNA transcript encoding for C1 INH was detected by slot blot hybridization. Incubation of HUVEC with gamma-interferon stimulated the expression of the 2.1 kilobase mRNA for C1 INH and increased the level of C1 INH produced by these cells. Production and expression of C1 INH by endothelial cells may help modulate the complement system and the contact system of plasma proteolysis on the vascular surface in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2128677428,"Abstract The inner membrane of mitochondria possesses a pH-regulated anion uniporter which is activated by depletion of matrix divalent cations with A23187 (Beavis, A. D., and Garlid, K. D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15085-15093). It is now shown that Cl- transport through this pathway is inhibited by Mg2+ and Ca2+. There appear to be two sites for inhibition by Mg2+. One has an IC50 = 38 microM at pH 7.4 and appears to be on the inside since it is only observed in the presence of A23187 (10 nmol/mg). The other has an IC50 = 440 microM at pH 7.4 and appears to be on the outside since it is observed in mitochondria pretreated with very low doses of A23187 (0.25 nmol/mg or less) and in A23187-pretreated mitochondria washed to remove A23187. Ca2+ is found to inhibit anion uniport in the presence or absence of A23187 with an IC50 of about 17 microM. In contrast to these findings Cl- uniport, activated by addition of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria without depleting endogenous Mg2+ is found to be very insensitive to exogenous Mg2+, being inhibited with an IC50 of 3.2 mM. This is explained by examination of the pH dependence of the Mg2+ IC50 in non-respiring mitochondria. The internal IC50 is found to be pH-dependent, rising to about 250 microM at pH 8.4. The external IC50 is also pH-dependent, rising to 2.5 mM or above at pH 8.4. These data are consistent with a model in which Mg2+ can only bind to the protein when it is protonated at a site with a pK of about 6.8 located in the matrix. Thus, both the intrinsic activity of the uniporter and its inhibition by Mg2+ appear to be regulated by matrix protons. This makes the rate of anion uniport much more sensitive to changes in matrix pH which is physiologically advantageous for its proposed role in volume homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1631405381,"Epitopes recognized by three epidermal growth factor (EGF) competitive monoclonal antibodies, LA22, LA58, and LA90, have been localized to a 14-amino acid region in the extracellular domain of the human EGF receptor. The binding of each of these mutually competitive antibodies to A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells was inhibited up to 87% by EGF. Furthermore, binding to A431 cells was inhibited 100% by the EGF competitive monoclonal antibody 528 IgG. The EGF receptor monoclonal antibody 455 IgG, which recognizes a blood group A-related carbohydrate modification of A431 receptors and does not inhibit EGF binding, did not inhibit the binding of these three antibodies to A431 cells. Antibodies LA22, LA58, and LA90 were unusual in that they bound to recognized denatured and endoglycosidase F-treated antigenic determinants in Western blots. This suggested that the antibodies recognized continuous peptide epitopes. The epitopes for these antibodies were first localized in cyanogen bromide- and V8 protease-generated fragments of a truncated form of the EGF receptor secreted by A431 cells. In experiments with synthetic peptides, all three antibodies were found to bind to the 14 amino acids from Ala-351 to Asp-364 of the mature human EGF receptor. These amino acids are located between the two Cys-rich regions of the extracellular domain of the receptor, and they include an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser recognition site for adhesion molecule receptors. The homologous sequence in the chicken EGF receptor, which binds mouse EGF with a 100-fold lower affinity than the human EGF receptor, contains four amino acid differences including two in the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser tetramer. The mutually competitive binding of EGF and antibodies LA22, LA58, and LA90 implied that the amino acids between Ala-351 and Asp-364 participated in the formation of the EGF-binding site of the human EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1578457901,"The loss of one H2A.H2B dimer from the nucleosomal core increases its affinity for RNA polymerase II and its efficiency as a transcription template, allowing transcription of the entire DNA present in the particle. In contrast, the nucleosomal core lacking the amino-terminal ends of histones, which has an affinity for polymerase equal to that of the H2A.H2B-deficient core, shows transcription properties similar to those of the whole nucleosomal core, with synthesis of short RNA chains (40 nucleotides or less). Similar results were obtained with a bacterial RNA polymerase. The improved efficiency of the H2A.H2B-deficient cores as transcription templates does not appear to be produced by nonspecific loss of protein or structural relaxation of the particle. These results suggest that a particle lacking one H2A.H2B dimer might be a necessary intermediate during in vivo transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1555205298,"Abstract The murine serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), SAA2, and SAA3 genes are expressed in various tissues in response to acute inflammation. Prolonged expression may be accompanied by amyloid deposition in liver, spleen, and kidney. Shortly before and during deposition, an amyloid-enhancing factor (AEF) can be extracted from these tissues which accelerates amyloid formation when administered with an inflammatory agent. We have investigated the ability of liver AEF to alter expression of the three SAA genes in liver, spleen, and kidney when administered to normal mice or to mice in which inflammation was created with the injection of silver nitrate. In liver, both AEF and silver nitrate induce SAA1 and SAA2 mRNA accumulation. However, AEF elicits a more rapid response and also acts as a potent inducer of hepatic SAA3 mRNA. Silver nitrate does not induce any SAA mRNA species in kidney, whereas AEF induces all three species. In contrast, AEF induces only SAA3 mRNA in the spleen. We also show that the elevation in hepatic SAA mRNA levels induced by either AEF or silver nitrate is associated with a transient increase in the length of the poly(A) tail."
https://openalex.org/W1511116368,"Abstract Human transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) is a 50-residue mitogenic peptide with a compact structure restrained by three disulfide bonds. Sequential and overlapping synthetic peptides were made to identify epitopes of TGF alpha using a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies were raised against human TGF alpha from different preparations obtained from either chemical synthesis or recombinant DNA techniques. Two related methodologies were used in these experiments. In the first method, probes were synthesized as peptides immobilized on polyethylene pins by the method of Geysen et al. (Geysen, H. M., Meloen, R. H., and Barteling, S. J. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 3998-4002). Three sets of sequentially overlapping tetrapeptides, hexapeptides, and octapeptides covering the entire length of the human TGF alpha sequence were synthesized. In the second method, a set of overlapping 8-residue synthetic peptides, freely soluble in solution, were used as probes. By both methods, the nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies, i.e. those that did not inhibit TGF alpha in mitogenic assays, recognized two immunodominant regions represented by the NH2-terminal segment (residues 1-9) and the most prominent beta-sheet of the molecule (residues 22-31). The NH2 terminus and the beta-sheet-(22-31) are in the same face of the molecule as determined by the solution structure. These two immunodominant regions were also recognized by the polyclonal antibodies as well as regions in the COOH terminus as minor epitopes. However, none of the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognized any synthetic peptides. Thus, our results suggest that the receptor-binding surface of TGF alpha does not involve the face represented by the NH2-terminal fragment and the major beta-sheet of residues 22-31, but rather, that the opposite face represented by two loops formed by residues 12-20 and 34-43 may be involved in TGF alpha binding to its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1557491431,"Recent evidence suggests that low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins may play important roles in a variety of membrane transport processes. In order to address the question of whether these proteins are involved in transport processes in the nerve axon, we have assessed their presence in rapid transport membranes from rabbit optic nerve. We report the characterization of a group of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins which are constituents of rapid transport vesicles. Although these proteins are components of rapid transport vesicles, they are apparently not major rapidly transported species. They are localized in cytosolic as well as in membrane fractions of axons, and the membrane-associated form behaves as an integral membrane protein(s). These proteins are also found in association with a variety of vesicular and organellar components of neurons including coated vesicles, synaptic vesicles, synaptic plasma membranes, and mitochondria. We discuss the possible roles of these proteins in rapid axonal transport and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1588725440,"Abstract The murine monoclonal antibody H-11 binds a conserved epitope found at the amino terminal of the vitamin K-dependent blood proteins prothrombin, factors VII and X, and protein C. The sequence of polypeptide recognized by antibody H-11 contains 2 residues of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, and binding of the antibody is inhibited by divalent metal ions. By using a solid-phase immunoassay with 125I-labeled antibody and immobilized vitamin K-dependent protein, binding of the antibody to the vitamin K-dependent proteins was inhibited by increasing concentrations of calcium, manganese, and magnesium ion. The transition midpoints for antibody binding were in the millimolar concentration range and were different for each metal ion. In general, the transition midpoints were lowest for manganese ion, intermediate for calcium ion, and highest for magnesium ion. Antibody H-11 bound specifically to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-12 of human prothrombin that was synthesized as the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing derivative. Binding of the antibody to the peptide was not inhibited by calcium ion. These data suggest that inhibition of antibody H-11 binding by divalent metal ions is not due simply to neutralization of negative charge by Ca2+. This transition which is conserved in vitamin K-dependent proteins containing the H-11 antigenic site is likely due to a structural transition of the amino-terminal polypeptide possibly from a random (accessible) to ordered (inaccessible) structure."
https://openalex.org/W1515179019,"Natural killer (NK) activity against K562 target cells is not an ouabain-sensitive process. Inhibition of 40% of cytotoxicity was achieved only with an ouabain concentration much higher than that required to inhibit cell activation in other systems such as leukocyte chemotaxis and B lymphocyte plaque formation. Pretreatment of effector cells with biological agents such as phorbol-ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or interferon increased the cytotoxicity. This activation was not counteracted by ouabain. The effect of ouabain on NK activity was compared with a well-known ouabain-sensitive process, for example, phytohemagglutinin-induced peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation. Ouabain completely blocked [3H]thymidine incorporation, independent of the stage of the culture when the drug was added, with exception of the last 6 h. This inhibition could be partially reversed by addition of KCl. Ouabain was equally effective when whole blood cultures were used. These results suggest that NK activity is ouabain resistant, unlike other systems of cell activation that lead or do not lead to proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1559917036,"By differential screening of a rat liver cDNA library, we have isolated several cDNA clones whose respective mRNAs are decreased in liver from diabetic rats. One such clone corresponding by DNA sequence to alpha 2-microglobulin mRNA has been used in the present study. As it was described previously a reduction (10 times) of alpha 2-microglobulin mRNA levels is observed in liver from diabetic animals. Insulin both in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes from diabetic rats is able to increase the level of alpha 2-microglobulin mRNA within 15 min. This fast effect of insulin is dose-dependent (half-maximal dose at 10(-10) M), indicating that it is likely to be mediated through the insulin receptor. Insulin induction is primarily due to an increase in the rate of transcription of the gene as judged by nuclear run-on transcription experiments and by its complete prevention with actinomycin D. These data indicate that alpha 2-microglobulin gene is a fast insulin-responsive gene and constitutes a good model gene to study the possible regulatory sequences involved in the control of gene transcription by insulin."
