Starting at the centrifugal end, the layers were as follows (Fig. 1): glycogen, ergastoplasm (microsomes), mitochondria, nuclei, ‘supernatant’ cytoplasm, vacuoles and fat. Each fraction could be identified by cytochemical reactions. It was found that most of the cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid resided in ergastoplasm, some in mitochondria, and none was detectable in the ‘supernatant’. Nuclei were relatively poor in ribonucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1983176433,THE ingenious hypothesis proposed by Dr. D. W. Tucker1 to explain the complex problems of the biology of the European eel presents in my opinion some heavy difficulties. I believe it therefore necessary to offer some observations with the intention of clarifying the question.

Fatty acids in aqueous solutions at those concentrations extracted from artificial culture filtrates proved highly effective in inactivating T. martini 1."

Previous work1–3 has shown that species of Bryophyllum, B. crenatum, B. verticillatum and B. daigremontanum do not flower if kept continually under either long- or short-day conditions. To induce flowering, long-day plants showing long internodes and petiolated oval leaves must be exposed daily for 10 days to 12-hr, illumination or less, whereas short-day plants with their very short internodes and round, almost sessile, leaves must be exposed for 20 days to a long day of 13 hr. or more and then to short-day conditions for a further 10 days. These plants were therefore described as long-short-day plants4. The long-day plants could not be induced to flower by treatment with gibberellic acid. Bünsow and Harder were able to induce elongation and flowering of long-day plants grown under short-day conditions by treatment with gibberellins obtained from the fungus5 and from unripe bean seeds6. The same result was obtained in our laboratory by treatment with gibberellic acid of material of Bryophyllum crenatum which had been maintained in the form of rosettes for 12 years by continuous exposure only to short-day conditions. If, however, after treatment with gibberellic acid these short-day plants were exposed to continuous illumination or to long-day conditions, they failed to form flower primordia although they elongated strongly, forming long internodes and new oval petiolated leaves. Thus gibberellic acid can replace the long-day requirement but not the quite specific flower-inducing effect of the short day. Extremely rarely a single flower appeared in the axil of one of the upper leaves of the rosette plants grown under short-day conditions ; this was only observed in the spring of 1949 in two out of many hundred plants grown in a 9-hr. day."

https://openalex.org/W2022097484,"THE total, non-protein and protein sulphydryl contents of biological materials can be determined by using two different analytical procedures: one for the determination of total sulphydryl (protein sulphydryl + non-protein sulphydryl) values and the other for the determination of non-protein sulphydryl values. The protein sulphydryl values are obtained by subtracting the non-protein sulphydryl values from the protein sulphydryl values. Most of the available methods, however, are often complicated, time-consuming and more or less non-specific. In an earlier communication1 it was reported from this laboratory that, with a little modification, the amperometric method of Benesch, Lardy and Benesch2 can be used for the specific determination of the total sulphydryl content of biological materials. It has since been observed that the method can be adapted for the non-protein sulphydryl determinations in the same materials. Thus it is possible to use a simple, specific and rapid method for the determination of all the three sulphydryl fractions in biological materials."

https://openalex.org/W2001775505,"THE method described by Kohn1 for the analysis of serum proteins by zone electrophoresis on strips of cellulose acetate membrane has been proved to be of great value. The development of this technique, as a micro-electrophoretic method2, has emphasized the importance of cellulose acetate as a stabilizing medium. The sheets of cellulose acetate are relatively expensive compared with filter paper, and their higher cost may deter workers from using this excellent material. It has been found that the cellulose acetate membrane strip may be used several times after suitable treatment by the method to be described."
