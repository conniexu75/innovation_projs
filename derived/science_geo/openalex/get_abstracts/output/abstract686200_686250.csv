https://openalex.org/W4200262120,"Conifers dominate the world's forest ecosystems and are the most widely planted tree species. Their giant and complex genomes present great challenges for assembling a complete reference genome for evolutionary and genomic studies. We present a 25.4-Gb chromosome-level assembly of Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) and revealed that its genome size is mostly attributable to huge intergenic regions and long introns with high transposable element (TE) content. Large genes with long introns exhibited higher expressions levels. Despite a lack of recent whole-genome duplication, 91.2% of genes were duplicated through dispersed duplication, and expanded gene families are mainly related to stress responses, which may underpin conifers' adaptation, particularly in cold and/or arid conditions. The reproductive regulation network is distinct compared with angiosperms. Slow removal of TEs with high-level methylation may have contributed to genomic expansion. This study provides insights into conifer evolution and resources for advancing research on conifer adaptation and development."

It is likely that individual tumors engage common patterns of the immune system-here ""archetypes""-creating prototypical non-destructive tumor immune microenvironments (TMEs) and modulating tumor-targeting. To discover the dominant immune system archetypes, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub-compartments uncovered dominant patterns of immune composition across cancers. These archetypes were profound insofar as they also differentiated tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. They also partitioned well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune organization and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these to improve therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4200576251,"Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring KEAP1 mutations are often resistant to immunotherapy. Here, we show that KEAP1 targets EMSY for ubiquitin-mediated degradation to regulate homologous recombination repair (HRR) and anti-tumor immunity. Loss of KEAP1 in NSCLC induces stabilization of EMSY, producing a BRCAness phenotype, i.e., HRR defects and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. Defective HRR contributes to a high tumor mutational burden that, in turn, is expected to prompt an innate immune response. Notably, EMSY accumulation suppresses the type I interferon response and impairs innate immune signaling, fostering cancer immune evasion. Activation of the type I interferon response in the tumor microenvironment using a STING agonist results in the engagement of innate and adaptive immune signaling and impairs the growth of KEAP1-mutant tumors. Our results suggest that targeting PARP and STING pathways, individually or in combination, represents a therapeutic strategy in NSCLC patients harboring alterations in KEAP1."

https://openalex.org/W4205572061,"The objective of the current study is to investigate the effect of rice bran oil (RBO) on hepatic fibrosis as a characteristic response to persistent liver injuries. Rats were randomly allocated into five groups: the negative control group, thioacetamide (TAA) group (thioacetamide 100 mg/kg thrice weekly for two successive weeks, ip), RBO 0.2 and 0.4 groups (RBO 0.2mL and 0.4 mL/rat/day, po ) and standard group (silymarin 100 mg/kg/day, po ) for two weeks after TAA injection. Blood and liver tissue samples were collected for biochemical, molecular, and histological analyses. Liver functions, oxidative stress, inflammation, liver fibrosis markers were assessed. The obtained results showed that RBO reduced TAA-induced liver fibrosis and suppressed the extracellular matrix formation. Compared to the positive control group, RBO dramatically reduced total bilirubin, AST, and ALT blood levels. Furthermore, RBO reduced MDA and increased GSH contents in the liver. Simultaneously RBO downregulated the NF-κβ signaling pathway, which in turn inhibited the expression of some inflammatory mediators, including Cox-2, IL-1β, and TNF-α. RBO attenuated liver fibrosis by suppressing the biological effects of TGF-β1, α-SMA, collagen I, hydroxyproline, CTGF, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). RBO reduced liver fibrosis by inhibiting hepatic stellate cell activation and modulating the interplay among the TGF-β1 and FAK signal transduction. The greater dosage of 0.4 mL/kg has a more substantial impact. Hence, this investigation presents RBO as a promising antifibrotic agent in the TAA model through inhibition of TGF-β1 /FAK/α-SMA."
https://openalex.org/W4200368749,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common vaginal infection that affects women of reproductive age. Its increased occurrence and associated treatment cost coupled to the rise in resistance of the causative pathogen to current antifungal therapies has necessitated the need for the discovery and development of novel effective antifungal agents for the treatment of the disease. We report in this study the anti-Candida albicans activity of Solanum torvum 70% ethanol fruit extract (STF), fractions and some isolated compounds against four (4) fluconazole-resistant strains of C. albicans. We further report on the effect of the isolated compounds on the antifungal activity of fluconazole and voriconazole in the resistant isolates as well as their inhibitory effect on C. albicans biofilm formation. STF was fractionated using n-hexane, chloroform (CHCl3) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) to obtain four respective major fractions, which were then evaluated for anti-C. albicans activity using the microbroth dilution method. The whole extract and fractions recorded MICs that ranged from 0.25 to 16.00 mg/mL. From the most active fraction, STF- CHCl3 (MIC = 0.25-1.00 mg/mL), four (4) known compounds were isolated as Betulinic acid, 3-oxo-friedelan-20α-oic acid, Sitosterol-3-β-D-glucopyranoside and Oleanolic acid. The compounds demonstrated considerably higher antifungal activity (0.016 to 0.512 mg/mL) than the extract and fractions and caused a concentration-dependent anti-biofilm formation activity. They also increased the sensitivity of the C. albicans isolates to fluconazole. This is the first report of 3-oxo-friedelan-20α-oic acid in the plant as well as the first report of betulinic acid, sitosterol-3-β-D-glucopyranoside and oleanolic acid from the fruits of S. torvum. The present study has demonstrated the anti-C. albicans activity of the constituents of S. torvum ethanol fruit extract and also shown that the constituents possess anti-biofilm formation and resistance modulatory activities against fluconazole-resistant clinical C. albicans isolates."
https://openalex.org/W4200403486,"Fluro(quinolones) is an important class of antibiotic used widely in both human and veterinary medicine. Resistance to fluro(quinolones) can be acquired by either chromosomal point mutations or plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR). There is a lack of studies on the prevalence of PMQR in organisms from environmental sources in Bangladesh. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of PMQR genes in E . coli from various water sources and analysed associations between multi-drug resistance (MDR) and resistance to extended spectrum β-lactam antibiotics. We analysed 300 E . coli isolates from wastewaters of urban live-bird markets (n = 74) and rural households (n = 80), rural ponds (n = 71) and river water samples (n = 75) during 2017–2018. We isolated E . coli by filtering 100 ml of water samples through a 0.2μm cellulose membrane and incubating on mTEC agar media followed by identification of isolated colonies using biochemical tests. We selected one isolate per sample for detection of PMQR genes by multiplex PCR and tested for antibiotic susceptibility by disc diffusion. Clonal relatedness of PMQR-positive isolates was evaluated by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR). About 66% (n = 199) of E . coli isolates harbored PMQR-genes, predominantly qnrS (82%, n = 164) followed by aac(6’)-lb-cr (9%, n = 17), oqxAB (7%, n = 13), qnrB (6%, n = 11) and qepA (4%, n = 8). Around 68% (n = 135) of PMQR-positive isolates were MDR and 92% (n = 183) were extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing of which the proportion of positive samples was 87% (n = 159) for bla CTX-M-1’ 34% (n = 62) for bla TEM , 9% (n = 16) for bla OXA-1, bla OXA-47 and bla CMY-2 , and 2% (n = 4) for bla SHV . Further, 16% (n = 32) of PMQR-positive isolates were resistant to carbapenems of which 20 isolates carried bla NDM-1 . Class 1 integron ( int 1) was found in 36% (n = 72) of PMQR-positive E . coli isolates. PMQR genes were significantly associated with ESBL phenotypes ( p ≤0.001). The presence of several PMQR genes were positively associated with ESBL and carbapenemase encoding genes such as qnrS with bla CTXM-1 ( p &lt;0.001), qnrB with bla TEM ( p &lt;0.001) and bla OXA-1 ( p = 0.005), oqxAB and aac(6’)-lb-cr with bla SHV and bla OXA-1 ( p &lt;0.001), qnrB with bla NDM-1 ( p &lt;0.001), aac(6’)-lb-cr with bla OXA-47 ( p &lt;0.001) and bla NDM-1 ( p = 0.002). Further, int 1 was found to correlate with qnrB ( p &lt;0.001) and qepA ( p = 0.011). ERIC-PCR profiles allowed identification of 84 of 199 isolates with 85% matching profiles which were further grouped into 33 clusters. Only 5 clusters had isolates (n = 11) with identical ERIC-PCR profiles suggesting that PMQR-positive E . coli isolates are genetically heterogeneous. Overall, PMQR-positive MDR E . coli were widely distributed in aquatic environments of Bangladesh indicating poor wastewater treatment and highlighting the risk of transmission to humans and animals."
https://openalex.org/W4200140206,"Understanding and identifying the markers and clinical information that are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) patient survival is needed for early detection and diagnosis. In this work, we aimed to build a simple model using Cox proportional hazards (PH) and random survival forest (RSF) and find a robust signature for predicting CRC overall survival. We used stepwise regression to develop Cox PH model to analyse 54 common differentially expressed genes from three mutations. RSF is applied using log-rank and log-rank-score based on 5000 survival trees, and therefore, variables important obtained to find the genes that are most influential for CRC survival. We compared the predictive performance of the Cox PH model and RSF for early CRC detection and diagnosis. The results indicate that SLC9A8, IER5, ARSJ, ANKRD27, and PIPOX genes were significantly associated with the CRC overall survival. In addition, age, sex, and stages are also affecting the CRC overall survival. The RSF model using log-rank is better than log-rank-score, while log-rank-score needed more trees to stabilize. Overall, the imputation of missing values enhanced the model's predictive performance. In addition, Cox PH predictive performance was better than RSF."
https://openalex.org/W4200278393,"The neural circuit mechanisms underlying observational learning, learning through observing the behavior of others, are poorly understood. Hippocampal place cells are important for spatial learning, and awake replay of place cell patterns is involved in spatial decisions. Here we show that, in observer rats learning to run a maze by watching a demonstrator's spatial trajectories from a separate nearby observation box, place cell patterns during self-running in the maze are replayed remotely in the box. The contents of the remote awake replay preferentially target the maze's reward sites from both forward and reverse replay directions and reflect the observer's future correct trajectories in the maze. In contrast, under control conditions without a demonstrator, the remote replay is significantly reduced, and the preferences for reward sites and future trajectories disappear. Our results suggest that social observation directs the contents of remote awake replay to guide spatial decisions in observational learning."
https://openalex.org/W4200081579,"Distinct bacterial upper airway microbiota structures have been described in pediatric populations, and relate to risk of respiratory viral infection and, exacerbations of asthma. We hypothesized that distinct nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota structures exist in pediatric populations, relate to environmental exposures and modify risk of acute sinusitis or upper respiratory infection (URI) in children.Bacterial 16S rRNA profiles from nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 354) collected longitudinally over a one-year period from 58 children, aged four to seven years, were analyzed and correlated with environmental variables, URI, and sinusitis outcomes.Variance in nasopharyngeal microbiota composition significantly related to clinical outcomes, participant characteristics and environmental exposures including dominant bacterial genus, season, daycare attendance and tobacco exposure. Four distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota structures (Cluster I-IV) were evident and differed with respect to URI and sinusitis outcomes. These clusters were characteristically either dominated by Moraxella with sparse underlying taxa (Cluster I), comprised of a non-dominated, diverse microbiota (Cluster II), dominated by Alloiococcus/Corynebacterium (Cluster III), or by Haemophilus (Cluster IV). Cluster I was associated with increased risk of URI and sinusitis (RR = 1.18, p = 0.046; RR = 1.25, p = 0.009, respectively) in the population studied.In a pediatric population, URI and sinusitis associate with the presence of Moraxella-dominated NP microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4200102955,"Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to be a worsening public health concern in the United States (US). Though the national incidence of HIV infection has decreased over recent years, that of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis have not. Despite national recommendations on prevention, screening, and treatment of these STIs, these practices have not been standardized. Nine Health Resources and Services Administration Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funded clinics across 3 US jurisdictions (Florida, Louisiana, and Washington, DC), were selected as clinical demonstration sites to be evaluated in this mixed method needs assessment to inform a multi-site, multi-level intervention to evaluate evidence-based interventions to improve STI screening and testing of bacterial STIs among people with or at risk for HIV. These 3 US jurisdictions were selected due to having higher than national average incidence rates of HIV and bacterial STIs. Descriptive statistics and deductive analysis were used to assess quantitative and qualitative needs assessment data. Results indicate the following needs across participating sites: inconsistent and irregular comprehensive sexual behavior history taking within and among sites, limited routine bacterial STI testing (once/year and if symptomatic) not in accordance with CDC recommendations, limited extragenital site gonorrhea/chlamydia testing, limited annual training on STI-related topics including LGBTQ health and adolescent/young adult sexual health, and limited efforts for making high-STI incidence individuals feel welcome in the clinic (primarily LGBTQ individuals and adolescents/young adults). These findings were used to identify interventions to be used to increase routine screenings and testing for bacterial STIs."
https://openalex.org/W4200241277,"Breeding programs of the species Coffea canephora rely heavily on the significant genetic variability between and within its two varietal groups (conilon and robusta). The use of hybrid families and individuals has been less common. The objectives of this study were to evaluate parents and families from the populations of conilon, robusta, and its hybrids and to define the best breeding and selection strategies for productivity and disease resistance traits. As such, 71 conilon clones, 56 robusta clones, and 20 hybrid families were evaluated over several years for the following traits: vegetative vigor, incidence of rust and cercosporiosis, fruit ripening time, fruit size, plant height, canopy diameter, and yield per plant. Components of variance and genetic parameters were estimated via residual maximum likelihood (REML) and genotypic values were predicted via best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). Genetic variability among parents (clones) and hybrid families was detected for most of the evaluated traits. The Mulamba-Rank index suggests potential gains up to 17% for the genotypic aggregate of traits in the hybrid population. An intrapopulation recurrent selection within the hybrid population would be the best breeding strategy because the genetic variability, narrow and broad senses heritabilities and selective accuracies for important traits were maximized in the crossed population. Besides, such strategy is simple, low cost and quicker than the concurrent reciprocal recurrent selection in the two parental populations, and this maximizes the genetic gain for unit of time."
https://openalex.org/W4200106117,"The UN's Sustainable Development Goals are devoted to eradicate a range of infectious diseases to achieve global well-being. These efforts require monitoring disease transmission at a level that differentiates between pathogen variants at the genetic/molecular level. In fact, the advantages of genetic (molecular) measures like multiplicity of infection (MOI) over traditional metrics, e.g., R0, are being increasingly recognized. MOI refers to the presence of multiple pathogen variants within an infection due to multiple infective contacts. Maximum-likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to derive MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies from molecular data. However, these methods are biased.Based on a single molecular marker, we derive a bias-corrected ML estimator for MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies. We further improve these estimators by heuristical adjustments that compensate shortcomings in the derivation of the bias correction, which implicitly assumes that data lies in the interior of the observational space. The finite sample properties of the different variants of the bias-corrected estimators are investigated by a systematic simulation study. In particular, we investigate the performance of the estimator in terms of bias, variance, and robustness against model violations. The corrections successfully remove bias except for extreme parameters that likely yield uninformative data, which cannot sustain accurate parameter estimation. Heuristic adjustments further improve the bias correction, particularly for small sample sizes. The bias corrections also reduce the estimators' variances, which coincide with the Cramér-Rao lower bound. The estimators are reasonably robust against model violations.Applying bias corrections can substantially improve the quality of MOI estimates, particularly in areas of low as well as areas of high transmission-in both cases estimates tend to be biased. The bias-corrected estimators are (almost) unbiased and their variance coincides with the Cramér-Rao lower bound, suggesting that no further improvements are possible unless additional information is provided. Additional information can be obtained by combining data from several molecular markers, or by including information that allows stratifying the data into heterogeneous groups."
https://openalex.org/W4200272135,"Tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 pandemics are both diseases of public health threat globally. Both diseases are caused by pathogens that infect mainly the respiratory system, and are involved in airborne transmission; they also share some clinical signs and symptoms. We, therefore, took advantage of collected sputum samples at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana to conduct differential diagnoses of long-standing endemic respiratory illness, particularly tuberculosis.Sputum samples collected through the enhanced national surveys from suspected COVID-19 patients and contact tracing cases were analyzed for TB. The sputum samples were processed using Cepheid's GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in pools of 4 samples to determine the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Positive pools were then decoupled and analyzed individually. Details of positive TB samples were forwarded to the NTP for appropriate case management.Seven-hundred and seventy-four sputum samples were analyzed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in both suspected COVID-19 cases (679/774, 87.7%) and their contacts (95/774, 12.3%). A total of 111 (14.3%) were diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 infection and six (0.8%) out of the 774 individuals tested positive for pulmonary tuberculosis: five (83.3%) males and one female (16.7%). Drug susceptibility analysis identified 1 (16.7%) rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis case. Out of the six TB positive cases, 2 (33.3%) tested positive for COVID-19 indicating a coinfection. Stratifying by demography, three out of the six (50%) were from the Ayawaso West District. All positive cases received appropriate treatment at the respective sub-district according to the national guidelines.Our findings highlight the need for differential diagnosis among COVID-19 suspected cases and regular active TB surveillance in TB endemic settings."

Still, our understanding of how the human brain relates to behavior in the real world and how this link is modulated by biological, social, and environmental factors is limited. To address this, we designed the Healthy Brain Study (HBS), an interdisciplinary, longitudinal, cohort study based on multidimensional, dynamic assessments in both the laboratory and the real world. Here, we describe the rationale and design of the currently ongoing HBS. The HBS is examining a population-based sample of 1,000 healthy participants (age 30-39) who are thoroughly studied across an entire year. Data are collected through cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological testing, neuroimaging, bio-sampling, questionnaires, ecological momentary assessment, and real-world assessments using wearable devices. These data will become an accessible resource for the scientific community enabling the next step in understanding the human brain and how it dynamically and individually operates in its bio-social context.

Knowledge about the determinants of severe disease and mortality in the Indian context can guide early clinical management.We conducted a hospital-based case control study across nine sites in India to identify the determinants of severe and critical COVID-19 disease.We identified age above 60 years, duration before admission >5 days, chronic kidney disease, leucocytosis, prothrombin time > 14 sec, serum ferritin >250 ng/mL, d-dimer >0.5 ng/mL, pro-calcitonin >0.15 μg/L, fibrin degradation products >5 μg/mL, C-reactive protein >5 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase >150 U/L, interleukin-6 >25 pg/mL, NLR ≥3, and deranged liver function, renal function and serum electrolytes as significant factors associated with severe COVID-19 disease.We have identified a set of parameters that can help in characterising severe COVID-19 cases in India. These parameters are part of routinely available investigations within Indian hospital settings, both public and private. Study findings have the potential to inform clinical management protocols and identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes at an early stage."

The panel smooth conversion model of coordination degree and carbon emission of logistics industry. The empirical results show that the coupling coordination degree of logistics and financial industry in China's 30 provinces is mostly in primary and medium coordination, and only a few provinces are on the verge of imbalance; the coupling coordination degree in the eastern region is overall moderate coordination, and the overall coordination degree in the central and western regions It is the primary coordination; with the growth of GDP per capita, the degree of coupling and coordination between the logistics and financial industries has promoted the increase of carbon emissions in various regions, but the promotion effect is an inverted U-shaped trend that first increases and then decreases."

https://openalex.org/W4200070727,"Differential expression of p53 has been reported in cervical cancer, primarily in tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we examined the association of TP53 codon 47 and codon 72 polymorphisms and serum level expression of p53 in cervical cancer patients (n = 129) and healthy controls (n = 122). We found elevated levels of serum p53 protein levels in cervical cancer patients (p = 0.0442) compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we found higher levels of serum p53 in patients with grade-III tumor (p = 0.001) compared to healthy controls. Examination of SNPs showed TP53 Arg/Pro heterozygosity (adjusted OR = 2.126, 95% CI = 1.181-3.827, p = 0.012), Pro/Pro mutant homozygosity (adjusted OR = 3.564, 95% CI = 1.647-7.713, p = 0.001), along with the combined genotype (Arg/Pro+Pro/Pro) (adjusted OR 2.542, 95% CI = 1.517-4.260, p<0.001) significantly increases the risk of cervical cancer. Expression quantitative trait analysis revealed no significant association with protein expression.

https://openalex.org/W4200106076,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important molecules that mediate virus-host interactions, mainly by regulating gene expression via gene silencing. Here, we demonstrated that HIV-1 infection upregulated miR-210-5p in HIV-1-inoculated cell lines and in the serum of HIV-1-infected individuals. Luciferase reporter assays and western blotting confirmed that a target protein of miR-210-5p, TGIF2, is regulated by HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, HIV-1 Vpr protein induced miR-210-5p expression. The use of a miR-210-5p inhibitor and TGIF2 overexpression showed that Vpr upregulated miR-210-5p and thereby downregulated TGIF2, which might be one of the mechanisms used by Vpr to induce G2 arrest. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, NF-κB p50, which upregulated miR-210-5p in response to Vpr protein. In conclusion, we identified a mechanism whereby miR-210-5p, which is induced upon HIV-1 infection, targets TGIF2. This pathway was initiated by Vpr protein activating NF-κB p50, which promoted G2 arrest. These alterations orchestrated by miRNA provide new evidence on how HIV-1 interacts with its host during infection and increase our understanding of the mechanism by which Vpr regulates the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W4200302328,"Trees dispersed in grazing areas are contribute to the sustainability of livestock systems. The interactions between trees and soil are ecological processes that allow the modification of the biology, fertility, and physics of the soil. This study was aimed to assess the influence of dispersed trees in pastures on soil properties in grazing areas for dual-purpose cattle systems in the Piedmont region of the Colombian Amazon. The work was done in grazing areas with scattered trees at the Centro de Investigaciones Amazónicas CIMAZ-Macagual in Florencia-Caquetá-Colombia. We evaluated the effect of five tree species, Andira inermis, Bellucia pentámera, Guarea Guidonia, Psidium guajava and Zygia longifolia, on soil properties (up to 30 cm soil depth) under and outside the influence of the crown. Under the tree crown, three points were systematically taken in different cardinal positions. This was done at a distance corresponding to half the radius of the tree crown. The sampling points in the open pasture area (out of crown) were made in the same way, but at 15 m from the crown border. The ANOVA showed significant interaction (P < 0.0001) between tree species and location for macrofauna abundance up to 30 cm soil depth. For this reason, we performed the comparison between locations for each tree species. Chemical soil variables up to 10 cm soil depth only showed interaction of tree species-location for exchangeable potassium (P = 0.0004). Soil physical soil characteristics up to 30 cm soil depth only showed interaction of tree species-location at 20 cm soil depth (P = 0.0003). The principal component analysis for soil properties explained 61.1% of the total variability of the data with the two first axes. Using Monte Carlo test, we found crown effect for all species. Trees help to control exchangeable mineral elements that can affect the soil, potentiate basic cations such as magnesium and potassium, increase the abundance of soil macrofauna; but some trees with high ground level of shade in grazing areas could increase soil compaction due to the greater concentration of cattle in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W4200325274,"Acquiring a reliable estimate of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the emergency department (ED) is important for clinical management and for dosing renally excreted drugs. However, renal function formulas such as CKD-EPI can give biased results when serum creatinine (SCr) is not in steady-state because the assumption that urinary creatinine excretion is constant is then invalid. We assessed the extent of this by analysing variability in SCr in patients who visited the ED of a tertiary care centre.Data from ED visits at the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands between 2012 and 2019 were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented Database. Three measurement time points were defined for each visit: last SCr measurement before visit as baseline (SCr-BL), first measurement during visit (SCr-ED) and a subsequent measurement between 6 and 24 hours during admission (SCr-H1). Non-steady-state SCr was defined as exceeding the Reference Change Value (RCV), with 15% decrease or 18% increase between successive SCr measurements. Exceeding the RCV was deemed as a significant change.Of visits where SCr-BL and SCr-ED were measured (N = 47,540), 28.0% showed significant change in SCr. Of 17,928 visits admitted to the hospital with a SCr-H1 after SCr-ED, 27,7% showed significant change. More than half (55%) of the patients with SCr values available at all three timepoints (11,054) showed at least one significant change in SCr over time.One third of ED visits preceded and/or followed by creatinine measurement show non-stable serum creatinine concentration. At the ED automatically calculated eGFR should therefore be interpreted with great caution when assessing kidney function."
https://openalex.org/W4200410432,"Salinity normalization of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) data is commonly used to account for conservative mixing processes when inferring net metabolic modification of seawater by coral reefs. Salinity (S), TA, and DIC can be accurately and precisely measured, but salinity normalization of TA (nTA) and DIC (nDIC) can generate considerable and unrecognized uncertainties in coral reef metabolic rate estimates. While salinity normalization errors apply to nTA, nDIC, and other ions of interest in coral reefs, here, we focus on nTA due to its application as a proxy for net coral reef calcification and the importance for reefs to maintain calcium carbonate production under environmental change. We used global datasets of coral reef TA, S, and modeled groundwater discharge to assess the effect of different volumetric ratios of multiple freshwater TA inputs (i.e., groundwater, river, surface runoff, and precipitation) on nTA. Coral reef freshwater endmember TA ranged from -2 up to 3032 μmol/kg in hypothetical reef locations with freshwater inputs dominated by riverine, surface runoff, or precipitation mixing with groundwater. The upper bound of freshwater TA in these scenarios can result in an uncertainty in reef TA of up to 90 μmol/kg per unit S normalization if the freshwater endmember is erroneously assumed to have 0 μmol/kg alkalinity. The uncertainty associated with S normalization can, under some circumstances, even shift the interpretation of whether reefs are net calcifying to net dissolving, or vice versa. Moreover, the choice of reference salinity for normalization implicitly makes assumptions about whether biogeochemical processes occur before or after mixing between different water masses, which can add uncertainties of ±1.4% nTA per unit S normalization. Additional considerations in identifying potential freshwater sources of TA and their relative volumetric impact on seawater are required to reduce uncertainties associated with S normalization of coral reef carbonate chemistry data in some environments. However, at a minimum, researchers should minimize the range of salinities over which the normalization is applied, precisely measure salinity, and normalize TA values to a carefully selected reference salinity that takes local factors into account."
https://openalex.org/W4200020770,"One of the core pathogenic mechanisms for schizophrenia is believed to be dysfunction in glutamatergic synaptic transmissions, particularly hypofunction of N-methyl d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Previously we showed that 14-3-3 functional knockout mice exhibit schizophrenia-associated behaviors accompanied by reduced synaptic NMDARs in forebrain excitatory neurons. To investigate how 14-3-3 proteins regulate synaptic localization of NMDARs, here we examined changes in levels of synaptic NMDARs upon 14-3-3 inhibition in primary neurons. Expression of 14-3-3 protein inhibitor (difopein) in primary glutamatergic cortical and hippocampal neurons resulted in lower number of synaptic puncta containing NMDARs, including the GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits. In heterologous cells, 14-3-3 proteins enhanced surface expression of these NMDAR subunits. Furthermore, we identified that 14-3-3ζ and ε isoforms interact with NMDARs via binding to GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. Taken together, our results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins play a critical role in NMDAR synaptic trafficking by promoting surface delivery of NMDAR subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B. As NMDAR hypofunctionality is known to act as a convergence point for progression of symptoms of schizophrenia, further studies on these signaling pathways may help understand how dysfunction of 14-3-3 proteins can cause NMDAR hypofunctionality and lead to schizophrenia-associated behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4200023316,"Three-dimensional landscape patterns are an effective means to study the relationship between landscape pattern evolution and eco-environmental effects. This paper selects six districts in Xi'an as the study area to examine the spatial distribution characteristics of the three-dimensional architectural landscape in the city's main urban area using three-dimensional information on the buildings in 2020 with the support of GIS. In this study, two new architectural landscape indices-landscape height variable coefficient and building rugosity index-were employed in landscape pattern analysis, whilst a system of rigorous and comprehensive three-dimensional architectural landscape metrics was established using principal component analysis. A mathematical model of weighted change of landscape metrics based on the objective weighting method was applied to carry out scale analysis of the landscape patterns. Spatial statistical analysis and spatial autocorrelation analysis were conducted to comprehensively study the differentiation of three-dimensional architectural landscape spatial patterns. The results show that the characteristic scale of the three-dimensional landscape pattern in Xi'an's main urban area is around 8 km. Moreover, the three-dimensional landscape of the buildings in this area is spatially positively correlated, exhibiting a high degree of spatial autocorrelation whilst only showing small spatial differences. The layout of the architectural landscape pattern is disorderly and chaotic within the second ring, whilst the clustering of patch types occurs near the third ring. Moreover, the building density in the Beilin, Lianhu, and Xincheng districts is large, the building height types are rich, and the roughness of the underlying surface is high, such that these are key areas to be improved through urban renewal. The height, volume, density, morphological heterogeneity, and vertical roughness of the architectural landscape vary amongst functional areas within the study area. This paper is the first to apply the study of spatial heterogeneity of three-dimensional landscape patterns to Xi'an. It does so in order to provide a quantitative basis for urban landscape ecological design for urban renewal and the rational planning of built-up areas, which will promote the sustainable development of the city's urban environment."
https://openalex.org/W4200155293,"It is well known that equity assessment of the spatial distribution of primary health care facilities (PHCFs) is significant to optimize the allocation of health care resources and enhance the ability to react to public health emergencies, yet there is much discussion about the poor effectiveness of assessment for many cities due to the limitations of the insufficient ability of traditional data to reflect residents' demands, etc. In many cities where PHCFs are inequity distributed, this is urgently needed for the government.Using Fuzhou City, China as a case study, we propose a comprehensive method for assessing the equity that consisting of two frameworks based on the Geographic Information System. The first framework is assessing resident demand based on daily demand and potential demand, and the second is assessing PHCFs supply based on road impedance. This method combines an index system based on multi-source data and a spatial matching analysis between resident demand and PHCFs supply based on the supply-demand disparity index.The demand degree for the PHCFs and the supply degree of accessing the PHCFs of different residential areas differ to great extents. The equity of the spatial distribution of PHCFs shows well overall, but there is still a lack of equity in local areas. The number of the residential areas with the lowest equity, insufficient supply and oversupply accounted for 10.31% and 39.00% respectively; the former is mainly gathered in a concentrated form at the edge and in a scattered form inside, and the latter is distributed in the interior mostly in a concentrated manner.The key findings highlight several aspects of improving the layout of PHCFs such as strengthen an in-depth analysis on residents' demand. This study contributes to a more accurate equity assessment, and further improves the layout of health care facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4200242391,"Dietary adequacy and diversity during the lactation period are necessary to ensure good health and nutrition among women and children. Behavioral interventions pertaining to health and nutrition counselling during pregnancy and lactation are critical for awareness about dietary diversity. The issue assumes salience for marginalized communities because of the Covid-19 pandemic and associated economic and societal disruptions. This paper assesses the dietary patterns among 400 lactating mothers in the tribal-dominated district of Palghar in Maharashtra, India in 2020. The study is based on primary data regarding consumption of 10 food groups among women across 10 food groups based on 24-hour recall period. The primary outcome variable was binary information regarding Minimum Dietary Diversity defined as consumption from at least 5 food groups. Econometric analysis based on multilevel models and item-response theory is applied to identify food groups that were most difficult to be received by mothers during the early and late lactation period. We find that the daily diet of lactating mothers in Palghar primarily consists of grains, white roots, tubers, and pulses. In contrast, the intake of dairy, eggs, and non-vegetarian food items is much lower. Only Half of the lactating women (56.5 percent; 95% CI: 37.4; 73.8) have a minimum diversified diet (MDD). The prevalence of lactating women with MDD was higher among households with higher income (73.1 percent; 95% CI: 45.2; 89.9) than those in lower income group (50.7 percent; 95% CI: 42.3; 58.9). Lactating Women (in early phase) who received health and nutrition counseling services are more likely (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 0.90; 6.26) to consume a diversified diet. Food groups such as fruits, meat, poultry, fish, nuts, and seeds were among the rare food items in daily diet. The dietary pattern lacking in fruits, nuts, and heme (iron) sources indicates more significant risks of micronutrient deficiencies. The findings call for improving dietary diversity among lactating mothers, particularly from the marginalized communities, and are driven by low consumption of dairy products or various fruits and vegetables. Among the different food items, the consumption of micronutrient-rich seeds and nuts is most difficult to be accessed by lactating mothers. Also, diet-centric counseling and informing lactating mothers of its benefits are necessary to increase dietary diversity for improving maternal and child nutrition."

We investigated long-term risks, and their factors, of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the transition between the clinical phases, especially in the IT+MA and IC groups.Of the 56 patients in the IT+MA group, 27 remained the IT+MA phase, but 29 transitioned to the CH phase and started nucleot(s)ide analogue (NA) treatment during the follow-up period. Meanwhile, of the 134 patients in the IC group, only 5 started NA treatment after progressing to the CH phase. The development of HCC from the IT+MA, IC, CH, and LC groups was observed in 2, 2, 9, and 20 cases, respectively. The cumulative incidence rates of developing HCC in the IT+MA, IC, CH, and LC groups were 9.9, 1.8, 3.0, and 53.1% at 10 years. In the CH and LC group, patients who developed HCC were older, had higher levels of FIB-4 index, M2BPGi, HBcrAg and AFP, and had lower levels of albumin and platelet counts. In CH patients, FIB-4 index levels were elevated at the diagnosis of HCC compared to baseline, whereas these decreased during the follow-up period in non-HCC patients.HCC occurred at a certain rate among patients in the IT+MA and IC groups. Careful follow-up is required for CH patients with higher levels of FIB-4 index and/or M2BPGi because of the high incidence of HCC development. (299 words)."
https://openalex.org/W4200309802,"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused two waves and spread to more than 90% of Canada's provinces since it was first reported more than a year ago. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Canadian provinces have implemented many Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). However, the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic continues due to the complex dynamics of human mobility. We develop a meta-population network model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The model takes into account the heterogeneity of mitigation strategies in different provinces of Canada, such as the timing of implementing NPIs, the human mobility in retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences due to work and recreation. To determine which activity is most closely related to the dynamics of COVID-19, we use the cross-correlation analysis to find that the positive correlation is the highest between the mobility data of parks and the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 from February 15 to December 13, 2020. The average effective reproduction numbers in nine Canadian provinces are all greater than one during the time period, and NPIs have little impact on the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics in Ontario and Saskatchewan. After November 20, 2020, the average infection probability in Alberta became the highest since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. We also observe that human activities around residences do not contribute much to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The simulation results indicate that social distancing and constricting human mobility is effective in mitigating COVID-19 transmission in Canada. Our findings can provide guidance for public health authorities in projecting the effectiveness of future NPIs."
https://openalex.org/W4200340585,"The stress-induced microcrack evolution in rock specimens causes a series of physical changes and heterogeneous deformations. Some of these attributes (such as sound, electricity, heat, etc.) have been effectively used to identify the damage state and precursory information of the rock specimens. However, the strain-field heterogeneity has not been investigated previously. In this study, the relationship of the strain-field heterogeneity and damage evolution of three sandstone specimens under the uniaxial compressive load was analyzed statistically. The acoustic emission (AE) and two-dimensional digital image correlation were employed for real-time evaluation of the AE parameters and strain-field heterogeneity. The results showed that the strain-field heterogeneity was closely related to the rock damage that amplified with the applied stress, and exhibited two features; numerical difference and spatial concentration. Subsequently, these two features were characterized by the two proposed heterogeneous quantitative indicators (i.e., the degree and space heterogeneities). Further, their four transition processes were in agreement with the damage stages confirmed by AE parameters: a relatively constant trend; growth with a relatively constant rate; drastic increase trend; and increase with a high rate to maximum value. Moreover, a time sequence chain for damage precursor was built, where the heterogeneous quantitative indicators and AE parameters differed in sensitivity to microcrack development and can be used as a damage warning at the varying magnitude of the external load."

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare providers faced a number of challenges, including how to quickly adapt screening practices. The objective of this analyses was to learn staff perspectives on how the pandemic impacted suicide risk screening in primary care and mental health settings. Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary care and mental health staff between April-September 2020 across 12 VHA facilities. A multi-disciplinary team employed a qualitative thematic analysis using a hybrid inductive/deductive approach. Staff reported multiple concerns for patients during the crisis, especially regarding vulnerable populations at risk for social isolation. Lack of clear protocols at some sites on how to serve patients screening positive for suicidal ideation created confusion for staff and led some sites to temporarily stop screening. Sites had varying degrees of adaptability to virtual based care, with the biggest challenge being completion of warm hand-offs to mental health specialists. Unanticipated opportunities that emerged during this time included increased ability of patients and staff to conduct virtual care, which is expected to continue benefit post-pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200516262,"Previous observational studies have demonstrated the development of pulmonary impairments in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infected individuals. The main observed lesions due to chronic inflammation of viral infection in situ are bronchiectasis and lung-scarring injuries. This lung inflammation may be the causal agent of restrictive and obstructive lung diseases, primarily in tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP-HAM) patients. We conducted a prospective cohort study to compare spirometry and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings among 28 HTLV-1-carrier patients over the course of 6 years (2014-2019) (male/female: 7/21; mean age: 54.7 ± 9.5, range: 41-68 years). Chest HRCT exams revealed the development and evolution of lung lesions related to TSP-HAM: including centrilobular nodules, parenchymal bands, lung cysts, bronchiectasis, ground-glass opacity, mosaic attenuation, and pleural thickening. Spirometry exams showed maintenance of respiratory function, with few alterations in parameters suggestive of obstructive and restrictive disorders primarily in individuals with lung lesions and TSP-HAM. The findings of the present study indicate that pulmonary disease related to HTLV-1 is a progressive disease, with development of new lung lesions, mainly in individuals with TSP-HAM. To improve clinical management of these individuals, we recommend that individuals diagnosed with PET-MAH undergo pulmonary evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4200606744,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) has been a significant threat to public health and effective treatment of bacterial infections. Current identification of MDR is primarily based upon the large proportions of isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics simultaneously, and therefore is a belated evaluation. For bacteria with MDR, we expect to see strong correlations in both the quantitative minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the binary susceptibility as classified by the pre-determined breakpoints. Being able to detect correlations from these two perspectives allows us to find multidrug resistant bacteria proactively. In this paper, we provide a Bayesian framework that estimates the resistance level jointly for antibiotics belonging to different classes with a Gaussian mixture model, where the correlation in the latent MIC can be inferred from the Gaussian parameters and the correlation in binary susceptibility can be inferred from the mixing weights. By augmenting the laboratory measurement with the latent MIC variable to account for the censored data, and by adopting the latent class variable to represent the MIC components, our model was shown to be accurate and robust compared with the current assessment of correlations. Applying the model to Salmonella heidelberg samples isolated from human participants in National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) provides us with signs of joint resistance to Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid &amp; Cephalothin and joint resistance to Ampicillin &amp; Cephalothin. Large correlations estimated from our model could serve as a timely tool for early detection of MDR, and hence a signal for clinical intervention."

This survey was conducted between December 18 and 20, 2019, using a web-based questionnaire. The participants were 1,200 individuals registered with an online survey company. This study analyzed the association between the Big Five personality traits and food stockpiling status (n = 1192). The Big Five personality traits assess five basic dimensions of personality (i.e., extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness). To measure theses personality traits, we used the Japanese version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI-J). The Mann-Whitney test and a multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that none of the Big Five personality traits were significantly associated with having or not having stockpile food. However, interestingly, considering the stages of behavior change regarding stockpiling, high extraversion was significantly positively related to initiating stockpiling. Moreover, high neuroticism was significantly positively related to interrupted stockpiling. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on personality traits (especially low extraversion and high neuroticism) to promote food stockpiling for disasters."

German vaccines were preferred over equivalent foreign vaccines, and the favorability ratings of foreign countries where COVID-19 vaccines were developed correlated with the level of vaccination willingness for each vaccine. The patterns in vaccination willingness were more pronounced when the national origin was shown along with the vaccine manufacturer label. The study shows how non-scientific factors drive everyday decision-making about vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W4200157245,"Background Though research has established that firearms in the home increase risk for injury and death, a substantial number of Americans, especially gun owners, believe that guns make their homes safer. More than half of gun owners in a nationally-representative survey said “it depends” when asked whether guns make their homes safer or more dangerous, but little is known about the factors that affect perceived safety. Objective To determine whether the relationship between the presence of firearms and perceived home or neighborhood safety is fixed or depends on additional factors and to identify the additional factors on which it depends. Methods A mixed-methods cross-sectional analysis of the 2018 state-representative California Safety and Wellbeing Survey (n = 2558, completion rate 49%), including calculation of weighted proportions and qualitative analysis of write-in responses. Findings One in six respondents (17.2%, 95% CI 14.9% to 19.7%) reported “it depends” when asked whether a gun in their home made the home a safer or more dangerous place to be (“the home scenario”). One in six (16.6%, 95% CI 14.3% to 19.2%) reported “it depends” when asked whether the neighborhood would be safer if all neighbors had guns in the home (“the neighborhood scenario”). For the home scenario, 28.3% (95% CI 21.9% to 35.7%) cited firearm owner characteristics (e.g., training and proficiency, temperament, and mental health), 28.4% (95% CI 22.3% to 35.5%) cited firearm storage and access, and 28.0% (95% CI 21.5% to 35.7%) cited intended use for guns as factors affecting perceived safety. For the neighborhood scenario, respondents overwhelmingly cited gun owner characteristics (72.1%, 95% CI 63.4% to 79.3%). Factors on which “it depends” varied by gun ownership status. Conclusion Perceived safety when firearms are in the home depends on numerous factors. Understanding these factors may inform tailored, targeted messaging and interventions for firearm injury prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4200160808,"Birth-preparedness and complication-readiness (BPCR) is the process of planning for normal birth and anticipating the actions needed in case of an emergency. The involvement of husband during pregnancy helps a mother to make timely decisions to avoid delays. Identifying the level of husband involvement in Birth-preparedness and complication-readiness is very important, as husband is the major decision maker in household and health service related issue. However, there is no sufficient data in the Kucha district, which describes the level of husband involvement in Birth-preparedness and complication-readiness. Therefore, this study assessed the level of husband involvement in birth preparedness and complication readiness in Kucha District, Gamo Zone, Ethiopia.Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 421 husbands whose wife gave birth within the last 12 months at Kucha District using simple random sampling technique. Data was collected using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire by trained data collectors. Binary and multivariable logistic regression with odds ratios along with the 95% confidence interval analysis were employed to find factors associated with the level of husband involvement. A p-value <0.05 with 95% confidence level used to decide statistical significance.Data were collected from 421 study participants. One hundred twenty-seven (30.2%) were involved in birth preparedness and complication readiness plan. Participants who had at least secondary school education AOR = 3.1, CI (1.84-5.23), had at least four antenatal care visits AOR = 4.91, CI (2.36-10.2), and live more than five km from the health care facility AOR = 2.35, CI = 1.40-3.96) were involved in birth preparedness and complication readiness plan.Husbands' involvement in birth preparedness and complication readiness was low. Husband's higher educational level, high frequency of antenatal care, and long distance to the health facility were significantly associated with husbands' involvement in Birth-preparedness and complication-readiness plan. Therefore, advocating for higher frequency of antenatal care and improving educational level are important to increase husbands' involvement in birth preparedness and complication readiness plan."
https://openalex.org/W4200281533,"Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference can now take advantage of powerful machine learning algorithms to complement traditional experimental methods in building gene networks. However, the dynamical nature of embryonic development-representing the time-dependent interactions between thousands of transcription factors, signaling molecules, and effector genes-is one of the most challenging arenas for GRN prediction. In this work, we show that successful GRN predictions for a developmental network from gene expression data alone can be obtained with the Priors Enriched Absent Knowledge (PEAK) network inference algorithm. PEAK is a noise-robust method that models gene expression dynamics via ordinary differential equations and selects the best network based on information-theoretic criteria coupled with the machine learning algorithm Elastic Net. We test our GRN prediction methodology using two gene expression datasets for the purple sea urchin, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, and cross-check our results against existing GRN models that have been constructed and validated by over 30 years of experimental results. Our results find a remarkably high degree of sensitivity in identifying known gene interactions in the network (maximum 81.58%). We also generate novel predictions for interactions that have not yet been described, which provide a resource for researchers to use to further complete the sea urchin GRN. Published ChIPseq data and spatial co-expression analysis further support a subset of the top novel predictions. We conclude that GRN predictions that match known gene interactions can be produced using gene expression data alone from developmental time series experiments."

https://openalex.org/W4200584352,"Generally, endospore contamination can occur from different sources during product manufacturing in many industries and therefore lower its quality by affecting physicochemical properties and shelf-life. Bacterial endospores can germinate inside the product and produce several enzymes, which can cause several undesirable changes. This study assessed the spores thermal resistance and applied a microwave decontamination technique toward herbal extracts (Tilia tomentosa and Centella asiatica) containing ethanol or glycerol. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, the detected contaminant endospores belonged to different Bacillus species, namely B. subtilis, B. zhangzhouensis, and B. pumilus. The thermal resistance assessment using inoculated endospores in the actual products revealed B. pumilus T2 as the most resistant endospore to the heat treatments tested in both T. tomentosa and C. asiatica extracts. Finally, a high-performance microwave technique was used to decontaminate T. tomentosa extract against the mixture of Bacillus spores. Results from the microwave technique indicate that the increase of temperature from 100°C to 105°C not only decontaminated the product but also could dramatically decrease the effective thermal treatment time (10 times), which can benefit the product quality. The results provided in this study considerably contribute to improving an original decontamination method for products containing glycerol and ethanol with the most negligible effect on product quality."
https://openalex.org/W4205653081,"Background The alternative prey hypothesis describes the mechanism for apparent competition whereby the mortality of the secondary prey species increases (and population size decreases decreases) by the increased predation by the shared predator if the population size of the primary prey decreases. Apparent competition is a process where the abundance of two co-existing prey species are negatively associated because they share a mutual predator, which negatively affects the abundance of both prey Here, we examined whether alternative prey and/or apparent competition hypothesis can explain the population dynamics and reproductive output of the secondary prey, wild forest reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus fennicus ) in Finland, in a predator-prey community in which moose ( Alces alces ) is the primary prey and the wolf ( Canis lupus ) is the generalist predator. Methods We examined a 22-year time series (1996–2017) to determine how the population size and the calf/female ratio of wild forest reindeer in Eastern Finland were related to the abundances of wolf and moose. Only moose population size was regulated by hunting. Summer predation of wolves on reindeer focuses on calves. We used least squares regression (GLS) models (for handling autocorrelated error structures and resulting pseudo-R 2 s) and generalized linear mixed (GLMs) models (for avoidance of negative predictions) to determine the relationships between abundances. We performed linear and general linear models for the calf/female ratio of reindeer. Results and synthesis The trends in reindeer population size and moose abundance were almost identical: an increase during the first years and then a decrease until the last years of our study period. Wolf population size in turn did not show long-term trends. Change in reindeer population size between consecutive winters was related positively to the calf/female ratio. The calf/female ratio was negatively related to wolf population size, but the reindeer population size was related to the wolf population only when moose abundance was entered as another independent variable. The wolf population was not related to moose abundance even though it is likely to consist the majority of the prey biomass. Because reindeer and moose populations were positively associated, our results seemed to support the alternative prey hypothesis more than the apparent competition hypothesis. However, these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and the primary mechanism is difficult to distinguish as the system is heavily managed by moose hunting. The recovery of wild forest reindeer in eastern Finland probably requires ecosystem management involving both habitat restoration and control of species abundances."

Building a successful long-term relationship can be viewed as a control engineering problem, where the control variable is the effort to be made to keep the relationship alive and well. We introduce a new mathematical model for the effort control problem of a couple in love who wants to stay together forever. The problem can be naturally formulated as a dynamic game in continuous time with nonlinearities. Adopting a dynamic programming approach, a tractable computational formulation of the problem is proposed together with an accompanying algorithm to find numerical solutions of the couple's effort problem. The computational analysis of the model is used to explore feeling trajectories, effort control paths, happiness, and stabilization mechanisms for different types of successful couples. In particular, the simulation analysis provides insight into the pattern of change of both marital quality and effort making in intact marriages and how they are affected by certain level of heterogamy in the couple."

Identifying age- and KOA-related changes to the modular control of gait may provide insight into the neurological mechanisms underlying reduced walking performance in these populations. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if the modular control of walking differs between younger and older adults without KOA and adults with end-stage KOA.Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography data were collected from ten younger (23.5 ± 3.1 years) and ten older (63.5 ± 3.4 years) adults without KOA and ten adults with KOA (64.0 ± 4.0 years) walking at their self-selected speed. Separate non-negative matrix factorizations of 500 bootstrapped samples determined the number of modules required to reconstruct each participant's electromyography. One-way Analysis of Variance tests assessed the effect of group on walking speed and the number of modules. Kendall rank correlations (τb) assessed the association between the number of modules and self-selected walking speed.The number of modules required in the younger adults (3.2 ± 0.4) was greater than in the individuals with KOA (2.3 ± 0.7; p = 0.002), though neither cohorts' required number of modules differed significantly from the unimpaired older adults (2.7 ± 0.5; p ≥ 0.113). A significant association between module number and walking speed was observed (τb = 0.350, p = 0.021) and individuals with KOA walked significantly slower (0.095 ± 0.21 m/s) than younger adults (1.24 ± 0.15 m/s; p = 0.005). Individuals with KOA also exhibited altered module activation patterns and composition (which muscles are associated with each module) compared to unimpaired adults.These findings suggest aging alone may not significantly alter modular control; however, the combined effects of knee osteoarthritis and aging may together impair the modular control of gait."

Among soon-to-be retirees (Study 1), greater cognitive interdependence was associated with seeing partners as more instrumental to one's goals both pre- and post-retirement, anticipating greater goal alignment post-retirement, and having directly involved partners in retirement planning to a greater extent than those relatively lower in cognitive interdependence. Among recent retirees (Study 2), retrospective cognitive interdependence was associated with post-retirement goal alignment and goal instrumentality, and the extent to which they believed they had directly involved their partners in retirement planning. However, it was post-retirement goal alignment that was associated with greater ease of retirement and subjective well-being. Finally, soon-to-be retirees relatively high in cognitive interdependence responded to concerns about their retirement (i.e., goal discordance and high retirement ambivalence) by wanting to involve their partners in their retirement plans to a greater extent (Study 3). These studies highlight the importance of romantic partners across the lifespan, and how partners might influence retirement planning, the transition to retirement, and well-being among recent retirees."
https://openalex.org/W4200128053,"In joint action literature it is often assumed that acting together is driven by pervasive and automatic process of co-representation, that is, representing the co-actor's part of the task in addition to one's own. Much of this research employs joint stimulus-response compatibility tasks varying the stimuli employed or the physical and social relations between participants. In this study we test the robustness of co-representation effects by focusing instead on variation in response modality. Specifically, we implement a mouse-tracking version of a Joint Simon Task in which participants respond by producing continuous movements with a computer mouse rather than pushing discrete buttons. We have three key findings. First, in a replication of an earlier study we show that in a classical individual Simon Task movement trajectories show greater curvature on incongruent trials, paralleling longer response times. Second, this effect largely disappears in a Go-NoGo Simon Task, in which participants respond to only one of the cues and refrain from responding to the other. Third, contrary to previous studies that use button pressing responses, we observe no overall effect in the joint variants of the task. However, we also detect a notable diversity in movement strategies adopted by the participants, with some participants showing the effect on the individual level. Our study casts doubt on the pervasiveness of co-representation, highlights the usefulness of mouse-tracking methodology and emphasizes the need for looking at individual variation in task performance."
https://openalex.org/W4200424793,"Japanese cedar pollinosis is a major seasonal allergy in Japan, and Japanese cypress pollinosis is a growing concern because the cypress pollen season follows the cedar pollen season and cross-reactivity among allergens occurs between these closely related species. Allergens purified from pollen under unspecified collecting conditions can potentially heterogenous allergens profiles and batch to batch variability, and amino acid sequence variants in allergens possibly exist among trees. Polymorphisms have not been investigated for the cypress pollen major allergens, Cha o 1 and Cha o 2. Our aim was to examine the homogeneity of allergen amino acid sequences. DNA sequences of Cha o 1 and Cha o 2 from pollen collected from Chiba and Ibaraki prefectures and from needles of 47 plus trees located at seed orchards in Chiba Prefecture were examined by amplicon sequencing and amino acid substitutions were deduced. Sequence analysis of the pollen samples revealed that eight and seven residues of Cha o 2 were polymorphic, respectively. Thirteen residues in Cha o 2, including those residues identified in pollen, were deduced to be polymorphic for the plus trees. Cha o 2 expressed by the 47 plus trees included amino acid differences when compared with that of isoallergen Cha o 2.0101. No substitution was deduced in Cha o 1 for pollen taken from the two prefectures. One conservative amino acid substitution was deduced in Cha o 1 for the plus trees. Of the 47 plus trees examined, 38 were deduced to express only the isoallergen Cha o 1.0101 isoform, whereas eight trees were heterozygous and a single tree was homozygous for the non-synonymous mutation, which indicates relative uniformity of Cha o 1. Cha o 2 was found to be a heterogeneous allergen which suggests that studies using pollen from different trees may not give the same results."
https://openalex.org/W4200438337,"There is increasing interest in the effect that food environments may have on obesity, particularly through mechanisms related to the marketing and consumption of calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods and sugary beverages. Price promotions, such as temporary price discounts, have been particularly effective in the marketing of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) among consumers. Research has also suggested that the purchasing behavior of consumer groups may be differentially sensitive to price discounts on CSDs, with obese women particularly sensitive. In addition, the intensity of price discount in a person's food environment may also vary across geography and over time. This study examines whether the weight change of obese women, compared to overweight or normal BMI women, is more sensitive to the intensity of price discounts on CSDs in the food environment. This study used longitudinal survey data from 1622 women in the Montreal Neighborhood Networks and Health Aging (MoNNET-HA) Panel. Women were asked to report their height and weight in 2008, 2010 and 2013 in order to calculate women's BMI in 2008 and their change of weight between 2008 and 2013. Women's exposure to an unhealthy food environment was based on the frequency in which their neighborhood food stores placed price discounts on CSDs in 2008. The price discount frequency on CSDs within women's neighborhoods was calculated from Nielsen point-of sales transaction data in 2008 and geocoded to participant's forward sortation area. The prevalence of obesity and overweight among MoNNET-HA female participants was 18.3% in 2008, 19.9% in 2010 and 20.7% in 2013 respectively. Results showed that among obese women, exposure to unhealthy food environments was associated with a 3.25 kilogram (SE = 1.35, p-value = 0.02) weight gain over the five-year study period. Exposure to price discounts on CSDs may disproportionately affect and reinforce weight gain in women who are already obese."
https://openalex.org/W4200567039,"Premature birth is one of the most important factors increasing the risk for brain damage in newborns. Development of an intraventricular hemorrhage in the immature brain is often triggered by fluctuations of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Therefore, monitoring of CBF becomes an important task in clinical care of preterm infants. Mathematical modeling of CBF can be a complementary tool in addition to diagnostic tools in clinical practice and research. The purpose of the present study is an enhancement of the previously developed mathematical model for CBF by a detailed description of apparent blood viscosity and vessel resistance, accounting for inhomogeneous hematocrit distribution in multiscale blood vessel architectures. The enhanced model is applied to our medical database retrospectively collected from the 254 preterm infants with a gestational age of 23-30 weeks. It is shown that by including clinically measured hematocrit in the mathematical model, apparent blood viscosity, vessel resistance, and hence the CBF are strongly affected. Thus, a statistically significant decrease in hematocrit values observed in the group of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage resulted in a statistically significant increase in calculated CBF values."
https://openalex.org/W4205862587,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive cancer usually diagnosed in young women with no effective prognosis prediction model to use. The present study was performed to develop a useful prognostic model for predicting overall survival (OS) for TNBC patients.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) databases were used as training and validation data sets, respectively, in which the gene expression levels and clinical prognostic information of TNBC were collected. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and non-TNBC (NTNBC) were identified with the thresholds of false discovery rate < 0.05 and |log2 Fold Change| > 1. DEGs in AmiGO2 and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were retained for further study. Univariate, multivariate Cox, and logistic regression analysis were conducted for detecting DEG signature with the threshold of log-rank P < 0.05. The prognosis models of mRNA signature, clinical factors were constructed and compared.One five-DEG signature, including CHST4, COCH, CST9, SOX11, and TDGF1 was identified in DEG prognosis model. Stratified analysis showed that the patients aged over 60, with higher pathologic stage (III-IV) and recurrence induced a significantly lower survival rate than those aged below 60, lower pathologic stage and without recurrence. Compared with patients with low-risk scores, those presented high-risk scores demonstrated significantly lower survival rate in the subgroup aged over 60 [HR = 3.780 (1.801-7.933), P < 0.0001]. For patients who obtained a higher pathologic stage and recurrence, high-risk scores were correlated with a significantly lower survival rate than patients with low-risk scores. The five-mRNA signature combined with clinical model (AUC = 0.950) predicted better than single clinical model (AUC = 0.795) or five-mRNA signature model (AUC = 0.823).Our present study identified a prognostic prediction model (combined with five-mRNA signature and clinical factors) for TNBC patients receiving immunotherapy, which will benefit future research and clinical therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4206111160,"Credible estimates suggest that a large number of the nearly 7000 languages in the world could go extinct this century, a prospect with profound cultural, socioeconomic, and political ramifications. Despite its importance, we still have little predictive theory for language dynamics and richness. Critical to the language extinction problem, however, is to understand the dynamics of the number of speakers of languages, the dynamics of language abundance distributions (LADs). Many regional LADs are very similar to the bell-shaped distributions of relative species abundance predicted by neutral theory in ecology. Using the tenets of neutral theory, here we show that LADs can be understood as an equilibrium or disequilibrium between stochastic rates of origination and extinction of languages. However, neutral theory does not fit some regional LADs, which can be explained if the number of speakers has grown systematically faster in some languages than others, due to cultural factors and other non-neutral processes. Only the LADs of Australia and the United States, deviate from a bell-shaped pattern. These deviations are due to the documented higher, non-equilibrium extinction rates of low-abundance languages in these countries."
