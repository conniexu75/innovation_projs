Here we analysed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and other Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes and 4,366 non-diabetic controls. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with type 2 diabetes at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P = 3.9 × 10(-13); odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with type 2 diabetes, and replicated in independent samples (P = 1.1 × 10(-4); OR = 1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at ~50% frequency in Native American samples and ~10% in east Asian, but is rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated that the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neanderthals. The SLC16A11 messenger RNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels. Despite type 2 diabetes having been well studied by genome-wide association studies in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for type 2 diabetes with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism."

These findings suggest that hyperactive retrotransposition of L1 in neurons triggered by environmental and/or genetic risk factors may contribute to the susceptibility and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Mental disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression affect a large proportion of the global population and have a major negative economic impact. Twin, family, and adoption studies indicate the complex involvement of both genetic and environmental factors for these diseases (Keshavan et al., 2011Keshavan M.S. Nasrallah H.A. Tandon R.

Despite their apparent heritability, however, causative genetic factors are mostly unknown except for rare cases of schizophrenia associated with chromosomal abnormalities (Brandon and Sawa, 2011Brandon N.J.

On the other hand, environmental risk factors including prenatal infection (Brown, 2006Brown A.S. Prenatal infection as a risk factor for schizophrenia.Schizophr. Bull. 2006; 32: 200-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and obstetric complications, such as neonatal hypoxia, embryonic ischemia, and gestational toxicosis (Lewis and Murray, 1987Lewis S.W.

Res. 1987; 21: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), are well-established risk factors for schizophrenia. However, it is not clarified how these environmental risk factors interact with genomic factors. Accumulating evidence indicates that genomic DNA in the brain contains distinctive somatic genetic variations compared with nonbrain tissues (Poduri et al., 2013Poduri A. Evrony G.D. Cai X. Walsh C.A. Somatic mutation, genomic variation, and neurological disease.Science. 2013; 341: 1237758Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These genetic signatures include brain-specific somatic mutations (Poduri et al., 2013Poduri A. Evrony G.D. Cai X. Walsh C.A.

Gage F.H. Generation of neuronal variability and complexity.Nature. 2006; 441: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These observed somatic variations are hypothesized to contribute to the generation of functionally diversified brain cells (Muotri and Gage, 2006Muotri A.R. Gage F.H. Generation of neuronal variability and complexity.Nature. 2006; 441: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Among the known retrotransposons, only long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (L1) has autonomous retrotransposition activity. Full-length L1 elements include a 5′ UTR, two open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3′ UTR (Figure 1A). Encoded products from the ORFs contain activities required for retrotransposition and are employed in the insertion of new L1 copies as well as nonautonomous retrotransposons such as Alu and SVA (Cordaux and Batzer, 2009Cordaux R. Batzer M.A. The impact of retrotransposons on human genome evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that engineered L1 has retrotransposition activity in neural progenitor cells from rat hippocampus (Muotri et al., 2005Muotri A.R. Chu V.T. Marchetto M.C. Deng W. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. Somatic mosaicism in neuronal precursor cells mediated by L1 retrotransposition.Nature. 2005; 435: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), human fetal brain (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O’Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and human embryonic stem cells (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O’Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These in vitro findings were confirmed in human L1 transgenic mice in vivo (Muotri et al., 2005Muotri A.R. Chu V.T. Marchetto M.C. Deng W. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. Somatic mosaicism in neuronal precursor cells mediated by L1 retrotransposition.Nature. 2005; 435: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Adult human brain cells also showed increased L1 copy number compared with nonbrain tissues (Coufal et al., 2009Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Yeo G.W. Mu Y. Lovci M.T. Morell M. O’Shea K.S. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells.Nature. 2009; 460: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Moreover, retrotransposition is active in MeCP2 mouse models and patients with Rett syndrome, indicating a role for this mechanism in this Mendelian disorder (Muotri et al., 2010Muotri A.R. Marchetto M.C. Coufal N.G. Oefner R. Yeo G. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in neurons is modulated by MeCP2.Nature. 2010; 468: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest the hypothesis that L1 retrotransposition may also be involved in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. In this study, we quantified L1 copy number in genomic DNA derived from postmortem brains of patients with major mental disorders. We report significant increases of L1 content in the prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. To confirm this finding, we quantified L1 copy number in neurons and nonneurons from a second, independent patient cohort using NeuN-based cell sorting (Iwamoto et al., 2011Iwamoto K. Bundo M. Ueda J. Oldham M.C. Ukai W. Hashimoto E. Saito T. Geschwind D.H. Kato T.

We next quantified L1 copy number in the animal models that are known to disturb early neural development. These included maternal polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly-I:C) injection in mice (Meyer and Feldon, 2012Meyer U. Feldon J.

Stress in puberty unmasks latent neuropathological consequences of prenatal immune activation in mice.Science. 2013; 339: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and chronic epidermal growth factor (EGF) injection to infant macaques (Nawa et al., 2000Nawa H. Takahashi M. Patterson P.H. Cytokine and growth factor involvement in schizophrenia—support for the developmental model.Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We found that genomic DNA of brains from both animal models showed increased L1 copy number, addressing the importance of environmental factors during perinatal and postnatal stages. We also found that the increased L1 copy number in the neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of schizophrenia patients with 22q11 deletion. The 22q11 deletion is a well-defined genetic factor and is one of the highest risk factors for schizophrenia, affecting about 1%–2% of schizophrenia patients (Karayiorgou et al., 2010Karayiorgou M. Simon T.J. Gogos J.A. 22q11.2 microdeletions: linking DNA structural variation to brain dysfunction and schizophrenia.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 402-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Finally, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of brain and liver in controls and patients. Comparison of brain-specific L1 insertion sites revealed that brain-specific L1 insertion in patients is enriched in or near genes related to synaptic function and neuropsychiatric diseases. These results suggest that increased retrotransposition of L1 in neurons, which was triggered by genetic component and/or environmental factors at the early neural development, could contribute to the susceptibility and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We used postmortem prefrontal cortex samples of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression as well as control subjects for analysis in set I. The demographic variables are summarized in Figure 1B. We quantified L1 copy number of postmortem prefrontal cortex and liver in each subject by quantitative RT-PCR with two different internal controls, which were designed for human endogenous retrovirus (HERVH) and alpha-satellite (SATA). We found a significant increase in the brain L1ORF2 content in patients with schizophrenia (Figure 1C). A tendency toward copy number increase was also observed in mood disorders and in other L1 probes in schizophrenia (Figure S1 available online). Somatic L1 retrotransposition was primarily found in neuronal cells (Kuwabara et al., 2009Kuwabara T. Hsieh J. Muotri A. Yeo G. Warashina M. Lie D.C. Moore L. Nakashima K. Asashima M. Gage F.H. Wnt-mediated activation of NeuroD1 and retro-elements during adult neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). To confirm the increased brain L1 copy number in schizophrenia and address whether this copy number increase is due to alteration of the neuronal genome, we examined an independent prefrontal cortex sample set (set II). We separated neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei from frozen brains using NeuN-based cell sorting (Figure 1D) (Iwamoto et al., 2011Iwamoto K. Bundo M. Ueda J. Oldham M.C. Ukai W. Hashimoto E. Saito T. Geschwind D.H. Kato T. Neurons show distinctive DNA methylation profile and higher interindividual variations compared with non-neurons.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). NeuN is expressed in vertebrate neurons, and its antibody can be used for labeling neuronal nuclei (Mullen et al., 1992Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. NeuN, a neuronal specific nuclear protein in vertebrates.Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We quantified L1ORF2 copy number of genomic DNA derived from neurons (NeuN-positive nuclei) and nonneurons (NeuN-negative nuclei) and then calculated the neuron-to-nonneuron ratio. We found a significant increase of neuronal L1ORF2 content in schizophrenia in two different internal controls (Figure 1E). The copy number of the other L1 probes tested also showed significant increase in schizophrenia compared to controls in SATA-normalized data, and similar tendency toward copy number increase was observed in HERVH-normalized data (Figure S1 and data not shown). We assessed the effect of confounding factors on L1 content (Table S1). Among the demographic variables tested, sample pH showed a weak correlation with L1ORF2 content in set II but not in set I. Several variables also showed weak correlations, but none showed consistency across the different internal control probes or across the two different sample sets. To consider the possible effect of antipsychotics, we examined L1 copy number in a human neuroblastoma cell line cultured with haloperidol or risperidone for 8 days. Both antipsychotics did not modify the L1 copy number at their low or high concentrations (Figure S2). Together with the fact that the lifetime intake of antipsychotics, which was estimated as fluphenazine milligram equivalents, did not correlate with L1 copy number in both brain sets (Table S1), medication status did not affect our results. To assess the potential roles of environmental factors on increased L1 copy number, we employed two different animal models that mimic environmental risk factors that affect early neural development. They included maternal poly-I:C injection in mice and chronic EGF injection to neonatal macaques. The poly-I:C, which mimics viral double-stranded RNA, injection to pregnant mice induces elevated maternal immune activation, and the offspring is known to show schizophrenia-like behavioral alterations such as impairments of prepulse inhibition and social behavior at the later stage (Meyer and Feldon, 2012Meyer U. Feldon J. To poly(I:C) or not to poly(I:C): advancing preclinical schizophrenia research through the use of prenatal immune activation models.Neuropharmacology. 2012; 62: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Pregnant mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of poly-I:C. L1 copy number in the prefrontal cortex of offspring was tested at postnatal day 21. We found that significant elevation of L1 copy number at all the tested probes compared to controls (Figure 2A). We then examined the L1 copy number in macaques treated with EGF during neonatal period. Perinatal and postnatal perturbation of EGF is known to evoke schizophrenia-like phenotypes, including deficits in prepulse inhibition, latent inhibition, social interaction, and working memory, in adulthood (Nawa et al., 2009Nawa H. Someya T. Sakai M. A novel schizophrenia model established by subcutaneously injecting a cytokine to a cynomolgus monkey neonate.Schizophr. Bull. 2009; 35: 252Google Scholar, Nawa et al., 2000Nawa H. Takahashi M. Patterson P.H. Cytokine and growth factor involvement in schizophrenia—support for the developmental model.Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).The neonatal macaques (n = 2) subcutaneously received EGF for seven times over 11 days. After 4 and 7 years from treatment, L1 copy number in the prefrontal cortex was tested. In addition, chronic haloperidol-treated macaques (n = 3) were also tested. Due to unavailability of other tissues, we isolated nonneuronal nuclei from frozen white matter and calculated the grey matter-to-nonneuron ratio in each subject. Although statistical approach could not be applied, we observed increase of L1 copy number in EGF-treated macaques, but not in the haloperidol-treated macaques, compared to controls (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that early environmental factors play important roles in the L1 content in the brain. We further confirmed that chronic haloperidol treatment did not influence L1 copy number in this model. We next assessed the importance of genetic risk factor on the L1 copy number in brain. We quantified L1 copy number in the neurons derived from iPS cells of schizophrenia patients with 22q11 deletion (n = 2) as well as controls (n = 2) (Figure S3). The iPS cells were established from the fibroblasts according to the previously developed method (Imaizumi et al., 2012Imaizumi Y. Okada Y. Akamatsu W. Koike M. Kuzumaki N. Hayakawa H. Nihira T. Kobayashi T. Ohyama M. Sato S. et al.Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with increased oxidative stress and α-synuclein accumulation in PARK2 iPSC-derived neurons and postmortem brain tissue.Mol.

Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors.Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13487) Google Scholar; M.T., unpublished data). To estimate the L1 copy number, we used two independently established iPS cell lines per patient. After induction of neuronal cells (Imaizumi et al., 2012Imaizumi Y. Okada Y. Akamatsu W. Koike M. Kuzumaki N. Hayakawa H. Nihira T. Kobayashi T. Ohyama M. Sato S. et al.Mitochondrial dysfunction associated with increased oxidative stress and α-synuclein accumulation in PARK2 iPSC-derived neurons and postmortem brain tissue.Mol. Brain. 2012; 5: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we isolated neuronal nuclei by NeuN-based sorting (Figure S3). We then examined L1 copy number and calculated the neuron-to-nonneuron ratio. Compared to controls, we observed consistent increase of L1 copy number in iPS cell-derived neurons of patients with schizophrenia with 22q11 deletion (Figure 3). These results suggest that the well-defined strong genetic risk factor also plays an important role in the L1 content in the brain. We next performed WGS of brain and liver DNA from same subjects by self-assembling DNA nanoarray technology (Drmanac et al., 2010Drmanac R. Sparks A.B. Callow M.J. Halpern A.L. Burns N.L. Kermani B.G. Carnevali P. Nazarenko I. Nilsen G.B. Yeung G. et al.Human genome sequencing using unchained base reads on self-assembling DNA nanoarrays.Science. 2010; 327: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). For this experiment, schizophrenia patients (n = 3) and control subjects (n = 3) were selected to match age, PMI, gender, brain pH, and race from set I. Selected patients exhibited increased L1 content by quantitative RT-PCR assay, compared to average L1 content of the controls and selected control subjects. The WGS metrics and identified variations were summarized in Table S2. Distribution of the detected mobile elements was almost equal between the tissues and across subjects, and over the half of the identified elements was related to the L1-Hs (Figure S4). Among the detected mobile element insertion sites in each sequenced sample, we first identified brain-specific L1 insertions in each subject (Tables S2 and S3). Although the total number of brain-specific L1 insertion tended to be higher in schizophrenia patients, this was not statistically significant, most likely due to the limited sample size and high interindividual variation. We then compared genomic locations of the insertion sites of brain-specific L1 between patients and controls (Figure 4A). The inter-to-intragenic L1 insertion ratio as well as exonic-to-intronic L1 insertion ratio did not differ between patients and controls. We then compared the affected genes by brain-specific L1 insertion by gene ontology approach. This analysis revealed that the number of enriched terms is higher in schizophrenia than controls, in spite that the number of brain-specific L1 insertions did not significantly differ. We found that neuronal function-related terms such as synapse and protein phosphorylation are clearly overrepresented in schizophrenia compared to controls (Figure 4B). In addition, disease-association analysis revealed that affected genes in patients are specifically enriched in terms related to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, while those in controls are enriched in nonneuropsychiatric terms such as height and scoliosis (Figure 4C). These results were consistently confirmed when we used less stringent definition of brain-specific L1 insertion (Figure S4). In addition, enrichment of the L1-inserted genes to the terms related to neuropsychiatric disorders in schizophrenia was also detected by the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (Figure S4). We report that the neuronal genome of schizophrenia contains higher copy number of a retrotransposon, L1. To validate this finding, we utilized iPS cells from patients with schizophrenia carrying the 22q11 deletion and observed an increase in L1 copy number in iPS cell-derived neurons. Moreover, using WGS, we found that L1 preferentially inserted into genes related to synaptic functions and schizophrenia. Animal model studies showed that environmental factors related to infection or inflammation that disturbs early neurodevelopmental processes increase L1 copy number in the brain. Collectively, these results suggest that hyperactive L1 retrotransposition into critical genes during neural development, triggered by genetic and/or environmental factors, contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Our results significantly expand the range of neuropsychiatric illnesses linked to aberrant L1 retrotransposition, from Mendelian disease patients with MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome (Muotri et al., 2010Muotri A.R. Marchetto M.C. Coufal N.G. Oefner R. Yeo G. Nakashima K. Gage F.H. L1 retrotransposition in neurons is modulated by MeCP2.Nature. 2010; 468: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and ATM mutations in ataxia telangiectasia (Coufal et al., 2011Coufal N.G. Garcia-Perez J.L. Peng G.E. Marchetto M.C. Muotri A.R. Mu Y. Carson C.T. Macia A. Moran J.V. Gage F.H. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) modulates long interspersed element-1 (L1) retrotransposition in human neural stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 20382-20387Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to schizophrenia, a complex mental disorder. The observed increase of L1 content in schizophrenia was not due to, or modulated by, biological or experimental artifacts, because changes were measured in two independent patient cohorts and each result was confirmed with two different internal controls. Although the L1 region showing significant increases differed between the two brain sets, this is attributable to cohort differences amplified by the strict threshold we employed. Actually, a significant increase of L1 content was widely observed in all probes in the SATA-normalized data in set II, where neuronal L1 copy number was directly examined (Figure S1). In addition, from the data analysis utilizing lifetime intake of antipsychotics of patients, and from the cell culture and macaque experiments, we conclude that antipsychotics do not affect L1 copy number in the brain. A significant increase was also observed in patients with mood disorders in one internal control in set I (Figure 1C). Future work will clarify whether there are L1 content increases in other mental disorders using larger and/or stratified patient cohorts. L1 retrotransposition has been detected during adult neurogenesis in the rat hippocampus, indicating that neural progenitor cells retain retrotransposition activity even in adult stages (Muotri et al., 2009Muotri A.R. Zhao C. Marchetto M.C. Gage F.H. Environmental influence on L1 retrotransposons in the adult hippocampus.Hippocampus. 2009; 19: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, we analyzed potential confounding factors, including age, age of onset, and duration of illness, and did not observe any significant correlation with L1 copy number in the brain. The transcript level of L1 in adult brain sample was also increased in patients compared to controls (data not shown). However, elevated expression is unlikely to contribute to increase of L1 copy number in patients, as significant increase of L1 transcripts was detected only in the 5′ region of L1 such as 5′ UTR and ORF1. These results suggest that L1 copy number does not globally increase with aging and that the variation of L1 copy number in patients is probably confined to early neurodevelopmental stages, at least in the prefrontal cortex. This prediction would be consistent with the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia, where abnormalities during critical early periods of brain development may trigger the later appearance of clinical symptoms (Bloom, 1993Bloom F.E.

https://openalex.org/W1994170225,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great promise for cell therapy as a source of diverse differentiated cell types. One key bottleneck to realizing such potential is allogenic immune rejection of hESC-derived cells by recipients. Here, we optimized humanized mice (Hu-mice) reconstituted with a functional human immune system that mounts a vigorous rejection of hESCs and their derivatives. We established knockin hESCs that constitutively express CTLA4-Ig and PD-L1 before and after differentiation, denoted CP hESCs. We then demonstrated that allogenic CP hESC-derived teratomas, fibroblasts, and cardiomyocytes are immune protected in Hu-mice, while cells derived from parental hESCs are effectively rejected. Expression of both CTLA4-Ig, which disrupts T cell costimulatory pathways, and PD-L1, which activates T cell inhibitory pathway, is required to confer immune protection, as neither was sufficient on their own. These findings are instrumental for developing a strategy to protect hESC-derived cells from allogenic immune responses without requiring systemic immune suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2068510638,"There are no clinically relevant treatments available that improve function in the growing population of very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' gestation) with neonatal brain injury. Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) is a common finding in these children and results in chronic neurodevelopmental impairments. As shown recently, failure in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation contributes to DWMI. We demonstrated previously that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an important role in oligodendrocyte development. Here we examine whether enhanced EGFR signalling stimulates the endogenous response of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells during a critical period after brain injury, and promotes cellular and behavioural recovery in the developing brain. Using an established mouse model of very preterm brain injury, we demonstrate that selective overexpression of human EGFR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or the administration of intranasal heparin-binding EGF immediately after injury decreases oligodendroglia death, enhances generation of new oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells and promotes functional recovery. Furthermore, these interventions diminish ultrastructural abnormalities and alleviate behavioural deficits on white-matter-specific paradigms. Inhibition of EGFR signalling with a molecularly targeted agent used for cancer therapy demonstrates that EGFR activation is an important contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration and functional recovery after DWMI. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that targeting EGFR in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at a specific time after injury is clinically feasible and potentially applicable to the treatment of premature children with white matter injury."
https://openalex.org/W1965173359,"The orchestration of brain function requires complex gene regulatory networks that are modulated, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs). These noncoding RNAs associate with argonaute (Ago) proteins in order to direct posttranscriptional gene suppression via base pairing with target transcripts. In order to better understand how miRNAs contribute to human-specialized brain processes and neurological phenotypes, identifying their targets is of paramount importance. Here, we address the latter by profiling Ago2:RNA interactions using HITS-CLIP to generate a transcriptome-wide map of miRNA binding sites in human brain. We uncovered ∼ 7,000 stringent Ago2 binding sites that are highly enriched for conserved sequences corresponding to abundant brain miRNAs. This interactome points to functional miRNA:target pairs across >3,000 genes and represents a valuable resource for accelerating our understanding of miRNA functions in brain. We demonstrate the utility of this map for exploring clinically relevant miRNA binding sites that may facilitate the translation of genetic studies of complex neuropsychiatric diseases into therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2067305429,"Neil Hunter and colleagues show that the HEI10 ubiquitin ligase regulates meiotic recombination by limiting the colocalization of RNF212 and MSH4-MSH5 to future crossover sites. At later stages, they find that HEI10 accumulates stably at designated crossover sites and facilitates clearance of RNF212 and MSH4-MSH5 complexes to promote the final steps of meiotic recombination. Crossover recombination facilitates the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis1,2. In mammals, poorly characterized regulatory processes ensure that every pair of chromosomes obtains at least one crossover, even though most recombination sites yield non-crossovers3. Designation of crossovers involves selective localization of the SUMO ligase RNF212 to a minority of recombination sites, where it stabilizes pertinent factors such as MutSγ (ref. 4). Here we show that the ubiquitin ligase HEI10 (also called CCNB1IP1)5,6 is essential for this crossover/non-crossover differentiation process. In HEI10-deficient mice, RNF212 localizes to most recombination sites, and dissociation of both RNF212 and MutSγ from chromosomes is blocked. Consequently, recombination is impeded, and crossing over fails. In wild-type mice, HEI10 accumulates at designated crossover sites, suggesting that it also has a late role in implementing crossing over. As with RNF212, dosage sensitivity for HEI10 indicates that it is a limiting factor for crossing over. We suggest that SUMO and ubiquitin have antagonistic roles during meiotic recombination that are balanced to effect differential stabilization of recombination factors at crossover and non-crossover sites."
https://openalex.org/W2152845123,"Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are multifactorial disease processes in which bacteria may play a role either in infection or stimulation of the inflammatory process. Rhinosinusitis has been historically studied with culture-based techniques, which have implicated several common pathogens in disease states. More recently, the NIH Human Microbiome Project has examined the microbiome at a number of accessible body sites, and demonstrated differences among healthy and diseased patients. Recent DNA-based sinus studies have suggested that healthy sinuses are not sterile, as was previously believed, but the normal sinonasal microbiome has yet to be thoroughly examined. Middle meatus swab specimens were collected from 28 consecutive patients presenting with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Bacterial colonization was assessed in these specimens using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. All subjects were positive for bacterial colonization of the middle meatus. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were the most prevalent and abundant microorganisms detected. Rich and diverse bacterial assemblages are present in the sinonasal cavity in the normal state, including opportunistic pathogens typically found in the nasopharynx. This work helps establish a baseline for understanding how the sinonasal microbiome may impact diseases of the upper airways."
https://openalex.org/W1993686079,"Cytosine residues in mammalian DNA occur in five forms: cytosine (C), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). The ten-eleven translocation (Tet) dioxygenases convert 5mC to 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC in three consecutive, Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxidation reactions. The Tet family of dioxygenases is widely distributed across the tree of life, including in the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. The genome of Naegleria encodes homologues of mammalian DNA methyltransferase and Tet proteins. Here we study biochemically and structurally one of the Naegleria Tet-like proteins (NgTet1), which shares significant sequence conservation (approximately 14% identity or 39% similarity) with mammalian Tet1. Like mammalian Tet proteins, NgTet1 acts on 5mC and generates 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC. The crystal structure of NgTet1 in complex with DNA containing a 5mCpG site revealed that NgTet1 uses a base-flipping mechanism to access 5mC. The DNA is contacted from the minor groove and bent towards the major groove. The flipped 5mC is positioned in the active-site pocket with planar stacking contacts, Watson-Crick polar hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions specific for 5mC. The sequence conservation between NgTet1 and mammalian Tet1, including residues involved in structural integrity and functional significance, suggests structural conservation across phyla."
https://openalex.org/W1984478493,"Current models of how animals estimate motion involve correlations between pairs of points in space and time. Here the authors show that both fly and human visual systems can encode the direction and contrast polarity of moving edges using three-point correlations, and that this enhances motion estimation accuracy. Sighted animals extract motion information from visual scenes by processing spatiotemporal patterns of light falling on the retina. The dominant models for motion estimation exploit intensity correlations only between pairs of points in space and time. Moving natural scenes, however, contain more complex correlations. We found that fly and human visual systems encode the combined direction and contrast polarity of moving edges using triple correlations that enhance motion estimation in natural environments. Both species extracted triple correlations with neural substrates tuned for light or dark edges, and sensitivity to specific triple correlations was retained even as light and dark edge motion signals were combined. Thus, both species separately process light and dark image contrasts to capture motion signatures that can improve estimation accuracy. This convergence argues that statistical structures in natural scenes have greatly affected visual processing, driving a common computational strategy over 500 million years of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2054659610,"Several studies have brought about increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that miRNAs play a pivotal role in multiple processes of carcinogenesis, including cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the potential role of miR-31 in colorectal cancer (CRC) aggressiveness and its underlying mechanisms. We found that miR-31 increased in CRC cells originated from metastatic foci and human primary CRC tissues with lymph node metastases. Furthermore, the high-level expression of miR-31 was significantly associated with a more aggressive and poor prognostic phenotype of patients with CRC (p < 0.05). The stable over-expression of miR-31 in CRC cells was sufficient to promote cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. It facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo too. Further studies showed that miR-31 can directly bind to the 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) of SATB2 mRNA and subsequently repress both the mRNA and protein expressions of SATB2. Ectopic expression of SATB2 by transiently transfected with pCAG-SATB2 vector encoding the entire SATB2 coding sequence could reverse the effects of miR-31 on CRC tumorigenesis and progression. In addition, ectopic over-expression of miR-31 in CRC cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our results illustrated that the up-regulation of miR-31 played an important role in CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo through direct repressing SATB2, suggesting a potential application of miR-31 in prognosis prediction and therapeutic application in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2034105406,"Increased muscle activation during whole-body vibration (WBV) is mainly ascribed to a complex spinal and supraspinal neurophysiological mechanism termed the tonic vibration reflex (TVR). However, TVR has not been experimentally demonstrated during low-frequency WBV, therefore this investigation aimed to determine the expression of TVR during WBV. Whilst seated, eight healthy males were exposed to either vertical WBV applied to the leg via the plantar-surface of the foot, or Achilles tendon vibration (ATV) at 25 Hz and 50 Hz for 70s. Ankle plantar-flexion force, tri-axial accelerations at the shank and vibration source, and surface EMG activity of m. soleus (SOL) and m. tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded from the unloaded and passively loaded leg to simulate body mass supported during standing. Plantar flexion force was similarly augmented by WBV and ATV and increased over time in a load- and frequency dependent fashion. SOL and TA EMG amplitudes increased over time in all conditions independently of vibration mode. 50 Hz WBV and ATV resulted in greater muscle activation than 25 Hz in SOL when the shank was loaded and in TA when the shank was unloaded despite the greater transmission of vertical acceleration from source to shank with 25 Hz and WBV, especially during loading. Low-amplitude WBV of the unloaded and passively loaded leg produced slow tonic muscle contraction and plantar-flexion force increase of similar magnitudes to those induced by Achilles tendon vibration at the same frequencies. This study provides the first experimental evidence supporting the TVR as a plausible mechanism underlying the neuromuscular response to whole-body vibration."
https://openalex.org/W2012950895,"It is becoming increasingly evident that interspecific hybridization is a common event in phytophthora evolution. Yet, the fundamental processes underlying interspecific hybridization and the consequences for its ecological fitness and distribution are not well understood. We studied hybridization events in phytophthora clade 8b. This is a cold-tolerant group of plant pathogenic oomycetes in which six host-specific species have been described that mostly attack winter-grown vegetables. Hybrid characterization was done by sequencing and cloning of two nuclear (ITS and Ypt1) and two mitochondrial loci (Cox1 and Nadh1) combined with DNA content estimation using flow cytometry. Three different mtDNA haplotypes were recovered among the presumed hybrid isolates, dividing the hybrids into three types, with different parental species involved. In the nuclear genes, additivity, i.e. the presence of two alleles coming from different parents, was detected. Hybrid isolates showed large variations in DNA content, which was positively correlated with the additivity in nuclear loci, indicating allopolyploid hybridization followed by a process of diploidization. Moreover, indications of homeologous recombination were found in the hybrids by cloning ITS products. The hybrid isolates have been isolated from a range of hosts that have not been reported previously for clade 8b species, indicating that they have novel pathogenic potential. Next to this, DNA content measurements of the non-hybrid clade 8b species suggest that polyploidy is a common feature of this clade. We hypothesize that interspecific hybridization and polyploidy are two linked phenomena in phytophthora, and that these processes might play an important and ongoing role in the evolution of this genus."
https://openalex.org/W2093585592,"We used RNAseq to generate a comprehensive transcriptome of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) over the course of a year in the naturally hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. During hibernation ground squirrels do not feed and use fat stored in White Adipose Tissue (WAT) as their primary source of fuel. Stored lipid is consumed at high rates by BAT to generate heat at specific points during the hibernation season. The highest rate of BAT activity occurs during periodic arousals from hypothermic torpor bouts, referred to as Interbout Arousals (IBAs). IBAs are characterized by whole body re-warming (from 5 to 37 °C) in 2-3 hours, and provide a unique opportunity to determine the genes responsible for the highly efficient lipid oxidation and heat generation that drives the arousal process. Illumina HighSeq sequencing identified 14,573 distinct BAT mRNAs and quantified their levels at four points: active ground squirrels in April and October, and hibernating animals during both torpor and IBA. Based on significant changes in mRNA levels across the four collection points, 2,083 genes were shown to be differentially expressed. In addition to providing detail on the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, and genes involved in beta-adrenergic and lipolytic pathways, we identified differentially expressed genes encoding various transcription factors and other regulatory proteins which may play critical roles in high efficiency fat catabolism, non-shivering thermogenesis, and transitions into and out of the torpid state."
https://openalex.org/W2012031864,"Background Kinesin family member 4A (KIF4A), a microtubule-based motor protein, was implicated in regulation of chromosomal structure and kinetochore microtubule dynamics. Considering the functions of KIF4A, we assumed that KIF4A is involved in progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) via activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, little is known about the relevance of KIF4A in the behavior of OSCC. We investigated the KIF4A expression status and its functional mechanisms in OSCC. Methods The KIF4A expression levels in seven OSCC-derived cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses. Using a KIF4A knockdown model, we assessed the expression of (SAC)-related molecules (BUB1, MAD2, CDC20, and cyclin B1), cell-cycle, and cellular proliferation. In addition to in vitro data, the clinical correlation between the KIF4A expression levels in primary OSCCs (n = 106 patients) and the clinicopathologic status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) also were evaluated. Results KIF4A mRNA and protein were up-regulated significantly (P < 0.05) in seven OSCC-derived cells compared with human normal oral keratinocytes. In the KIF4A knockdown cells, SAC activation was observed via increased BUB1 expression on the kinetochores, appropriate kinetochore localization of MAD2, down-regulation of CDC20, up-regulation of cyclin B1, and cell-cycle arrested at G2/M phase. The results showed that cellular proliferation of KIF4A knockdown cells decreased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with control cells. IHC showed that KIF4A expression in primary OSCCs was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than in the normal oral counterparts and that KIF4A-positive OSCCs were correlated closely (P < 0.05) with tumoral size. Conclusions Our results proposed for the first time that KIF4A controls cellular proliferation via SAC activation. Therefore, KIF4A might be a key regulator for tumoral progression in OSCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2084528616,"The hematopoietic system sustains regeneration throughout life by balancing self-renewal and differentiation. To stay poised for mature blood production, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain low-level expression of lineage-associated genes, a process termed lineage priming. Here, we modulated expression levels of Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins to ask whether lineage priming affects self-renewal of human HSCs. We found that lentiviral overexpression of ID proteins in cord blood HSCs biases myeloerythroid commitment at the expense of lymphoid differentiation. Conversely, reducing ID2 expression levels increases lymphoid potential. Mechanistically, ID2 inhibits the transcription factor E47 to attenuate B-lymphoid priming in HSCs and progenitors. Strikingly, ID2 overexpression also results in a 10-fold expansion of HSCs in serial limiting dilution assays, indicating that early lymphoid transcription factors antagonize human HSC self-renewal. The relationship between lineage priming and self-renewal can be exploited to increase expansion of transplantable human HSCs and points to broader implications for other stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2001205747,"Background The potential mechanisms of microRNA-1 (miR-1) in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of miR-1 on the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) in a right atrial tachypacing model and to elucidate the potential mechanisms. Methods and Results QRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of the miR-1, KCNE1, and KCNB2 genes after 1-week of right atrial tachypacing in New Zealand white rabbits. The AERP was measured using a programmable multichannel stimulator, and atrial fibrillation was induced by burst stimulation in vivo. The slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) and AERP in atrial cells were measured by whole cell patch clamp in vitro. Right atrial tachypacing upregulated miR-1 expression and downregulated KCNE1 and KCNB2 in this study, while the AERP was decreased and the atrial IKs increased. The downregulation of KCNE1 and KCNB2 levels was greater when miR-1 was further upregulated through in vivo lentiviral infection. Electrophysiological tests indicated a shorter AERP, a great increase in the IKs and a higher atrial fibrillation inducibility. In addition, similar results were found when the levels of KCNE1 and KCNB2 were downregulated by small interfering RNA while keeping miR-1 level unaltered. Conversely, knockdown of miR-1 by anti-miR-1 inhibitor oligonucleotides alleviated the downregulation of KCNE1 and KCNB2, the shortening of AERP, and the increase in the IKs. KCNE1 and KCNB2 as the target genes for miR-1 were confirmed by luciferase activity assay. Conclusions These results indicate that miR-1 accelerates right atrial tachypacing-induced AERP shortening by targeting potassium channel genes, which further suggests that miR-1 plays an important role in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation and exhibits significant clinical relevance as a potential therapeutic target for atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2042739306,"The authors show that a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, DH-CBD, can rescue exaggerated acoustic startle phenotypes caused by startle disease–causing point mutations in the glycine receptor (GlyR) α1 subunit. Homomeric and presynaptic GlyRs showed significant impairment as a result of these mutations, which was selectively rescued by DH-CBD. Although postsynaptic glycine receptors (GlyRs) as αβ heteromers attract considerable research attention, little is known about the role of presynaptic GlyRs, likely α homomers, in diseases. Here, we demonstrate that dehydroxylcannabidiol (DH-CBD), a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid, can rescue GlyR functional deficiency and exaggerated acoustic and tactile startle responses in mice bearing point mutations in α1 GlyRs that are responsible for a hereditary startle-hyperekplexia disease. The GlyRs expressed as α1 homomers either in HEK-293 cells or at presynaptic terminals of the calyceal synapses in the auditory brainstem are more vulnerable than heteromers to hyperekplexia mutation–induced impairment. Homomeric mutants are more sensitive to DH-CBD than are heteromers, suggesting presynaptic GlyRs as a primary target. Consistent with this idea, DH-CBD selectively rescues impaired presynaptic GlyR activity and diminished glycine release in the brainstem and spinal cord of hyperekplexic mutant mice. Thus, presynaptic α1 GlyRs emerge as a potential therapeutic target for dominant hyperekplexia disease and other diseases with GlyR deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1964101972,"Background Recent obesity prevention initiatives focus on healthy neighborhood design, but most research examines neighborhood food retail and physical activity (PA) environments in isolation. We estimated joint, interactive, and cumulative impacts of neighborhood food retail and PA environment characteristics on body mass index (BMI) throughout early adulthood. Methods and Findings We used cohort data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study [n=4,092; Year 7 (24-42 years, 1992-1993) followed over 5 exams through Year 25 (2010-2011); 12,921 person-exam observations], with linked time-varying geographic information system-derived neighborhood environment measures. Using regression with fixed effects for individuals, we modeled time-lagged BMI as a function of food and PA resource density (counts per population) and neighborhood development intensity (a composite density score). We controlled for neighborhood poverty, individual-level sociodemographics, and BMI in the prior exam; and included significant interactions between neighborhood measures and by sex. Using model coefficients, we simulated BMI reductions in response to single and combined neighborhood improvements. Simulated increase in supermarket density (from 25th to 75th percentile) predicted inter-exam reduction in BMI of 0.09 kg/m2 [estimate (95% CI): -0.09 (-0.16, -0.02)]. Increasing commercial PA facility density predicted BMI reductions up to 0.22 kg/m2 in men, with variation across other neighborhood features [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.14 (-0.29, 0.01) to -0.22 (-0.37, -0.08)]. Simultaneous increases in supermarket and commercial PA facility density predicted inter-exam BMI reductions up to 0.31 kg/m2 in men [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.23 (-0.39, -0.06) to -0.31 (-0.47, -0.15)] but not women. Reduced fast food restaurant and convenience store density and increased public PA facility density and neighborhood development intensity did not predict reductions in BMI. Conclusions Findings suggest that improvements in neighborhood food retail or PA environments may accumulate to reduce BMI, but some neighborhood changes may be less beneficial to women."

Both LR-HPV and HR-HPV were significantly associated with all cytological abnormalities. Presence of TV was associated with LR- and HR-HPV, ASC-US and HSIL, but not with other abnormalities. All women with TV and HSIL also had HR-HPV, while the latter was present in only 59% of women with TV and ASC-US. Amongst HPV negative women, TV was found in 1.3% of women with ASC-US, but only in 0.03% of women with normal cytology (OR 4.2, CL95% 2.1-8.6). In HR-HPV positive women, presence of TV increased the likelihood of cytological abnormalities somewhat (P=0.05), mainly due to an increase in ASC-US and LSIL, but not HSIL.We conclude that TV infection is associated with both LR and HR-HPV infection of the cervix, as well as with ASC-US and HSIL. TV is a concomitant STI, but is not thought to be a co-factor in the causation of HSIL and cervical cancer. However, TV may cause false positive diagnoses of ASC-US."

Here we present baseline data from the first 20 years of an individually based study of this species, conducted at the Dzanga Clearing, Central African Republic. A total of 3,128 elephants were identified over the 20-year study (1,244 adults; 675 females, 569 males). It took approximately four years for the majority of elephants visiting the clearing to be identified, but new elephants entered the clearing every year of the study. The study population was relatively stable, varying from 1,668 to 1,864 individuals (including juveniles and infants), with increasingly fewer males than females over time. The age-class distribution for females remained qualitatively unchanged between 1995 and 2010, while the proportion of adult males decreased from 20% to 10%, likely reflecting increased mortality. Visitation patterns by individuals were highly variable, with some elephants visiting monthly while others were ephemeral users with visits separated by multiple years. The number of individuals in the clearing at any time varied between 40 and 100 individuals, and there was little evidence of a seasonal pattern in this variation. The number of elephants entering the clearing together (defined here as a social group) averaged 1.49 (range 1–12) for males and 2.67 (range 1–14) for females. This collation of 20 years of intensive forest elephant monitoring provides the first detailed, long term look at the ecology of bai visitation for this species, offering insight to the ecological significance and motivation for bai use, social behavior, and threats to forest elephants. We discuss likely drivers (rainfall, compression, illegal killing, etc.) influencing bai visitation rates.

https://openalex.org/W1974378005,"Background A reduced exercise capacity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therapeutic exercise can be beneficial and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the quadriceps muscles may represent a practical approach. The primary aim of this study was to determine the acceptability of NMES of the quadriceps to patients with NSCLC used alongside palliative chemotherapy. Secondary aims explored aspects of safety and efficacy of NMES in this setting. Methods Patients with advanced NSCLC due to receive first-line palliative chemotherapy were randomized to usual care with or without NMES. They were asked to undertake 30 minute sessions of NMES, ideally daily, but as a minimum, three times weekly. For NMES to be considered acceptable, it was predetermined that ≥80% of patients should achieve this minimum level of adherence. Qualitative interviews were held with a subset of patients to explore factors influencing adherence. Safety was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass, and physical activity level were assessed at baseline and after three cycles of chemotherapy. Results 49 patients (28 male, median (IQR) age 69 (64−75) years) participated. Of 30 randomized to NMES, 18 were eligible for the primary endpoint, of whom 9 (50% [90% CI, 29 to 71]) met the minimum level of adherence. Adherence was enhanced by incorporating sessions into a daily routine and hindered by undesirable effects of chemotherapy. There were no serious adverse events related to NMES, nor significant differences in quadriceps muscle strength, thigh lean mass or physical activity level between groups. Conclusions NMES is not acceptable in this setting, nor was there a suggestion of benefit. The need remains to explore NMES in patients with cancer in other settings.

https://openalex.org/W2093986530,"Hematogenous metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer-related deaths, yet the mechanism remains unclear. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood may employ different pathways to cross blood endothelial barrier and establish a metastatic niche. Several studies provide evidence that prostate cancer (PCa) cell tethering and rolling on microvascular endothelium via E-selectin/E-selectin ligand interactions under shear flow theoretically promote extravasation and contribute to the development of metastases. However, it is unknown if CTCs from PCa patients interact with E-selectin expressed on endothelium, initiating a route for tumor metastases. Here we report that CTCs derived from PCa patients showed interactions with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing endothelial cells. To examine E-selectin-mediated interactions of PCa cell lines and CTCs derived from metastatic PCa patients, we used fluorescently-labeled anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody J591-488 which is internalized following cell-surface binding. We employed a microscale flow device consisting of E-selectin-coated microtubes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) on parallel-plate flow chamber simulating vascular endothelium. We observed that J591-488 did not significantly alter the rolling behavior in PCa cells at shear stresses below 3 dyn/cm2. CTCs obtained from 31 PCa patient samples showed that CTCs tether and stably interact with E-selectin and E-selectin expressing HUVECs at physiological shear stress. Interestingly, samples collected during disease progression demonstrated significantly more CTC/E-selectin interactions than samples during times of therapeutic response (p=0.016). Analysis of the expression of sialyl Lewis X (sLex) in patient samples showed that a small subset comprising 1.9-18.8% of CTCs possess high sLex expression. Furthermore, E-selectin-mediated interactions between prostate CTCs and HUVECs were diminished in the presence of anti-E-selectin neutralizing antibody. CTC-Endothelial interactions provide a novel insight into potential adhesive mechanisms of prostate CTCs as a means to initiate metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2165576587,"Priming of random hexamers in cDNA synthesis is known to show sequence bias, but in addition it has been suggested recently that mismatches in random hexamer priming could be a cause of mismatches between the original RNA fragment and observed sequence reads. To explore random hexamer mispriming as a potential source of these errors, we analyzed two independently generated RNA-seq datasets of synthetic ERCC spikes for which the reference is known. First strand cDNA synthesized by random hexamer priming on RNA showed consistent position and nucleotide-specific mismatch errors in the first seven nucleotides. The mismatch errors found in both datasets are consistent in distribution and thermodynamically stable mismatches are more common. This strongly indicates that RNA-DNA mispriming of specific random hexamers causes these errors. Due to their consistency and specificity, mispriming errors can have profound implications for downstream applications if not dealt with properly."
https://openalex.org/W1968572789,"Pleistocene climatic fluctuations influenced patterns of genetic variation and promoted speciation across a wide range of species groups. Lichens are commonly found in habitats that were directly impacted by glacial cycles; however, the role of Pleistocene climate in driving speciation in most lichen symbionts remains unclear. This uncertainty is due in part to limitations in our ability to accurately recognize independently evolving lichen-forming fungal lineages and a lack of relevant fossil calibrations. Using a coalescent-based species tree approach, we estimated divergence times for two sister clades in the genus Xanthoparmelia (Parmeliaceae) restricted to western North America. We assessed the influence of two different species circumscription scenarios and various locus-specific rates of molecular evolution on divergence estimates. Species circumscriptions were validated using the program BP&P. although speciation was generally supported in both scenarios, divergence times differed between traditional species circumscriptions and those based on genetic data, with more recent estimates resulting from the former. Similarly, rates of evolution for different loci resulted in variable divergence time estimates. However, our results unambiguously indicate that diversification in the sampled Xanthoparmelia clades occurred during the Pleistocene. Our study highlights the potential impact of ambiguous species circumscriptions and uncertain rates of molecular evolution on estimating divergence times within a multilocus species tree framework."

https://openalex.org/W1982436785,"Topical vaginal anti-HIV microbicides are an important focus in female-based strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. Understanding microbicide pharmacokinetics is essential to development, characterization and implementation of efficacious microbicide drug delivery formulations. Current methods to measure drug concentrations in tissue (e.g., LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry) are highly sensitive, but destructive and complex. This project explored the use of confocal Raman spectroscopy to detect microbicide drugs and to measure their local concentrations in fluids, drug delivery gels, and tissues. We evaluated three candidate microbicide drugs: tenofovir, Dapivirine and IQP-0528. Measurements were performed in freshly excised porcine buccal tissue specimens, gel vehicles and fluids using two Horiba Raman microscopes, one of which is confocal. Characteristic spectral peak calibrations for each drug were obtained using serial dilutions in the three matrices. These specific Raman bands demonstrated strong linear concentration dependences in the matrices and were characterized with respect to their unique vibrational signatures. At least one specific Raman feature was identified for each drug as a marker band for detection in tissue. Sensitivity of detection was evaluated in the three matrices. A specific peak was also identified for tenofovir diphosphate, the anti-HIV bioactive product of tenofovir after phosphorylation in host cells. Z-scans of drug concentrations vs. depth in excised tissue specimens, incubated under layers of tenofovir solution in a Transwell assay, showed decreasing concentration with depth from the surface into the tissue. Time-dependent concentration profiles were obtained from tissue samples incubated in the Transwell assay, for times ranging 30 minutes - 6 hours. Calibrations and measurements from tissue permeation studies for tenofovir showed good correlation with gold standard LC-MS/MS data. These results demonstrate that confocal Raman spectroscopy holds promise as a tool for practical, minimally invasive, label-free measurement of microbicide drug concentrations in fluids, gels and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1989544046,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have emerged as a source of potentially unlimited supply of autologous endothelial cells (ECs) for vascularization. However, the regenerative function of these cells relative to adult ECs and ECs derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells is unknown. The objective was to define the differentiation characteristics and vascularization potential of Fetal liver kinase (Flk)1(+) and Vascular Endothelial (VE)-cadherin(+) ECs derived identically from mouse (m)ES and miPS cells.Naive mES and miPS cells cultured in type IV collagen (IV Col) in defined media for 5 days induced the formation of adherent cell populations, which demonstrated similar expression of Flk1 and VE-cadherin and the emergence of EC progenies. FACS purification resulted in 100% Flk1(+) VE-cadherin(+) cells from both mES and miPS cells. Emergence of Flk1(+)VE-cadherin(+) cells entailed expression of the vascular developmental transcription factor Er71, which bound identically to Flk1, VE-cadherin, and CD31 promoters in both populations. Immunostaining with anti-VE-cadherin and anti-CD31 antibodies and microscopy demonstrated the endothelial nature of these cells. Each cell population (unlike mature ECs) organized into well-developed vascular structures in vitro and incorporated into CD31(+) neovessels in matrigel plugs implanted in nude mice in vivo.Thus, iPS cell-derived Flk1(+)VE-cadherin(+) cells expressing the Er71 are as angiogenic as mES cell-derived cells and incorporate into CD31(+) neovessels. Their vessel forming capacity highlights the potential of autologous iPS cells-derived EC progeny for therapeutic angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2131655368,"Compared to the striking diversification and levels of endemism observed in many terrestrial groups within the Hawaiian Archipelago, marine invertebrates exhibit remarkably lower rates of endemism and diversification. Supralittoral invertebrates restricted to specific coastal patchy habitats, however, have the potential for high levels of allopatric diversification. This is the case of Ligia isopods endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago, which most likely arose from a rocky supralittoral ancestor that colonized the archipelago via rafting, and diversified into rocky supralittoral and inland lineages. A previous study on populations of this isopod from Oʻahu and Kauaʻi revealed high levels of allopatric differentiation, and suggested inter-island historical dispersal events have been rare. To gain a better understanding on the diversity and evolution of this group, we expanded prior phylogeographic work by incorporating populations from unsampled main Hawaiian Islands (Maui, Molokaʻi, Lanaʻi, and Hawaiʻi), increasing the number of gene markers (four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes), and conducting Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Our study revealed new lineages and expanded the distribution range of several lineages. The phylogeographic patterns of Ligia in the study area are complex, with Hawaiʻi, Oʻahu, and the Maui-Nui islands sharing major lineages, implying multiple inter-island historical dispersal events. In contrast, the oldest and most geographically distant of the major islands (Kauaʻi) shares no lineages with the other islands. Our results did not support the monophyly of all the supralittoral lineages (currently grouped into L. hawaiensis), or the monophyly of the terrestrial lineages (currently grouped into L. perkinsi), implying more than one evolutionary transition between coastal and inland forms. Geometric-morphometric analyses of three supralittoral clades revealed significant body shape differences among them. A taxonomic revision of Hawaiian Ligia is warranted. Our results are relevant for the protection of biodiversity found in an environment subject to high pressure from disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W2081152390,"Background Physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SED) may have independent effects on health and disease. This might be due to PA and SED having distinct effects on lipoprotein metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine associations between lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations (-P) and accelerometer-measured SED and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in a sample of healthy adult subjects. Methods Lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, whereas SED and MVPA were measured using Agtigraph GT1M and GT3X+ accelerometers. We obtained valid data in 73 subjects (30 men and 43 women, age 40.5 ± 10.6 years; body mass index 24.0 ± 2.8). Multiple regression analysis was used to determine associations (partial correlations) with lipoproteins. Results Positive associations were detected between SED and small VLDL-P, large LDL-P and TG (partial r = 0.24 to 0.25, p < .047). Corresponding associations were non-significant for MVPA (partial r = -0.12 to 0.04, p > .355). On the contrary, MVPA was positively associated with large HDL-P, average HDL size, Apo A1 and HDL-cholesterol (partial r = 0.28 to 0.50, p < .027), whereas SED was not (partial r = -0.06 to 0.07, p > .607). Conclusion There might be a specific effect of SED versus MVPA on lipoprotein metabolism. However, our results must be interpreted carefully due to possible effect-modification by gender and a low sample size. Thus, our findings should be viewed as preliminary."
https://openalex.org/W2111024933,"We often form intentions but have to postpone them until the appropriate situation for retrieval and execution has come, an ability also referred to as event-based prospective memory. After intention completion, our cognitive system has to deactivate no-more-relevant intention representations from memory to avoid interference with subsequent tasks. In everyday life, we frequently rely on these abilities also in stressful situations. Surprisingly, little is known about potential stress effects on these functions. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the reliability of event-based prospective memory and of intention deactivation in conditions of acute psychosocial stress. To this aim, eighty-two participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test, a standardized stress protocol, or a standardized control situation. Following this treatment, participants performed a computerized event-based prospective memory task with non-salient and focal prospective memory cues in order to assess prospective memory performance and deactivation of completed intentions. Although the stress group showed elevated levels of salivary cortisol as marker of a stress-related increase in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity throughout the cognitive testing period compared to the no-stress group, prospective memory performance and deactivation of completed intentions did not differ between groups. Findings indicate that cognitive control processes subserving intention retrieval and deactivation after completion may be mostly preserved even under conditions of acute stress."
https://openalex.org/W2154997655,"Introduction A combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is often used as first line chemotherapy for treatment of ovarian cancer. Therefore the use of imaging biomarkers early after initiation of treatment to determine treatment sensitivity would be valuable in order to identify responders from non-responders. In this study we describe the non-invasive PET imaging of glucose uptake and cell proliferation using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and 3’-deoxy-3’-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) for early assessment of treatment response in a pre-clinical mouse model of human ovarian cancer treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Methods In vivo uptake of FLT and FDG in human ovarian cancer xenografts in mice (A2780) was determined before treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel (CaP) and repeatedday 1, 4 and 8 after treatment start. Tracer uptake was quantified using small animal PET/CT. Tracer uptake was compared with gene expression of Ki67, TK1, GLUT1, HK1 and HK2. Results Tumors in the CaP group was significantly smaller than in the control group (p=0.03) on day 8. On day 4 FDG SUVmax ratio was significantly lower in the CaP group compared to the control group (105±4% vs 138±9%; p=0.002) and on day 8 the FDG SUVmax ratio was lower in the CaP compared to the control group (125±13% vs 167±13%; p=0.05). On day 1 the uptake of FLT SUVmax ratio was 89±9% in the CaP group and 109±6% in the control group; however the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Conclusions Our data suggest that both FDG and FLT PET may be used for the assessment of anti-tumor effects of a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel in the treatment of ovarian cancer. FLT provides an early and transient signal and FDG a later and more prolonged response. This underscores the importance of optimal timing between treatment and FLT or FDG imaging since treatment response may otherwise be overlooked."
https://openalex.org/W2026099051,"Purpose Chronic hand and wrist pain is a common clinical issue for orthopaedic surgeons and rheumatologists. The purpose of this study was 1. To analyze the interobserver agreement of SPECT/CT, MRI, CT, bone scan and plain radiographs in patients with non-specific pain of the hand and wrist, and 2. to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging methods in this selected patient population. Materials and Methods Thirty-two consecutive patients with non-specific pain of the hand or wrist were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had been imaged by plain radiographs, planar early-phase imaging (bone scan), late-phase imaging (SPECT/CT including bone scan and CT), and MRI. Two experienced and two inexperienced readers analyzed the images with a standardized read-out protocol. Reading criteria were lesion detection and localisation, type and etiology of the underlying pathology. Diagnostic accuracy and interobserver agreement were determined for all readers and imaging modalities. Results The most accurate modality for experienced readers was SPECT/CT (accuracy 77%), followed by MRI (56%). The best performing, though little accurate modality for inexperienced readers was also SPECT/CT (44%), followed by MRI and bone scan (38% each). The interobserver agreement of experienced readers was generally high in SPECT/CT concerning lesion detection (kappa 0.93, MRI 0.72), localisation (kappa 0.91, MRI 0.75) and etiology (kappa 0.85, MRI 0.74), while MRI yielded better results on typification of lesions (kappa 0.75, SPECT/CT 0.69). There was poor agreement between experienced and inexperienced readers in SPECT/CT and MRI. Conclusions SPECT/CT proved to be the most helpful imaging modality in patients with non-specific wrist pain. The method was found reliable, providing high interobserver agreement, being outperformed by MRI only concerning the typification of lesions. We believe it is beneficial to integrate SPECT/CT into the diagnostic imaging algorithm of chronic wrist pain."
https://openalex.org/W2075663238,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play an essential role in the development of antigen-specific B cell immunity. Tfh cells regulate the differentiation and survival of activated B cells outside and inside germinal centers (GC) of secondary lymphoid organs. They act through cognate contacts with antigen-presenting B cells, but there is no current marker to specifically identify those Tfh cells which productively interact with B cells. Here we show that neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), a cell surface receptor, is selectively expressed by a subset of Tfh cells in human secondary lymphoid organs. Nrp1 expression on Tfh cells correlates with B cell differentiation in vivo and in vitro, is transient, and can be induced upon co-culture with autologous memory B cells in a cell contact-dependent manner. Comparative analysis of ex vivo Nrp1+ and Nrp1- Tfh cells reveals gene expression modulation during activation. Finally, Nrp1 is expressed by malignant Tfh-like cells in a severe case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) associated with elevated terminal B cell differentiation. Thus, Nrp1 is a specific marker of Tfh cells cognate activation in humans, which may prove useful as a prognostic factor and a therapeutic target in neoplastic diseases associated with Tfh cells activity."
https://openalex.org/W2089966649,"Virus infection may cause a multiplicity of symptoms in their host including discoloration, distortion and growth retardation. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV) infection was studied using kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.), a non-wood fiber-producing crop in this study. Infection by HCRSV reduced the fiber yield and concomitant economic value of kenaf. We investigated kenaf growth retardation and fluctuations of four selected miRNAs after HCRSV infection. Vegetative growth (including plant height, leaf size and root development) was severely retarded. From the transverse and radial sections of the mock and HCRSV-infected kenaf stem, the vascular bundles of HCRSV-infected plants were severely disrupted. In addition, four conserved plant developmental and defence related microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR165, miR167, miR168 and miR171) and their respective target genes phabulosa (PHB), auxin response factor 8 (ARF8), argonaute 1 (AGO1) and scarecrow-like protein 1 (SCL1) displayed variation in expression levels after HCRSV infection. Compared with the mock inoculated kenaf plants, miR171 and miR168 and their targets SCL1 and AGO1 showed greater fluctuations after HCRSV infection. As HCRSV upregulates plant SO transcript in kenaf and upregulated AGO1 in HCRSV-infected plants, the expression level of AGO1 transcript was further investigated under sulfite oxidase (SO) overexpression or silencing condition. Interestingly, the four selected miRNAs were also up- or down-regulated upon overexpression or silencing of SO. Plant growth retardation and fluctuation of four conserved miRNAs are correlated to HCRSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2083641516,"Although the genome wide supported psychosis susceptibility neurogranin (NRGN) gene is expressed in human brains, it is unclear how it impacts brain morphology in schizophrenia. We investigated the influence of NRGN rs12807809 on cortical thickness, subcortical volumes and shapes in patients with schizophrenia. One hundred and fifty six subjects (91 patients with schizophrenia and 65 healthy controls) underwent structural MRI scans and their blood samples were genotyped. A brain mapping algorithm, large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, was used to perform group analysis of subcortical shapes and cortical thickness. Patients with risk TT genotype were associated with widespread cortical thinning involving frontal, parietal and temporal cortices compared with controls with TT genotype. No volumetric difference in subcortical structures (hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, basal ganglia) was observed between risk TT genotype in patients and controls. However, patients with risk TT genotype were associated with thalamic shape abnormalities involving regions related to pulvinar and medial dorsal nuclei. Our results revealed the influence of the NRGN gene on thalamocortical morphology in schizophrenia involving widespread cortical thinning and thalamic shape abnormalities. These findings help to clarify underlying NRGN mediated pathophysiological mechanisms involving cortical-subcortical brain networks in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2036709902,"Transcription factor-based reprogramming can lead to the successful switching of cell fates. We have recently reported that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be directly reprogrammed into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) after the forced expression of Brn4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc. Here, we tested whether iNSCs could be further reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The two factors Oct4 and Klf4 were sufficient to induce pluripotency in iNSCs. Immunocytochemistry and gene expression analysis showed that iNSC-derived iPSCs (iNdiPSCs) are similar to embryonic stem cells at the molecular level. In addition, iNdiPSCs could differentiate into cells of all three germ layers, both in vitro and in vivo, proving that iNdiPSCs are bona fide pluripotent cells. Furthermore, analysis of the global gene expression profile showed that iNdiPSCs, in contrast to iNSCs, do not retain any MEF transcriptional memory even at early passages after reprogramming. Overall, our results demonstrate that iNSCs can be reprogrammed to pluripotency and suggest that cell fate can be redirected numerous times. Importantly, our findings indicate that the induced pluripotent cell state may erase the donor-cell type epigenetic memory more efficiently than other induced somatic cell fates."
https://openalex.org/W2071517626,"The C3 toxins from Clostridium botulinum (C3bot) and Clostridium limosum (C3lim) as well as C3-derived fusion proteins are selectively taken up into the cytosol of monocytes/macrophages where the C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Rho results in inhibition of Rho-signalling and characteristic morphological changes. Since the fusion toxin C2IN-C3lim was efficiently taken up into and inhibited proliferation of murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, its effects on RAW 264.7-derived osteoclasts were investigated. C2IN-C3lim was taken up into differentiated osteoclasts and decreased their resorption activity. In undifferentiated RAW 264.7 cells, C2IN-C3lim-treatment significantly decreased their differentiation into osteoclasts as determined by counting the multi-nucleated, TRAP-positive cells. This inhibitory effect was concentration- and time-dependent and most efficient when C2IN-C3lim was applied in the early stage of osteoclast-formation. A single-dose application of C2IN-C3lim at day 0 and its subsequent removal at day 1 reduced the number of osteoclasts in a comparable manner while C2IN-C3lim-application at later time points did not reduce the number of osteoclasts to a comparable degree. Control experiments with an enzymatically inactive C3 protein revealed that the ADP-ribosylation of Rho was essential for the observed effects. In conclusion, the results indicate that Rho-activity is crucial during the early phase of osteoclast-differentiation. Other bone cell types such as pre-osteoblastic cells were not affected by C2IN-C3lim. Due to their cell-type selective and specific mode of action, C3 proteins and C3-fusions might be valuable tools for targeted pharmacological manipulation of osteoclast formation and activity, which could lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies against osteoclast-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2083492616,"Background Acute and recurrent acute urticaria are often associated with multiple factors including infections and recent data suggest a role for herpesviruses. Objective To test the null hypothesis, that is, there is no association of herpesvirus infections with urticaria. Methods Thirty-seven patients between one month and 15 years of age were age matched to 37 controls who were healthy or had mild acute respiratory infections but without urticaria. Patients and controls were followed for 1 to 6 years. Diagnostic studies included DNA detection by real-time PCR for herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6). Tests for other infections included adenovirus, parvovirus B 19, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, Group A streptococci, rotavirus, and parasites. Results Specific infections were diagnosed in 26 of 37 cases and among 9 of 37 control children (P=0.0002). Single or concomitant herpesvirus infections occurred in 24 cases and in 4 controls (65% vs 11 %, p=0.0003). Cases had 10 HHV-6 infections, 8 CMV infections, 5 EBV infections, and 4 HSV-1 infections.

https://openalex.org/W2157005147,"Introduction Impairment of the mucosal barrier plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. The myosin IXB (MYO9B) gene and the two tight-junction adaptor genes, PARD3 and MAGI2, have been linked to gastrointestinal permeability. Common variants of these genes are associated with celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, two other conditions in which intestinal permeability plays a role. We investigated genetic variation in MYO9B, PARD3 and MAGI2 for association with acute pancreatitis. Methods Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MYO9B, two SNPs in PARD3, and three SNPs in MAGI2 were studied in a Dutch cohort of 387 patients with acute pancreatitis and over 800 controls, and in a German cohort of 235 patients and 250 controls. Results Association to MYO9B and PARD3 was observed in the Dutch cohort, but only one SNP in MYO9B and one in MAGI2 showed association in the German cohort (p < 0.05). Joint analysis of the combined cohorts showed that, after correcting for multiple testing, only two SNPs in MYO9B remained associated (rs7259292, p = 0.0031, odds ratio (OR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.35-2.78; rs1545620, p = 0.0006, OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.53). SNP rs1545620 is a non-synonymous SNP previously suspected to impact on ulcerative colitis. None of the SNPs showed association to disease severity or etiology. Conclusion Variants in MYO9B may be involved in acute pancreatitis, but we found no evidence for involvement of PARD3 or MAGI2."

https://openalex.org/W2077510216,"Gene Targeting (GT) is the integration of an introduced vector into a specific chromosomal site, via homologous recombination. It is considered an effective tool for precise genome editing, with far-reaching implications in biological research and biotechnology, and is widely used in mice, with the potential of becoming routine in many species. Nevertheless, the epigenetic status of the targeted allele remains largely unexplored. Using GT-modified lines of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that the DNA methylation profile of the targeted locus is changed following GT. This effect is non-directional as methylation can be either completely lost, maintained with minor alterations or show instability in the generations subsequent to GT. As DNA methylation is known to be involved in several cellular processes, GT-related alterations may result in unexpected or even unnoticed perturbations. Our analysis shows that GT may be used as a new tool for generating epialleles, for example, to study the role of gene body methylation. In addition, the analysis of DNA methylation at the targeted locus may be utilized to investigate the mechanism of GT, many aspects of which are still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2020270303,"Globally, 11% of infants are born preterm. In adulthood, individuals born preterm are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the mechanistic basis of this remains unknown. Clinically overt cardiovascular disease may be preceded by altered cardiac autonomic activity characterised by increased sympathetic activity and/or reduced parasympathetic activity. Thus, altered cardiac autonomic activity in survivors of preterm birth may underlie later cardiovascular risk.To investigate the impact of gestational age on cardiac autonomic activity in juvenile and adult sheep.Singleton-bearing ewes were randomised antenatally to spontaneous term birth (TC; n=73) or corticosteroid induced preterm birth (PT; n=60). Cardiac autonomic modulation was assessed using heart rate variability analysis in juvenile and adult offspring. Preterm birth in adult males was associated with altered sympatho-vagal modulation (LFnu: PT 64 ± 4 vs. TC 49 ± 4, p<0.05; LogLF/HF: PT 1.8 ± 0.1 vs. TC 1.5 ± 0.1, p<0.05) and reduced parasympathetic modulation (LogRMSSD: PT 2.9 ± 0.2 vs. TC 3.4 ± 0.1, p<0.05; LogNN50: PT 0.3 ± 0.4 vs. TC 1.6 ± 0.4, p<0.05). Within the range of term birth, each one-day increment in gestational age was associated with a decrement in LFnu in juvenile females and with a decrement in LFnu and LF/HF ratio, but an increment in RMSSD and NN50 in adult females.Cardiac autonomic function in adult sheep is affected in a sex-specific manner by gestational age at birth, even within the term range. Altered cardiac autonomic function may contribute to increased later cardiovascular morbidity in those born preterm."
https://openalex.org/W2046395359,"The secondary structures of amyloidogenic proteins are largely influenced by various intra and extra cellular microenvironments and metal ions that govern cytotoxicity. The secondary structure of a prion fragment, PrP(111-126), was determined using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in various microenvironments. The conformational preferences of the prion peptide fragment were examined by changing solvent conditions and pH, and by introducing external stress (sonication). These physical and chemical environments simulate various cellular components at the water-membrane interface, namely differing aqueous environments and metal chelating ions. The results show that PrP(111-126) adopts different conformations in assembled and non-assembled forms. Aging studies on the PrP(111-126) peptide fragment in aqueous buffer demonstrated a structural transition from random coil to a stable β-sheet structure. A similar, but significantly accelerated structural transition was observed upon sonication in aqueous environment. With increasing TFE concentrations, the helical content of PrP(111-126) increased persistently during the structural transition process from random coil. In aqueous SDS solution, PrP(111-126) exhibited β-sheet conformation with greater α-helical content. No significant conformational changes were observed under various pH conditions. Addition of Cu2+ ions inhibited the structural transition and fibril formation of the peptide in a cell free in vitro system. The fact that Cu2+ supplementation attenuates the fibrillar assemblies and cytotoxicity of PrP(111-126) was witnessed through structural morphology studies using AFM as well as cytotoxicity using MTT measurements. We observed negligible effects during both physical and chemical stimulation on conformation of the prion fragment in the presence of Cu2+ ions. The toxicity of PrP(111-126) to cultured astrocytes was reduced following the addition of Cu2+ ions, owing to binding affinity of copper towards histidine moiety present in the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2164317849,"With the advance of genome-wide association studies and newly identified SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) associations with complex disease, important discoveries have emerged focusing not only on individual genes but on disease-associated pathways and gene sets. The authors used prospective myocardial infarction case-control studies nested in the Nurses’ Health and Health Professionals Follow-Up Studies to investigate genetic variants associated with myocardial infarction or LDL, HDL, triglycerides, adiponectin and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Using these case-control studies to illustrate an integrative systems biology approach, the authors applied SNP set enrichment analysis to identify gene sets where expression SNPs representing genes from these sets show enrichment in their association with endpoints of interest. The authors also explored an aggregate score approach. While power limited one’s ability to detect significance for association of individual loci with myocardial infarction, the authors found significance for loci associated with LDL, HDL, apoB and triglycerides, replicating previous observations. Applying SNP set enrichment analysis and risk score methods, the authors also found significance for three gene sets and for aggregate scores associated with myocardial infarction as well as for loci-related to cardiovascular risk factors, supporting the use of these methods in practice."
https://openalex.org/W1974511373,"Mutation of the p53 gene is the most common genetic alteration in human malignances and associated clinically with tumor progression and metastasis. To determine the effect of mutant p53 on epithelial differentiation, we developed three-dimensional culture (3-D) of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We found that parental MDCK cells undergo a series of morphological changes and form polarized and growth-arrested cysts with hollow lumen, which resembles branching tubules in vitro. We also found that upon knockdown of endogenous wild-type p53 (p53-KD), MDCK cells still form normal cysts in 3-D culture, indicating that p53-KD alone is not sufficient to disrupt cysts formation. However, we found that ectopic expression of mutant R163H (human equivalent R175H) or R261H (human equivalent R273H) in MDCK cells leads to disruption of cyst polarity and formation of invasive aggregates, which is further compounded by knockdown of endogenous wild-type p53. Consistently, we found that expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors (Snail-1, Slug and Twist) is altered by mutant p53, which is also compounded by knockdown of wild-type p53. Moreover, the expression level of c-Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor and a key regulator of kidney cell tubulogenesis, is enhanced by combined knockdown of endogenous wild-type p53 and ectopic expression of mutant R163H or R261H but not by each individually. Together, our data suggest that upon inactivating mutation of the p53 gene, mutant p53 acquires its gain of function by altering morphogenesis and promoting cell migration and invasion in part by upregulating EMT and c-Met."

Compliance with methodological guidelines issued by the Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre was assessed using a detailed checklist of 23 methodological items. The rate of compliance was calculated based on the number of economic evaluations for which the item was applicable.Economic evaluations tended to comply with guidelines regarding perspective, target population, subgroup analyses, comparator, use of comparative clinical data and final outcome measures, calculation of costs, incremental analysis, discounting and time horizon. However, more attention needs to be paid to the description of limitations of indirect comparisons, the choice of an appropriate analytic technique, the expression of unit costs in values for the current year, the estimation and valuation of outcomes, the presentation of results of sensitivity analyses, and testing the face validity of model inputs and outputs. Also, a large variation was observed in the scope and depth of the quality assessment by the Drug Reimbursement Committee.Although general guidelines exist, pharmaceutical companies and the Drug Reimbursement Committee would benefit from the existence of a more detailed checklist of methodological items that need to be reported in an economic evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2035396258,"Peer review is an important element of scientific communication but deserves quantitative examination. We used data from the handling service manuscript Central for ten mid-tier ecology and evolution journals to test whether number of external reviews completed improved citation rates for all accepted manuscripts. Contrary to a previous study examining this issue using resubmission data as a proxy for reviews, we show that citation rates of manuscripts do not correlate with the number of individuals that provided reviews. Importantly, externally-reviewed papers do not outperform editor-only reviewed published papers in terms of visibility within a 5-year citation window. These findings suggest that in many instances editors can be all that is needed to review papers (or at least conduct the critical first review to assess general suitability) if the purpose of peer review is to primarily filter and that journals can consider reducing the number of referees associated with reviewing ecology and evolution papers."
https://openalex.org/W2115987345,"The chromatin remodelling protein ATRX is associated with the rare genetic disorder ATR-X syndrome. This syndrome includes developmental delay, cognitive impairment, and a variety of skeletal deformities. ATRX plays a role in several basic chromatin-mediated cellular events including DNA replication, telomere stability, gene transcription, and chromosome congression and cohesion during cell division. We have used a loss-of-function approach to directly investigate the role of Atrx in the adult skeleton in three different models of selective Atrx loss. We specifically targeted deletion of Atrx to the forelimb mesenchyme, to cartilage and to bone-forming osteoblasts. We previously demonstrated that loss of ATRX in forelimb mesenchyme causes brachydactyly while deletion in chondrocytes had minimal effects during development. We now show that targeted deletion of Atrx in osteoblasts causes minor dwarfism but does not recapitulate most of the skeletal phenotypes seen in ATR-X syndrome patients. In adult mice from all three models, we find that joints lacking Atrx are not more susceptible to osteoarthritis, as determined by OARSI scoring and immunohistochemistry. These results indicate that while ATRX plays limited roles during early stages of skeletal development, deficiency of the protein in adult tissues does not confer susceptibility to osteoarthritis."
