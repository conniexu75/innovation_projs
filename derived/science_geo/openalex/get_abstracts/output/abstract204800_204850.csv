Trypsin would be expected to cleave alanine and the heptapeptide, Gly . Phe . Phe . Tyr . Thr . Pro. Lys, from the molecule leaving a large portion of the molecule, desoctapeptide-insulin, intact. Sanger and Tuppy (3) and later Feitelson and Partridge (4) detected alanine and the heptapeptide on paper chromatograms of the products of tryptic digestion of the oxidized B chain of insulin, Harris and Li (5) obtained the same paper chromatographic pattern from tryptic digestion of crystalline zinc-insulin. Nicol and Smith (6, 7) have reported studies on the isolation of desoctapeptide-insulin (designated DHA-insulin by these investigators). They originally reported that desoctapeptide-insulin was biologically inactive in rabbits (6). However, Nicol recently (7) reported that desoctapeptide-insulin possessed about 15% of the biological activity of insulin in the lowering of the blood sugar of rabbits and also in the uptake of glucose by the rat diaphragm. Our studies were initiated several years ago with the idea of developing procedures for the preparation, isolation, and characterization of desoctapeptide-insulin. We used a somewhat different approach to the problem than that of Nicol and have obtained what appear to be conflicting results with regard to the biological activity of the desoctapeptide-insulin."

There did not appear to be a causal relationship between these findings, and the findings do not appear to be attributable either to a generalized behavioral defect or to inadequate dietary intake."

https://openalex.org/W1970539763,"Empirical equations derived from brain size (E) and body size (P) of archaic-Eocene, Oligocene, and Recent mammals were all of the form, E = kP2/3; k = 0.03 for the Eocene, 0.06 for the Oligocene, and 0.12 for the Recent groups. It is suggested that k, which has been used as an index of cephalization in contemporary mammals, may be an appropriate measure of brain evolution in the mammals as a class."

https://openalex.org/W2010759651,"A bacteriophage is described which grows on recipient (F-) and not on donor ( Hfr, F+, or F') salmonella. The reason for this differential is unknown, since the phage attaches to all mating types, but progeny ensue only from female bacteria. Purification of this phage has been accomplished. A procedure is described for quantitatively determining either the acquisition or loss of the F agent by bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2050504789,"The rate of antigen disappearance was studied in hibernating ground squirrels (Citellus tridecemlineatus) injected with I(131)-labeled bovine serum albumin. There was no detectable disappearance of antigen during 14 days of hibernation. The induction period, however, ended 5 days after arousal as compared to a 7-day induction period in nonhibernating ground squirrels."

The albumin level rose while the globulin level, especially the level of alpha fraction, fell in tremulous mice, but the trend was reversed in quivering mice. In waddler mice the changes were observed only in females."

https://openalex.org/W2065670183,"The analysis of vigilance as operant behavior treats illumination (observing) responses as operants that produce signal-detections. Evidence is presented that the relationship is an artifact of the procedure, and that no vigilance factor is involved in illumination-responses."

https://openalex.org/W2024392906,"Antigen, diffusing into converging edges of an antibody depot, inhibits the precipitation unless the reaction is completed before an inhibiting antigen excess is established. Since the rate of the increase of antigen concentration depends on the size of the angle, relative avidities of similar preparations of antibody may be estimated from the angle just producing observable inhibition."
