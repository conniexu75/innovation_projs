https://openalex.org/W2979563681,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis generally requires substantial postreaction purification. Here, we report a direct electrosynthesis strategy that delivers separate hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) streams to an anode and cathode separated by a porous solid electrolyte, wherein the electrochemically generated H+ and HO2- recombine to form pure aqueous H2O2 solutions. By optimizing a functionalized carbon black catalyst for two-electron oxygen reduction, we achieved >90% selectivity for pure H2O2 at current densities up to 200 milliamperes per square centimeter, which represents an H2O2 productivity of 3.4 millimoles per square centimeter per hour (3660 moles per kilogram of catalyst per hour). A wide range of concentrations of pure H2O2 solutions up to 20 weight % could be obtained by tuning the water flow rate through the solid electrolyte, and the catalyst retained activity and selectivity for 100 hours."

https://openalex.org/W2978022936,"Homeostatic mechanisms stabilize neuronal activity in vivo, but whether this process gives rise to balanced network dynamics is unknown. Here, we continuously monitored the statistics of network spiking in visual cortical circuits in freely behaving rats for 9 days. Under control conditions in light and dark, networks were robustly organized around criticality, a regime that maximizes information capacity and transmission. When input was perturbed by visual deprivation, network criticality was severely disrupted and subsequently restored to criticality over 48 h. Unexpectedly, the recovery of excitatory dynamics preceded homeostatic plasticity of firing rates by >30 h. We utilized model investigations to manipulate firing rate homeostasis in a cell-type-specific manner at the onset of visual deprivation. Our results suggest that criticality in excitatory networks is established by inhibitory plasticity and architecture. These data establish that criticality is consistent with a homeostatic set point for visual cortical dynamics and suggest a key role for homeostatic regulation of inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2979359769,"Epithelial resident memory T (eTRM) cells serve as sentinels in barrier tissues to guard against previously encountered pathogens. How eTRM cells are generated has important implications for efforts to elicit their formation through vaccination or prevent it in autoimmune disease. Here, we show that during immune homeostasis, the cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) epigenetically conditions resting naïve CD8+ T cells and prepares them for the formation of eTRM cells in a mouse model of skin vaccination. Naïve T cell conditioning occurs in lymph nodes (LNs), but not in the spleen, through major histocompatibility complex class I-dependent interactions with peripheral tissue-derived migratory dendritic cells (DCs) and depends on DC expression of TGF-β-activating αV integrins. Thus, the preimmune T cell repertoire is actively conditioned for a specialized memory differentiation fate through signals restricted to LNs."

Wang et al. examine the potential for solid-state cooling of twisted fibers, along with configurations such as supercoiling, for materials including natural rubber, polyethylene, and nickel-titanium fibers. The cooling is related to the change in entropy of the material as it is mechanically deformed. Science , this issue p. 216"
https://openalex.org/W2979884643,"The Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) recruit the master kinase mTORC1 to lysosomes to regulate cell growth and proliferation in response to amino acid availability. The nucleotide state of Rag heterodimers is critical for their association with mTORC1. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure of RagA/RagC in complex with mTORC1 shows the details of RagA/RagC binding to the RAPTOR subunit of mTORC1 and explains why only the RagAGTP/RagCGDP nucleotide state binds mTORC1. Previous kinetic studies suggested that GTP binding to one Rag locks the heterodimer to prevent GTP binding to the other. Our crystal structures and dynamics of RagA/RagC show the mechanism for this locking and explain how oncogenic hotspot mutations disrupt this process. In contrast to allosteric activation by RHEB, Rag heterodimer binding does not change mTORC1 conformation and activates mTORC1 by targeting it to lysosomes."

However, it also acts as a coagonist on excitatory N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Otsu et al. examined the function of the NMDA receptor subunit combination GluN1/GluN3A in the medial habenula (MHb) of adult mice. This NMDA receptor subunit combination in MHb neurons is activated by glycine released from astrocytes. Activation of GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptors causes depolarization and increased spiking of MHb neurons. Reducing GluN3A receptor subunit levels in the MHb blocks conditioned place aversion.

Han et al. investigated if a protein called SHISA7 was involved in regulating GABA A receptor expression and function (see the Perspective by Rudolph and Moss). SHISA7 was found at GABA-releasing synapses, where it interacted with GABA A receptors, controlled receptor concentration at the synapse, sped up receptor deactivation kinetics, and modulated some behavioral properties of benzodiazepines. SHISA7 thus affects surface expression, gating kinetics, and pharmacology of GABA A receptors in the brain. Science , this issue p. 246 ; see also p. 185"
https://openalex.org/W2979590015,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an essential part of diabetes care. Real-time CGM data are beneficial to patients for daily glucose management, and aggregate summary statistics of CGM measures are valuable to direct insulin dosing and as a tool for researchers in clinical trials. Yet, the various commercial systems still report CGM data in disparate, non-standard ways. Accordingly, there is a need for a standardized, free, open-source approach to CGM data management and analysis. A package titled cgmanalysis was developed in the free programming language R to provide a rapid, easy, and consistent methodology for CGM data management, summary measure calculation, and descriptive analysis. Variables calculated by our package compare well to those generated by various CGM software, and our functions provide a more comprehensive list of summary measures available to clinicians and researchers. Consistent handling of CGM data using our R package may facilitate collaboration between research groups and contribute to a better understanding of free-living glucose patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2979857898,"The adaptation of plants to land required multiple morphological innovations. Among these include a variety of lateral organs that are initiated from apical meristems, in which the mantainance of undifferentiated stem cells is regulated by the homeodomain WUSCHEL-RELATED (WOX) transcription factors. Expansion of the WOX gene family has been associated with whole genome duplication (WGD) events and postulated to have been pivotal to the evolution of morphological complexity in land plants. Previous studies have classified the WOX gene family into three superclades (e.g., the ancient clade, the intermediate clade, and the modern clade). In order to improve our understanding of the evolution of the WOX gene family, we surveyed the WOX gene sequences from 38 genomes and 440 transcriptomes spanning the Viridiplantae and Rhodophyta. The WOX phylogeny inferred from 1039 WOX proteins drawn from 267 species with improved support along the backbone of the phylogeny suggests that the plant-specific WOX family contains three ancient superclades, which we term Type 1 (T1WOX, the WOX10/13/14 clade), Type 2 (T2WOX, the WOX8/9 and WOX11/12 clades), and Type 3 (T3WOX, the WUS, WOX1/6, WOX2, WOX3, WOX4 and WOX5/7 clades). Divergence of the T1WOX and T2WOX superclades may predate the diversification of vascular plants. Synteny analysis suggests contribution of WGD to expansion of the WOX family. Promoter analysis finds that the capacity of the WOX genes to be regulated by the auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways may be deeply conserved in the Viridiplantae. This study improves our phylogenetic context for elucidating functional evolution of the WOX gene family, which has likely contributed to the morphological complexity of land plants."
https://openalex.org/W2979701974,"The forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins are transcription factors involved in the differentiation of many cell types. Type II collagen (Col2) Cre-Foxo1-knockout and Col2-Cre-Foxo1,3,4 triple-knockout mice exhibit growth plate malformation. Moreover, recent studies have reported that in some cells, the expressions and activities of FOXOs are promoted by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), a growth factor playing a key role in chondrogenic differentiation. Here, using a murine chondrogenic cell line (ATDC5), mouse embryos, and human mesenchymal stem cells, we report the mechanisms by which FOXOs affect chondrogenic differentiation. FOXO1 expression increased along with chondrogenic differentiation, and FOXO1 inhibition suppressed chondrogenic differentiation. TGFβ1/SMAD signaling promoted expression and activity of FOXO1. In ATDC5, FOXO1 knockdown suppressed expression of sex-determining region Y box 9 (Sox9), a master regulator of chondrogenic differentiation, resulting in decreased collagen type II α1 (Col2a1) and aggrecan (Acan) expression after TGFβ1 treatment. On the other hand, chemical FOXO1 inhibition suppressed Col2a1 and Acan expression without suppressing Sox9 To investigate the effects of FOXO1 on chondrogenic differentiation independently of SOX9, we examined FOXO1's effects on the cell cycle. FOXO1 inhibition suppressed expression of p21 and cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Conversely, FOXO1 overexpression promoted expression of p21 and cell-cycle arrest. FOXO1 inhibition suppressed expression of nascent p21 RNA by TGFβ1, and FOXO1 bound the p21 promoter. p21 inhibition suppressed expression of Col2a1 and Acan during chondrogenic differentiation. These results suggest that FOXO1 is necessary for not only SOX9 expression, but also cell-cycle arrest during chondrogenic differentiation via TGFβ1 signaling."

The half-quantum fluxoid manifests itself as a $\pi$ phase shift in the quantum oscillation of the critical temperature.

We also discuss the strong indication that $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd is a spin-triplet superconductor."
https://openalex.org/W2979711254,"This study aimed to identify the relationships between clinical impairments and gait deviations in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A retrospective convenience sample of 367 children with CP was selected (3–18 years old) and divided in two groups based on clinical symptomatology [unilateral (uCP) / bilateral CP (bCP), (n = 167/200)]. All children underwent a three-dimensional gait analysis and a standardized clinical examination. Gait was inspected on a vector level (all sagittal motions combined), and an individual joint level (pelvis, hip, knee and ankle joint motions). Statistical non-parametric mapping was applied to identify specific parts of the gait cycle displaying relationships between the gait deviations of both groups and the impairment scores of spasticity, weakness, selectivity, and passive range of motion. Impairment scores were summarized in two ways: a) composite impairment scores (e.g. combined spasticity of all assessed muscles acting around the hip, knee and ankle joints) and b) joint specific impairment scores (e.g. spasticity of the muscles acting around the knee joint). Results showed that the vector and most of the individual motions were related to the composite scores. Direct and carry-over relationships were found between certain individual motions and joint impairment scores (around the same or neighboring joints, respectively). All correlations were more prominent for children with bCP compared to uCP, especially regarding the relationships of gait deviations with weakness and reduced selectivity. In conclusion, this study enabled the mapping of relationships between clinical impairments and gait deviations in children with CP, by identifying specific parts of the gait cycle that are related to each of these impairments. These results provide a comprehensive description of these relationships, while simultaneously highlighting the differences between the two CP groups. Integration of these findings could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of gait deviations and, eventually, support individualized treatment planning."

Our identification strategy exploits Italian data as a natural control group. We use French and Italian Consumer Price Indices, purchase prices and quantities from the 2011 and 2012 Kantar and GfK home-scan surveys for two French regions and two neighbouring Italian regions, and expenditure data from the 2011 and 2012 Italian Expenditure Survey. We check for the robustness of our results by applying the difference-in-difference models using only French data and considering water as the benchmark (control) good. We find that the tax is transmitted to the prices of taxed drinks, with full transmission for soft drinks and partial transmission for fruit juices. The evidence on purchase responses is mixed and less robust, indicating at most a very small reduction in soft drink purchases (about half a litre per capita per year), an impact which would be consistent with the low tax rate. We find suggestive evidence of a larger response by the sub-sample of heavy purchasers. Fruit juices and water do not seem to have been affected by the tax."

For instance, the temperature at which a material becomes superconducting—the critical temperature—can be tuned by varying strain. Bachmann et al. used focused ion beam milling to fabricate microstructures of the superconductor CeIrIn 5 on sapphire substrate. A difference in the thermal contraction coefficients of the two layers induced nonuniform strain upon cooling of the sample, leading to large gradients of the critical temperature. This approach can be used in other materials and may enable fabrication of superconducting circuitry without physical junctions. Science , this issue p. 221"

https://openalex.org/W2979476567,"Brain metastasis is a major distant metastasis occurring in patients with advanced breast cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have a strong influence on various oncological functions and have been reported as potential biomarkers for detecting distant metastasis. Specific biomarkers and unique miRNAs for brain metastasis have yet to be reported. The aim of this study was to identify novel miRNAs in serum, to assist in the diagnosis of brain metastasis in patients with advanced breast cancer. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with breast cancer and collected clinical data. In addition, we evaluated serum miRNA profiles in patients with breast cancer, with and without brain metastasis, using high-sensitivity microarrays. All patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging tests. A total of 51 serum samples from patients with breast cancer and brain metastasis, stored in the National Cancer Center Biobank, were used, and 28 serum samples were obtained from controls without brain metastasis. Two miRNAs, miR-4428 and miR-4480, could significantly distinguish patients with brain metastasis, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.779 and 0.781, respectively, while a combination of miR-4428 and progesterone receptor had an AUC value of 0.884. No significant correlations were identified between the expression levels of these two miRNAs in serum and clinical data. We conclude that serum miR-4428 and miR-4480 may be useful as biomarkers for predicting brain metastasis in patients with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2980062602,"Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and ERAP2 critically shape the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) immunopeptidome. The ERAPs remove N-terminal residues from antigenic precursor peptides and generate optimal-length peptides (i.e. 8-10-mers) to fit into the MHC class I groove. It is therefore intriguing that MHC class I molecules can present N-terminally extended peptides on the cell surface that can elicit CD8+ T-cell responses. This observation likely reflects gaps in our understanding of how antigens are processed by the ERAP enzymes. To better understand ERAPs' function in antigen processing, here we generated a nested set of N-terminally extended 10-20-mer peptides (RA) n AAKKKYCL covalently bound to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*0801. We used X-ray crystallography, thermostability assessments, and an ERAP1-trimming assay to characterize these complexes. The X-ray structures determined at 1.40-1.65 Å resolutions revealed that the residue extensions (RA) n unexpectedly protrude out of the A pocket of HLA-B*0801, whereas the AAKKKYCL core of all peptides adopts similar, bound conformations. HLA-B*0801 residue 62 was critical to open the A pocket. We also show that HLA-B*0801 and antigenic precursor peptides form stable complexes. Finally, ERAP1-mediated trimming of the MHC I-bound peptides required a minimal length of 14 amino acids. We propose a mechanistic model explaining how ERAP1-mediated trimming of MHC I-bound peptides in cells can generate peptides of canonical as well as noncanonical lengths that still serve as stable MHC I ligands. Our results provide a framework to better understand how the ERAP enzymes influence the MHC I immunopeptidome."
https://openalex.org/W2979896911,"Introduction The subventricular zone (SVZ) in the brain is associated with gliomagenesis and resistance to treatment in glioblastoma. In this study, we investigate the prognostic role and biological characteristics of subventricular zone (SVZ) involvement in glioblastoma. Methods We analyzed T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced MR images of a retrospective cohort of 647 primary glioblastoma patients diagnosed between 2005–2013, and performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis to adjust the prognostic effect of SVZ involvement for clinical patient- and tumor-related factors. Protein expression patterns of a.o. markers of neural stem cellness (CD133 and GFAP-δ) and (epithelial-) mesenchymal transition (NF-κB, C/EBP-β and STAT3) were determined with immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing 220 of the tumors. Molecular classification and mRNA expression-based gene set enrichment analyses, miRNA expression and SNP copy number analyses were performed on fresh frozen tissue obtained from 76 tumors. Confirmatory analyses were performed on glioblastoma TCGA/TCIA data. Results Involvement of the SVZ was a significant adverse prognostic factor in glioblastoma, independent of age, KPS, surgery type and postoperative treatment. Tumor volume and postoperative complications did not explain this prognostic effect. SVZ contact was associated with increased nuclear expression of the (epithelial-) mesenchymal transition markers C/EBP-β and phospho-STAT3. SVZ contact was not associated with molecular subtype, distinct gene expression patterns, or markers of stem cellness. Our main findings were confirmed in a cohort of 229 TCGA/TCIA glioblastomas. Conclusion In conclusion, involvement of the SVZ is an independent prognostic factor in glioblastoma, and associates with increased expression of key markers of (epithelial-) mesenchymal transformation, but does not correlate with stem cellness, molecular subtype, or specific (mi)RNA expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2979832008,"The group of neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) all exhibit inclusions containing amyloid-type α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates within degenerating brain cells. α-syn also exists as soluble oligomeric species that are hypothesized to represent intermediates between its native and aggregated states. These oligomers are present in brain extracts from patients suffering from synucleinopathies and hold great potential as biomarkers. Although easily prepared in vitro, oligomers are metastable and dissociate over time, thereby complicating α-syn oligomer research. Using the small amine-reactive cross-linker, formaldehyde (FA), we successfully stabilized α-syn oligomers without affecting their size, overall structure or antigenicity towards aggregate-conformation specific α-syn antibodies FILA and MJFR-14-6-4-2. Further, cross-linked α-syn oligomers show resistance towards denaturant like urea and SDS treatment and remain fully functional as internal standard in an aggregation-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) despite prior incubation with urea. We propose that FA cross-linked α-syn oligomers could serve as important calibrators to facilitate comparative and standardized α-syn biomarker studies going forward."
https://openalex.org/W2979792290,"Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii has been extensively studied in wild boars worldwide due to the emerging risk for human infection through meat consumption. However, this is the first study that reports toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in wild boars, wild boar hunters and their hunting dogs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in the complex wild boars, hunting dogs and hunters, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in southern and central-western Brazil. Overall, anti-T. gondii seropositivity was observed in 15/71 (21.1%) wild boars by modified agglutination test (MAT); and 49/157 (31.2%) hunting dogs and 15/49 (32.7%) hunters by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in Brazilian wild boars was within the national and international range, posting wild boars as potential environmental sentinels for T. gondii presence. In addition, the findings have comparatively shown that wild boars have been less exposed to infection than hunting dogs or hunters in both Brazilian regions. Seropositivity for T. gondii was statistically higher in 12/14 (85.7%) captured wild boars when compared to 5/57 (7.0%) free-range wild boars (p = 0.000001). Similarly, captured wild boars from anthropized areas were more likely to be seropositive than of natural regions (p = 0.000255). When in multiple regression model, dogs with the habit of wild boar hunting had significant more chance to be positive (adjusted-OR 4.62 CI 95% 1.16–18.42). Despite potential as sentinels of environmental toxoplasmosis, seroprevalence in wild boars alone may provide a biased basis for public health concerns; thus, hunters and hunting dogs should be always be included in such studies. Although hunters should be aware of potential T. gondii infection, wild boars from natural and agricultural areas may present lower protozoa load when compared to wild boars from anthropized areas, likely by the higher presence of domestic cats as definitive hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2979998001,"Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) show pain hypersensitivity and smooth muscle hypercontractility in response to colorectal distension (CRD). Synaptic plasticity, a key process of memory formation, in the enteric nervous system may be a novel explanation. This study aimed to explore the regulatory role of ephrinB2/ephB2 in enteric synaptic plasticity and colonic hyperreactive motility in IBS. Postinfectious (PI)‐IBS was induced by Trichinella spiralis infection in rats. Isometric contractions of colonic circular muscle strips, particularly neural‐mediated contractions, were recorded ex vivo. Meanwhile, ephrinB2/ephB2‐mediated enteric structural and functional synaptic plasticity were assessed in the colonic muscularis, indicating that ephrinB2 and ephB2 were located on enteric nerves and up‐regulated in the colonic muscularis of PI‐IBS rats. Colonic hypersensitivity to CRD and neural‐mediated colonic hypercontractility were present in PI‐IBS rats, which were correlated with increased levels of cellular homologous fos protein ( c‐fos ) and activity‐regulated cystoskeleton‐associated protein (arc), the synaptic plasticity‐related immediate early genes, and were ameliorated by ephB2Fc (an ephB2 receptor blocker) or MK801 (an NMDA receptor inhibitor) exposure. EphrinB2/ephB2 facilitated synaptic sprouting and NMDA receptor‐mediated synaptic potentiation in the colonic muscularis of PI‐IBS rats and in the longitudinal muscle‐myenteric plexus cultures, involving the Erk‐MAPK and PI3K‐protein kinase B pathways. In conclusion, ephrinB2/ephB2 promoted the synaptic sprouting and potentiation of myenteric nerves involved in persistent muscle hypercontractility and pain in PI‐IBS. Hence, ephrinB2/ephB2 may be an emerging target for the treatment of IBS.—Zhang, L., Wang, R., Bai, T., Xiang, X., Qian, W., Song, J., Hou, X.

Furthermore, alterations in the feline ocular surface microbiome over time or following topical antibiotic treatment are unknown. Aims of this study were to further characterize the ocular surface microbiome of healthy cats and to identify whether there are microbial community changes over time and following topical antibiotic use. Twenty-four eyes from twelve adult, research-bred, female spayed domestic shorthaired cats were evaluated. Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment (0.5%) was applied to the ocular surface of one randomly assigned eye per cat three times daily for 7 days, while the fellow eye served as an untreated control. The ocular surface was sampled by swabbing the inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes prior to initiating treatment (day 0), after 1 week of treatment (day 7), and 4 weeks after concluding treatment (day 35). Genomic DNA was extracted from the swabs and sequenced using primers that target the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. At baseline, the most common bacterial phyla identified were Proteobacteria (42.4%), Firmicutes (30.0%), Actinobacteria (15.6%), and Bacteroidetes (8.1%). The most abundant bacterial families sequenced were Corynebacteriaceae (7.8%), Helicobacteraceae (7.5%), Moraxellaceae (6.1%), and Comamonadaceae (5.6%). Alpha and beta diversity measurements were largely unchanged in both treatment and control eyes over time. However, univariate and linear discriminant analyses revealed significant and similar changes in the abundance of some bacterial taxa over time in both treatment and control eyes. Overall, the feline ocular surface microbiome remained stable over time and following topical antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2980230850,"An incursion of Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a previously FMD-free country can cause significant economic damage from immediate and prolonged closure of FMD-sensitive markets. Whilst emergency vaccination may help contain disease, the presence of vaccinated animals complicates post-outbreak management and the recovery of FMD-free status for return to trade. We present enhancements to the Australian Animal DISease (AADIS) model that allow comparisons of post-outbreak management strategies for vaccinated animals, for the purposes of securing the earliest possible return to trade. Two case studies are provided that compare the retention of vaccinated animals with removal for waste/salvage, and the impact on recovery of FMD-sensitive markets per OIE guidelines. It was found that a vaccinate-and-retain strategy was associated with lower post-outbreak management costs, however this advantage was outweighed by significantly higher trade losses. Under the assumptions of the study there was no cost advantage to salvaging the removed vaccinated animals."
https://openalex.org/W2979466589,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a fibrocartilaginous tissue critical for chewing and speaking. In patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), permanent tissue loss can occur. Recapitulating the complexity of TMDs in animal models is difficult, yet critical for the advent of new therapies. Synovial fluid from diseased human samples revealed elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Here, we propose to recapitulate these findings in mice by subjecting murine TMJs with TNF-alpha or CFA (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant) in mandibular condyle explant cultures and by local delivery in vivo using TMJ intra-articular injections. Both TNF-alpha and CFA delivery to whole mandibular explants and in vivo increased extracellular matrix deposition and increased cartilage thickness, while TNF-alpha treated explants had increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and degradative enzymes. Moreover, the application of TNF-alpha or CFA in both models reduced cell number. CFA delivery in vivo caused soft tissue inflammation, including pannus formation.

By excluding the tasks with poor acceptability (i.e., writing and picture description tasks) and increasing the items related to the remaining tasks, we showed that the PSP-tailored SAND Global Score is an acceptable, consistent and reliable tool to screen language disturbances in PSP. However, we failed to detect major differences in language involvement according to disease phenotype. Differently, we showed that patients with dementia present worse language performances.Taking into account specific disease features, the combination of the SAND subscores included in the PSP-tailored SAND better represents language abilities in PSP. Furthermore, we showed that language disturbances feature PSP patients irrespective of disease phenotype, but parallels the deterioration of the global cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2979696348,"Fitting cochlear implants, especially the precise determination of electrical hearing thresholds, is a time-consuming and complex task for patients as well as audiologists. Aim of the study was to develop a method that enables cochlear implant (CI) patients to determine their electrical hearing thresholds precisely and independently. Applicability and impact of this method on speech perception in noise at soft speech levels were evaluated.An adaptive psychoacoustic procedure for precise hearing threshold determination (precT) was implemented using MatLab (MathWorks) and a graphical user interface was created. Sound signals were calibrated with a CIC4-Implant-Decoder. Study design: A prospective study including 15 experienced adult cochlear implant users was conducted. Electrical hearing thresholds were determined using the automated precT procedure (auto-precT). Speech perception in noise at 50 dB SPL presentation levels was measured for three conditions: (P1) T-levels kept at the previously established T-levels; (P2) T-levels set to the hearing thresholds determined using auto-precT application; (P3) T-levels set 10 cu below the values determined with auto-precT.All subjects were able to perform the auto-precT application independently. T-levels were altered on average by an absolute value of 10.5 cu using auto-precT. Median speech reception thresholds were significantly improved from 2.5 dB SNR (P1) to 1.6 dB SNR (P2, p = 0.02). Speech perception was lowest using the globally lowered T-levels, median 2.9 dB SNR (P3, not significant compared to P1 and P2).The applicability of the developed auto-precT application was confirmed in the present clinical study. Patients benefited from adjusting previously established T-levels to the threshold levels determined by the auto-precT application. The integration of the application in the clinical fitting routine as well as a remote fitting software approach is recommended. Furthermore, future possibilities of auto-precT include the implementation of the application on tablets or smart phones."
https://openalex.org/W2979782999,"Background and aims The DE-PLAN was a European multicenter study, with the primary objective of testing whether a community-based lifestyle modification programme could serve as a means of primary prevention for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in high-risk individuals (based on the FINDRISC questionnaire). The aim of this study was to examine the impact of a 1-year community-based lifestyle intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in individuals from four participating European centers (Athens, Barcelona, Krakow, Kaunas), through a post-hoc analysis. Materials and methods Each center was allowed to implement different intervention strategies specifically tailored to the needs of their corresponding population sample. Before and after the intervention, participants underwent clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, an oral glucose tolerance test and lipid profile measurements. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the validated HRQOL-15D questionnaire. A difference of ±0.015 in the 15D questionnaire score was set as the threshold of clinically meaningful change. Results Data from 786 participants (67% females, mean age 59.7±9.4 years, BMI 31.5±4.5 kg/m2) with complete data regarding the HRQOL were analyzed (Athens: 104, Barcelona: 434, Krakow: 175, Kaunas: 70). After 1 year, a significant overall improvement in HRQOL was shown, as depicted by a change of 15D score from baseline value (0.88±0.9) to post-intervention (0.90±0.87, P<0.001), achieving the threshold of clinically meaningful change. A significant weight reduction was also observed (-0.8±4.0 kg, P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, improvement in HRQOL was independently associated with lower 15D score at baseline (P<0.001) and self-reported increase in overall exercise time (P<0.001) as assessed through specifically designed trial questionnaires. Conclusion A community-based lifestyle intervention programme aiming at T2D prevention, applied on a heterogeneous population and with varied methods, was shown to improve overall health-related quality of life to a clinically meaningful degree."

ΔNp63α, a proto-oncogene in the p53 family of transcription factors, is overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and associated with poor prognosis and survival. ΔNp63α elicits its tumorigenic effects in part by promoting cellular proliferation and cell survival. Despite its importance in SCC, the upstream regulation of ΔNp63α is poorly understood. In this study, we identify TIP60 as a novel upstream regulator of ΔNp63α. Using a combination of overexpression, silencing, stable expression, and pharmacological approaches in multiple cell lines, we showed that TIP60 up-regulates ΔNp63α expression. Utilizing cycloheximide treatment, we showed that TIP60 catalytic activity is required for stabilization of ΔNp63α protein levels. We further showed that TIP60 coexpression inhibits ΔNp63α ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Stabilization of ΔNp63α protein was further associated with TIP60-mediated acetylation. Finally, we demonstrated that TIP60-mediated regulation of ΔNp63α increases cellular proliferation by promoting G2/M progression through MTS assays and flow cytometry. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that TIP60 may contribute to SCC progression by increasing ΔNp63α protein levels, thereby promoting cellular proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2980221848,"Currently, many ischemic stroke patients worldwide suffer from physical and mental impairments, and thus have a low quality of life. However, although rehabilitation is acknowledged as an effective way to recover patients' health, there does not exist yet an adaptive training platform for animal tests so far. For this sake, this paper aims to develop an adaptive escalator (AE) for rehabilitation of rats with cerebral ischemia. Rats were observed to climb upward spontaneously, and a motor-driven escalator, equipped with a position detection feature and an acceleration/deceleration mechanism, was constructed accordingly as an adaptive training platform. The rehabilitation performance was subsequently rated using an incline test, a rotarod test, the infarction volume, the lesion volume, the number of MAP2 positive cells and the level of cortisol. This paper is presented in 3 parts as follows. Part 1 refers to the escalator mechanism design, part 2 describes the adaptive ladder-climbing rehabilitation mechanism, and part 3 discusses the validation of an ischemic stroke model. As it turned out, a rehabilitated group using this training platform, designated as the AE group, significantly outperformed a control counterpart in terms of a rotarod test. After the sacrifice of the rats, the AE group gave an average infarction volume of (34.36 ± 3.8)%, while the control group gave (66.41 ± 3.1)%, validating the outperformance of the escalator-based rehabilitation platform in a sense. An obvious difference between the presented training platform and conventional counterparts is the platform mechanism, and for the first time in the literature rats can be well and voluntarily rehabilitated at full capacity using an adaptive escalator. Taking into account the physical diversity among rats, the training strength provided was made adaptive as a reliable way to eliminate workout or secondary injury. Accordingly, more convincing arguments can be made using this mental stress-free training platform."
https://openalex.org/W2979511742,"The purpose of our present study was to assess the prognostic impact of FDG PET-CT after induction chemotherapy for patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).This retrospective study included 50 patients with inoperable stage II/III NSCLC from January 2012 to July 2015. They were treated for curative intent with induction chemotherapy, followed by concomitant chemoradiation therapy or sequential radiation therapy. FDG PET-CT scans were acquired at initial staging (PET1) and after the last cycle of induction therapy (PET2). Five parameters were evaluated on both scans: SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, TLG, MTV, and their respective deltas. The prognostic value of each parameter for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated with Cox proportional-hazards regression models.Median follow-up was 19 months. PET1 parameters, clinical and histopathological data were not predictive of the outcome. TLG2 and ΔTLG were prognostic factors for OS. TLG2 was the only prognostic factor for PFS. For OS, log-rank test showed that there was a better prognosis for patients with TLG2< 69g (HR = 7.1, 95%CI 2.8-18, p = 0.002) and for patients with ΔTLG< -81% after induction therapy (HR = 3.8, 95%CI 1.5-9.6, p = 0.02). After 2 years, the survival rate was 89% for the patients with low TLG2 vs 52% for the others. We also evaluated a composite parameter considering both MTV2 and ΔSUVmax. Patients with MTV2> 23cc and ΔSUVmax> -55% had significantly shorter OS than the other patients (HR = 5.7, 95%CI 2.1-15.4, p< 0.01).Post-induction FDG PET might be an added value to assess the patients' prognosis in inoperable stage II/III NSCLC. TLG, ΔTLG as well as the association of MTV and ΔSUVmax seemed to be valuable parameters, more accurate than clinical, pathological or pretherapeutic imaging data."
https://openalex.org/W2979797753,"Hypomagnesaemic tetany (HypoMgT) in ruminants is a physiological disorder caused by inadequate intake or impaired absorption of magnesium (Mg) in the gut. If it is not detected and treated in time, HypoMgT can cause the death of the affected animal. A semi-structured questionnaire survey was conducted from July 2016-2017 to assess farmers' awareness of HypoMgT in cattle and sheep in the UK. The questionnaire was distributed to farmers at farm business events and agricultural shows, and through a collaborative group of independent veterinary practices to their clients. Farmers were asked about (i) the incidence of presumed HypoMgT (PHT); (ii) their strategies to treat or prevent HypoMgT; (iii) mineral tests on animals, forage and soil, and (iv) farm enterprise type. A total of 285 responses were received from 82 cattle, 157 mixed cattle and sheep, and 46 sheep farmers, of whom 39% reported HypoMgT in their livestock, affecting 1-30 animals. Treatment and/or prevention against HypoMgT was reported by 96% respondents with PHT and 79% of those without. Mineral tests on animal, forage, and soil was conducted by 24%, 53%, and 66% of the respondents, respectively, regardless of PHT. There was a highly significant association between the use of interventions to tackle HypoMgT and the incidence of PHT (p < 0.01). The top three treatment/prevention strategies used were reported as being free access supplementation (149), in feed supplementation (59) and direct to animal treatments (drenches, boluses and injections) (45) although these did vary by farm type. Although some (9) reported using Mg-lime, no other pasture management interventions were reported (e.g., Mg-fertilisation or sward composition). Generally, the results indicate that UK farmers are aware of the risks of HypoMgT. A more integrated soil-forage-animal assessment may improve the effectiveness of tackling HypoMgT and help highlight the root causes of the problem."

This study investigates whether [18F]FLT transport proteins are regulated through hypoxia. Expression and function of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT)-1, hENT2, and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) were studied under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and assessed with [18F]FLT-PET in estrogen receptor positive (ER+)-MCF7, triple-negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer (BC) cells, and MCF10A cells (human mammary epithelial cells). Functional involvement of hENT2 [18F]FLT transport was demonstrated in all cell lines. In vitro [18F]FLT uptake was higher in MDA-MB231 than in MCF7: 242 ± 9 vs. 147 ± 18% radioactivity/mg protein after 60 min under normoxia. Hypoxia showed no significant change in radiotracer uptake. Protein analysis revealed increased hENT1 (P < 0.0963) in MDA-MB231. Hypoxia did not change expression of either hENT1, hENT2, or TK1. In vitro inhibition experiments suggested involvement of hENT1, hENT2, and human concentrative nucleoside transporters during [18F]FLT uptake into all cell lines. In vivo PET imaging revealed comparable tumor uptake in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 tumors over 60 min, reaching standardized uptake values of 0.96 ± 0.05 vs. 0.89 ± 0.08 (n = 3). Higher hENT1 expression in MDA-MB231 seems to drive nucleoside transport, whereas TK1 expression in MCF7 seems responsible for comparable [18F]FLT retention in ER+ tumors. Our study demonstrates that hypoxia does not significantly affect nucleoside transport as tested with [18F]FLT in BC.-Krys, D., Hamann, I., Wuest, M., Wuest, F.

https://openalex.org/W2979804650,"Cerebral hemodynamics after arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in children are largely unknown. This study aims to explore long-term cerebral perfusion balance of vital tissue and its relation to motor outcome after childhood AIS. Patients diagnosed with childhood AIS (≤16 years at diagnosis, time since stroke ≥2 years) and typically developing peers were examined. Hemiparesis was classified according to the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure. Manual ability was assessed using the ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire. Cerebral blood flow was measured by arterial spin labeling and analyzed in the following brain regions: the hemispheres, the territory of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and in subregions of the MCA territory (MCA anterior, middle, posterior). To assess cerebral perfusion balance, laterality indices were calculated using cerebral blood flow in the ipsi- and contralesional hemisphere. Laterality indices were compared between stroke patients with and without hemiparesis, and peers. Twenty participants diagnosed with AIS were included (12 boys, 8 girls; mean age 14.46±4.96 years; time since stroke 8.08±3.62 years); 9 (45%) were diagnosed with hemiparesis. Additionally, 47 typically developing peers (21 boys, 26 girls; mean age 14.24±5.42 years) were studied. Laterality indices were higher in stroke patients and oriented to the contralesional hemisphere in all brain regions except the ACA territory and MCA posterior subregion. This was significantly different from peers, who showed balanced laterality indices. There was a significant correlation between laterality indices and manual ability, except in the ACA territory. AIS is associated with long-term alterations of cerebral blood flow in vital tissue, even in patients without hemiparesis. The degree of imbalance of cerebral perfusion in children after AIS is associated with manual ability."
https://openalex.org/W2979814106,Significant phenotypic overlaps exist between autophagy and acidogenesis in Aspergillus niger. The possible role of autophagy in the acidogenic growth and metabolism of this fungus was therefore examined and the movement of cytosolic EGFP to vacuoles served to monitor this phenomenon. An autophagy response to typical as well as a metabolic inhibitor-induced nitrogen starvation was observed in A. niger mycelia. The vacuolar re-localization of cytosolic EGFP was not observed upon nitrogen starvation in the A. niger Δatg1 strain. The acidogenic growth of the fungus consisted of a brief log phase followed by an extended autophagy-like state throughout the idiophase of fermentation. Mycelia in the idiophase were highly vacuolated and EGFP was localized to the vacuoles but no autolysis was observed. Both autophagy and acidogenesis are compromised in Δatg1 and Δatg8 strains of A. niger. The acidogenic growth of the fungus thus appears to mimic a condition of nutrient limitation and is associated with an extended autophagy-like state. This crucial role of autophagy in acidogenic A. niger physiology could be of value in improving citric acid fermentation.

DLBCL can be subdivided into germinal centre B-cell like (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC or non-GCB) using a gene-expression based or an immunohistochemical approach. In this study we aimed to identify additional proteins that are differentially expressed between GCB and non-GCB DLBCL. A reference super-SILAC mix, including proteins of eight B-cell lymphoma cell lines, was mixed with proteins isolated from seven non-GCB DLBCL and five GCB DLBCL patient tissue samples to quantify protein levels. Protein identification and quantification was performed by LC-MS. We identified a total of 4289 proteins, with a four-fold significant difference in expression between non-GCB and GCB DLBCL for 37 proteins. Four proteins were selected for validation in the same cases and replication in an independent cohort of 47 DLBCL patients by immunohistochemistry. In the validation cohort, we observed a non-significant trend towards the same differential expression pattern as observed in the proteomics. The replication study showed significant and consistent differences for two of the proteins: expression of glomulin (GLMN) was higher in GCB DLBCL, while expression of ribosomal protein L23 (RPL23) was higher in non-GCB DLBCL. These proteins are functionally linked to important pathways involving MYC, p53 and angiogenesis. In summary, we showed increased expression of RPL23 and decreased expression of GLMN in non-GCB compared to GCB DLBCL on purified primary DLBCL patient samples and replicated these results in an independent patient cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2979583105,"In many data classification problems, a number of methods will give similar accuracy. However, when working with people who are not experts in data science such as doctors, lawyers, and judges among others, finding interpretable algorithms can be a critical success factor. Practitioners have a deep understanding of the individual input variables but far less insight into how they interact with each other. For example, there may be ranges of an input variable for which the observed outcome is significantly more or less likely. This paper describes an algorithm for automatic detection of such thresholds, called the Univariate Flagging Algorithm (UFA). The algorithm searches for a separation that optimizes the difference between separated areas while obtaining a high level of support. We evaluate its performance using six sample datasets and demonstrate that thresholds identified by the algorithm align well with published results and known physiological boundaries. We also introduce two classification approaches that use UFA and show that the performance attained on unseen test data is comparable to or better than traditional classifiers when confidence intervals are considered. We identify conditions under which UFA performs well, including applications with large amounts of missing or noisy data, applications with a large number of inputs relative to observations, and applications where incidence of the target is low. We argue that ease of explanation of the results, robustness to missing data and noise, and detection of low incidence adverse outcomes are desirable features for clinical applications that can be achieved with relatively simple classifier, like UFA."

In this study, we investigated Avastin's capacity to modulate VEGF165 binding to porcine aortic endothelial cells and to heparin and fibronectin (FN) across a range of pH values (pH 5–8). We observed that Avastin slightly enhanced VEGF binding to heparin and that heparin increased VEGF binding to Avastin.

The purpose of our study was to assess exercise capacity and sleep in patients with chronic constrictive pericarditis (CCP) undergoing a pericardiectomy. Methods We studied consecutive patients scheduled for pericardiectomy due to symptomatic CCP. Were performed quality of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire—MLHFQ) and sleep questionnaires (Epworth, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index—PSQI), serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), serum C-reactive protein, transthoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise test and overnight polysomnography immediately before and six months after pericardiectomy.

https://openalex.org/W2928931662,"Under current policy decision making paradigm, we make or evaluate a policy decision by intervening different socio-economic parameters and analyzing the impact of those interventions. This process involves identifying the causal relation between interventions and outcomes. Matching method is one of the popular techniques to identify such causal relations. However, in one-to-one matching, when a treatment or control unit has multiple pair assignment options with similar match quality, different matching algorithms often assign different pairs. Since, all the matching algorithms assign pair without considering the outcomes, it is possible that with same data and same hypothesis, different experimenters can make different conclusions. This problem becomes more prominent in case of large-scale observational studies. Recently, a robust approach is proposed to tackle the uncertainty which uses discrete optimization techniques to explore all possible assignments. Though optimization techniques are very efficient in its own way, they are not scalable to big data. In this work, we consider causal inference testing with binary outcomes and propose computationally efficient algorithms that are scalable to large-scale observational studies. By leveraging the structure of the optimization model, we propose a robustness condition which further reduces the computational burden. We validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by testing the causal relation between Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and readmission to different hospital (non-index readmission) on the State of California Patient Discharge Database from 2010 to 2014. Our result shows that HRRP has a causal relation with the increase in non-index readmission and the proposed algorithms proved to be highly scalable in testing causal relations from large-scale observational studies."
https://openalex.org/W2979371226,"Human cytomegalovirus (CVM) has been detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in brain tumours; however, whether CMV antigen is seen in melanomas has not yet been elucidated. Applying IHC, melanoma tissue was assessed for the expression of pp65, a tegument protein of CMV. Two cohorts were available, cohort-I and II, the latter included also related metastasis. In addition to IHC, in situ hybridisation (ISH) was carried out to assess whether CMV related genetic sequences were detectable in a subset of cases. Seventy per cent of the 142 cases in cohort-I and 50% of the 37 cases in cohort-II displayed immunoreactivity (IR). In both cohorts, the IHC outcome correlated with T-stage (Cohort I: Spearman 0.22, p = 0.01, Cohort II: Fisher exact text 0.04). In 30 of cohort-II cases, when IHC staining was carried out on both the primary tumour and the corresponding metastasis, no change in IR was noted in 53%; in 20%, the IR was lower and in 27% higher in the metastasis when compared with the primary tumour. These results were significant (Fisher exact test 0.03). Applying ISH technique on four tumour cases with detectable pp65 protein, CMV related genetic sequence was not detected. Here, we demonstrate, congruent with observations published for brain tumours, that the protein pp65 is indeed observed in substantial number of melanoma cases with IHC; however, no signal was detected with ISH technique. These findings are in line with previously reported studies, demonstrating that the role of CMV in tumours is still debatable."

> “There I was again, meticulously planning meals and obsessing over exercise.” 

It started 2 years into my Ph.D., after my comprehensive exam. I had always succeeded academically, aiming for a pedestal defined by others' standards. As I stepped in front of my exam committee, I was eager to dazzle. But I was told my hypothesis wasn't valid. I was chastised for lack of creativity. My simplistic sketch of the Golgi drew derisive snickers. Even though I passed, I believed I was a failure.

Suddenly, for the first time, I felt completely out of control. The result was debilitating stress and anxiety. Up to that point, I had never denied myself food, and I exercised for fun—not out of obligation. But the Instagram fitness influencer craze lured me into thinking I could take back control of my life by perfecting my physique.

What began as a seemingly harmless “lifestyle change” turned into orthorexia nervosa, an unhealthy obsession with supposedly healthy eating and exercise (but not body weight, in contrast to anorexia or bulimia). I spent my days using my research skills to methodically plan a restrictive diet complemented by a strict exercise routine. During lab meeting, instead of paying attention to the research being presented, my mind was fixated on the ideal ratio of carbs, fats, and protein. I spent more time weighing rice cakes and spinach than planning the experiments I needed to do to finish my manuscript. I often turned down social gatherings so that I could eat “safe” meals at home.

I had gained a false sense of control and suppressed my emotions, but the underlying problems were still there—and getting worse. Over 9 months, as my stress and anxiety increased, orthorexia developed into anorexia. I compulsively stepped on the scale multiple times a day and spat out food after chewing. I ate from the smallest dishes to give the illusion of a full plate and denied my audibly growling stomach the food it needed. I bruised from sitting in chairs and would black out upon standing. I couldn't sleep, and I jeopardized my relationships. I became a walking skeleton.

My family and adviser asked whether I was OK and suggested time away from lab, but my disordered brain made excuses for how I was feeling and behaving. I honestly believed I was thriving.

It wasn't until I stumbled across an article about disordered eating as a coping mechanism for mental health issues that I put a name to the problem. After 2 months of spiraling deeper into my disorder, thinking I could “fix” it on my own, I finally sought the help of a therapist.

I learned that my eating disorder had nothing to do with food, exercise, or weight; instead, it was about my desire to be exceptional. Through weekly sessions, I unpacked 25 years of needing to be perfect. I learned tools to acknowledge and process my feelings, instead of numbing them with calorie restriction and intense workouts.

Still, in times of stress the disordered part of my brain desperately clung to food deprivation. Restoring my weight took more than a year, as well as the help of a dietitian. Gradually I redefined food and exercise as sustenance for body and mind, not tools for suppressing uncomfortable feelings.

Now, a year and a half into my recovery, I am entering my final year of graduate school with a completely different mindset about the person I want—rather than need—to be. Yes, I still want to succeed. But I don't want to be perfect.

It is part of the type specimen of Deinonychus—the basis for the Velociraptor in the Jurassic Park movies. The black color signals something just as striking. The fossil isn9t just a mineral replica of the original claw. It is likely two-thirds dinosaur residue. That fossils can harbor organic matter isn9t new. Whole fields of science have sprung up to decipher ancient DNA and intact proteins. But in fossils as old as the Deinonychus claw, most of the useful sequences of those molecules have long vanished. Now, researchers at Yale have devised a way to extract information locked in degraded proteins. They have shown how, when conditions are right after an animal dies, cellular proteins can transform into a mix of hardy polymers that repel water, are inedible for microbes, are impervious to heat, and last for eons. They are now starting to apply their nondestructive technique to help solve paleontological mysteries such as where turtles fit on the vertebrate family tree, and whether an extinct animal was warm-blooded."

Melt from Greenland already accounts for 25% of global sea level rise, and its share is growing. Even by conservative estimates, Greenland could contribute another quarter-meter of sea level rise by 2100—within the lifetime of children living today. At Helheim Glacier, an ambitious new project is seeking to understand how Greenland9s 300 marine-terminating glaciers lose their ice in the island9s long, narrow fjords. The project will chart infiltrating warm Atlantic Ocean water, along with every angle of Helheim9s fracturing face. If successful, the researchers could help constrain an important uncertainty about the future of sea level rise."
