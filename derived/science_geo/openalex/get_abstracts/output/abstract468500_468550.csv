https://openalex.org/W1986283558,"Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns that mediate well established cytokine-driven pathways, activating NF-κB together with IRF3/IRF7. In addition, TLR3 drives caspase 8-regulated programmed cell death pathways reminiscent of TNF family death receptor signaling. We find that inhibition or elimination of caspase 8 during stimulation of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, or TLR9 results in receptor interacting protein (RIP) 3 kinase-dependent programmed necrosis that occurs through either TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) or MyD88 signal transduction. TLR3 or TLR4 directly activates programmed necrosis through a RIP homotypic interaction motif-dependent association of TRIF with RIP3 kinase (also called RIPK3). In fibroblasts, this pathway proceeds independent of RIP1 or its kinase activity, but it remains dependent on mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) downstream of RIP3 kinase. Here, we describe two small molecule RIP3 kinase inhibitors and employ them to demonstrate the common requirement for RIP3 kinase in programmed necrosis induced by RIP1-RIP3, DAI-RIP3, and TRIF-RIP3 complexes. Cell fate decisions following TLR signaling parallel death receptor signaling and rely on caspase 8 to suppress RIP3-dependent programmed necrosis whether initiated directly by a TRIF-RIP3-MLKL pathway or indirectly via TNF activation and the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL necroptosis pathway."

In this paper, a new denoising methodology is proposed that takes into consideration the multicomponent nature of multi-directional DWI datasets such as those employed in diffusion imaging. This new filter reduces random noise in multicomponent DWI by locally shrinking less significant Principal Components using an overcomplete approach. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art methods using synthetic and real clinical MR images, showing improved performance in terms of denoising quality and estimation of diffusion parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2069050894,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a key mediator in the development of many cancers. For 20 years, it has been assumed that Stat3 mediates its biological activities as a nuclear localized transcription factor activated by many cytokines. However, recent studies from this laboratory and others indicate that Stat3 has an independent function in the mitochondria (mitoStat3) where it controls the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) and mediates Ras-induced transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts. The actions of mitoStat3 in controlling respiration and Ras transformation are mediated by the phosphorylation state of serine 727. To address the role of mitoStat3 in the pathogenesis of cells that are transformed, we used 4T1 breast cancer cells, which form tumors that metastasize in immunocompetent mice. Substitution of Ser-727 for an alanine or aspartate in Stat3 that has a mitochondrial localization sequence, MLS-Stat3, has profound effects on tumor growth, complex I activity of the ETC, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cells expressing MLS-Stat3(S727A) display slower tumor growth, decreased complex I activity of the ETC, and increased ROS accumulation under hypoxia compared with cells expressing MLS-Stat3. In contrast, cells expressing MLS-Stat3(S727D) show enhanced tumor growth and complex I activity and decreased production of ROS. These results highlight the importance of serine 727 of mitoStat3 in breast cancer and suggest a novel role for mitoStat3 in regulation of ROS concentrations through its action on the ETC.Background: A pool of the nuclear transcription factor Stat3 in the mitochondria (mitoStat3) controls respiration and Ras transformation.Results: Serine phosphorylation of mitoStat3 controls accumulation of reactive oxygen species and growth of breast cancer in mice.Conclusion: These results provide the first evidence for a mechanism by which mitoStat3 contributes to tumorigenesis.Significance: The data suggest new therapeutic approaches to treatment of breast cancer.

https://openalex.org/W1964087334,"Exopolysaccharides were isolated and purified from Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785, which has previously been shown to act as a competitive exclusion agent to control Clostridium perfringens in poultry. Structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy revealed that L. johnsonii FI9785 can produce two types of exopolysaccharide: EPS-1 is a branched dextran with the unusual feature that every backbone residue is substituted with a 2-linked glucose unit, and EPS-2 was shown to have a repeating unit with the following structure: -6)-α-Glcp-(1–3)-β-Glcp-(1–5)-β-Galf-(1–6)-α-Glcp-(1–4)-β-Galp-(1–4)-β-Glcp-(1-. Sites on both polysaccharides were partially occupied by substituent groups: 1-phosphoglycerol and O-acetyl groups in EPS-1 and a single O-acetyl group in EPS-2. Analysis of a deletion mutant (ΔepsE) lacking the putative priming glycosyltransferase gene located within a predicted eps gene cluster revealed that the mutant could produce EPS-1 but not EPS-2, indicating that epsE is essential for the biosynthesis of EPS-2. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the localization of galactose residues on the exterior of wild type cells and their absence in the ΔepsE mutant. EPS2 was found to adopt a random coil structural conformation. Deletion of the entire 14-kb eps cluster resulted in an acapsular mutant phenotype that was not able to produce either EPS-2 or EPS-1. Alterations in the cell surface properties of the EPS-specific mutants were demonstrated by differences in binding of an anti-wild type L. johnsonii antibody. These findings provide insights into the biosynthesis and structures of novel exopolysaccharides produced by L. johnsonii FI9785, which are likely to play an important role in biofilm formation, protection against harsh environment of the gut, and colonization of the host.Background: Bacterial cell surface polysaccharides are important in pathogenesis, cell adhesion, and protection against harsh environments.Results: Two novel exopolysaccharide (EPS) structures were identified in Lactobacillus johnsonii.Conclusion: The eps cluster is essential for production of both EPS, but epsE is required only for the heteropolymer.Significance: This study will guide functional analysis of EPS in survival and colonization of gut commensals.

Heteropolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 153-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). They have been shown to be important for the genus Lactobacillus for their putative roles in colonization, adhesion, stress resistance, host-bacteria interactions, and also immunomodulation, which are all important properties related to their probiotic functions (3.Delcour J.

EPS are also of considerable interest to the food industry, due to their rheological properties and GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status (1.Badel S. Bernardi T. Michaud P. New perspectives for lactobacilli exopolysaccharides.Biotechnol. Adv. 2011; 29: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The structure of bacterial EPS has a wide diversity among different species due to the different sugar monomers and glycosidic linkages present in their repeating units. Those containing only one type of sugar molecule are described as homopolysaccharides, whereas heteropolysaccharides are composed of different sugar monomers (2.De Vuyst L. Degeest B.

Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 is a poultry-derived isolate that is being investigated as a potential probiotic that may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control Clostridium perfringens (6.La Ragione R.M. Narbad A. Gasson M.J. Woodward M.J. In vivo characterization of Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; 38: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). C. perfringens is a cause of human food poisoning, but some strains are also responsible for necrotic enteritis in poultry, causing problems of animal welfare as well as huge economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. L. johnsonii FI9785 has been shown to adhere well to tissue culture and chick gut explant tissues, out-competing pathogenic bacteria in challenge models. However, the mode of action by which L. johnsonii FI9785 achieves this protective effect is unknown. L. johnsonii 142 and L. johnsonii NCC533 have also been shown to produce capsular EPS, and deletion of the eps cluster in the strain NCC533 resulted in an acapsular phenotype and affected residence time in the murine gut (7.Górska S. Jachymek W. Rybka J. Strus M. Heczko P.B. Gamian A. Structural and immunochemical studies of neutral exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii 142.Carbohydr. Res. 2010; 345: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8.Denou E. Pridmore R.D. Berger B. Panoff J.M. Arigoni F. Brüssow H. Identification of genes associated with the long-gut-persistence phenotype of the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 using a combination of genomics and transcriptome analysis.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3161-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of the capsular EPS and the mechanism of the biosynthesis for the genus Lactobacillus. Previously, the genome of L. johnsonii FI9785 was shown to include a 14.9-kb region that harbors 14 putative genes that may be responsible for the EPS biosynthesis in this strain (Fig. 1) (9.Horn N. Wegmann U. Dertli E. Mulholland F. Collins S.R. Waldron K.W. Bongaerts R.J. Mayer M.J. Narbad A. Spontaneous mutations reveals influence of exopolysaccharide on Lactobacillus johnsonii surface characteristics.PloS One. 2013; 8: e59957Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The predicted roles of these genes include regulation of sugar biosynthesis, chain length determination, biosynthesis of the repeating unit, polymerization, and export. This cluster has six putative genes encoding glycosyltransferases, which transfer a sugar moiety to the activated acceptor molecule (2.De Vuyst L. Degeest B. Heteropolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 153-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 10.Jolly L. Newell J. Porcelli I. Vincent S.J. Stingele F. Lactobacillus helveticus glycosyltransferases. From genes to carbohydrate synthesis.Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). On the basis of homology to conserved domains, the product of the first glycosyltransferase gene, epsE, was predicted to initiate the capsular EPS biosynthesis by adding the first sugar to the undecaprenylphosphate, whereas another gene in this cluster, epsC, was predicted to encode a tyrosine-protein kinase involved in regulation of capsular EPS biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Changes in the eps cluster resulted in alterations in the accumulation level of EPS in derivatives of L. johnsonii FI9785; a ΔepsE deletion mutant was still able to produce EPS but in lower quantities, whereas an increase in EPS production was observed for a spontaneous epsCD88N mutant (9.Horn N. Wegmann U. Dertli E. Mulholland F. Collins S.R. Waldron K.W. Bongaerts R.J. Mayer M.J. Narbad A. Spontaneous mutations reveals influence of exopolysaccharide on Lactobacillus johnsonii surface characteristics.PloS One. 2013; 8: e59957Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to understand the changes in EPS production after these mutations, knowledge of the primary structure of the EPS produced by the wild type and derivative strains is a prerequisite. In the present study, we identified the structure of two different capsular EPS produced by L. johnsonii FI9785. We also investigated strains with mutations in specific genes of the eps cluster to examine effects on the structure and biosynthesis of these EPS polymers as well as on the cell surface structure of L. johnsonii FI9785. Moreover, we confirmed the localization of specific sugar residues in situ. These characterizations may help us to identify the importance of the structure of the capsular EPS to the bacterial cell surface, which may have an impact on colonization and pathogen exclusion by commensal resident gut bacteria. L. johnsonii FI9785 wild type strain and its derivatives, described previously (9.Horn N. Wegmann U. Dertli E. Mulholland F. Collins S.R. Waldron K.W. Bongaerts R.J. Mayer M.J. Narbad A.

The first 390 bp of the epsA gene and some upstream sequence was amplified using primers 5epsA_KpnF (5′-AAAGGTACCAAATTAAATAACAAGAG-3′) and epsA_R1 (5′-CGGTAAGTTAACTTTCATATCTCG-3′). The partial epsA product was then restricted and ligated into KpnI/XhoI-restricted pG+host9 (12.Maguin E. Prévost H. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. Efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other Gram-positive bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) using Fastlink DNA ligase (Epicenter). The ligation product was transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli MC1022, and positive colonies were selected with erythromycin (400 μg/ml) and confirmed by colony PCR using GoTaq polymerase (Promega) and primers pGhost1 (5′- AGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACG-3′) and pGhostR (5′-TACTACTGACAGCTTCCAAGG-3′). Plasmids were extracted using a plasmid minikit (Qiagen) and sequenced to confirm the partial epsA gene insertion. The final construct was named pG+host9epsAp. To amplify the partial FI9785_1170 gene with 280 bp of non-coding region, primers 1170F_SPLICECAT (5′-ACCTGCCCCGTTAGTAAAGGACAGTACT-3′) and 1170_ncR (5′-TATTAAGCTTTCCATTTCCTGC-3′) were used, introducing a tail for splice overlap extension PCR with the chloramphenicol resistance gene product and incorporating a HindIII restriction site, respectively. The products from these two reactions were then used as templates for splice overlap extension PCR together with the primer pair CAT_XHOF and 1170_ncR to produce a 1585-bp product. This was then digested with XhoI and HindIII and subcloned as before into pG+host9epsAp. The deletion plasmid was transformed into L. johnsonii FI9785 by electroporation (13.Horn N. Wegmann U.

Characterisation of a novel plasmid p9785S from Lactobacillus johnsonii FI9785.Plasmid. 2005; 54: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the method of gene replacement was performed as described by Denou et al. (8.Denou E. Pridmore R.D. Berger B. Panoff J.M. Arigoni F. Brüssow H. Identification of genes associated with the long-gut-persistence phenotype of the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 using a combination of genomics and transcriptome analysis.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3161-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on MRS plates supplemented with chloramphenicol at 30 °C as the permissive temperature for plasmid replication followed by inoculation in MRS broth supplemented with chloramphenicol (7.5 μg/ml) at 42 °C as the non-permissive temperature for five serial passages. The culture was diluted and plated on MRS containing chloramphenicol at 42 °C to obtain single colonies that were replica-plated onto MRS agar with chloramphenicol and MRS with erythromycin to identify EryS, CmR clones. A positive clone was selected, and the deletion of the eps cluster was confirmed by PCR (L. johnsonii Δeps_cluster). 100 μl of 25% glutaraldehyde was added to a 1-ml bacterial suspension in an Eppendorf tube and left to fix for 1.5 h. The suspensions were centrifuged and washed three times in 0.05 m sodium cacodylate buffer. After the final wash, the cell pellets were mixed 1:1 with molten 2% low melting point agarose (Type VII; Sigma), which was solidified by chilling and chopped into small pieces (∼1 mm3). The sample pieces were left overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.05 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2). The samples were transferred to a Leica EM TP tissue processor (Leica Microsystems UK Ltd., Milton Keynes) where they were washed; postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.05 m sodium cacodylate for 2 h; washed; and dehydrated through an ethanol series (30, 50, 70, 90, and 100% × 2) with 1 h between each change. The samples were infiltrated with a 1:1 mix of LR White medium grade resin (London Resin Company Ltd.) to 100% ethanol, followed by a 2:1 and a 3:1 mix and finally 100% resin, with 1 h between each change. This was followed by two more changes into fresh 100% resin, with periods of 8 h between. Six tissue blocks from each sample were placed into gelatin capsules with fresh resin and polymerized overnight at 60 °C. Sections ∼90 nm thick were cut using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut E, Reichert-Jung) collected on film/carbon-coated copper grids, and stained sequentially with uranyl acetate (saturated in 50% ethanol) and Reynold's lead citrate. Sections were examined and imaged in an FEI Tecnai G2 20 Twin transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. Exopolysaccharides were isolated from 500-ml cultures of bacteria grown for 2 days at 37 °C in MRS broth as described previously (9.Horn N. Wegmann U. Dertli E. Mulholland F. Collins S.R. Waldron K.W. Bongaerts R.J. Mayer M.J. Narbad A. Spontaneous mutations reveals influence of exopolysaccharide on Lactobacillus johnsonii surface characteristics.PloS One. 2013; 8: e59957Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to the capsular EPS isolated from the bacterial cell pellets, the capsular EPS that was retained in the supernatant during the centrifugation steps was also harvested and processed separately. These fractions were designated as pellet and supernatant EPS preparations. Silicon nitride AFM tips (PNP-TR, Nanoworld AG) were functionalized using a four-step procedure (carried out at 21 °C). The first step involved incubation of the tips in a 2% solution of (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich) in toluene (dried over a 4-Å molecular sieve) for 1 h, followed by washing with toluene and then chloroform. In the second step, the silanized tips were incubated for 1 h in a 0.1% solution of a heterobifunctional linker, MAL-PEG-SCM, 2 kDa (Creative PEGWorks) in chloroform. Unbound linker was washed off with chloroform, and the tips were dried with argon. The third step involved covalent attachment of a lectin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA1; Sigma-Aldrich) by incubation of the tips in 1 mg/ml solutions of the lectin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 for 1 h at 21 °C, followed by a PBS washing step. The fourth step involved incubation of the lectin-functionalized cantilevers in a 10 mg/ml solution of glycine in PBS to “amine”-cap any unreacted succinimide groups, followed by washing in PBS. Lectin-functionalized tips were stored under PBS at 4 °C overnight before use. Extracted EPS samples were covalently attached to glass slides using the procedure described above but with a different intermediate linker. The glass was initially functionalized with (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and then a 2 mm solution of a carbohydrate-binding heterobifunctional linker γ-maleimidophenylbutyric acid hydrazide hydrochloride in methanol was incubated on the slide for 1 h at 21 °C, followed by a methanol rinsing step. Next, solutions of the extracted EPS samples (0.1% in PBS) were incubated on the slides for 1 h at 21 °C and then rinsed with PBS. Finally, slides were incubated in 10 mg/ml solutions of glucose in PBS to sugar-cap any remaining unreacted hydrazide groups. Force mapping measurements on the EPS-coated slides were carried out as below. Bacterial cells were electrostatically attached to glass slides to enable force mapping to be carried out in aqueous buffer. Freshly washed glass slides were incubated in a 0.01% solution of poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 20 °C. Treated slides were drained and dried for 1 h at 60 °C and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Bacterial cell suspensions (∼108 cells/ml) in distilled water were incubated on the treated slides for 1 h. The slides were rinsed with distilled water to remove any non-adherent cells, and excess liquid was removed before insertion into the liquid cell of the atomic force microscope, where they were immersed in PBS. All binding measurements on cell surfaces were carried out under PBS using a MFP-3D BIO atomic force microscope (Asylum Research Inc.). The experimental data were captured in “force-volume” mode (at a rate of 2 μm/s in the z direction and at a scan rate of 1 Hz and a pixel density of 32 × 32). In this mode, the instrument ramps the z piezo element of the scanner by a predetermined amount at each sample point over a selected scan area and records the subsequent deflection of the cantilever as it is pushed into (maximum load force, 300 pN) and then retracted away from the sample surface. This produces a matrix of 1024 force versus distance curves relating to the image coordinates. The spring constant, k, of the cantilevers was determined by fitting the thermal noise spectra (14.Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Calibration of atomic force microscope tips.Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3413) Google Scholar), yielding typical values in the range 0.01–0.04 newtons/m. Adhesion in force spectra was quantified using a bespoke Excel macro (15.Gunning A.P. Chambers S. Pin C. Man A.L. Morris V.J. Nicoletti C. Mapping specific adhesive interactions on living human intestinal epithelial cells with atomic force microscopy.FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which fits a straight line to the base line of the retract portion of the force-distance data, and wormlike chain fitting of the adhesion peaks was performed using a routine in the instrument's software. L. johnsonii FI9785 was grown in MRS, and the cells were inactivated with 1% formalin and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Inactivated cells were dialyzed against PBS. Polyclonal anti-wild type antibodies were raised in rabbits by BioGenes (Germany) to a titer of >1:200,000. The specificity of the antibody was tested by ELISA (16.Mackenzie D.A. Jeffers F. Parker M.L. Vibert-Vallet A. Bongaerts R.J. Roos S. Walter J. Juge N. Strain-specific diversity of mucus-binding proteins in the adhesion and aggregation properties of Lactobacillus reuteri.Microbiology. 2010; 156: 3368-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Wild type and derivative strains were grown to stationary phase, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in PBS to an optical density (A600) of 1.0. Cells were transferred (100 μl/well) onto a normal binding microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One); BSA (1 mg/ml in PBS) was included as a negative control. 25 μl of diluted antibody (1:200 in PBS) was added per well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 175 μl of PBS was added to each well, the plate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) (1:750 in PBS) solution. The antibody-bacteria complexes were then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. PBS (200 μl) was added to each well, and the antibody responses to the strains were measured as the median fluorescence from the green fluorescein, detected via PMT sensors in channel FL1 (530/30) at 568–583 nm in a FC500 cytometer (Beckman Coulter). A total of 20,000 events/sample were acquired at a low rate. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar). NMR samples were prepared by adding 600 μl of D2O to ∼1 mg of each lyophilized polysaccharide, followed by vigorous mixing and centrifugation. Supernatants (550 μl) were transferred to 5-mm NMR tubes. Spectra were measured at 600 MHz (1H) and 150 MHz (13C) using a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Sample temperature was set at 300 K for an initial 1H NMR screening of all samples and at 338 K for subsequent two-dimensional and 13C NMR studies of the wild type, epsCD88N, and ΔepsE samples. The 90° pulses were 9.1 μs (1H) and 10 μs (13C), and spectra were acquired with presaturation of the residual HDO signal using standard Bruker methods and parameters (name of the pulse sequence is shown in italic type, followed by the number of scans for each experiment (NS)): 1H (noesygppr1d, NS = 64); 13C (zgpg30, NS = 20,000); COSY (cosygpmfqfpr, NS = 32); TOCSY (mlevphpr.2, NS = 32, mixing time = 100 ms); ROESY (roesyphpr, NS = 24, mixing ti"

We have recently shown that cholesterol regulates representative members of the Kir family and that in the majority of the cases, cholesterol suppresses channel function. Furthermore, recent data indicate that cholesterol regulates Kir channels by specific sterol-protein interactions, yet the location of the cholesterol binding site in Kir channels is unknown. Using a combined computational-experimental approach, we show that cholesterol may bind to two nonanular hydrophobic regions in the transmembrane domain of Kir2.1 located between adjacent subunits of the channel. The location of the binding regions suggests that cholesterol modulates channel function by affecting the hinging motion at the center of the pore-lining transmembrane helix that underlies channel gating either directly or through the interface between the N and C termini of the channel."

Cryptococcus neoformans variety grubii (serotype A) is the major causative agent of this disease. In the present study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using the ISHAM MLST consensus scheme for the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex was used to analyse nucleotide polymorphisms among 476 isolates of this pathogen obtained from 8 Asian countries. Population genetic analysis showed that the Asian C. neoformans var. grubii population shows limited genetic diversity and demonstrates a largely clonal mode of reproduction when compared with the global MLST dataset. HIV-status, sequence types and geography were found to be confounded. However, a correlation between sequence types and isolates from HIV-negative patients was observed among the Asian isolates. Observations of high gene flow between the Middle Eastern and the Southeastern Asian populations suggest that immigrant workers in the Middle East were originally infected in Southeastern Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2062849515,"Existing methods for predicting protein crystallization obtain high accuracy using various types of complemented features and complex ensemble classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers. It is desirable to develop a simple and easily interpretable prediction method with informative sequence features to provide insights into protein crystallization. This study proposes an ensemble method, SCMCRYS, to predict protein crystallization, for which each classifier is built by using a scoring card method (SCM) with estimating propensity scores of p-collocated amino acid (AA) pairs (p=0 for a dipeptide). The SCM classifier determines the crystallization of a sequence according to a weighted-sum score. The weights are the composition of the p-collocated AA pairs, and the propensity scores of these AA pairs are estimated using a statistic with optimization approach. SCMCRYS predicts the crystallization using a simple voting method from a number of SCM classifiers. The experimental results show that the single SCM classifier utilizing dipeptide composition with accuracy of 73.90% is comparable to the best previously-developed SVM-based classifier, SVM_POLY (74.6%), and our proposed SVM-based classifier utilizing the same dipeptide composition (77.55%). The SCMCRYS method with accuracy of 76.1% is comparable to the state-of-the-art ensemble methods PPCpred (76.8%) and RFCRYS (80.0%), which used the SVM and Random Forest classifiers, respectively. This study also investigates mutagenesis analysis based on SCM and the result reveals the hypothesis that the mutagenesis of surface residues Ala and Cys has large and small probabilities of enhancing protein crystallizability considering the estimated scores of crystallizability and solubility, melting point, molecular weight and conformational entropy of amino acids in a generalized condition. The propensity scores of amino acids and dipeptides for estimating the protein crystallizability can aid biologists in designing mutation of surface residues to enhance protein crystallizability.

https://openalex.org/W2026317593,"Background Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) signalling regulates murine hepatic fibrogenesis through effects on hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and obesity-related hypertension with SNS activation accelerates progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the commonest cause of chronic liver disease. NAFLD may lead to cirrhosis. The effects of the SNS neurotransmitters norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) on human primary HSC (hHSC) function and in NAFLD pathogenesis are poorly understood. Aims to determine the mechanistic effects of NE/EPI/NPY on phenotypic changes in cultured hHSC, and to study SNS signalling in human NAFLD livers. Methods Freshly isolated hHSC were assessed for expression of cathecholamine/neuropeptide Y receptors and for the synthesis of NE/EPI. The effects of NE/EPI/NPY and adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (PRZ)/propranolol (PRL) on hHSC fibrogenic functions and the involved kinases and interleukin pathways were examined. Human livers with proven NAFLD were then assessed for upregulation of SNS signalling components. Results Activated hHSC express functional α/β-adrenoceptors and NPY receptors, which are upregulated in the livers of patients with cirrhotic NAFLD. hHSC in culture synthesize and release NE/EPI, required for their optimal basal growth and survival. Exogenous NE/EPI and NPY dose-dependently induced hHSC proliferation, mediated via p38 MAP, PI3K and MEK signalling. NE and EPI but not NPY increased expression of collagen-1α2 via TGF-β without involvement of the pro-fibrogenic cytokines leptin, IL-4 and IL-13 or the anti-fibrotic cytokine IL-10. Conclusions hHSC synthesize and require cathecholamines for optimal survival and fibrogenic functionality. Activated hHSC express directly fibrogenic α/β-adrenoceptors and NPY receptors, upregulated in human cirrhotic NAFLD. Adrenoceptor and NPY antagonists may be novel anti-fibrotic agents in human NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2069156386,"In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), misfolded or improperly assembled proteins are exported to the cytoplasm and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ER-associated E3 ligases, which coordinate substrate recognition, export, and proteasome targeting, are key components of ERAD. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is one ERAD substrate targeted to co-translational degradation by the E3 ligase RNF5/RMA1. RNF185 is a RING domain-containing polypeptide homologous to RNF5. We show that RNF185 controls the stability of CFTR and of the CFTRΔF508 mutant in a RING- and proteasome-dependent manner but does not control that of other classical ERAD model substrates. Reciprocally, its silencing stabilizes CFTR proteins. Turnover analyses indicate that, as RNF5, RNF185 targets CFTR to co-translational degradation. Importantly, however, simultaneous depletion of RNF5 and RNF185 profoundly blocks CFTRΔF508 degradation not only during translation but also after synthesis is complete. Our data thus identify RNF185 and RNF5 as a novel E3 ligase module that is central to the control of CFTR degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2088254637,"The mitochondrial enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase, which is encoded by the CYP27B1 gene, converts 25OHD to the biological active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). Renal 1α-hydroxylase activity is the principal determinant of the circulating 1,25(OH)2D concentration and enzyme activity is tightly regulated by several factors. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) decreases serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations by suppressing CYP27B1 mRNA abundance in mice. In extra-renal tissues, 1α-hydroxylase is responsible for local 1,25(OH)2D synthesis, which has important paracrine actions, but whether FGF-23 regulates CYP27B1 gene expression in extra-renal tissues is unknown. We sought to determine whether FGF-23 regulates CYP27B1 transcription in the kidney and whether extra-renal tissues are target sites for FGF-23-induced suppression of CYP27B1. In HEK293 cells transfected with the human CYP27B1 promoter, FGF-23 suppressed promoter activity by 70%, and the suppressive effect was blocked by CI-1040, a specific inhibitor of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2. To examine CYP27B1 transcriptional activity in vivo, we crossed fgf-23 null mice with mice bearing the CYP27B1 promoter-driven luciferase transgene (1α-Luc). In the kidney of FGF-23 null/1α-Luc mice, CYP27B1 promoter activity was increased by 3-fold compared to that in wild-type/1α-Luc mice. Intraperitoneal injection of FGF-23 suppressed renal CYP27B1 promoter activity and protein expression by 26% and 60% respectively, and the suppressive effect was blocked by PD0325901, an ERK1/2 inhibitor. These findings provide evidence that FGF-23 suppresses CYP27B1 transcription in the kidney. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in FGF-23 null/1α-Luc mice, CYP27B1 promoter activity and mRNA abundance are increased in several extra-renal sites. In the heart of FGF-23 null/1α-Luc mice, CYP27B1 promoter activity and mRNA were 2- and 5-fold higher, respectively, than in control mice. We also observed a 3- to 10-fold increase in CYP27B1 mRNA abundance in the lung, spleen, aorta and testis of FGF-23 null/1α-Luc mice. Thus, we have identified novel extra-renal target sites for FGF-23-mediated regulation of CYP27B1."

A description of some 30 new tracksites and data on sedimentary environments, track occurrence and preservation, ichnology and chronostratigraphy are provided. These new track localities represent various facies types within a diverse set of fluvial environments. The footprint discoveries mostly represent hadrosaurian and, less abundantly, to sauropod dinosaurs. The hadrosaur tracks are significantly smaller in size than, but morphologically similar to, those of North America and Asia and are attributable to the ichnogenus Hadrosauropodus. The track succession, with more than 40 distinct track levels, indicates that hadrosaur footprints in the Ibero-Armorican region occur predominantly in the late Maaastrichtian (at least above the early Maastrichtian–late Maastrichtian boundary). The highest abundance is found noticeably found in the late Maastrichtian, with tracks occurring in the C29r magnetochron, within about the latest 300,000 years of the Cretaceous."
https://openalex.org/W2085077742,"Endocytic recycling involves the return of membranes and receptors to the plasma membrane following their internalization into the cell. Recycling generally occurs from a series of vesicular and tubular membranes localized to the perinuclear region, collectively known as the endocytic recycling compartment. Within this compartment, receptors are sorted into tubular extensions that later undergo vesiculation, allowing transport vesicles to move along microtubules and return to the cell surface where they ultimately undergo fusion with the plasma membrane. Recent studies have led to the hypothesis that the C-terminal Eps15 homology domain (EHD) ATPase proteins are involved in the vesiculation process. Here, we address the functional roles of the four EHD proteins. We developed a novel semipermeabilized cell system in which addition of purified EHD proteins to reconstitute vesiculation allows us to assess the ability of each protein to vesiculate MICAL-L1-decorated tubular recycling endosomes (TREs). Using this assay, we show that EHD1 vesiculates membranes, consistent with enhanced TRE generation observed upon EHD1 depletion. EHD4 serves a role similar to that of EHD1 in TRE vesiculation, whereas EHD2, despite being capable of vesiculating TREs in the semipermeabilized cells, fails to do so in vivo. Surprisingly, the addition of EHD3 causes tubulation of endocytic membranes in our semipermeabilized cell system, consistent with the lack of tubulation observed upon EHD3 depletion. Our novel vesiculation assay and in vitro electron microscopy analysis, combined with in vivo data, provide evidence that the functions of both EHD1 and EHD4 are primarily in TRE membrane vesiculation, whereas EHD3 is a membrane-tubulating protein."
https://openalex.org/W2015506319,"The gastrointestinal tract of animals is adapted to their primary source of food to optimize resource use and energy intake. Temperate bat species mainly feed on arthropods. These contain the energy-rich carbohydrate chitin, which is indigestible for the endogenous enzymes of a typical mammalian gastrointestinal tract. However, the gastrointestinal tract of bat species should be adapted to their diet and be able to digest chitin. We hypothesized that (i) European vespertilionid bat species have the digestive enzyme chitinase and that (ii) the chitinolytic activity is located in the intestine, as has been found for North American bat species. The gastrointestinal tracts of seven bat species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Plecotus auritus, Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri, Myotis daubentonii, Myotis myotis, and Nyctalus leisleri) were tested for chitinolytic activity by diffusion assay. Gastrointestinal tracts of P. pipistrellus, P. auritus, M. nattereri, M. myotis, and N. leisleri were examined for acidic mammalian chitinase by western blot analysis. Tissue sections of the gastrointestinal tract of P. pipistrellus were immunohistochemically analyzed to locate the acidic mammalian chitinase. Chitinolytic activity was detected in the stomachs of all bat species. Western blot analysis confirmed the acidic mammalian chitinase in stomach samples. Immunohistochemistry of the P. pipistrellus gastrointestinal tract indicated that acidic mammalian chitinase is located in the stomach chief cells at the base of the gastric glands. In conclusion, European vespertilionid bat species have acidic mammalian chitinase that is produced in the gastric glands of the stomach. Therefore, the gastrointestinal tracts of insectivorous bat species evolved an enzymatic adaptation to their diet."
https://openalex.org/W2144102293,"Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation and H2A monoubiquitination (ubH2A) are two closely related histone modifications that regulate Polycomb silencing. Previous studies reported that H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) rarely coexists with H3K36 di- or tri-methylation (H3K36me2/3) on the same histone H3 tails, which is partially controlled by the direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity of H3K27-specific methyltransferase PRC2. By contrast, H3K27 methylation does not affect the catalytic activity of H3K36-specific methyltransferases, suggesting other Polycomb mechanism(s) may negatively regulate the H3K36-specific methyltransferase(s). In this study, we established a simple protocol to purify milligram quantities of ubH2A from mammalian cells, which were used to reconstitute nucleosome substrates with fully ubiquitinated H2A. A number of histone methyltransferases were then tested on these nucleosome substrates. Notably, all of the H3K36-specific methyltransferases, including ASH1L, HYPB, NSD1, and NSD2 were inhibited by ubH2A, whereas the other histone methyltransferases, including PRC2, G9a, and Pr-Set7 were not affected by ubH2A. Together with previous reports, these findings collectively explain the mutual repulsion of H3K36me2/3 and Polycomb modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2078215704,"We have previously described apolipoprotein B (apoB)-dependent and -independent cholesterol absorption pathways and the role of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in these pathways. To assess the contribution of these pathways to cholesterol absorption and to determine whether there are other pathways, we generated mice that lack MTP and ABCA1, individually and in combination, in the intestine. Intestinal deletions of Mttp and Abca1 decreased plasma cholesterol concentrations by 45 and 24%, respectively, whereas their combined deletion reduced it by 59%. Acute cholesterol absorption was reduced by 28% in the absence of ABCA1, and it was reduced by 92-95% when MTP was deleted in the intestine alone or together with ABCA1. MTP deficiency significantly reduced triglyceride absorption, although ABCA1 deficiency had no effect. ABCA1 deficiency did not affect cellular lipids, but Mttp deficiency significantly increased intestinal levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids. Accumulation of intestinal free fatty acids, but not triglycerides, in Mttp-deficient intestines was prevented when mice were also deficient in intestinal ABCA1. Combined deficiency of these genes increased intestinal fatty acid oxidation as a consequence of increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α). These studies show that intestinal MTP and ABCA1 are critical for lipid absorption and are the main determinants of plasma and intestinal lipid levels. Reducing their activities might lower plasma lipid concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2164355983,"Teleost fishes exhibit wide and temporally stable inter-individual variation in a suite of aerobic and anaerobic locomotor traits. One mechanism that could allow such variation to persist within populations is the presence of tradeoffs between aerobic and anaerobic performance, such that individuals with a high capacity for one type of performance have a reduced capacity for the other. We investigated this possibility in European seabass Dicentrarchuslabrax, each measured for a battery of indicators of maximum locomotor performance. Aerobic traits comprised active metabolic rate, aerobic scope for activity, maximum aerobic swimming speed, and stride length, using a constant acceleration test. Anaerobic traits comprised maximum speed during an escape response, maximum sprint speed, and maximum anaerobic burst speed during constant acceleration. The data provided evidence of significant variation in performance among individuals, but there was no evidence of any trade-offs among any traits of aerobic versus anaerobic swimming performance. Furthermore, the anaerobic traits were not correlated significantly among each other, despite relying on the same muscular structures. Thus, the variation observed may reflect trade-offs with other morphological, physiological or behavioural traits."

MyD88 has a modular structure with a death domain (DD) at the N terminus, an intermediate linker domain (ID), and a TIR domain at the C terminus (10Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S.

This complex propagates the signal and leads to activation of transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), the activator protein 1, and the interferon-regulatory factors, and of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as the stress kinase p38 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (14Brown J.

The TIR domain displays a globular form, consisting of five β-sheets (βA–βE) and four α-helices (αA–αC and αE), connected to the β-strands by surface-exposed loops (16Ohnishi H. Tochio H. Kato Z.

Biol. 2007; 82: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, current understanding of the nature of homotypic oligomerization of the MyD88-TIR domain is still limited. Here, we have performed an extensive structure-function analysis of the MyD88-TIR domain by mutagenesis. Our studies identify new residues (Glu183, Ser244, and Arg288) that are requested to ensure efficient self-association of MyD88. Modeling studies revealed that Glu183, Ser244, and a portion of the BB loop lie in an interface of dimerization between two contiguous TIR domains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mutation of these residues also impairs the recruitment of IRAK1/4 and the activation of NF-κB. Importantly, forced expression of MyD88 mini-proteins encompassing the Glu183 residue competed with homodimerization of the endogenous MyD88 protein and attenuated TLR signaling in immune cells. Thus, our findings identified a novel region of the TIR domain of MyD88 that is crucial for TLR/IL-1R signal transduction. Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged MyD88 or Myc-tagged MyD88 TIR, Myc-tagged MyD88, Myc-tagged IRAK1-kinase-dead (KD) (K239S), and Myc-tagged IRAK4-KD (KK213AA), were constructed as described previously (13Loiarro M.

All constructs for the expression of mutated MyD88 TIR or MyD88 were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides containing the mutated residues. Constructs for GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins expression were obtained by subcloning cDNA encoding each protein into pCL-pCX vector. Lentiviral vectors for stable expression of GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning cDNA encoding each protein into PCCLsin.PPT.hPGK vector. All constructs were confirmed by Cycle Sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy). The vector for the expression of FLAG-tagged IL-1R was a kind gift from Dr. Alberto Mantovani (Humanitas Clinical and Research Center Rozzano, Italy). The NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct (pNiFty2-Luc) was purchased from InvivoGen, whereas Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-TK-Luc; Promega). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lonza), all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza), penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Dendritic cells were generated from human monocytes of healthy donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy blood donor through density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes were then positively separated using anti-CD14-labeled magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm nonessential amino acids (Lonza), penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Monocytes were cultured for 5 days in medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml GM-CSF (Miltenyi) and 40 ng/ml IL-4 (Miltenyi). This protocol leads to 98–99% of CD1a+/CD14− monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). All cells were grown in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For Western blot analysis, THP-1 cells were serum-starved overnight in medium containing 0.5% FBS and stimulated or not with Pam3CSK4 (1 μg/ml; InvivoGen) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml; Pepro Tech) for 30 min. At the end of incubation, cells were collected and lysed, and cell extracts were analyzed. For flow cytometry analysis the pro-monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated into mature monocytic cells by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (200 nm) for 24 h. Mature THP-1 cells and MDDCs were then stimulated with Pam3CSK4 (1 μg/ml; InvivoGen) or LPS (1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, for 6 h, in presence of brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) in the last 4 h to inhibit Golgi traffic. At the end of incubation, cells were collected, fixed, permeabilized, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293T cells were cultured in 6-cm-diameter dishes and transfected with the appropriate expression vectors by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MDDCs were transfected by electroporation with the Amaxa Nucleofector using the Human Dendritic Cell Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions. THP-1 stable cell lines were generated by transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding GFP or GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins. THP-1 cells (3 × 105) were infected with lentiviral particles at a multiplicity of infection of 40 in medium supplemented with Polybrene (6 μg/ml) for 24 h. At the end of incubation, cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in fresh medium, and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was assessed by FACS analysis. HEK293T cells were harvested 20 h after transfection, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubating for 10 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cytosolic fractions were collected for immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated as described (13Loiarro M. Gallo G. Fantò N. De Santis R. Carminati P. Ruggiero V. Sette C.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were diluted in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis.

HEK293T cells (5 × 105) were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with 5 ng of NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene and Renilla luciferase reporter gene (1 ng) as an internal control together with the constructs for the indicated MyD88 proteins by using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. THP-1 cells (1 × 106) were transfected by electroporation with the Amaxa Nucleofector using the Cell Line Nucleofector® Kit V (Lonza) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were stimulated or not with IL-1β (20 ng/ml), TNF-α (20 ng/ml), or Pam3CSK4 (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. At the end of incubation, cells were harvested and lysed, and luciferase activity was quantified with a biocounter luminometer using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Data were normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity by that of the Renilla luciferase. THP-1cells and MDDCs were stained with live-dead fixable near-infrared (Invitrogen) to exclude dead cells from the subsequent analysis. After washing, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.5% saponin, and stained for 15 min at 4 °C with PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-human TNF-α (clone MAb11; eBioscience) or Alexa Fluor 647 anti-human IL-1β (clone JK1B-1; Biolegend). The percentage of cytokine-producing cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (Cyan; Beckman Coulter). NMR solutions of MyD88 TIR domain (PDB ID code 2Z5V) were extracted from the Protein Data Bank. Models of MyD88-TIR domain homodimer were generated using the algorithm PatchDock and sorted by shape complementarity criteria; the first 20 solutions were further refined by the FireDock algorithm using a restricted interface side chain rearrangement and a soft rigid-body optimization. Solutions were automatically ranked by a binding score that includes Atomic Contact Energy, softened van der Waals interactions, partial electrostatics, and additional estimations of the binding free energy. Densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed using underexposed images from three to five experiments and analyzed by ImageQuant5.0 software. Statistical differences between mean values were determined using the two-tailed Student's t test. To identify the residues required for homotypic oligomerization of the TIR domain of MyD88, we performed an extensive mutational analysis. Relying on sequence comparison between different TIR domains (Fig. 1A), we selected several amino acids that might be sensitive to point mutations. We focused on residues present within the flanking regions of three highly conserved motifs denoted box 1, 2, and 3 (17Xu Y. Tao X. Shen B. Horng T. Medzhitov R. Manley J.L. Tong L. Structural basis for signal transduction by the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains.Nature. 2000; 408: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) of the MyD88-TIR, with specific attention to charged/polar residues that are likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions (Fig. 1A). We also selected other residues within the AB and CD loops, as they are located in exposed regions that could play a role in the TIR-TIR interface of the MyD88 dimer. The amino acids shown in boldface type were substituted with alanine, with the exception of Lys282 (isoleucine), Arg288 (glycine), and Lys291 (methionine) that were substituted with the amino acid requiring the minimal change in codon usage. The effect of the introduced mutation on homodimerization of the TIR domain was then tested by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type MyD88 and wild-type or mutated Myc-tagged MyD88-TIR. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and homodimerization was tested by detecting Myc-MyD88-TIR in the immunoprecipitates. We found that several substitutions (D162A, E183A, D195A, K282I, and R288G) impaired MyD88-TIR homodimerization with respect to the wild-type TIR domain in this assay (Fig. 1, B and C). By contrast, other mutations (N186A, R188A, S242A, S244A, H248A, and K291M) were either ineffective or caused a reproducible increase of dimerization (Fig. 1, B and C). Homodimerization of the MyD88-TIR domain is required for propagation of TLR/IL-1R signaling (3O'Neill L.A. The interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor superfamily: 10 years of progress.Immunol.

https://openalex.org/W2127152943,"Pdr5 is the founding member of a large subfamily of evolutionarily distinct, clinically important fungal ABC transporters containing a characteristic, deviant ATP-binding site with altered Walker A, Walker B, Signature (C-loop), and Q-loop residues. In contrast to these motifs, the D-loops of the two ATP-binding sites have similar sequences, including a completely conserved aspartate residue. Alanine substitution mutants in the deviant Walker A and Signature motifs retain significant, albeit reduced, ATPase activity and drug resistance. The D-loop residue mutants D340A and D1042A showed a striking reduction in plasma membrane transporter levels. The D1042N mutation localized properly had nearly WT ATPase activity but was defective in transport and was profoundly hypersensitive to Pdr5 substrates. Therefore, there was a strong uncoupling of ATPase activity and drug efflux. Taken together, the properties of the mutants suggest an additional, critical intradomain signaling role for deviant ATP-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1980778581,"Background Recently, we reported that low reward dependence, and to a lesser extent, low cooperativeness in the Temperature and Character Inventory (TCI) may be risk factors for treatment-resistant depression. Here, we analyzed additional psychological traits in these patients. Methods We administered Costa and McCrae's five-factor model personality inventory, NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R), to antidepressant-treatment resistant depressed patients (n = 35), remitted depressed patients (n = 27), and healthy controls (n = 66). We also evaluated the relationships between scores on NEO and TCI, using the same cohort of patients with treatment-resistant depression, as our previous study. Results Patients with treatment-resistant depression showed high scores for neuroticism, low scores for extraversion, openness and conscientiousness, without changes in agreeableness, on the NEO. However, patients in remitted depression showed no significant scores on NEO. Patients with treatment-resistant depression and low openness on NEO showed positive relationships with reward dependence and cooperativeness on the TCI. Conclusions Many studies have reported that depressed patients show high neuroticism, low extraversion and low conscientiousness on the NEO. Our study highlights low openness on the NEO, as a risk mediator in treatment-resistant depression. This newly identified trait should be included as a risk factor in treatment-resistant depression."
https://openalex.org/W2033390671,"The mosquito Anopheles gambiae uses its innate immune system to control bacterial and Plasmodium infection of its midgut tissue. The activation of potent IMD pathway-mediated anti-Plasmodium falciparum defenses is dependent on the presence of the midgut microbiota, which activate this defense system upon parasite infection through a peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRPLC. We employed transcriptomic and reverse genetic analyses to compare the P. falciparum infection-responsive transcriptomes of septic and aseptic mosquitoes and to determine whether bacteria-independent anti-Plasmodium defenses exist. Antibiotic treated aseptic mosquitoes mounted molecular immune responses representing a variety of immune functions upon P. falciparum infection. Among other immune factors, our analysis uncovered a serine protease inhibitor (SRPN7) and Clip-domain serine protease (CLIPC2) that were transcriptionally induced in the midgut upon P. falciparum infection, independent of bacteria. We also showed that SRPN7 negatively and CLIPC2 positively regulate the anti-Plasmodium defense, independently of the midgut-associated bacteria. Co-silencing assays suggested that these two genes may function together in a signaling cascade. Neither gene was regulated, nor modulated, by infection with the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, suggesting that SRPN7 and CLIPC2 are components of a defense system with preferential activity towards P. falciparum. Further analysis using RNA interference determined that these genes do not regulate the anti-Plasmodium defense mediated by the IMD pathway, and both factors act as agonists of the endogenous midgut microbiota, further demonstrating the lack of functional relatedness between these genes and the bacteria-dependent activation of the IMD pathway. This is the first study confirming the existence of a bacteria-independent, anti-P. falciparum defense. Further exploration of this anti-Plasmodium defense will help clarify determinants of immune specificity in the mosquito, and expose potential gene and/or protein targets for malaria intervention strategies based on targeting the parasite in the mosquito vector."
https://openalex.org/W2007990845,"Peptidoglycan hydrolases are key enzymes in bacterial cell wall homeostasis. Understanding the substrate specificity and biochemical activity of peptidoglycan hydrolases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of special interest as it can aid in the development of new cell wall targeting therapeutics. In this study, we report biochemical and structural characterization of the mycobacterial N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase, Rv3717. The crystal structure of Rv3717 in complex with a dipeptide product shows that, compared with previously characterized peptidoglycan amidases, the enzyme contains an extra disulfide-bonded β-hairpin adjacent to the active site. The structure of two intermediates in assembly reveal that Zn(2+) binding rearranges active site residues, and disulfide formation promotes folding of the β-hairpin. Although Zn(2+) is required for hydrolysis of muramyl dipeptide, disulfide oxidation is not required for activity on this substrate. The orientation of the product in the active site suggests a role for a conserved glutamate (Glu-200) in catalysis; mutation of this residue abolishes activity. The product binds at the head of a closed tunnel, and the enzyme showed no activity on polymerized peptidoglycan. These results point to a potential role for Rv3717 in peptidoglycan fragment recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2022835332,"The SNF1/AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPKs) function in energy regulation in eukaryotic cells. SNF1/AMPKs are αβγ heterotrimers that are activated by phosphorylation of the activation loop Thr on the catalytic subunit. Protein kinases that activate SNF1/AMPK have been identified, but the protein phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylation of the activation loop are less well defined. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1/AMPK, Reg1-Glc7 protein phosphatase 1 and Sit4 type 2A-related phosphatase function together to dephosphorylate Thr-210 on the Snf1 catalytic subunit during growth on high concentrations of glucose; reg1Δ and sit4Δ single mutations do not impair dephosphorylation when inappropriate glycogen synthesis, also caused by these mutations, is blocked. We here present evidence that Ptc1 protein phosphatase 2C also has a role in dephosphorylation of Snf1 Thr-210 in vivo. The sit4Δ ptc1Δ mutant exhibited partial defects in regulation of the phosphorylation state of Snf1. The reg1Δ ptc1Δ mutant was viable only when expressing mutant Snf1 proteins with reduced kinase activity, and Thr-210 phosphorylation of the mutant SNF1 heterotrimers was substantially elevated during growth on high glucose. This evidence, together with findings on the reg1Δ sit4Δ mutant, indicates that although Reg1-Glc7 plays the major role, all three phosphatases contribute to maintenance of the Snf1 activation loop in the dephosphorylated state during growth on high glucose. Ptc1 has overlapping functions with Reg1-Glc7 and Sit4 in glucose regulation of SNF1/AMPK and cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W2156163976,"Cytolysin A (ClyA) is an α-pore forming toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella enterica. Here, we report that E. coli ClyA assembles into an oligomeric structure in solution in the absence of either bilayer membranes or detergents at physiological temperature. These oligomers can rearrange to create transmembrane pores when in contact with detergents or biological membranes. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements revealed that oligomers adopted an intermediate state found during the transition between monomer and transmembrane pore. These results indicate that the water-soluble oligomer represents a prepore intermediate state. Furthermore, we show that ClyA does not form transmembrane pores on E. coli lipid membranes. Because ClyA is delivered to the target host cell in an oligomeric conformation within outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), our findings suggest ClyA forms a prepore oligomeric structure independently of the lipid membrane within the OMV. The proposed model for ClyA represents a non-classical pathway to attack eukaryotic host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004783314,"Identifying the exact regulatory circuits that can stably maintain tissue homeostasis is critical for our basic understanding of multicellular organisms, and equally critical for identifying how tumors circumvent this regulation, thus providing targets for treatment. Despite great strides in the understanding of the molecular components of stem-cell regulation, the overall mechanisms orchestrating tissue homeostasis are still far from being understood. Typically, tissue contains the stem cells, transit amplifying cells, and terminally differentiated cells. Each of these cell types can potentially secrete regulatory factors and/or respond to factors secreted by other types. The feedback can be positive or negative in nature. This gives rise to a bewildering array of possible mechanisms that drive tissue regulation. In this paper, we propose a novel method of studying stem cell lineage regulation, and identify possible numbers, types, and directions of control loops that are compatible with stability, keep the variance low, and possess a certain degree of robustness. For example, there are exactly two minimal (two-loop) control networks that can regulate two-compartment (stem and differentiated cell) tissues, and 20 such networks in three-compartment tissues. If division and differentiation decisions are coupled, then there must be a negative control loop regulating divisions of stem cells (e.g. by means of contact inhibition). While this mechanism is associated with the highest robustness, there could be systems that maintain stability by means of positive divisions control, coupled with specific types of differentiation control. Some of the control mechanisms that we find have been proposed before, but most of them are new, and we describe evidence for their existence in data that have been previously published. By specifying the types of feedback interactions that can maintain homeostasis, our mathematical analysis can be used as a guide to experimentally zero in on the exact molecular mechanisms in specific tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2080029440,"In this study we tested the ability of a mechanistic model (Niche Mapper™) to accurately model adult, non-denning polar bear (Ursus maritimus) energetics while fasting during the ice-free season in the western Hudson Bay. The model uses a steady state heat balance approach, which calculates the metabolic rate that will allow an animal to maintain its core temperature in its particular microclimate conditions. Predicted weight loss for a 120 day fast typical of the 1990s was comparable to empirical studies of the population, and the model was able to reach a heat balance at the target metabolic rate for the entire fast, supporting use of the model to explore the impacts of climate change on polar bears. Niche Mapper predicted that all but the poorest condition bears would survive a 120 day fast under current climate conditions. When the fast extended to 180 days, Niche Mapper predicted mortality of up to 18% for males. Our results illustrate how environmental conditions, variation in animal properties, and thermoregulation processes may impact survival during extended fasts because polar bears were predicted to require additional energetic expenditure for thermoregulation during a 180 day fast. A uniform 3°C temperature increase reduced male mortality during a 180 day fast from 18% to 15%. Niche Mapper explicitly links an animal's energetics to environmental conditions and thus can be a valuable tool to help inform predictions of climate-related population changes. Since Niche Mapper is a generic model, it can make energetic predictions for other species threatened by climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1974833654,"Rainfall events can be characterized as “pulses”, which are discrete and variable episodes that can significantly influence the structure and function of desert ecosystems, including shifts in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). To determine the threshold and hierarchical response of rainfall event size on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, a proxy for ANPP) and the difference across a desert area in northwestern China with two habitats – dune and desert – we selected 17 independent summer rainfall events from 2005 to 2012, and obtained a corresponding NDVI dataset extracted from MODIS images. Based on the threshold-delay model and statistical analysis, the results showed that the response of NDVI to rainfall pulses began at about a 5 mm event size. Furthermore, when the rainfall event size was more than 30 mm, NDVI rapidly increased 3- to 6-fold compared with the response to events of less than 30 mm, suggesting that 30 mm was the threshold for a large NDVI response. These results revealed the importance of the 5 mm and 30 mm rainfall events for plant survival and growth in desert regions. There was an 8- to 16-day lag time between the rainfall event and the NDVI response, and the response duration varied with rainfall event size, reaching a maximum of 32 days. Due to differences in soil physical and mineralogical properties, and to biodiversity structure and the root systems' abilities to exploit moisture, dune and desert areas differed in precipitation responses: dune habitats were characterized by a single, late summer productivity peak; in contrast, deserts showed a multi-peak pattern throughout the growing season."
https://openalex.org/W2061285938,"Disordered regions of proteins often bind to structured domains, mediating interactions within and between proteins. However, it is difficult to identify a priori the short disordered regions involved in binding. We set out to determine if docking such peptide regions to peptide binding domains would assist in these predictions.We assembled a redundancy reduced dataset of SLiM (Short Linear Motif) containing proteins from the ELM database. We selected 84 sequences which had an associated PDB structures showing the SLiM bound to a protein receptor, where the SLiM was found within a 50 residue region of the protein sequence which was predicted to be disordered. First, we investigated the Vina docking scores of overlapping tripeptides from the 50 residue SLiM containing disordered regions of the protein sequence to the corresponding PDB domain. We found only weak discrimination of docking scores between peptides involved in binding and adjacent non-binding peptides in this context (AUC 0.58).Next, we trained a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) using as input the protein sequence, predicted secondary structure, Vina docking score and predicted disorder score. The results were very promising (AUC 0.72) showing that multiple sources of information can be combined to produce results which are clearly superior to any single source.We conclude that the Vina docking score alone has only modest power to define the location of a peptide within a larger protein region known to contain it. However, combining this information with other knowledge (using machine learning methods) clearly improves the identification of peptide binding regions within a protein sequence. This approach combining docking with machine learning is primarily a predictor of binding to peptide-binding sites, and is not intended as a predictor of specificity of binding to particular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2087126031,"Very long chain (C22-C24) ceramides are synthesized by ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2). A CerS2 null mouse displays hepatopathy because of depletion of C22-C24 ceramides, elevation of C16-ceramide, and/or elevation of sphinganine. Unexpectedly, CerS2 null mice were resistant to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Although there were a number of biochemical changes in the liver, such as increased levels of glutathione and multiple drug-resistant protein 4, these effects are unlikely to account for the lack of acetaminophen toxicity. A number of other hepatotoxic agents, such as d-galactosamine, CCl4, and thioacetamide, were also ineffective in inducing liver damage. All of these drugs and chemicals require connexin (Cx) 32, a key gap junction protein, to induce hepatotoxicity. Cx32 was mislocalized to an intracellular location in hepatocytes from CerS2 null mice, which resulted in accelerated rates of its lysosomal degradation. This mislocalization resulted from the altered membrane properties of the CerS2 null mice, which was exemplified by the disruption of detergent-resistant membranes. The lack of acetaminophen toxicity and Cx32 mislocalization were reversed upon infection with recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing CerS2. We establish that Gap junction function is compromised upon altering the sphingolipid acyl chain length composition, which is of relevance for understanding the regulation of drug-induced liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2060201221,"Marine invertebrates commonly have a biphasic life cycle in which the metamorphic transition from a pelagic larva to a benthic post-larva is mediated by the nitric oxide signalling pathway. Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesised by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is a client protein of the molecular chaperon heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). It is notable, then, that both NO and HSP90 have been implicated in regulating metamorphosis in marine invertebrates as diverse as urochordates, echinoderms, molluscs, annelids, and crustaceans. Specifically, the suppression of NOS activity by the application of either NOS- or HSP90-inhibiting pharmacological agents has been shown consistently to induce the initiation of metamorphosis, leading to the hypothesis that a negative regulatory role of NO is widely conserved in biphasic life cycles. Further, the induction of metamorphosis by heat-shock has been demonstrated for multiple species. Here, we investigate the regulatory role of NO in induction of metamorphosis of the solitary tropical ascidian, Herdmania momus. By coupling pharmacological treatments with analysis of HmNOS and HmHSP90 gene expression, we present compelling evidence of a positive regulatory role for NO in metamorphosis of this species, in contrast to all existing ascidian data that supports the hypothesis of NO as a conserved negative regulator of metamorphosis. The exposure of competent H. momus larvae to a NOS inhibitor or an NO donor results in an up-regulation of NOS and HSP90 genes. Heat shock of competent larvae induces metamorphosis in a temperature dependent manner, up to a thermal tolerance that approaches 35°C. Both larval/post-larval survival and the appearance of abnormal morphologies in H. momus post-larvae reflect the magnitude of up-regulation of the HSP90 gene in response to heat-shock. The demonstrated role of NO as a positive metamorphic regulator in H. momus suggests the existence of inter-specific adaptations of NO regulation in ascidian metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010888832,"Depression is a chronic and debilitating condition with a significant degree of relapse and treatment resistance that could stem, at least in part, from disturbances of neuroplasticity. This has led to an increased focus on treatment strategies that target brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis. In the current study we aimed to assess whether erythropoietin (EPO) would have antidepressant-like effects given its already established pro-trophic actions. In particular, we assessed whether EPO would diminish the deleterious effects of a social stressor in mice. Indeed, EPO induced anxiolytic and antidepressant-like responses in a forced swim test, open field, elevated-plus maze, and a novelty test, and appeared to blunt some of the negative behavioural effects of a social stressor. Furthermore, EPO promoted adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an important feature of effective antidepressants. Finally, a separate study using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin revealed that antagonizing this pathway prevented the impact of EPO upon forced swim performance. These data are consistent with previous findings showing that the mTOR pathway and its neurogenic and synaptogenic effects might mediate the behavioral consequences of antidepressant agents. Our findings further highlight EPO as a possible adjunct treatment for affective disorders, as well as other stressor associated disorders of impaired neuroplasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2056388917,"Candida albicans is responsible for a number of life-threatening infections and causes considerable morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Previous studies of C. albicans pathogenesis have suggested several steps must occur before virulent infection, including early adhesion, invasion, and late tissue damage. However, the mechanism that triggers C. albicans transformation from yeast to hyphae form during infection has yet to be fully elucidated. This study used a systems biology approach to investigate C. albicans infection in zebrafish. The surviving fish were sampled at different post-infection time points to obtain time-lapsed, genome-wide transcriptomic data from both organisms, which were accompanied with in sync histological analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the dynamic gene expression profiles of significant variations in both C. albicans and zebrafish. The results categorized C. albicans infection into three progressing phases: adhesion, invasion, and damage. Such findings were highly supported by the corresponding histological analysis. Furthermore, the dynamic interspecies transcript profiling revealed that C. albicans activated its filamentous formation during invasion and the iron scavenging functions during the damage phases, whereas zebrafish ceased its iron homeostasis function following massive hemorrhage during the later stages of infection. This was followed by massive hemorrhaging toward the end stage of infection. Most of the immune related genes were expressed as the infection progressed from invasion to the damage phase. Such global, inter-species evidence of virulence-immune and iron competition dynamics during C. albicans infection could be crucial in understanding control fungal pathogenesis."

Therefore, targeting pathogens with drugs that interfere with virulence gene expression offers an effective alternative to conventional antimicrobial chemotherapy. Many Gram-negative intestinal pathogens produce AraC-like proteins that control the expression of genes required for infection. In this study we investigated the prototypical AraC-like virulence regulator, RegA, from the mouse attaching and effacing pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, as a potential drug target. By screening a small molecule chemical library and chemical optimization, we identified two compounds that specifically inhibited the ability of RegA to activate its target promoters and thus reduced expression of a number of proteins required for virulence. Biophysical, biochemical, genetic, and computational analyses indicated that the more potent of these two compounds, which we named regacin, disrupts the DNA binding capacity of RegA by interacting with amino acid residues within a conserved region of the DNA binding domain. Oral administration of regacin to mice, commencing 15 min before or 12 h after oral inoculation with C. rodentium, caused highly significant attenuation of intestinal colonization by the mouse pathogen comparable to that of an isogenic regA-deletion mutant.

Proteins were included from species encompassing multiple microbial phyla and diverse ecological niches as well as the nitrogen fixation genotypes, anf, nif, and vnf, which encode proteins associated with cofactors differing at one metal site. After adjusting for differences in sequence length, insertions, and deletions, the remaining >85% of the sequence co-aligned the subunits from the three genotypes. Six Groups, designated Anf, Vnf , and Nif I-IV, were assigned based upon genetic origin, sequence adjustments, and conserved residues. Both subunits subdivided into the same groups. Invariant and single variant residues were identified and were defined as ""core"" for nitrogenase function. Three species in Group Nif-III, Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator, Desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii, and Thermodesulfatator indicus, were found to have a seleno-cysteine that replaces one cysteinyl ligand of the 8Fe:7S, P-cluster. Subsets of invariant residues, limited to individual groups, were identified; these unique residues help identify the gene of origin (anf, nif, or vnf) yet should not be considered diagnostic of the metal content of associated cofactors. Fourteen of the 19 residues that compose the cofactor pocket are invariant or single variant; the other five residues are highly variable but do not correlate with the putative metal content of the cofactor. The variable residues are clustered on one side of the cofactor, away from other functional centers in the three dimensional structure. Many of the invariant and single variant residues were not previously recognized as potentially critical and their identification provides the bases for new analyses of the three-dimensional structure and for mutagenesis studies."

Here we reported the isolation and characterization of the Hv-SGT1 gene from Haynaldia villosa (2n = 14, VV). Analysis of the subcellular location of Hv-SGT1 by transient expression of a fusion to GFP indicated its presence in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Levels of Hv-SGT1 transcripts were increased by inoculation with either the biotrophic pathogen Blumeria graminis DC. f. Sp. tritici (Bgt) or the hemi-biotrophic pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg). Levels of Hv-SGT1 showed substantial increase following treatment with H2O2 and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), only slightly induced following exposure to ethephon or abscisic acid, but not changed following exposure to salicylic acid. The demonstration that silencing of Hv-SGT1 substantially reduced resistance to Bgt indicated that Hv-SGT1 was an essential component of disease resistance in H. villosa. The over-expression of Hv-SGT1 in Yangmai 158 enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, and this correlated with increased levels of whole-cell reactive oxygen intermediates at the sites of penetration by the pathogens. Compared with wild-type plants, the expression levels of genes related to the H2O2 and JA signaling pathways were lower in the Hv-SGT1 silenced plants and higher in the Hv-SGT1 over-expressing plants. Therefore, the involvement of Hv-SGT1 in H2O2 production correlates with the hypersensitive response and jasmonic acid signaling. Our novel demonstration that wheat with over-expressed Hv-SGT1 showed enhanced resistance to both powdery mildew and FHB suggests that it could served as a transgenic genetic resource in wheat breeding for multiple disease resistance."

In this work, we found that the dimeric state, not the monomeric state, is the functionally active form. Two conserved arginine residues are present in the active site: Arg-51 and an intruding Arg-239* from the neighboring subunit. In this study, they were each mutated to alanine and lysine, and all four mutants were catalytically inactive. The mutants were also incapable of accommodating pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, a competitive inhibitor of the native enzyme, suggesting that the two Arg residues are involved in substrate binding. It was also observed that the decarboxylase activity was partially recovered in a heterodimer hybridization experiment when inactive R51(A/K) and R239(A/K) mutants were mixed together. Of the 20 crystal structures obtained from mixing inactive R51A and R239A homodimers that diffracted to a resolution lower than 3.00 Å, two structures are clearly R51A/R239A heterodimers and belong to the C2 space group. They were refined to 1.80 and 2.00 Å resolutions, respectively. Four of the remaining crystals are apparently single mutants and belong to the P42212 space group. In the heterodimer structures, one active site is shown to contain dual mutation of Ala-51 and Ala-239*, whereas the other contains the native Arg-51 and Arg-239* residues, identical to the wild-type structure. Thus, these observations provide the foundation for a molecular mechanism by which the oligomerization state of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase could regulate the enzyme activity."

Although the efficacies of T. versicolor extracts have been documented, the active ingredients and mechanisms underlying the actions of these extracts remain uncharacterized. Results We purified a new protein, YZP, from the fruiting bodies of T. versicolor and identified the gene encoding YZP using RNA-seq and de novo assembly technologies. YZP is a 12-kDa non-glycosylated protein comprising 139 amino acids, including an 18-amino acids signal peptide. YZP induced a greater than 60-fold increase in IL-10 secretion in mice B lymphocytes; moreover, YZP specifically triggered the differentiation of CD1d+ B cells into IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (Bregs) and enhanced the expression of CD1d. YZP-induced B cells suppressed approximately 40% of the LPS-activated macrophage production of inflammatory cytokines in a mixed leukocyte reaction and significantly alleviated the disease activity and colonic inflammation in a DSS-induced acute colitis murine model. Furthermore, YZP activated Breg function via interaction with TLR2 and TLR4 and up-regulation of the TLR-mediated signaling pathway. Conclusions We purified a novel Breg-stimulating protein, YZP, from T. versicolor and developed an advanced approach combining RNA-seq and de novo assembly technologies.to clone its gene.

Significance: Translational-independent targeting of mRNA to membranes may be mediated by a mechanism conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1975521820,"Investigations into protein folding are largely dominated by studies on monomeric proteins. However, the transmembrane domain of an important group of membrane proteins is only formed upon multimerization. Here, we use in vitro translation-coupled folding and insertion into artificial liposomes to investigate kinetic steps in the assembly of one such protein, the outer membrane secretin PulD of the bacterial type II secretion system. Analysis of the folding kinetics, measured by the acquisition of distinct determinants of the native state, provides unprecedented evidence for a sequential multistep process initiated by membrane-driven oligomerization. The effects of varying the lipid composition of the liposomes indicate that PulD first forms a ""prepore"" structure that attains the native state via a conformational switch."
https://openalex.org/W2029492937,"AdpA serves as the global transcription factor in the A-factor regulatory cascade, controlling the secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation of the filamentous bacterium Streptomyces griseus. AdpA binds to over 500 operator regions with the consensus sequence 5'-TGGCSNGWWY-3' (where S is G or C, W is A or T, Y is T or C, and N is any nucleotide). However, it is still obscure how AdpA can control hundreds of genes. To elucidate the structural basis of this tolerant DNA recognition by AdpA, we focused on the interaction between the DNA-binding domain of AdpA (AdpA-DBD), which consists of two helix-turn-helix motifs, and a target duplex DNA containing the consensus sequence 5'-TGGCGGGTTC-3'. The crystal structure of the AdpA-DBD-DNA complex and the mutant analysis of AdpA-DBD revealed its unique manner of DNA recognition, whereby only two arginine residues directly recognize the consensus sequence, explaining the strict recognition of G and C at positions 2 and 4, respectively, and the tolerant recognition of other positions of the consensus sequence. AdpA-DBD confers tolerant DNA sequence specificity to AdpA, allowing it to control hundreds of genes as a global transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2049105297,"China has a large barley germplasm collection which has not been well characterized and is therefore underutilized. The Bmy1 locus encoding the β-amylase enzyme on chromosome 4H has been well characterized in the worldwide barley germplasm collections due to its importance in the malting and brewing industry. The Bmy1 locus was chosen as an indicator to understand genetic potential for improvement of malting quality in Chinese landraces and Tibetan wild barley. The genetic diversity of 91 barley accessions was assessed using allele specific Multiplex-ready molecular markers. Eight accessions were further sequenced, based on the Multiplex-ready marker diversity for Bmy1 in the germplasm. Six of the eight accessions clustered together in a unique group, and showed similarities to ‘Haruna Nijo’, wild barley accession PI296896 and ‘Ashqelon’. Sequence comparisons with the known Bmy1 alleles identified not only the existing 13 amino acid substitutions, but also a new substitution positioned at A387T from a Chinese landrace W127, which has the highest β-amylase activity. Two new alleles/haplotypes namely Bmy1-Sd1c and Bmy1-Sd5 were designated based on different amino acid combinations. We identified new amino acid combination of C115, D165, V233, S347 and V430 in the germplasm. The broad variation in both β-amylase activity and amino acid composition provides novel alleles for the improvement of malting quality for different brewing styles, which indicates the high potential value of the Chinese landraces and Tibetan wild barley."
https://openalex.org/W2156188627,"Objectives Health benefits and costs of combined reduced-antigen-content tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) immunization among adults ≥65 years have not been evaluated. In February 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended expanding Tdap vaccination (one single dose) to include adults ≥65 years not previously vaccinated with Tdap. Our study estimated the health and economic outcomes of one-time replacement of the decennial tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster with Tdap in the 10% of individuals aged 65 years assumed eligible each year compared with a baseline scenario of continued Td vaccination. Methods We constructed a model evaluating the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating a cohort of adults aged 65 with Tdap, by calculating pertussis cases averted due to direct vaccine effects only. Results are presented from societal and payer perspectives for a range of pertussis incidences (25–200 cases per 100,000), due to the uncertainty in estimating true annual incidence. Cases averted were accrued throughout the patient 's lifetime, and a probability tree used to estimate the clinical outcomes and costs (US$ 2010) for each case. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost to acute disease were calculated by multiplying cases of mild/moderate/severe pertussis by the associated health-state disutility; QALY losses due to death and long-term sequelae were also considered. Incremental costs and QALYs were summed over the cohort to derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Scenario analyses evaluated the effect of alternative plausible parameter estimates on results. Results At incidence levels of 25, 100, 200 cases/100,000, vaccinating adults aged 65 years costs an additional $336,000, $63,000 and $17,000/QALY gained, respectively. Vaccination has a cost-effectiveness ratio less than $50,000/QALY if pertussis incidence is >116 cases/100,000 from societal and payer perspectives. Results were robust to scenario analyses. Conclusions Tdap immunization of adults aged 65 years according to current ACIP recommendations is a cost-effective health-care intervention at plausible incidence assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2076644904,"In most cells, cationic amino acids such as l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-ornithine are transported by cationic (CAT) and y+L (y+LAT) amino acid transporters. In human erythrocytes, the cysteine-modifying agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has been shown to inhibit system y+ (most likely CAT-1), but not system y+L (Devés, R., Angelo, S., and Chávez, P. (1993) J. Physiol. 468, 753–766). We thus wondered if sensitivity to NEM distinguishes generally all CAT and y+LAT isoforms. Transport assays in Xenopus laevis oocytes established that indeed all human CATs (including the low affinity hCAT-2A), but neither y+LAT isoform, are inhibited by NEM. hCAT-2A inhibition was not due to reduced transporter expression in the plasma membrane, indicating that NEM reduces the intrinsic transporter activity. Individual mutation of each of the seven cysteine residues conserved in all CAT isoforms did not lead to NEM insensitivity of hCAT-2A. However, a cysteine-less mutant was no longer inhibited by NEM, suggesting that inhibition occurs through modification of more than one cysteine in hCAT-2A. Indeed, also the double mutant C33A/C273A was insensitive to NEM inhibition, whereas reintroduction of a cysteine at either position 33 or 273 in the cysteine-less mutant led to NEM sensitivity. We thus identified Cys-33 and Cys-273 in hCAT-2A as the targets of NEM inhibition.

System y+ was first described in Ehrlich cells as system Ly+ (to refer to the positively charged substrate lysine) and was later renamed system y+ when it became evident that other CAAs share the same transport system (1Christensen H.N.

It works independently of the presence of Na+ and H+ ions, exhibits a relatively high affinity for CAAs, and works preferentially as an exchanger of CAAs, evidenced by its strong trans-stimulation. The second system, named y+L, was first described in erythrocytes (3Devés R. Chavez P. Boyd C.A.

In contrast, system y+L, also present in these cells, is insensitive to NEM. Later, molecular identification of amino acid transporters revealed that there are several isoforms of SLC7 (solute carrier family 7) (see Fig. 1A) that mediate either system y+ (and y+-like) or y+L activity. Whether sensitivity to NEM generally distinguishes all system y+ (and y+-like) from system y+L isoforms had not been elucidated so far. Most members of the SLC7 branch of cationic amino acid transporters (CATs) exhibit transport properties similar to system y+. All CAT proteins transport exclusively CAAs in a Na+-independent manner. They are glycosylated and predicted to have 14 transmembrane domains (TMDs) (5Closs E.I. Boissel J.P. Habermeier A. Rotmann A. Structure and function of cationic amino acid transporters (CATs).J.

CAT-2B and CAT-3 can thus be seen as transporters resembling system y+ and are referred to here as y+-like. Finally, CAT-2A is not at all trans-stimulated and has a low substrate affinity (11Kavanaugh M.P. Wang H. Zhang Z. Zhang W. Wu Y.N. Dechant E. North R.A. Kabat D.

Hence, although clearly a member of the CAT family, CAT-2A does not qualify as a system y+ transporter. The second branch of the SLC7 family consists of the so-called light chains of heteromeric amino acid transporters (lcHATs), which are not glycosylated and are predicted to have 12 TMDs (13Verrey F.

In contrast to the CATs, lcHATs need to associate with glycoproteins to localize to the plasma membrane. When coexpressed with the glycoprotein 4F2hc, the lcHATs y+LAT1 (SLC7A7) and y+LAT2 (SLC7A6) mediate system y+L activity (14Torrents D. Estévez R. Pineda M. Fernández E. Lloberas J. Shi Y.B.

NEM is frequently used to inhibit enzymes with cysteine residues in their active center. In a nucleophilic attack, it forms a thioether with the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues. This reaction is specific in a pH range of 6.5–7.5. At lower pH, NEM may also react with histidine (16Smyth D.G. Blumenfeld O.O. Konigsberg W. Reactions of N-ethylmaleimide with peptides and amino acids.Biochem. J. 1964; 91: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Our previous work with human transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes already demonstrated that NEM (at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.5 mm) inhibits CAT-1 but leaves y+LAT2/4F2hc unaffected (17Rotoli B.M.

The aim of the present study was to determine (i) whether CATs and y+LATs can generally be distinguished by their reactivity with NEM and (ii) which cysteine residues within CAT proteins are responsible for sensitivity to NEM.

Non-injected oocytes were used as controls. If not indicated otherwise, all experiments were performed 2 days after cRNA injection. The oocytes were first rinsed three times with ice-cold uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and then transferred to the same solution with the indicated NEM concentration (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 10 min at 20 °C. The same amount of uptake solution supplemented with l-[3H]arginine (ICN Biomedicals GmbH, Eschwege, Germany) was added at a final concentration (if not indicated otherwise) of 1 mm (10 μCi/ml). After incubation for 15 min at 20 °C, oocytes were washed five times with ice-cold uptake solution and solubilized individually in 2% SDS. The radioactivity of the lysates was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. Oocytes were washed three times with ice-cold uptake solution (pH 6.8) and then equilibrated in the same solution supplemented with 0.1–10 mm unlabeled l-arginine at 18 °C. The oocytes were transferred to the same solution containing, in addition, l-[3H]arginine (10 μCi/ml). After a 15-min incubation at 20 °C, oocytes were washed and processed as described above. All steps were performed at 4 °C. 12 oocytes each were rinsed three times with PBSmod (0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.76 mm KH2PO4, and 10.1 mm Na2HPO4) and then incubated for 30 min with membrane-impermeable sulfosuccinimidobiotin (1 mg/ml in PBSmod; EZ-LinkTM, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The biotinylation reaction was stopped by incubating oocytes in PBSmod containing 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min and rinsing four times with PBSmod containing, in addition, 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. After lysis in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0,1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Applied Science) an aliquot of each whole oocyte lysate was mixed directly with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris base, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.001% (v/v) bromphenol blue, 8 m urea, and 2% mercaptoethanol) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The remaining lysate was incubated overnight with avidin-coated Sepharose beads (immobilized NeutrAvidinTM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to separate biotinylated surface proteins. The beads were then washed three times with washing buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) and once with washing buffer II (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). All washing solutions contained 20 μm PMSF. Biotinylated proteins were released from the beads by incubation in 1× sample buffer for 10 min at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. Lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran 83, Whatman). Staining for human CAT-2A (hCAT-2A) proteins was achieved by sequential incubations in Blotto (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Antifoam A (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk) supplemented with 5% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature to block unspecific binding sites; three times in antibody dilution buffer (1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4); in a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-hCAT-2 antibody (18Habermeier A.

Chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences HyperfilmTM ECL, GE Healthcare) were then immediately exposed to the membranes. Signal intensity was quantified using ChemiDoc® (Bio-Rad). For standardization, membranes were stained with anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). hCAT-2A was previously predicted to exhibit 14 TMDs (5Closs E.I.

Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28055) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. If only two groups were compared, the t test was used. The confidence interval was always 95%. To examine whether all validated hCAT proteins are inhibited by NEM and the two y+L isoforms are resistant to the SH group-modifying agent, we analyzed arginine transport by the individual transporters expressed in oocytes from X. laevis in the presence and absence of 1 mm NEM (Fig. 1B). For transport studies, 1 mm arginine was used in experiments with low affinity hCAT-2A, 0.1 mm arginine was used in experiments with all other transporters. We found that NEM inhibited not only the molecular representative of system y+ (hCAT-1) but also the system y+-like transporters hCAT-2B and hCAT-3 and the non-system y+ transporter hCAT-2A. In each case, a t test yielded p < 0.001 when comparing values from NEM-treated oocytes and untreated controls. NEM inhibition of the CAT proteins was quite pronounced, leaving only 16% (hCAT-1), 1% (hCAT-2A), 7% (hCAT-2B), and 16% (hCAT-3) residual activity compared with untreated oocytes expressing the same transporter. In contrast, neither molecular representative of system y+L, y+LAT1 or y+LAT2 (each time coexpressed with 4F2hc). exhibited a significant inhibition by 1 mm NEM. A t test yielded p values of 0.27 (y+LAT1) and 0.83 (y+LAT2). To test whether the NEM-mediated reduction of CAT-mediated transport is conveyed by internalization of transport proteins, we examined cryosections of hCAT-2A-EGFP-expressing oocytes exposed for 10 min immediately before freezing to 1 mm NEM or to buffer only. By far the largest part of the fluorescent signal was found in the oocyte plasma membrane under both conditions (Fig. 2A), indicating that NEM treatment causes no change in the localization of the transporter. To verify this result, cell surface proteins of intact hCAT-2A-expressing oocytes preincubated with 1 mm NEM for 10 min or untreated were biotinylated. Subsequent isolation of the biotinylated proteins and analysis by Western blotting revealed no change in the cell surface localization of hCAT-2A upon NEM treatment (Fig. 2B). This indicates that NEM inhibits the intrinsic hCAT activity. We next wondered if NEM causes hCAT inhibition by directly modifying sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues of the transporters. To answer this question, we focused on hCAT-2A because it has a relatively small number of cysteine residues among the hCATs, exhibits a robust transport activity in X. laevis oocytes, and showed the most pronounced inhibition by NEM of all hCATs. Because all hCAT proteins were inhibited by NEM, we reasoned that NEM should act on cysteine residue(s) conserved among the hCATs. Cys-33, Cys-85, Cys-264, Cys-273, Cys-299, Cys-347, and Cys-427 were found to meet this condition. Of these, only Cys-85 is also found at corresponding positions in y+LAT1 and y+LAT2, which are not inhibited by NEM. All seven cysteine residues in hCAT-2A were substituted individually with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Of the resulting seven single mutants, four exhibited transport activity comparable to WT in uptake studies using 1 mm l-[3H]arginine (Fig. 3). One mutant had a higher activity and two mutants had lower activities compared with WT. Transport measurements at different arginine concentrations revealed that, compared with WT, the C33A and C264A mutants exhibited a reduced and an increased Vmax value, respectively (1.7 ± 0.3 (C33A), 10.7 ± 0.3 (C264A), and 6.9 ± 0.7 (WT) nmol/oocyte/h; one-way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test, p < 0.001 in each case). Neither total expression nor cell surface expression of the C33A mutant was different compared with WT (Fig. 3B). The apparent Km of hCAT-2A-C33A was even lower than that of WT (1.3 ± 0.1 versus 3.0 ± 0.2 mm, p < 0.05), whereas the apparent Km of hCAT-2A-C264A (2.6 ± 0.6 mm) was not significantly altered. Surprisingly, all single cysteine mutants were still inhibited by NEM (Fig. 3A). To determine whether NEM affects any of the cysteine residues in hCAT-2A, we constructed a transporter devoid of cysteine residues (cysteine-less (CL), hCAT-2A-CL) by mutating all 13 cysteine residues within hCAT-2A to alanine. This mutant had only ∼8% transport activity compared with WT after 2 days of expression in X. laevis oocytes (data not shown). Upon examining the total and cell surface expression of hCAT-2A-CL, it became evident that both were much lower for hCAT-2A-CL than for WT, whereas the ratio of total to surface protein was comparable to that of WT (Fig. 4A). Because of low protein expression and transport activity, the expression time was extended from 2 to 4 days, resulting in a higher amount of protein detected in Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B) and an ∼25% transport activity compared with WT. Inhibition experiments revealed that the cysteine-less mutant was not inhibited at any NEM concentration used (0.2, 0.5, or 1 mm) (Fig. 4C). Even a t test comparing oocytes treated with 1 mm NEM and untreated controls yielded a p value of 0.25. The resistance of the cysteine-less hCAT-2A protein to inhibition by NEM strongly suggested that cysteine residues within hCAT-2A were conveying the NEM inhibition of WT. As individual mutation of each of the conserved cysteine residues was not sufficient to abolish NEM inhibition (Fig. 3A), it seemed likely that more than one cysteine residue may mediate the NEM effect. We therefore had a closer look at the results in Fig. 3A and noticed that, in contrast to WT and all other mutants, (i) the C33A and C85A mutants exhibited no tendency for inhibition at the lowest NEM concentration used (0.2 mm), and (ii) the C85A and C273A mutants were not completely inhibited by NEM at 1 mm. We therefore created double mutants, each carrying alanine mutations at two of these three cysteine residues. In fact, the C33A/C273A mutant was not inhibited at any NEM concentration used (Fig. 5). A t test comparing oocytes treated with 1 mm NEM and controls yielded a p value of 0.43. In contrast, the double mutants C33A/C85A and C85A/C273A were still significantly inhibited by NEM. These data strongly suggest that NEM inhibition occurs at Cys-33 and Cys-273. In fact, a mutant in which all cysteine residues except Cys-33 and Cys-273 were mutated to alanine (hCAT-2A-CL(C33+273)) was inhibited by NEM (Fig. 6A). In addition, it exhibited a much higher transport activity compared with hCAT-2A-CL. Because the two single cysteine mutants hCAT-2A-C33A and hCAT-2A-C273A were (almost) as sensitive to NEM as WT, we concluded that modification of one of these two cysteine residues by NEM would be sufficient to inhibit hCAT-2A. Indeed, mutants in which all cysteine residues except Cys-33 or Cys-273 were mutated to alanine, hCAT-2A-CL(C33) and hCAT-2A-CL(C273), were still inhibited by NEM (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, transport of hCAT-2A-CL(C33) was about three times higher than that of hCAT-2A-CL (data not shown). This was not due to increased total or cell surface expression compared with hCAT-2A-CL. In contrast to hCAT-2A-CL(C33), transport of hCAT-2A-CL(C273) was comparable to hCAT-2A-CL: even after 4 days of expression, the transport activity of hCAT-2A-CL(C273) was only 11% of WT. Our study has established that all CAT proteins, but neither of the y+LAT isoforms, are inhibited by the cysteine-modifying compound NEM. Hence, NEM can be used to generally distinguish transport of CAAs by CATs and y+LATs. They belong to two different branches of the SLC7 family and are often coexpressed in mammalian cells. However, NEM does not distinguish between transporters with system y+ (CAT-1), y+-like (CAT-2B and CAT-3), and non-y+ (CAT-2A) activity within the CAT branch. In line with previo"
https://openalex.org/W2062441772,"This study addresses the feasibility of the classical notion of parameter in linguistic theory from the perspective of parametric hierarchies. A novel program-based analysis is implemented in order to show certain empirical problems related to these hierarchies. The program was developed on the basis of an enriched data base spanning 23 contemporary and 5 ancient languages. The empirical issues uncovered cast doubt on classical parametric models of language acquisition as well as on the conceptualization of an overspecified Universal Grammar that has parameters among its primitives. Pinpointing these issues leads to the proposal that (i) the (bio)logical problem of language acquisition does not amount to a process of triggering innately pre-wired values of parameters and (ii) it paves the way for viewing language, epigenetic ('parametric') variation as an externalization-related epiphenomenon, whose learning component may be more important than what sometimes is assumed."

Loss of BDK function in mice and humans causes BCAA deficiency and epilepsy with autistic features. In response to amino acid deficiency, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2∼P) by general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) activates the amino acid stress response. We hypothesized that GCN2 functions to protect the brain during chronic BCAA deficiency. To test this idea, we generated mice lacking both Gcn2 and Bdk (GBDK) and examined the development of progeny. GBDK mice appeared normal at birth, but they soon stopped growing, developed severe ataxia, tremor, and anorexia, and died by postnatal day 15. BCAA levels in brain were diminished in both Bdk−/− and GBDK pups. Brains from Bdk−/− pups exhibited robust eIF2∼P and amino acid stress response induction, whereas these responses were absent in GBDK mouse brains. Instead, myelin deficiency and diminished expression of myelin basic protein were noted in GBDK brains. Genetic markers of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes were also reduced in GBDK brains in association with apoptotic cell death in white matter regions of the brain. GBDK brains further demonstrated reduced Sod2 and Cat mRNA and increased Tnfα mRNA expression.

https://openalex.org/W2057110434,"Background The protein tyrosine phosphatase PRL-1 represents a putative oncogene with wide-ranging cellular effects. Overexpression of PRL-1 can promote cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasis, but the underlying mechanisms by which it influences these processes remain poorly understood. Methodology To increase our comprehension of PRL-1 mediated signaling events, we employed transcriptional profiling (DNA microarray) and proteomics (mass spectrometry) to perform a thorough characterization of the global molecular changes in gene expression that occur in response to stable PRL-1 overexpression in a relevant model system (HEK293). Principal Findings Overexpression of PRL-1 led to several significant changes in the mRNA and protein expression profiles of HEK293 cells. The differentially expressed gene set was highly enriched in genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion, and RNA recognition and splicing. In particular, members of the Rho signaling pathway and molecules that converge on this pathway were heavily influenced by PRL-1 overexpression, supporting observations from previous studies that link PRL-1 to the Rho GTPase signaling network. In addition, several genes not previously associated with PRL-1 were found to be significantly altered by its expression. Most notable among these were Filamin A, RhoGDIα, SPARC, hnRNPH2, and PRDX2. Conclusions and Significance This systems-level approach sheds new light on the molecular networks underlying PRL-1 action and presents several novel directions for future, hypothesis-based studies."
https://openalex.org/W1971739844,"An ecological flow network is a weighted directed graph in which the nodes are species, the edges are ""who eats whom"" relationships and the weights are rates of energy or nutrient transferred between species. Allometric scaling is a ubiquitous feature for flow systems such as river basins, vascular networks and food webs.The ""ecological network analysis"" can serve to reveal hidden allometries, the power law relationship between the throughflux and the indirect impact of node [Formula: see text], directly from the original flow networks without any need to cut edges in the network. The dissipation law, which is another significant scaling relationship between the energy dissipation (respiration) and the throughflow of any species, is also obtained from an analysis of the empirical flow networks. Interestingly, the exponents of the allometric law ([Formula: see text]) and the dissipation law ([Formula: see text]) show a strong relationship for both empirical and simulated flow networks. The dissipation law exponent [Formula: see text], rather than the topology of the network, is the most important factors that affect the allometric exponent [Formula: see text].The exponent [Formula: see text] can be interpreted as the degree of centralization of the network, i.e., the concentration of impacts (direct and indirect influences on the entire network along all energy flow pathways) on hubs (the nodes with large throughflows). As a result, we find that as [Formula: see text] increases, the relative energy loss of large nodes increases, [Formula: see text] decreases, i.e., the relative importance of large species decreases. Moreover, the entire flow network is more decentralized. Therefore, network flow structure (allometry) and thermodynamic constraints (dissipation) are linked."
https://openalex.org/W2024985855,"Metastatic tumor cells in body fluids are important targets for treatment, and critical surrogate markers for evaluating cancer prognosis and therapeutic response. Here we report, for the first time, that live metastatic tumor cells in blood samples from mice bearing human tumor xenografts and in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with cancer were successfully detected using a tumor cell-specific recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV). In contrast to the FDA-approved CellSearch system, VACV detects circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in a cancer biomarker-independent manner, thus, free of any bias related to the use of antibodies, and can be potentially a universal system for detection of live CTCs of any tumor type, not limited to CTCs of epithelial origin. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that VACV was effective in preventing and reducing circulating tumor cells in mice bearing human tumor xenografts. Importantly, a single intra-peritoneal delivery of VACV resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of tumor cells in the ascitic fluid from a patient with gastric cancer. Taken together, these results suggest VACV to be a useful tool for quantitative detection of live tumor cells in liquid biopsies as well as a potentially effective treatment for reducing or eliminating live tumor cells in body fluids of patients with metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2044848194,"Pertussis toxin (PTx) is the major virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis. The enzymatic or active (A) subunit inactivates host G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways. The non-enzymatic binding (B) subunit also mediates biological effects due to lectin-like binding characteristics, including the induction of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent down-regulation of chemokine receptor expression. Here we report another activity attributable to PTxB, facilitating transfer of membrane material between mammalian cells. This activity does not require the TCR, and does not require cell-to-cell contact or cellular aggregation. Rather, membrane vesicles are transferred from donor to recipient cells in a toxin-dependent fashion. Membrane transfer occurs in different cell types, including cultured human T cells, CHO cells, and human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Transfer involves both lipid and integral membrane proteins, as evidenced by the transfer of T and B cell-specific receptor molecules to other PBMCs. Interestingly, membrane transfer activity is a property that PTx shares with some, but not all, cell-aggregating lectins that are mitogenic for human T cells, and appears to be related to the ability to bind certain host cell glycolipids. This phenomenon may represent another mechanism by which pertussis toxin disrupts mammalian intra- and inter-cellular signaling."
