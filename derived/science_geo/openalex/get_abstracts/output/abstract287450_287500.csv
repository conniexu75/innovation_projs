https://openalex.org/W2159849881,"Black phosphorus undergoes two reversible structural transitions at high pressures. The first is to a structure of the type arsenic A7. This structure is transformed to a simple cubic structure at higher pressures. The reversibility between the A7 and simple cubic structures at 111 kilobars indicates that the transition obtainable at this pressure provides a good calibration point by which high-pressure x-ray data may be united with volumetric or resistance measurements, or both."

Water potentials of fielddry leaves corresponded to 30 to 40 percent relative humidity. Mature leaves survived from 15 to approximately 0 percent relative humidity. Known examples were increased from 4 to 15 species, which for the first time included grasses."

The distribution of specific rotations in 200 individual samples varied from [alpha](D) = -218 degrees to [alpha](D) = +206 degrees with a mean of +0.14 degree and standard deviation of 86.4 degrees. This resolution into enantiomers is determined by chance development, with equal probability, of right- or left-handed crystallites; it can be controlled and made stereospecific by addition of dissymmetric compounds at low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2050319764,"Despite its somewhat naive simplicity, the method of the local molecular field has had undeniable success in satisfactorily explaining a large number of previously known facts and in opening the way for the discovery of new facts. Let us note, however, that all the structures that have been discussed above are collinear structures: on the average (in time) all the atomic magnets pointing in one or the opposite direction are parallel to a single direction. However, the local molecular field method can also be extended to noncollinear structures such as that of helimagnetism, which Yoshimori and Villain discovered independently in an absolutely unexpected manner; one can thus interpret phenomena in a remarkably simple and concrete manner."

https://openalex.org/W1984268328,"Carbon-14-labeled beta-alanine was injected into newly formed Drosophila melanogaster female pupae. Homozygous ebony deposited less C(14) in pupal sheaths, deposited more C(14) in adult body extracts and wings, and decarboxylated and oxidized beta-alanine to excrete C(14)O(2) faster than did non-ebony homozygotes. Heterozygotes were intermediate in all these activities."
https://openalex.org/W2079985427,"Thermoluminescence dosimetry is a powerful tool for obtaining the distribution of gamma dose, heretofore unknown, from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Roof tiles irradiated by the bombs show intense thermoluminescence, and the radiation dose for samples irradiated below 100 r by the bomb can be measured by this method."
https://openalex.org/W1981277248,"Pollen of corn plants carrying three closely linked genes (alpha beta Sh(2)) on chromosome 3 were treated by ethyl methanesulfonate in order to determine the nature of genetic changes produced. In this genetic material the loss of the beta gene alone represents a discrete genetic change, possibly a point mutation, while the loss of two or more markers represents chromosome aberrations. Ethyl methanesulfonate, x-rays, and ultraviolet light all induced numerous chromosome aberrations, but only ultraviolet light and probably ethyl methanesulfonate induced discrete genetic changes."
https://openalex.org/W2012487170,"The electrical resistance of ytterbium, measured as a function of pressure, shows a sharp maximum at 38 kb, both at 300 degrees K and 77 degrees K. At low pressures ytterbium is a metal because of overlap between filled and empty bands. From about 20 kb to the resistance maximum it is a semiconductor, indicating that the overlap disappears. At the maximum there is a phase transition, and beyond this pressure ytterbium is again metallic."

https://openalex.org/W2023266914,"A comet of the size recently postulated by H. C. Urey would leave a large crater. It is shown, from aerodynamic theory, from observations of distribution around terrestrial impact craters, and from experimental nuclear explosions, that the observed distribution of tektites cannot be the result of impact on the earth, whether cometary or meteoritic. It is further shown, from aerodynamic theory, from observation of a meteor shower, and from study of the breakup of artificial satellites, that the distribution of tektites can be accounted for as a result of fusion stripping of a satellite, as originally suggested by Suess."
https://openalex.org/W1983217487,"The hemocyanin of the keyhole limpet, Diodora aspera, shows no Bohr effect within the pH range 6.88 to 7.84. At 10 degrees C the pressure of half-saturation is 5 mm-Hg of oxygen pressure. A moderately positive interaction occurs among the oxygen-combining sites during oxygenation. The heat of oxygenation is calculated to be approximately -12.6 kcal/mole of oxygen. The pH of normal blood of Diodora is lower than that of many other marine molluscs."

https://openalex.org/W2052122768,"The gravity at the Apollo 14 landing site has been determined from the accelerometer data that were telemetered from the lunar module. The values for the lunar gravity measured at the Apollo 11, 12, and 14 sites were reduced to a common elevation and were then compared between sites. A theoretical gravity, based on the assumption of a spherical moon, was computed for each landing site and compared with the observed value. The observed gravity was also used to compute the lunar radius at each landing site."
