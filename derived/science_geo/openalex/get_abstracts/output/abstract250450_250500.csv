However, the influence of living alone on experiences generally considered to be beneficial to the brain, such as physical exercise, remains unknown. We report here that individual housing precludes the positive influence of short-term running on adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of rats and, in the presence of additional stress, suppresses the generation of new neurons. Individual housing also influenced corticosterone levels—runners in both housing conditions had elevated corticosterone during the active phase, but individually housed runners had higher levels of this hormone in response to stress. Moreover, lowering corticosterone levels converted the influence of short-term running on neurogenesis in individually housed rats from negative to positive. These results suggest that, in the absence of social interaction, a normally beneficial experience can exert a potentially deleterious influence on the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2281048538,"Monoubiquitination is a reversible post-translational protein modification that has an important regulatory function in many biological processes, including DNA repair. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases that are negative regulators of monoubiquitination, but little is known about their regulation and contribution to the control of conjugated-substrate levels. Here, we show that the DUB ubiquitin specific protease 1 (USP1) deubiquitinates the DNA replication processivity factor, PCNA, as a safeguard against error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) of DNA. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation inactivates USP1 through an autocleavage event, thus enabling monoubiquitinated PCNA to accumulate and to activate TLS. Significantly, the site of USP1 cleavage is immediately after a conserved internal ubiquitin-like diglycine (Gly–Gly) motif. This mechanism is reminiscent of the processing of precursors of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifiers by DUBs. Our results define a regulatory mechanism for protein ubiquitination that involves the signal-induced degradation of an inhibitory DUB."

https://openalex.org/W2168103192,"The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are critically involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, survival, and apoptosis via cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling. SOCS-1 silencing by aberrant DNA methylation contributes to oncogenesis in various B-cell neoplasias and carcinomas. Recently, we showed an alternative loss of SOCS-1 function due to deleterious SOCS-1 mutations in a major subset of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and in the PMBL line MedB-1, and a biallelic SOCS-1 deletion in PMBL line Karpas1106P. For both cell lines our previous data demonstrated retarded JAK2 degradation and sustained phospho-JAK2 action leading to enhanced DNA binding of phospho-STAT5. Here, we analysed SOCS-1 in laser-microdissected Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We detected SOCS-1 mutations in HRS cells of eight of 19 cHL samples and in three of five Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)-derived cell lines by sequencing analysis. Moreover, we found a significant association between mutated SOCS-1 of isolated HRS cells and nuclear phospho-STAT5 accumulation in HRS cells of cHL tumor tissue (P < 0.01). Collectively, these findings support the concept that PMBL and cHL share many overlapping features, and that defective tumor suppressor gene SOCS-1 triggers an oncogenic pathway operative in both lymphomas."

The underlying mechanisms are insufficiently understood. To identify components of the RNAi pathway in S2 cells, we developed a screen based on rescue from RNAi-induced lethality. We identified Argonaute 2, a core component of the RNAi machinery, and three gene products previously unknown to be involved in RNAi in Drosophila: DEAD-box RNA helicase Belle, 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit 8 (Pros45), and clathrin heavy chain, a component of the endocytic machinery. Blocking endocytosis in S2 cells impaired RNAi, suggesting that dsRNA fragments are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Indeed, using a candidate gene approach, we identified two Drosophila scavenger receptors, SR-CI and Eater, which together accounted for more than 90% of the dsRNA uptake into S2 cells. When expressed in mammalian cells, SR-CI was sufficient to mediate internalization of dsRNA fragments. Our data provide insight into the mechanism of dsRNA internalization by Drosophila cells. These results have implications for dsRNA delivery into mammalian cells.

These results have implications for dsRNA delivery into mammalian cells. Many organisms mount specific defense responses to silence invading nucleic acid sequences before these sequences integrate into the host genome and disturb cellular processes. At the core of these sequence-directed immunity mechanisms is dsRNA, 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; AcLDL, acetylated low density lipoprotein; Chc, clathrin heavy chain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DEAD-box, Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp sequence; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RISC, RNA-induced silencing complexes; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. which becomes processed and causes gene silencing, referred to as RNA interference (RNAi) (1Fire A.

Nature. 2004; 431: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In addition to its defense function, RNAi guides endogenous developmental and regulatory processes and is used as a research tool to suppress the expression of cellular genes in numerous model organisms (2Mello C.C. Conte Jr., D. Nature. 2004; 431: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Although species variations exist, the silencing mechanisms in plants, fungi, worms, insects, and mammals share common features and conserved genes. Drosophila S2 cells are widely used to carry out large scale functional screens (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3423-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) because dsRNA fragments (usually about 500-700 bp) can be added directly to the cell culture medium, “soaking” the cells rather than transfecting them (6Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). This makes silencing in these cells easy and efficient, in contrast to mammalian cells that require small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to be delivered by transfection. In contrast to Caenorhabditis elegans cells, which internalize dsRNA by the channel-forming transmembrane protein SID-1 (7Winston W.M. Molodowitch C. Hunter C.P. Science. 2002; 295: 2456-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), the mechanism of dsRNA uptake into Drosophila cells is unknown. In the cytosol, dsRNA fragments are processed into short 21-23-nucleotide dsRNA duplexes (siRNAs) by a dsRNA-specific RNase-III-type endonuclease called Dicer-2 (8Hammond S.M. Bernstein E. Beach D.

Nature. 2001; 409: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (3819) Google Scholar). Dicer-2 is stably complexed with the dsRNA binding domain-containing protein R2D2 binding to siRNA and thereby, facilitating siRNA loading onto RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) (11Liu Q. Rand T.A. Kalidas S. Du F. Kim H.E. Smith D.P. Wang X. Science. 2003; 301: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). RISC contain a member of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family Ago-2, which has been shown to mediate siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage (12Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) and degradation of the passenger strand in the siRNA duplex (13Matranga C. Tomari Y. Shin C. Bartel D.P. Zamore P.D.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although Dicer-2, R2D2, and Ago-2 can constitute “minimal” RISC under certain circumstances (15Rand T.A. Petersen S. Du F. Wang X. Cell. 2005; 123: 621-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), many other proteins have been suggested to be involved in RNA silencing in vivo (16Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar, 17Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 18Sontheimer E.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been postulated that an RNA helicase is required for loading of the RISC with the guide strand of the siRNA duplex. In Drosophila, three putative RNA helicases (Armitage, Spindle E, and Dmp68) have been implicated in RNAi (16Meister G. Tuschl T. Nature. 2004; 431: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar, 17Tomari Y. Zamore P.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 18Sontheimer E.J. Nat. Rev.

To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of dsRNA uptake, transfer, and processing in S2 cells, we carried out an RNAi-based screen to identify gene products required for RNAi. 2,000 dsRNAs were analyzed for their protective effect from lethality induced by RNAi against an essential gene for cell viability, the Drosophila homologue of ubiquitin (Ubi-p63E) (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 4Boutros M. Kiger A.A. Armknecht S. Kerr K. Hild M. Koch B. Haas S.A. Consortium H.F. Paro R. Perrimon N. Science. 2004; 6: 832-835Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In addition, the mechanism and two receptors for dsRNA internalization in S2 cells were identified. Synthesis of the dsRNAs—A cDNA library derived from S2 cells (20Pearson A. Lux A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) was used as a source for templates for RNA synthesis essentially as described earlier (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Targeted dsRNA treatments were carried out as described (21Kallio J. Leinonen A. Ulvila J. Valanne S. Ezekowitz R.A. Rämet M. Microbes Infect. 2005; 7: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using primers presented in a supplemental table. GFP dsRNA was produced using pMT/BiP/V5-His/GFP plasmid (Invitrogen) as a template. FITC-labeled GFP dsRNA was synthesized using a T7 MegaScript kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that half of the UTP was replaced with 1.5 mm FITC-UTP (Enzo). Ubi-p63E Survival Assay—S2 cells were grown as described (20Pearson A. Lux A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). dsRNAs corresponding to indicated or random genes were introduced into S2 cells by soaking. On a 24-well plate, a total of 5 × 105 cells/well were treated with 10 μg of dsRNA. After 72 h, one-sixth of the cells treated with the first dsRNA was transferred into a 48-well plate, and Ubi-p63E dsRNA (5 μg) was introduced. 72 h later, the ability of the S2 cells to phagocytose FITC-labeled Escherichia coli was measured using flow cytometry (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assay—S2 cells were transferred to 24-well plates, and 5 μg of dsRNA was added. After 48 h, the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of constitutively active form of Toll (Toll10b) together with 0.5 μg of Drosomycin-luciferase firefly reporter, 0.1 μg of control plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega), and either 0.5 μg of Myd88 dsRNA or 0.5 μg of GFP dsRNA using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 96 h after transfections, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. The ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activities was calculated, and the values were normalized to the values of GFP dsRNA-treated controls. Endocytosis Assay—For the S2 cells, 2 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 48-well plates for flow cytometry. After 72 h, 7-20 μg/ml FITC-labeled dsRNA (500 bp) or 4 μg/ml Alexa-acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) (Molecular Probes) was added to the growth medium and incubated for 20 min. The extracellular fluorescence was quenched by adding trypan blue just prior to the actual measurement. Thereafter, the cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. For the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates for flow cytometry. 36-48 h later, 2 μg/ml Alexa-AcLDL or 7.5 μg/ml FITC-dsRNA (500 bp) was added to the growth medium and incubated for 2 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed with 1× PBS, detached by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold 1× PBS, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Confocal and Fluorescence Microscopy—106 S2 cells/well were seeded into two chamber slides (Nunc) and, when indicated, treated with a total of 20 μg of indicated dsRNA. 72 h later, cells were allowed to internalize FITC-labeled dsRNA (500 bp, 12 μg/ml) for 5, 20, or 60 min at 26 °C. Cells were then washed with 1× PBS and thereafter fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed again with 1× PBS, and the cell nuclei were stained for 20 min with 1 μg/ml 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. After the staining, slides were washed twice with 1× PBS and once with distilled H2O and mounted on Aquamount. For the CHO cells, 105 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates and acid-washed onto 22 × 22-mm coverslips for microscopy. 36-48 h later, 2 μg/ml Alexa488-AcLDL or 7.5 μg/ml FITC-dsRNA was added to the growth medium and incubated for 4 h. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed for 20 min with 3% formaldehyde. Fixed coverslips were washed with 1× PBS, unreacted aldehyde groups were saturated with 50 mm ammonium chloride in 1× PBS, and coverslips were mounted on 15 μl of moviol. Pictures were taken on an inverted Nikon TE2000-U epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Hamatsu Orca ER) using a 60× Plan-Apochromat oil objective. Images were acquired and enhanced using Openlab software (Improvision). Immunoelectron Microscopy—2 × 106 cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes, and 10 μg/ml dsRNA was added. After 72 h, cells were allowed to internalize FITC-dsRNA (8.5 μg/ml) for 0, 5, or 60 min at 26 °C. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2 m phosphate buffer with 2.5% sucrose for 30 min. The fixed cells were pelleted and immersed in 2% agarose in 1× PBS, after which the blocks were immersed in 2.3 m sucrose in 1× PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the immunolabeling, thin sections were first incubated in 0.05 m glycine in 1× PBS followed by incubation in 5% BSA with 0.1% cold water fish skin gelatin (Aurion) in 1× PBS. Antibodies and the gold conjugate were diluted in 0.1% BSA-C (Aurion) in 1× PBS. All washings were performed in 0.1% BSA-C in 1× PBS. The sections were incubated with anti-FITC antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (1:500 dilution) followed by protein A-gold complex (10 nm) for 30 min. The sections were embedded in methylcellulose and examined in Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co.). Images were captured with a CCD camera equipped with TCL-EM-Menu version 3 from Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems GmbH (Gaunting, Germany). To identify components of the RNAi machinery in S2 cells, we devised an assay based on the observation that RNAi directed against the essential gene Ubi-p63E kills S2 cells (4Boutros M. Kiger A.A. Armknecht S. Kerr K. Hild M. Koch B. Haas S.A. Consortium H.F. Paro R. Perrimon N. Science. 2004; 6: 832-835Crossref Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and abolishes their ability to phagocytose fluorescent particles (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to use phagocytosis as a sensitive readout for the RNAi-mediated rescue from the lethal effects of Ubi-p63E dsRNA. When the synthesis of an essential component of RNAi machinery is prevented by RNAi, the cells are protected from Ubi-p63E RNAi-mediated lethality, and their ability to phagocytose is preserved. As shown in Fig. 1A, S2 cells lose the ability to phagocytose E. coli within 48 h after addition of Ubi-p63E dsRNA into the cell culture medium. Pretreatment of cells with Dicer-2 dsRNAs decreased the lethal effect of Ubi-p63E dsRNA in a concentration-dependent way (Fig. 1, A and B). We screened 2,000 dsRNA fragments generated from random S2 cell-derived cDNA clones (3Rämet M. Manfruelli P. Pearson A. Mathey-Prevot B. Ezekowitz R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Most treatments had little or no effect, whereas altogether four RNAi treatments rescued from RNAi-induced lethality to an extent comparable to Dicer-2 RNAi (which was used as a positive control) (Fig. 1C). These were dsRNAs targeting the endonuclease Ago-2, a well established component of the RNAi machinery in Drosophila (12Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 22Rand T.A. Ginalski K. Grishin N.V. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14385-14389Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 23Okamura K. Ishizuka A. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1655-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and three genes that had not been implicated in RNAi in Drosophila previously: belle, a recently characterized DEAD-box RNA helicase; Pros45, the regulatory subunit 8 of the 26 S proteasome; and clathrin heavy chain (Chc), a component of the endocytic machinery. The finding that Chc, a component of the endocytic machinery, is required for RNAi in S2 cells suggests that it plays a role in the uptake of dsRNA, whereas Ago-2, belle, and Pros45 are more likely to act at later steps in the silencing process. To confirm this prediction, we used an assay that bypasses dsRNA internalization by transfection. In this assay, transcriptional activation of a reporter gene (Drosomycin-luciferase) by a constitutively active form of the cell surface receptor Toll (Toll10B) is prevented by RNAi targeting, a downstream component of the Toll signaling pathway (Myd88). When an essential component of the RNAi machinery is blocked by RNAi, silencing of the Toll pathway is prevented, and the reporter gene is transcribed. As shown in Fig. 2A, RNAi targeting Ago-2, belle, and Pros45 (as well as a Dicer-2 control) interfered with Myd88 dsRNA-mediated silencing of Toll pathway signaling as measured by luciferase activity. Chc dsRNA did not affect silencing of reporter gene expression. These data confirm on the one hand the involvement of Belle and Pros45 in RNA silencing and indicate on the other hand that Chc acts upstream of intracellular silencing events. To confirm the role of endocytic pathway in RNAi, we used a variation of the reporter gene assay as described above. We pretreated S2 cells with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar type H+-ATPase required for endosome maturation, before soaking the cells with dsRNA directed against Myd88. As shown in Fig. 2B, pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 significantly, albeit not totally, blocked the effect of Myd88 dsRNA on Drosomycin-luciferase reporter activity, indicating that endocytosis of dsRNA fragments is necessary for efficient transcriptional silencing in S2 cells. We used immunofluorescence and electron microscopy to further characterize the uptake of FITC-dsRNA fragments into S2 cells (Fig. 3). dsRNA uptake is rapid; after 5 min, a major portion of the FITC-dsRNA was bound at the cell periphery just above the plasma membrane or internalized beneath the plasma membrane in small vesicles (Fig. 3). Within 30 min, dsRNA could be seen in larger vesicles (Fig. 3B). Taken together with the functional analysis described above, these data suggest that dsRNA fragments are taken up into S2 cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Scavenger receptors are a group of structurally unrelated molecules known to mediate the endocytosis of certain polyanionic ligands, including nucleic acids (reviewed in Ref. 24Greaves D.R. Gordon S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Drosophila genome contains several scavenger receptors, some of which have been characterized in detail (20Pearson A. Lux A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Franc N.C. Heitzler P. Ezekowitz R.A. White K. Science. 1999; 18: 1991-1994Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 26Rämet M.

Cell. 2005; 123: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We tested whether RNAi targeting some of these receptors affected endocytosis of dsRNA (Fig. 4A). RNAi targeting the class B scavenger receptors Croquemort (crq), emp, and ninaD as well as the eater homologues CG8946 and CG18146 had no effect on endocytosis, whereas RNAi targeting the class C scavenger receptor, SR-CI, and the epidermal growth factor repeat-containing scavenger receptor, eater, led to a significant decrease in the endocytosis of dsRNA fragments (500 bp) (Fig. 4A). Consistent with previous observations, SR-CI RNAi decreased also the endocytosis of AcLDL, whereas eater RNAi had a smaller effect (Fig. 4A and Refs. 26Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Göbel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar and 27Kocks C. Cho J.H. Nehme N. Ulvila J.

Cell. 2005; 123: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A combination of SR-CI and eater RNAi resulted in >90% decrease in the internalization of dsRNA when compared with GFP dsRNA-treated controls. These data were confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B); RNAi silencing of SR-CI and eater together led to a strongly reduced internalization signal. Targeting these receptors similarly decreased internalization of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled dsRNA, excluding the possibility that these scavenger receptors bind to fluorescein and not to dsRNA (data not shown). These results indicate that eater and SR-CI together account for a major part of the internalized dsRNA in S2 cells. In contrast to Drosophila cells, mammalian cells do not readily internalize dsRNA fragments. Therefore, we tested whether expression of a Drosophila scavenger receptor can increase dsRNA internalization into mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 5, CHO cells stably transfected with SR-CI (20Pearson A. Lux A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) showed a marked increase in dsRNA uptake when compared with nontransfected control cells. Thus, expression of a Drosophila scavenger receptor is sufficient to confer increased uptake of dsRNA into mammalian cells. We used an RNAi-based screen to find genes required for RNAi in Drosophila S2 cells. We identified a known RNAi component and three genes previously unknown to be involved in RNAi in Drosophila. The identification of Ago-2, the core component of the RISC (12Hammond S.M. Boettcher S. Caudy A.A. Kobayashi R. Hannon G.J. Science. 2001; 293: 1146-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), validates our screen and shows that it is suitable for identifying genes involved in RNAi. In addition, three other genes were identified: belle, Pros45, and Chc. Interestingly, we noted that RNAi directed against Ago-2, belle, or Pros45, similar to control RNAi against Dicer-2, only partially rescued from the RNAi-induced lethal effect of Ubi-p63E knockdown (Fig. 1). Because it seems unlikely that all of these genes encode particularly long-lived proteins, this result suggests that none of these genes may be absolutely required for RNAi. Besides Belle, three putative RNA helicases (Armitage, Spindle E, and Dmp68) have been reported to be important for RNAi in S2 cells (28Kennerdell J.R. Yamaguchi S. Carthew R.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Ishizuka A. Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2497-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 30Tomari Y.

Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and it is possible that one or all of these could compensate for reduced belle expression. Alternatively, it is conceivable that it may be technically impossible to entirely silence the expression of a gene encoding for a protein that itself is necessary for RNAi. DEAD-box proteins are ATP-dependent RNA helicases that function at various stages of RNA processing (31Rocak S. Linder P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). belle encodes a recently characterized Drosophila DEAD-box protein that is conserved from yeast to man (32Johnstone O. Deuring R. Bock R. Linder P. Fuller M.T. Lasko P. Dev. Biol. 2004; 277: 92-101Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Strong mutations in Belle cause lethality by larval growth arrest and male and female sterility. Belle yeast ortholog DED1 is involved in translation initiation, ATP-dependent RNA unwinding, and remodeling of RNA-protein interactions (33Chuang R.-Y. Weaver P.L. Liu Z. Chang T.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1468-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 34Iost I. Dreyfus M. Linder P. J. Biol.

Science. 2004; 304: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This makes Belle as well as Belle-related molecules an interesting candidate for unidentified siRNA duplex unwindase activities in Drosophila RISC. Pros45, the Drosophila orthologue of SUG1, is one of the six ATPases in the base part of the regulatory subunit of the 26 S proteasome. The 19 S regulatory subunit confers polyubiquitin recognition to the 20 S proteasome core (36Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that besides its role in protein degradation, the 19 S regulatory proteasome subunit functions also in transcriptional regulation and in nucleotide excision repair and that the ATPase activity of SUG1 is important in these processes (37Lee D. Ezhkova E. Li B. Pattenden S.G. Tansey W.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 423-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 38Baker S.P. Grant P.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 361-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Yeast as well as vertebrate SUG1 has been shown to possess 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity and to be involved in transcriptional regulation (39Fraser R.A. Rossignol M. Heard D.J. Egly J.M. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7122-7126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, because the proteasome had never before been implicated in RNAi, and our RNAi machinery screen was ubiquitin-based, we used an ubiquitin-independent RNAi assay to confirm that Pros45/SUG1 is required for efficient RNAi (Fig. 2A). Our results suggest that Pros45/SUG1 indeed may be involved in RNAi, either directly or indirectly, and warrant further investigation of its role in RNA silencing. Our results indicate that endocytosis plays a role in the uptake of dsRNA in Drosophila cells. By a candidate approach, we were able to identify two endocytic receptors that together account for a major part of the dsRNA uptake in S2 cells, the previously characterized Drosophila scavenger receptors SR-CI and Eater. SR-CI and Eater are two structurally unrelated type I membrane proteins that have a role in the phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens and display multi-ligand specificity reminiscent of mammalian scavenger receptors (26Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Göbel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Kocks C.

Cell. 2005; 123: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The binding activity of SR-CI has been mapped to its N terminus containing two complement control protein domains and one MAM (meprin/A5 antigen/mu receptor tyrosine phosphatase) domain. The ectodomain of Eater is predicted to contain 32 typical, non-calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like domains (27Kocks C. Cho J.H. Nehme N. Ulvila J. Pearson A.M. Meister M. Strom C. Conto S.L. Hetru C. Stuart L.M. Stehle T. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Ferrandon D. Rämet M. Ezekowitz R.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the N-terminal four of which have been shown to participate in ligand binding. Our results suggest that dsRNA may be another, hitherto unrecognized, ligand for these molecules. It will be interesting to address whether the same domains bind all types of ligands. If so, further analysis of the structural basis of this interaction may help to provide insight into the basis of multiligand specificity in general. Of note, the expression of both SR-CI and Eater has been shown to be restricted to plasmatocytes, a macrophage-like blood cell type of Drosophila (26Rämet M. Pearson A. Manfruelli P. Li X. Koziel H. Göbel V. Chung E. Krieger M. Ezekowitz R.A. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Kocks C. Cho J.H. Nehme N. Ulvila J. Pearson A.M. Meister M. Strom C. Conto S.L. Hetru C. Stuart L.M. Stehle T. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Ferrandon D. Rämet M. Ezekowitz R.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 335-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). For in vivo silencing approaches, which involve dsRNA injected into the hemolymph (blood equivalent of the fly) (40Goto A. Blandin S. Royet J. Reichhart J.M. Levashina E.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6619-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), one should therefore expect that a major part of the injected dsRNA fragments is cleared by plasmatocytes. This may have implications for this type of gene silencing approach in the fly. The finding that mammalian cells show strongly increased internalization of dsRNA after expression of a Drosophila scavenger receptor (SR-CI) opens avenues for improved delivery of silencing agents into mammalian cells. Silencing agents such as siRNAs could be derivatized with scavenger receptor ligands, thereby facilitating their uptake and eliminating the need for transfections in cellular high throughput RNAi screens. It appears that SR-CI does not recognize siRNAs that are routinely used for RNAi in mammalian cells but rather longer fragments of dsRNA (supplemental figure and data not shown). Nevertheless, it is conceivable to explore direct delivery of 500 bp long dsRNA fragments into mammalian cells that carry deletions of RNase L and protein kinase R, a cell-based viral defense system for dsRNA that is thought to interfere with biological readouts (41Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 42Player M.R. Torrence P.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 55-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This could facilitate mammalian high throughput RNAi screens especially with cell lines that are difficult to transfect by making such screens cheaper and more accessible.

https://openalex.org/W2088930918,"Irradiated cells induce chromosomal instability in unirradiated bystander cells in vitro. Although bystander effects are thought to be linked to radiation-induced secondary cancers, almost no studies have evaluated bystander effects in vivo. Furthermore, it has been proposed that epigenetic changes mediate bystander effects, but few studies have evaluated epigenetic factors in bystander tissues in vivo. Here, we describe studies in which mice were unilaterally exposed to X-irradiation and the levels of DNA damage, DNA methylation and protein expression were evaluated in irradiated and bystander cutaneous tissue. The data show that X-ray exposure to one side of the animal body induces DNA strand breaks and causes an increase in the levels of Rad51 in unexposed bystander tissue. In terms of epigenetic changes, unilateral radiation suppresses global methylation in directly irradiated tissue, but not in bystander tissue at given time-points studied. Intriguingly, however, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and 3b and a concurrent increase in the levels of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in bystander tissues. Furthermore, the levels of two methyl-binding proteins known to be involved in transcriptional silencing, MeCP2 and MBD2, were also increased in bystander tissue. Together, these results show that irradiation induces DNA damage in bystander tissue more than a centimeter away from directly irradiated tissues, and suggests that epigenetic transcriptional regulation may be involved in the etiology of radiation-induced bystander effects."

https://openalex.org/W2061035319,"We used gene expression profiling, mutation analyses of FGFR3 and TP53, and LOH analyses of chromosome 9 and the TP53 region on chromosome arm 17p, to molecularly characterize 75 Ta and T1 bladder carcinomas. We identified four major cellular processes related to cell cycle, protein synthesis, immune response, and extra cellular components that contribute to the expressional heterogeneity of early-stage urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). Activating FGFR3 mutations were found at the highest frequency in G1 tumors (80%), and showed a strong correlation with FGFR3 expression. In contrast, G3 tumors displayed mutations in less than 10% of the cases and a low level of FGFR3 expression. Even though LOH on chromosome 9 was not associated with any specific expression pattern, our data indicate that loss of chromosome 9 is associated with tumor development rather than initiation. The combined analyses suggest the existence of two types of UCC tumors, one which is characterized by FGFR3 mutation or expression, high expression of protein synthesis genes, and low expression of cell cycle genes. Furthermore, the presented data underscore FGFR3 receptor involvement in urothelial cell transformation as the presence of FGFR3 mutations has a major impact on the global gene expression profile of bladder carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2164866041,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. The human TLR3 recognizes foreign-derived double-stranded RNA and endogenous necrotic cell RNA as ligands. Herein we characterized the contribution of glycosylation to TLR3 structure and function. Exogenous addition of purified extracellular domain of TLR3 (hTLR3 ECD) expressed in human embryonic kidney cells was found to inhibit TLR3-dependent signaling, thus providing a reagent for structural and functional characterization. Approximately 35% of the mass of the hTLR3 ECD was due to posttranslational modification, with N-linked glycosyl groups contributing substantially to the additional mass. Cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, prevented TLR3-induced NF-κB activation, confirming that N-linked glycosylation is required for bioactivity of this receptor. Further, mutations in two of these predicted glycosylation sites impaired TLR3 signaling without obviously affecting the expression of the protein. Single-particle structures reconstructed from electron microscopy images and two-dimensional crystallization revealed that hTLR3 ECD forms a horseshoe structure similar to the recently elucidated x-ray structure of the protein expressed in insect cells using baculovirus vectors (Choe, J., Kelker, M.

Proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns are key factors in the cascade of events from the detection to the elimination of an invading organism. This form of innate immunity is conserved in eukaryotes. For example, the Drosophila melanogaster Toll protein is responsible for resistance to fungal and bacterial infections (3Lemaitre B. Nat. Rev.

The TLRs and related pathogen sensors contain leucine-rich repeat motifs that form docking sites for pathogen ligands or adaptors that bind pathogen ligands, the binding of which will activate signal transduction pathway(s) (10McGettrick A.F.

TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA and may be a part of a redundant sensor system to detect viral infections (13Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

Virology. 2004; 322: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although specific features in the ligands required to interact with TLR3 remain to be identified, TLR3 is activated by polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and has been reported to be activated by RNAs extracted from necrotic cells (16Kariko K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). A number of issues concerning TLR3 structure and function remain to be elucidated. For example, TLR3 can apparently act both on the surface of the plasma membrane, as it does in fibroblasts, and by attaching to the membranes of intracellular vacuoles, where it is proposed to act in immature dendritic cells (17Matsumoto M. Funami K. Tanabe M. Oshiumi H. Shingai M. Seto Y. Yamamoto A. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 18Nishiya T. DeFranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19008-19017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The trafficking of TLRs should be influenced by glycosylation in general, and N-linked glycosylation of TLR2 and TLR4 has been shown to play essential roles in its localization (19Weber A.N. Morse M.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34589-34594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A significant recent advance in TLR3 was the elucidation of a 2.1 Å structure of the soluble ectodomain by Choe et al. (1Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Bell et al. (2Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) independently elucidated a highly similar structure. In both studies, the crystallized ectodomains were produced in a baculovirus expression system and formed a horseshoe-shaped solenoid structure that was extensively decorated with glycosyl modifications, some of which were partially resolved in the structure. Whether the glycosylations are important in TLR3 localization and/or function were not directly addressed in these works (1Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 2Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, de Bouteiller et al. (21de Bouteiller O. Merck E. Hasan U.A. Hubac S. Benguigui B. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. Caux C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a change of Asn-247 to an arginine in TLR3 negatively affected TLR3 activity. We expressed the extracellular domain (ECD) of the human TLR3 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293T) and demonstrated that it was modified with N-linked glycosylations. Using the Glc-NAc-transferase inhibitor tunicamycin, a concentration-dependent inhibition of TLR3 activity was observed. Systematic mutational analysis of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites identified two asparagine residues in leucine-rich repeats 8 and 15 that are important for TLR3 activity. The mutant proteins remain expressed at levels similar to wild type. In addition, because our ectodomain was produced in human cells as opposed to insect-derived protein, which differs in the presence of glycosylations, we independently established the structural framework for the hTLR3 ECD using electron microscopy of single particles and two-dimensional crystals in conjunction with image reconstruction. Expression and Purification of hTLR3 ECD—The full-length human TLR3 cDNA, identical to accession number U88879, was amplified from human dendritic cells and cloned into pcDNA3.1. The extracellular domain of TLR3, consisting of amino acids 1-703, was also cloned into pcDNA3.1 to generate the hTLR3-ECD antigen with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. The protein was expressed and secreted by transiently transfected HEK 293E cells. During the secretion process, residues 1-26 were cleaved, generating a protein containing residues 27-703. The secreted protein was purified from the supernatant of 293E cells using a BD-TALON™ metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences) and further purified by gel filtration chromatography. Cell-based Assays—HEK 293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated in CoStar White 96-well plates at 4.4 × 104/ml for transfection. When the cells were ∼65-90% confluent, they were transfected with a mixture of the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and plasmids pNF-κB-Luc (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), pFL-TLR3, and phRL-TK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) that, respectively, code for the firefly luciferase reporter, full-length wild-type and/or TLR3s with mutations in the ectodomain, and the Renilla luciferase transfection control. The cells were allowed to incubate for 24 h to allow expression from the plasmids. Poly(I:C) (1 μg/ml, unless stated otherwise) was then added to appropriate sets of transfected cells to induce TLR3-dependent NF-κB activity. After another 6 h of incubation, the cells were harvested using the Dual Glo Luciferase Assay System reagents (Promega). Luminescence was quantified using the FLU-Ostar OPTIMA Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—FACS analyses were performed with 293T cells grown in 6-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/well. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH7.4, + 3% fetal bovine serum + 0.04% sodium azide) before suspension at ∼2 × 107 cells/ml in FACS buffer. The cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of phycoerthrin-labeled anti-human TLR3 mAb (clone TLR3.7; eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or a negative control mouse IgG1 control antibody. The antibodies were added to aliquots of the cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer to remove unbound antibody and then resuspended in FACS buffer. Viaprobe (BD Biosciences) was added to the cultures to exclude dead cells. The cells were transferred to the appropriate tubes and analyzed using a FACSCalibur machine (BD Biosciences). Western Blots—293T cells were transiently transfected with wild type, mutant TLR3, or with control pcDNA as described above. 36 h posttransfection, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega Inc.) and sonicated to degrade chromosomal DNA. Equal amounts of proteins from each sample were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The anti-TLR3 antibody IMG315A (Imgenex Inc.) was used in Western blots because the mAb used in the FACS analysis was unable to detect denatured TLR3. The blots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL-Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). When the effects of tunicamycin or swainsonine were examined, the cells were transfected for 6 h before addition of the drugs. Mutational Analysis of TLR3—N-linked glycosylation sites in hTLR3 ECD were predicted by the computer program Motif (NCBI). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using oligonucleotides annealed to the target sequence and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Inc.). Several clones that resulted from the mutational analysis were sequenced to confirm that no unintended mutations were made. Mutant clones with affected activity were sequenced in their entirety. Mass Spectrometry—Samples were concentrated by use of a NanoSep centrifugation concentrator (Pall Inc.), desalted using C-18 Zip Tips (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and eluted with 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One microliter of the sample was co-crystallized with the matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile/water (50:50) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI experiments were recorded on an ABI Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer. To deglycosylate hTLR3 ECD, 1 μg of the protein was treated with a mixture of N-glycanase, O-glycanase, and sialidase for 24 h at 37 °C. The products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF spectroscopy as described above. Also, the proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4-12% denaturing protein gel and then stained with the glycosylation-specific dye, SYPRO Ruby Protein gel stain (Invitrogen Inc.). Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—For single particle imaging, 2.5 μl of a 50-μg/ml solution of TLR3 ECD in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was either applied to freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids (G400) or to holey carbon films. The samples were washed with distilled water and stained for 1 min with an aqueous solution of uranyl acetate (1% w/v, pH 4.25) for the G400 grids or stained with 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate (pH 6.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) trehalose for the holey carbon film according to Harris and Scheffler (22Harris J.R. Scheffler D. Micron. 2002; 33: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional crystals were grown using the lipid monolayer approach (23Hoppert M. Microscopic Techniques in Biotechnology. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2003Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.2 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-1,2-dioleoylglycerol-3[phospho-l-serine] (100 μg/ml) and egg phosphatidylcholine (400 μg/ml) in chloroform/hexane (1:1) were layered onto 15 μl of 10 μg/ml of hTLR3ECD in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm Li2SO4, and 0.6 m sodium formate and incubated overnight in a humid chamber at 4 °C. Crystals attached to the lipid monolayer were transferred to transmission electron microscopy grid by placing a hydrophobic carbon-coated grid onto the solution surface for 1 min, followed by washing and staining as described above. Specimens were observed in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Electron micrographs were recorded at a calibrated magnification of ×39,000 on Kodak 4489 electron image sheet film and digitized with a Leafscan 45 using a scan step corresponding to 0.514 nm/pixel at the specimen level. Electron micrographs of TLR3 two-dimensional crystals were processed using the CRISP2 software package (24Hovmöller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-136Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Pixel areas of 512 × 512 were screened for the best order, indexed, and refined, and Fourier projection maps were calculated in p2 or p22121, depending on the crystal type. The p2 symmetry was established based on the presence of local two-folds. For the second crystal type, p22121 was selected based on the phase residual criterion, unit cell parameters, and systematic absences in the Fourier transforms of the type h00 with h representing odd and 0k0 with k representing odd. The three-dimensional image reconstruction of single particles was performed using the EMAN software package (25Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Approximately 2000 particles were selected with the program BOXER. After filtering and centering, STARTNRCLASSES was used to classify the raw particles into 50 classes; each class was averaged to improve signal:noise ratio. Eight classes were selected to generate a first three-dimensional reconstruction with C1 symmetry using STARTANY. This first three-dimensional reconstruction served as a starting point for iterative refinement until the reconstruction was stable as judged by Fourier shell correlation. The three-dimensional volume of the final reconstruction was displayed with the program Chimera (26Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28972) Google Scholar). Purified Recombinant hTLR3 ECD Can Affect Signaling by Full-length TLR3—We expressed and purified amino acids 27-704 of the extracellular domain of human TLR3 in 293T cells to initiate characterization of its structure and function. The recombinant protein contained six additional histidine residues at the C terminus to facilitate purification and is henceforth named hTLR3 ECD. In SDS-PAGE, purified hTLR3 ECD migrated as a mass of ∼110 kDa, much larger than the predicted mass of ∼75 kDa (Fig. 1A). The difference is likely to be because of posttranslational modifications. To confirm that this is the case, we translated residues 1-704 of TLR3 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and found that the resultant protein migrated at the expected mass (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that hTLR3 ECD is heavily modified, likely by glycosylation, a feature that we will examine below. To examine the function of the hTLR3 ECD and how mutations affected TLR3 activity, we used a cell-based assay that measures TLR3-dependent activation of gene expression. Briefly, the assay was performed by transiently transfecting 293T cells with a mixture of three plasmids: one expressing wild-type TLR3, a second reporter plasmid in which firefly luciferase sequence was expressed from a promoter containing two NF-κB binding sites, and a third control plasmid that constitutively expresses the Renilla luciferase under the control of the Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase promoter. The assay thus detects TLR3 function by the amount of reporter firefly luciferase activity produced through activation of the NF-kB transcription factor. The Renilla luciferase activity was used to detect any potentially toxic effects of our manipulations. HEK 293T cells are suitable for these assays because they do not produce detectable TLR3 activity (21de Bouteiller O. Merck E. Hasan U.A. Hubac S. Benguigui B. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. Caux C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar) and do not contain detectable TLR3 in Western blots (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, this reporter assay is strictly dependent on the transient expression of TLR3 (data not shown) and specifically dependent on the addition of poly(I:C) (Fig. 1D). A typical assay will increase the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase by 4- to 7-fold (Fig. 1D). When hTLR3 ECD was added to the reporter assay to a final concentration of 12.5-100 μg/ml, we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of wild-type TLR3-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 1D), demonstrating that hTLR3 ECD can effectively compete with wild-type human TLR3 for poly(I:C)-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that hTLR3 ECD is suitable for additional biochemical analyses. hTLR3 ECD Is Glycosylated—Mass spectrometry was used to examine the mass of hTLR3 ECD with greater precision. The purified hTLR3 ECD ionized as a large number of peaks that ranged from 105 to 115 kDa, indicating that it exists in a highly heterogeneous state (data not shown). A similar proportion of the extra mass in the ectodomain of TLR2 and TLR4 is due to glycosylation (19Weber A.N. Morse M.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34589-34594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To visualize the glycosyl groups on hTLR3 ECD directly, we separated hTLR3 ECD by SDS-PAGE and stained the gel with a glycosylation-specific fluorescent dye, SYPRO Ruby (Fig. 2A). Treatment with NANase or O-glycosidase, which releases α (2, 3)-linked sialic acids and unsubstituted Ser- or Thr-linked GalGalNac, respectively, did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of hTLR3 ECD or abolish binding by SYPRO Ruby dye. PNGlycosidase F, which releases the N-linked glycans, not only decreased the molecular mass of hTLR3 ECD from ∼115 to ∼90 kDa (Fig. 2A) but also reduced the amount of bound dye. An ∼90-kDa band was detected in amounts similar to the input when stained with Coomassie Blue (data not shown) These results confirm those from mass spectrometry that hTLR3 ECD contains a significant amount of glycosylation and further demonstrate that the majority of the removable glycosyl groups are N-linked. The fact that the mass of the protein was not reduced to the unmodified 75 kDa, the residual staining with Ruby Red, and the heterogeneous peaks in mass spectroscopy suggest that additional modifications other than N-linked glycosylations are present. Glycosylation of TLR3 Is Required for TLR3 Function—Inhibitors of protein glycosylation were used to examine whether glycosylation is required for TLR3 function in 293T cells (Fig. 2, B-D). Tunicamycin inhibits the addition of N-acetylglucosamine, the first sugar of N-linked glycosylation, whereas swainsonine affects the processing of the terminal mannoses by lysosomal mannosidase II that could lead to more complex glycosylation structures (27Elbein A.D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 21-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Moremen K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both compounds were added between 0.2 and 5 μg/ml. These concentrations do not exhibit toxicity as determined by the normal expression of Renilla luciferase expressed from the constitutive thymidine kinase promoter (data not shown). Tunicamycin inhibited TLR3-dependent induction of the NF-κB reporter in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). However, swainsonine did not apparently affect TLR3 signaling even at 5 μg/ml, a concentration that should be sufficient to inhibit glycosylation (Fig. 2C) (29Guo H.-B. Lee I. Kamar M. Pierce M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52412-52424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Another mannosidase II inhibitor, deoxymannojirimycin, also did not affect TLR3 activity in our assay, 6C. Kao, data not shown. suggesting that TLR3 activity is not affected by modifications that require mannosidase II. The differential effects of tunicamycin and swainsonine have been reported for a number of glycoproteins (30Patel R.N. Attur M.G. Dave M.N. Patel I.V. Stuchin S.A. Abramson S.B. Amin A.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3459-3467PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jans D.A. Jans P. Luius H. Fahrenholz F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether treatment with tunicamycin or swainsonine affected the level of TLR3 expression, transfected HEK297 cells were analyzed by Western blot. Tunicamycin addition to the cultures significantly decreased the amount of full-length TLR3, whereas the addition of swainsonine to 5 μg/ml did not have an obvious effect on TLR3 levels (Fig. 2D). The decrease in TLR3 levels was consistently observed in three independent transfection experiments and suggests that proper N-linked glycosylation of TLR3 is necessary for both the expression and function of TLR3. We also examined the level of TLR3 expression upon tunicamycin and swainsonine treatment using FACS with a monoclonal antibody to the ECD of hTLR3, TLR3.7. Human 293T cells transfected with the empty vector control had a high background, with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 51.6 (Fig. 2D). Cells transfected with wild-type TLR3 had an MFI of 79.8. When the transfected cells were treated with tunicamycin, the MFI of TLR3-positive cells was reduced to 60.1, suggesting that tunicamycin treatment does affect TLR3 expression. Again, treatment with swainsonine had no significant effects on TLR3 levels as detected by FACS analysis. Mutation of Potential N-linked Glycosylation Sites—The hTLR3 ECD has nine sites that perfectly matched the N-linked glycosylation motif of Asn-X-Ser/Thr (Fig. 3A). Of these, five (Asn-57, -196, -247, -275, and -413) were conserved in all of the mammalian species we examined, whereas the rest varied in the mammalian orthologs (Fig. 3A). We individually mutated the conserved asparagines within these nine putative N-linked glycosylation sites to alanines. An additional four asparagines that do not match the conserved motifs (Asn-70, -124, -252, and -388) were also mutated. For these four residues, Choe et al. (1Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) observed electron densities associated with N-glucosamines for residues Asn-124 and Asn-252 and Bell et al. (2Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) observed glycosylations associated with Asn-70 and Asn-252, but not Asn-124. We do not have evidence that Asn-388 is associated with glycosylations. Plasmids containing the mutant constructs were individually transfected into HEK 293T cells, and the effects on the NF-κB reporter activity were assessed. Changes in the four asparagines that do not match the consensus N-linked glycosylation sites did not significantly affect TLR3-dependent activation of the reporter assay, although the mutation at Asn-252 decreased NF-κB activity slightly in this assay and had modest effects in other assays (Fig. 3B and data not shown). However, changes in two of the five conserved potential N-linked glycosylation sites, N247A and N413A, consistently reduced TLR3-mediated NF-κB activation to half or less of the wild-type level (Fig. 3C). We also tested both the N413A and N265A mutations at a range of plasmid concentrations from 5 to 20 ng/transfection and found that the defect relative to wild type was observed at all concentrations tested (data not shown). The change at Asn-247 is in agreement with the observations of de Bouteiller et al. (21de Bouteiller O. Merck E. Hasan U.A. Hubac S. Benguigui B. Trinchieri G. Bates E.E. Caux C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), who characterized a change of this residue to an arginine and found the resultant protein to be nonfunctional. A version of TLR3 containing both the N247A and the N413A mutations reduced TLR3 activity to background (Fig. 3C). Expression and Localization of Mutant TLR3 Proteins—The lack of TLR3 activity with mutations N247A and N413A could be either because of an effect on protein expression, protein localization, or on a specific activity such as ligand binding. To examine the expression of the mutant TLR3 proteins, we first performed a Western blot with mAb IMG315A. The results from three independent experiments show that the levels of all three mutant proteins, N247A, N413A, and the double mutant, were comparable with the WT TLR3 in 293T cells and to TLR3 with a mutation at Asn-196 (Fig. 4A and data not shown), suggesting that the level of protein expression was not responsible for the decrease in activity in the mutants. Notably, we consistently observed that each of the mutant proteins tended to migrate at a slightly lower electrophoretic position relative to the wild-type TLR3, suggesting that the mutations did affect posttranslational modifications of the proteins. FACS analysis was used to determine whether the mutant proteins are expressed on the surface or within transfected 293T cells. Staining for intracellular protein was also performed with detergent-permeabilized cells. For cell surface expression, the background MFI in cells transfected with pcDNA was at 11, whereas cells transfected with wild-type TLR3 showed MFI levels over 27. All mutants, including N247A and N413A, had MFI >18, indicating that all of the proteins were expressed on the cell surface at levels comparable with the WT TLR3 (Fig. 4B). The background level for"

Acto-S1 ATPase activities in reconstituted systems were also determined. We investigated R145G and R145W mutations from the inhibitory region and D190H and R192H mutations from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site. Each of the four mutations sensitized the acto-S1 ATPase to Ca2+. Whereas the mutations from the inhibitory region increased the basal level of ATPase activity, those from the second actin-tropomyosin-binding site did not. The effects on the Ca2+ binding properties of the troponin ternary complex and the troponin-tropomyosin complex with one of four mutations were either desensitization or no effect compared with those with wild-type cTnI. All of the mutations, however, affected the Ca2+ sensitivities of the reconstituted thin filaments in the same direction as the acto-S1 ATPase activity. Also the thin filaments with one of the mutant cTnIs bound Ca2+ with less cooperativity compared with those with wild-type cTnI. These data indicate that the mutations found in the inhibitory region and those from the second actin-tropomyosin site shift the equilibrium of the states of the thin filaments differently. Moreover, the increased Ca2+ bound to myofilaments containing the mutant cTnIs may be an important factor in triggered arrhythmias associated with the cardiomyopathy."

https://openalex.org/W2036836592,"Mutations in Wnt pathway genes are rare in human breast cancer, yet activation of the pathway is evident from the misolocalization of β-catenin. We searched for relationships in the expression of Wnt pathway genes and found that both secreted frizzled related protein 1 (Sfrp1) and TCF-4 transcripts were all highly downregulated in a common subset of breast cancers relative to normal breast tissue. Sfrp1 has been previously characterized as a Wnt inhibitor, and we found that interfering with its expression in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A activated Wnt signaling. Reduction of TCF-4 levels in breast cancer was surprising as it is a transcription factor that is responsive to Wnt signaling. Therefore, we investigated a possible inhibitory role for TCF-4 in human breast cells as well as further characterizing Sfrp1. We identified CD24 as a Wnt target in MCF10A cells and used its expression a marker of Wnt signaling. Interfering with either Sfrp1 or TCF-4 in this cell line enhanced CD24 expression. Furthermore, removal of TCF/LEF binding sites in a CD24-luciferase reporter resulted in elevated reporter gene expression. Our results indicate that both Sfrp1 and TCF-4 repress Wnt signaling in breast tissue and their downregulation contributes to the activation of Wnt signaling."

Despite the enormous contributions made by these and other studies to our understanding of how such enzymes function, important details still remain obscure. There are, for example, no detailed structural data on the first ThDP-bound intermediate in the presence of any enzyme (for example, α-lactylthiamin diphosphate (α-LThDP) in PDHc E1 and pyruvate decarboxylase), which is postulated to form in the currently accepted mechanism of thiamin catalysis (Fig. 1, top, third object from the right). In an effort to obtain structural information pertaining to this key intermediate, we have determined the crystal structure of PDHc E1 from Escherichia coli in complex with α-phosphonolactylthiamin diphosphate (PLThDP). PLThDP is the product of the reaction between ThDP and methylacetylphosphonate, with the latter being an analogue of the true substrate pyruvate and a potent inhibitor of PDHc. The complex formed with PLThDP instead of ThDP therefore mimics the structure of the enzyme-bound, reactive tetrahedral intermediate α-LThDP (13Zhang S. Liu M. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54312-54318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in the decarboxylation step of the PDHc E1 reaction. It differs from the complex formed with the true substrate only in the replacement of the carboxylate group by a methyl phosphonate (PO3Me) group. However, unlike the C2α-CO2 bond normally cleaved in the reaction with pyruvate, the C2α-PO3Me bond remains intact. The reaction is therefore trapped in a pre-CO2 release-like state, and the structure represents a covalently bound, pre-decarboxylation reaction intermediate analogue. There have been three covalently bound reaction intermediate structures reported for ThDP-dependent enzymes (11Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. Konig S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Chabriere E. Charon M. Volbeda A. Pieulle L. Hatchikian E. Fontecilla-Camps J. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2004; 337: 1011-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but they all represented the planar enamine intermediate (Fig. 1, top right object) that exists only after decarboxylation. The E1-PLThDP structure is thus the first structural example of a covalently bound, pre-decarboxylation reaction intermediate analogue in any ThDP-dependent enzyme. The E1 component of the PDHc complex catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the overall PDHc reaction and therefore also provides an ideal target for mechanistic structural investigation. Initial crystallographic results for the E1-PLThDP complex have been reported previously (15Arjunan P. Sax M. Brunskill A. Nemeria N. Jordan F. Furey W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2005; 61: C202Crossref Google Scholar), and complete, detailed results at 2.1 Ä resolution are now presented with the analysis revealing several unique structural features that are absent in the native enzyme. 1) The enzyme-bound conformation of PLThDP is the V form, rather than the S form determined many years ago for the same compound in the absence of enzyme, showing how the enzyme can enforce this highly strained V conformation even in the intermediate analogue. 2) The structure identifies a role for residue His-407, explaining previous biochemical data, and shows the direct interaction (and implied function) of several additional active center residues with the covalently bound adduct. 3) Major reorganization of the active center takes place and includes the ordering of two key loops not seen in any of our other PDHc E1 structures before; thus the PLThDP dramatically diminishes their mobility. 4) A marked deviation from co-planarity of the C2–C2α bond with the thiazolium ring is clearly revealed and suggests likely mechanistic consequences. 5) The structure shows strong interaction of the C2α-OH with the N4′ atom of the 4′-aminopyrimidine of ThDP, as evidenced by a short contact distance. Elsewhere, we used PLThDP in solution to show that PLThDP exists with the 1′,4′-iminoThDP tautomeric form (16Jordan F. Nemeria N. Zhang S. Yan Y. Arjunan P. Furey W. J. Am. Chem.

The observed short O–N4′ distance is fully consistent with this tautomerization. The structural reorganization and ordering resulting from the presence of PLThDP deep in the active site extends to the enzyme exterior, providing a new surface likely involved in interactions with other enzymatic components within the PDHc multienzyme complex. Crystallization and Data Collection—The PDHc E1 from E. coli was purified and assayed according to published procedures (18Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R.

ThDP, when present, was removed by gel filtration using an Amersham Biosciences G-25 column. For crystallization, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% NaN3, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 μm leupeptin. The H407A E1 variant was purified and assayed as reported previously (19Nemeria N. Arjunan P. Brunskill A. Sheibani F. Wei W. Yan Y. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W.

The parental and corresponding variant E1 proteins were independently co-crystallized with PLThDP and Mg2+ by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method under conditions similar to that used for our earlier E1-ThDP crystallographic studies (8Arjunan P.

The best crystals were obtained at a reservoir solution with 15–20% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether, 10% propanol, 0.2% NaN3, and 60 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.05) at 22 °C.

An Osmic mirror system was used along with a thin nickel foil to provide a highly focused, intense beam of CuKα radiation. The crystals are monoclinic with space group P21 and cell constants a = 81.6, b = 142.5, c = 82.1 Ä, and β = 102.4°, with two molecules (subunits) in an asymmetric unit. To 2.1 Ä resolution, 466,210 total observations were reduced to yield 99,699 unique reflections (94% complete) with an internal R factor (based on intensities) of 0.07. The data were processed with the XGEN package (20Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-387Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and scaled with a local version of Weissman's Fourier scaling program FBSCALE (21Weissman L. Computational Crystallography. Clarendon Press, Oxford1982: 56-63Google Scholar). For the H407A E1-PLThDP complex, synchrotron data were collected at SERCAT (Advanced Photon Source) and processed with the HKL2000 package (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Since the previous E1-ThDP crystals are isomorphous with both E1-PLThDP and H407A E1-PLThDP crystals (cell constants differing by less than 0.8 Ä), atomic coordinates from the former structure were used as the starting model for both refinements. The initial model included 1602 amino acids and omitted the ThDP cofactors. Following rigid body refinement, the E1-PLThDP model was further refined by simulated annealing using the program XPLOR (23Brunger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) without imposing any non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. After the initial refinement, examination of electron density difference maps clearly showed strong density for the intermediate analogue, PLThDP, and also produced strong and interpretable electron density for two of the three previously unobserved regions, 401–413 and 541–557. After including the PLThDP and the two missing regions, the model was refined with simulated annealing, and subsequent cycles consisted of positional and B factor refinement. The refinement procedure included periodic examinations of simulated annealing omit and difference maps, as well as the introduction of water molecules. A final examination of difference electron density maps still did not produce interpretable electron density for the N-terminal residues 1–55, and they are excluded from the model. Inspection of electron density maps, model building, and structural comparisons were carried out by using the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). For all data to 2.1 Ä resolution, the R factor is 0.203 (0.213 in the last shell), and the Rfree(based on 5.3% of data) is 0.254 (0.291 in the last shell). The final structure has good stereochemistry with root mean square deviations from ideality of 0.006 Ä and 1.3° for bond lengths and angles, respectively. The final model contains two independent subunits, each with 831 amino acids out of a possible 886, as well as two PLThDP-Mg+2 cofactor pairs. This model also includes 564 water molecules, five phosphate ions, and two cisprolines (Pro-463) per asymmetric unit. The model was analyzed with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss M.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and 89% of the residues are in the most favored region in the Ramachandran plot (26Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot shows no residues in disallowed regions in either subunit. The structure of the H407A E1-PLThDP complex was determined and refined in a similar manner. However, in this structure, although the PLThDP was clearly present in strong density, the regions 1–55, 401–413, and 541–557 were completely disordered. The new structure was refined using the program CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Price L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The final model, which included 550 water molecules, resulted in an R factor of 21.6% and a Rfree of 24.1% to 1.85 Ä resolution. The slightly higher R factor for the H407A E1-PLThDP variant may be attributed to the fact that this structure contains 60 disordered residues absent from the model (the regions 401–413 and 541–557 in each molecule) that were ordered in the E1-PLThDP structure. Ramachandran statistics are similar to those for the E1-PLThDP structure. All data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Graphical representations of protein models were generated by using the program RIBBONS (28Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors for the E1-PLThDP and H407A E1-PLThDP structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the access codes 2G25 and 2G28, respectively.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsE1-PLThDPH407A E1-PLThDPSpace groupP21P21Unit cell a (Ä)81.682.0 b (Ä)142.5143.2 c (Ä)82.182.5 β (°)102.4102.6Resolution2.1 Ä1.55 ÄCompleteness % (last shell)94, (66)95, (33)Total reflections466,210685,515Unique reflections99,699213,020Rmerge0.0650.076Refinement statistics Resolution range (Ä)39.2-2.1042.0-1.85 Number of reflections93,771150,327 R factor (last shell)0.203 (0.213)0.216 (0.267) Rfree (last shell)0.254 (0.291)0.240 (0.300) Number of residues16621602 Number of waters564550Average B factor (Ä2) Main chain atoms9.5021.04 Side chain atoms11.1521.17 Solvent atoms16.023.68Root mean square deviations Bond lengths (Ä)0.0060.009 Bond angles (°)1.3°1.5° Open table in a new tab The main chain folds in PDHc E1-ThDP (8Arjunan P.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and in its E1-PLThDP counterpart are very similar, with both structures containing two subunits in an asymmetric unit. The two independent subunits are almost identical stereochemically and are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry axis. The complete dimer is shown in Fig. 2a. Each E1-PLThDP subunit consists of a single polypeptide chain folded into three domains: the N terminus (1–470), the middle (471–700), and the C terminus (701–886). Least-squares fitting of 801 common α-carbon atoms in the E1-ThDP and E1-PLThDP structures results in a root mean square deviation of 0.40 Ä. However, significant main-chain deviations (up to 2.7 Ä) occur in the middle domain helix containing residues 525–535, which are involved in close contacts with residues present in the active site channel. Except for a few side chains at the surface of the protein, the electron density over the entire molecule is generally very well defined, but as in the E1-ThDP structure, there is no interpretable electron density for the N-terminal residues 1–55. A surprising observation in the E1-PLThDP map is the presence of well defined electron density for loop residues 401–413 and 541–557 that was absent in the map of the E1-ThDP structure due to complete disorder. These two loops form part of the active site channel situated at the dimer interface. The 401–413 loop forms part of the active site, and residue His-407 in this loop forms a critical hydrogen bond to an oxygen atom in the substrate analogue phosphonyl group. This loop stabilizes the other newly ordered loop 541–557, assisted by interactions created from the large movement in the helical region 525–535. The ordering creates new interface interactions between residues Lys-403–Asn-404 from one subunit and residues Gln-548–Asp-549 from the other subunit. The two newly ordered regions thus interact with each other and propagate outward from the active site to the enzyme surface. The newly ordered regions are shown in terms of the overall structure in Fig. 2a and in greater clarity regarding the active site and enzyme surface in Fig. 2b. Electron density for the 401–413 loop and its interactions with PLThDP are shown in Fig. 3. The average B value for main and side chain atoms is 9.5 and 11.2 Ä2, respectively. These values are significantly lower than those observed in the E1-ThDP structure (16.0 and 18.6 Ä2, respectively) (8Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y. Jordan F. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), implying a more ordered assembly. Accordingly, the presence of the reaction intermediate analogue in the active site supports the formation of a tighter E1 dimer. The now ordered loop regions provide a new exterior surface that can conceivably interact with other subunits of the PDHc complex and also partially seal the active site entrance, leading to a more hydrophobic catalytic region. It is important to note that the E1-ThDP and E1-PLThDP complex crystals are isomorphous; thus the ordering cannot be attributed to new packing contacts in a different crystal form and arises only from the presence of the adduct now covalently bound to the cofactor. The H407A E1-PLThDP structure (not shown) reveals the active site to be intact and the structure generally unchanged when compared with the E1-ThDP (8Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y. Jordan F. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and E1-PLThDP structures. As in E1-ThDP and unlike in the E1-PLThDP structure, however, a final difference electron density map did not contain interpretable electron density for loop regions 401–413 and 541–557; the N-terminal region 1–55 is unobserved in all of the structures. When combined with the other structures, analysis of the H407A E1-PLThDP structure therefore confirmed the need for the His-407-PLThDP interaction in inducing the disorder-to-order transformation in two loops as the loops are ordered only when both the intermediate and His-407 are present. Clearly, the ordering is induced by the presence of PLThDP via direct hydrogen-bonding to residue His-407 and results in providing previously missing structural elements to complete both the exterior surface and the interior surface leading to the active sites. For E1-PLThDP, a difference electron density map calculated with the protein-only model indicated strong positive density for the PLThDP (Fig. 4). Funnel-shaped channels leading to the active sites are about 24 Ä deep, with walls formed by residues from both the N-terminal domain and the middle domain. In the absence of enzyme, a prior PLThDP crystal structure analysis (29Turano A. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Pike D. Kluger R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 3089-3095Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) revealed that the thiamin portion of the molecule assumes the S conformation (Φt = –99.5°, Φp = –173.6°), which is characteristic of other C2-substituted thiamins and places C2 and its bound adduct distant from N4′ of the aminopyrimidine ring. The enzyme-bound PLThDP, however, adopts the V conformation with torsion angles (30Pletcher J. Sax M. Blank G. Wood M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 1396-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) Φt and Φp of 100.5 and –67°, respectively, and results in crowding near C2. The C2α-PO3Me bond is directed very nearly perpendicular to the thiazolium ring. The PLThDP conformation is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions with Tyr-599, His-640, His-407, and Gln-408 (through a water). The active site cleft is lined with residues His-106, Ser-109, Gln-140, His-142, Tyr-177, Met-194, Asp-230, Glu-235, Asn-260, Leu-264, Lys-392, His-407, and Gln-408 from one subunit and residues Asp-521, Thr-525, Ile-569, Glu-571, Tyr-599, Phe-602, Glu-636, and His-640 from the other subunit. A stereo view of the dimer interface environment around the catalytic center is shown in Fig. 5. The structure reveals residues on the enzyme that are responsible for stabilization of the intermediate and that are capable of participating in catalysis as well. On one side of the thiazolium ring, in the vicinity of the covalent adduct on C2, is a cluster of four histidine residues. Of these, His-142 is involved in binding with the diphosphate group of the cofactor, whereas His-407 and His-640 interact with oxygen atoms in the adduct. The fourth, His-106, is bound to a water molecule. As seen earlier, His-407 is hydrogen-bonded to one of the phosphonyl oxygens, and His-640 is hydrogen-bonded to the C2α-hydroxyl oxygen atom. Tyr-599 also forms a hydrogen bond with one of the phosphonyl oxygen atoms. Other residues (Tyr-177, Gln-408, and Glu-636) interact indirectly with the intermediate analogue by hydrogen-bonding through water molecules. Leu-264 appears to interact with the analogue through Van der Waals contacts, with a terminal methyl carbon making a 3.52 Ä contact distance to the one of the phosphonyl oxygen atoms of the adduct.FIGURE 5Stereo view of the active site environment in the E1-PLThDP structure. The PLThDP is at the interface between the N-terminal and middle domains from different subunits. Residues numbered <470 and >500 are from the N-terminal and middle domains, respectively. The middle domain residues are also shown with brown bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to inducing disorder-to-order transformations, the presence of PLThDP in the active site also induces conformational changes in nearby protein residues that were previously ordered. Relative to the E1-ThDP structure, a conformational rearrangement of protein residues Leu-264, Glu-522, and Tyr-599 occurs in the E1-PLThDP structure. Residue Glu-522 shows a large conformational change as its side chain moved more than 4 Ä. The movement of residues Leu-264 and Tyr-599 and the presence of the phosphonyl oxygen atom close to the thiazolium ring play an important role in the movement of the side chain of Glu-522, which is no longer pointing toward the active site. Although it may not play a direct role in the mechanism of catalysis at this stage, Glu-522 still interacts with the cofactor through water molecules. The key interactions with PLThDP are all likely to be present in the corresponding LThDP intermediate formed from the natural substrate pyruvate, as indicated in Fig. 6, since the majority of good hydrogen bonds can still be formed. Perhaps most surprisingly, analysis of the E1-PLThDP structure revealed a significant distortion in planarity for the C2–C2α bond connecting the substrate analogue to the planar thiazolium ring, as seen in Fig. 4. This out-of-plane distortion implies considerable strain and persists despite incorporation of a planarity restraint during refinement, even after significantly increasing the restraint weight well beyond that normally used. To determine whether this effect is real or simply induced by other possibly incorrect refinement restraints, refinements and pure energy minimizations were carried out with a variety of standard force fields. In all cases, the out-of-plane distortion persists (to varying but significant degrees), provided that any reasonable van der Waals radii are used for the aminopyrimidine N4′ and adduct C2α-hydroxyl O atoms, and in any event, the distortion is required to fit the electron density. The resulting distance between these atoms (2.5 Ä) is reasonable, but it would be unacceptably short (2.2 Ä), producing a strong repulsive force in the absence of the distortion, thus explaining the strained conformation that is observed. Furthermore, since only three essentially rigid groups (coordinates obtained from the highly accurate small molecule PLThDP crystal structure (29Turano A. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M. Pike D. Kluger R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 3089-3095Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) are involved, the short contact is dictated by only the thiazolium and aminopyrimidine relative ring orientations and by the fact that the C2α-PO3Me bond is nearly perpendicular to the thiazolium ring plane. The Φt and Φp torsion angles defining the ring orientations, as well as the S–C2–C2α–P torsion angle, are clearly required to fit the strong and unambiguous electron density, and the former are also consistent with those observed in all reported ThDP-containing enzyme structures.

The repeating building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, a nucleoprotein complex consisting of two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 wrapped around 146/147 bp of DNA (1Luger K. Mäder A.W.

In vivo chromatin assembly is mostly coupled to DNA replication (11Krude T. Eur. J.

Assembly of nucleosomes seems to be closely linked to the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machineries, required for the formation of evenly spaced nucleosome arrays, which are characteristic for the native chromatin conformation (17Haushalter K.A.

Per definition, all share the capability of binding histones and releasing them to DNA or other targets, but they differ with respect to in vivo functions and the preferred histone interaction partner.

Although NAP1 is generally regarded as a carrier for the H2A·H2B dimer, it interacts with similar affinity with H3·H4 in vitro (32McQuibban G.A. Commisso-Cappelli C.N. Lewis P.N. J. Biol.

Furthermore, recent results report the interaction of NAP1 with linker histones (38Shintomi K. Iwabuchi M. Saeki H. Ura K. Kishimoto T. Ohsumi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, a tetrasome consisting of an (H3·H4)2 tetramer is formed on the DNA followed by the addition of two H2A·H2B dimers. In a final step the linker histone H1 is added to the core nucleosome yielding a complex, which is referred to here to as the chromatosome. This stepwise assembly mechanism has been shown for chromatin formation in vivo (10Jackson V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 40Worcel A. Han S. Wong M.L.

Hence, this assembly order appears to be governed by the intrinsic physical properties of the histones themselves. Accordingly, nucleosomes can be formed with predeposited H3·H4 tetrasomes but assemble only inefficiently on H2A·H2B-DNA complexes (49Kleinschmidt J.A. Seiter A. Zentgraf H.

In this study NAP1 was used in combination with DNA templates of 146 and 207 bp length, recombinant core histones, and linker histone H1 as a minimal system to study the mechanism of mononucleosome assembly mediated by a histone chaperone under well defined conditions and at physiological ionic strength. It is shown that NAP1-guided assembly includes an additional intermediate step, as after tetrasome deposition hexasomes are formed, which then maturate into complete nucleosomes. Furthermore, NAP1 assembles H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes mechanistically similar to canonical ones. According to our results, formation of mononucleosomes by NAP1 is not influenced by the energy-dependent activity of chromatin remodeling factors like ACF. Based on these findings and the results of a preceding paper (39Kepert J.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Heuvelman G.L. Fejes Toth K. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34063-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we propose a model in which assembly of nucleosomes up to the level of chromatin is governed by affinity differences of histones between chaperones and binding sites on DNA or (sub)nucleosomal complexes. Preparation of Proteins—N-terminally His-tagged yeast NAP1 was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (36Fejes Tóth K.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant histone octamer with either canonical H2A or H2A.Z was purified using established protocols (56Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol.

Site-specific labeling of histone complexes with Alexa Fluor 488 or 633 C5 maleimide (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, Netherlands) was performed as described previously using plasmids containing H2A R12C, H2A.Z K5C, H3 C110A, and H4 K5C to obtain Alexa 488-labeled H2Af, H2A.Zf, and H4f as well as Alexa 633-labeled H2Ar histone complexes (36Fejes Tóth K.F.

Gordon F. Luger K. Hansen J.C. Tremethick D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Alexa 488-labeled H1 (H1f) was prepared as described previously (39Kepert J.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Heuvelman G.L. Fejes Toth K. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34063-34072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Labeling efficiency and purification were assessed by absorbance spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Nucleic Acids—DNA fragments of 146 bp (DNA146) or 207 bp (DNA207) containing the Lytechinus variegatus rDNA sequence were prepared by restriction enzyme digestion (EcoRV or RsaI) with subsequent gel purification from the template pTJR2 (59Richmond T.J. Searles M.A. Simpson R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or p5S207-12 (60Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The bona fide random DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from plasmid pET3A using the primer I (CAT ACC GCC AGT TGT TTA CCC) and primer II (GGT CAC TGA TGC CTC CGT) for the 146-bp fragment or primer I and primer III (CAG AAG CCA GAC ATT AAC GCT TC) for the 207-bp fragment. The products were isolated by gel purification. Gel Electrophoretic Analysis of NAP1-mediated Nucleosome Assembly—For gel electrophoretic analysis, mixtures of NAP1/histone octamer (800/100 nm) and DNA207 or DNA146 (each 100 nm) were prepared in assembly buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Brij-35 (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)). In experiments with H1 or ACF (1 ACF complex: 50 histone octamers, reaction supplemented with either 1 mm ATP or CTP) a decreased salt concentration of 75 mm KCl was used. Chromatosome assembly was studied by the addition of preincubated 150 nm H1f and 300 nm NAP1. The increased ratio of H1 to histone octamer (1.5:1) was chosen to shift the equilibrium more toward chromatosome formation. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for the times indicated prior to loading on a 1% Tris borate-EDTA (Figs. 1, E and F, 2C, 5, and 6 and supplemental Figs. S1–S4) or Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose gel (Figs. 1, A and B, and 3). Equivalent results were obtained, with Tris acetate-EDTA providing a slightly better separation of species on the 207-bp DNA. The distribution of species was also analyzed by native PAGE using 5.5% (29:1) acrylamide-bisacrylamide gels, which allowed a separation of complexes at different positions on the DNA. Gels were run at approx. 5 V/cm in 0.3× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C for 12 h. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide (EtBr) fluorescence after staining or by recording the Alexa 488 signal of the histone label. Quantification was conducted using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For the evaluation of the EtBr signal the amount of free DNA in equilibrium at the end of the time course (typically 10–15%) was determined and used to calculate the amount of histone-DNA complexes from the fraction of bound DNA. The resulting values were used to derive the amount of the different histone-DNA species at the other time points. The time lag in the EMSA experiments between loading the samples on the gel and the stop point of the ongoing assembly reaction was determined to be 200 s. This value was derived from a comparison with the fluorescence anisotropy data as well as from using it as a free parameter when fitting the gel data to the models given in Equations 1.1a, 1.1b, 1.2a, 1.2b, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2. Least-squares fitting of kinetic rate constants was performed with the software package GEPASI, which automatically derives differential equations for a given model (61Mendes P. Comput. Appl.

Kinetic parameters from the quantitative analysis are given in Table 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were conducted on a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Histone/NAP1 samples with Alexa-labeled H4f or H2Af in assembly buffer were excited at 496 nm, and emission was monitored at 513 nm. H4f was used for tetrasome assembly and H2Af for nucleosome assembly. Anisotropy data acquisition and analysis were conducted essentially as described previously (62Vogel S.K. Schulz A. Rippe K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4094-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly reaction was started by the addition of DNA207 or DNA146 to a final concentration of 100 nm duplex. Upon transfer of histones from NAP1 to the DNA, the total fluorescence intensity increased, as given by the quenching factor, q. The fraction of histone H2Af or H4f bound to DNA at equilibrium, θeq, was determined in the EMSA experiments from the amount of free DNA and assigned to the fraction of H2A or H4 bound to DNA when the anisotropy signal reached a plateau. The fraction of DNA-bound histone θ in dependence of assembly time t was calculated according to θ(t) = (r – rNAP1-H)/[(r – rNAP1-H) + q · (rDNA-H – r)], where r is the measured anisotropy, rNAP1-H the anisotropy of the NAP1-histone complex, and rDNA-H the anisotropy of the DNA-histone complex (63Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 1999; (Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York): 308-309Google Scholar). From the analysis of the data the following values were obtained: (i) octamer formation with DNA146: θeq = 0.63, q = 1.25, rNAP1-H = 0.145 (NAP1-H2Af complex), rDNA-H (DNA-H2Af complex) = 0.098; (ii) octamer formation with DNA207: θeq = 0.72, q = 1.48, rNAP1-H = 0.152 (NAP1-H2Af complex), rDNA-H = 0.086 (DNA-H2Af complex); (iii) tetrasome formation with DNA207: θeq = 0.33, q = 1.22, rNAP1-H = 0.188 (NAP1-H4f complex), rDNA-H = 0.139 (DNA-H4f complex). NAP1-mediated Mononucleosome Assembly Proceeds via a Hexasome Intermediate—To investigate the kinetics of nucleosome assembly by histone chaperone NAP1, products and intermediates of the reaction were analyzed on agarose gels (Fig. 1). For this purpose NAP1 and the histone octamer were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio of one histone per NAP1 monomer, which was determined previously as the optimal ratio for complex formation (35McBryant S.J.

Fractions of this premix were then allowed to react for the indicated times with the 207-bp (DNA207) or 146-bp (DNA146) rDNA fragment, in an equimolar ratio between histone octamers and DNA, and analyzed on agarose gels (Fig. 1). Products were detected via staining of the DNA with EtBr (Fig. 1, A and E) or by recording the fluorescence of Alexa 488-maleimide-labeled H2A (H2Af) of the same gel (Fig. 1, B and F). With the Alexa 488 signal three bands were identified, which represent the slow moving NAP12-(H2Af·H2B) complex (36Fejes Tóth K.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Rippe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15690-15699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Kepert J.F. Mazurkiewicz J. Heuvelman G.L. Fejes Toth K. Rippe K. J. Biol.

With EtBr staining of the gels (Fig. 1, A and E) the “complete” nucleosome band was identified from a comparison of the migration behavior with salt-reconstituted nucleosomes (see also Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1A). The second species running below the nucleosome was assigned to a hexasome, e.g. a subnucleosomal particle, in which only one H2A·H2B dimer is present. Per definition such a complex displays a 50% decreased ratio between histone H2Af fluorescence and EtBr staining compared with the complete nucleosome. In agreement with this expectation, quantification of the Alexa 488 to EtBr signal showed a ratio of 1.8 ± 0.3 for the normalized H2Af fluorescence intensity of the nucleosome band to that of the hexasome (Fig. 1, C and G). The formation of hexasome and nucleosome particles on both DNAs was quantified by averaging the results from numerous gels. Compared with the DNA207 template the abundance of hexasomes increased significantly with DNA146 (Fig. 1, D and H), and in equilibrium the hexasome band was about twice as prominent as the nucleosomal band. With both DNAs a significant fraction of H2A·H2B remained bound to NAP1, as not all hexasomes maturated to full nucleosomes in equilibrium. However, if more NAP12-(H2A·H2B) complexes or free H2A·H2B were added, all subnucleosomal particles converted into nucleosomes (data not"
https://openalex.org/W2081252777,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein exerts most of its anti-tumorigenic activity by transcriptionally activating several pro-apoptotic genes. Accumulating evidence also suggests a transcription-independent function of p53 during apoptosis. It has recently been shown that, when activated, a fraction of p53 translocates to mitochondria, causing cytochrome c release. We now demonstrate a caspase-dependent cleavage of p53 resulting in the generation of four fragments, two of which lack a nuclear localization signal and consequently localize to cytosol. Moreover, these two fragments translocate to mitochondria and induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization in the absence of transcriptional activity. This novel feature of p53 supports the model whereby cytosolic p53 exerts major functions in apoptosis and also suggests the presence of a positive feedback loop in which activated caspases cleave p53 to augment mitochondrial membrane depolarization."
https://openalex.org/W2005539763,"The copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is an intracellular metallochaperone required for incorporation of copper into the essential antioxidant enzyme copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Nutritional studies have revealed that the abundance of CCS is inversely proportional to the dietary and tissue copper content. To determine the mechanisms of copper-dependent regulation of CCS, copper incorporation into SOD1 and SOD1 enzymatic activity as well as CCS abundance and half-life were determined after metabolic labeling of CCS-/- fibroblasts transfected with wild-type or mutant CCS. Wild-type CCS restored SOD1 activity in CCS-/- fibroblasts, and the abundance of this chaperone in these cells was inversely proportional to the copper content of the media, indicating that copper-dependent regulation of CCS is entirely post-translational. Although mutational studies demonstrated no role for CCS Domain I in this copper-dependent regulation, similar analysis of the CXC motif in Domain III revealed a critical role for these cysteine residues in mediating copper-dependent turnover of CCS. Further mutational studies revealed that this CXC-dependent copper-mediated turnover of CCS is independent of the mechanisms of delivery of copper to SOD1 including CCS-SOD1 interaction. Taken together these data demonstrate a mechanism determining the abundance of CCS that is competitive with the process of copper delivery to SOD1, revealing a unique post-translational component of intracellular copper homeostasis.

Copper is an essential nutrient functioning in facile electron transfer reactions critical for cellular respiration, iron oxidation, pigment formation, connective tissue biogenesis, peptide amidation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and antioxidant defense (1Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1579S-1580SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). This essential role of copper as well as the potential toxicity of this metal is revealed by the inherited disorders of copper metabolism, Menkes disease, and Wilson disease (2Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These diseases result from loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding homologous copper-transporting P-type ATPases that reside in the secretory pathway mediating copper incorporation into nascent cuproproteins and copper efflux from the cell (3Luk E.

Copper-dependent trafficking of these ATPases provides a rapid, post-translational mechanism for the response of the cell to changes in copper content and is critical for intracellular copper homeostasis (5Tao T.Y. Gitlin J.D. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under physiologic circumstances, the availability of intracellular copper is extraordinarily restricted due to the presence of excess chelating capacity (6Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Thus, the delivery of copper to specific pathways within the cell is mediated by metallochaperones that function to provide copper directly to target proteins while protecting this metal from intracellular scavengers (7O'Halloran T.V.

Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) 2The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MEF; mouse embryonic fibroblast; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonic acid; CCS, copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase. is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic enzyme that requires a single bound copper ion to catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide critical to the antioxidant defenses of all cells (11Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The delivery and incorporation of copper into SOD1 in mammals and yeast is mediated by the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) via direct protein-protein interaction that involves a CCS-SOD1 heterodimeric intermediate (12Culotta V.C.

Despite this detailed understanding of the mechanisms of copper trafficking and delivery within cells, virtually nothing is known about the homeostatic mechanisms that determine the hierarchy of copper acquisition by specific chaperones. After cellular uptake of copper by the plasma membrane transporter Ctr1, copper is presumably distributed to specific sites dependent upon intracellular requirements as determined by metabolic and enzymatic needs (15Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Recent nutritional studies have demonstrated that the intracellular abundance of CCS is dependent upon the availability of dietary copper, suggesting a more direct link between copper availability and homeostasis (16Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Prohaska J.R. Broderius M. Brokate B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In support of this concept, recent in vitro studies by L'Abbe and Bertinato (18Bertinato J. L'Abbe M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35071-35078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) now directly demonstrate copper-dependent regulation of CCS abundance in rodent and human liver cell lines. In this study we have utilized the availability of cells derived from CCS-/- mouse embryos to directly examine the mechanisms of this process. Materials—General chemicals and reagents were purchased through Sigma. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Hybridization membranes and immunoblot blot reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Protein A beads were purchased from Repligen. Polyclonal rabbit antisera to human CCS were prepared and used for immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation as previously described (13Casareno R.L. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antisera to human actin was purchased from Sigma, and murine monoclonal antisera to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was purchased from BD Biosciences. [35S]Methionine/[35S]cysteine Translabel and [35S]cysteine were purchased from MP Biomedicals Inc. 64Cu (700 Ci/mmol) was obtained by fast neutron bombardment of an enriched zinc target and used previously described (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cloning and Mutagenesis—A full-length cDNA encoding wild-type human CCS (12Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) was cloned into the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech). The coding region corresponding to amino acids 86-274 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP as previously described (13Casareno R.L. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Site-directed nucleotide mutagenesis was performed in pIRES2-EGFP containing the entire human CCS open reading frame using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), 5′ sense and 3′ antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the mutations C22S,C25S, C244S,C246S, and Y134E,G135E. In all cases, the presence of specific mutations and fidelity of the entire cDNA sequence were verified by automated fluorescent sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—Immortalized Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from E7 embryos and cultured as previously described (20Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CCS-/- and SOD1-/- mice were obtained utilizing transgenic methodology as previously described (21Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 22Ho Y.S. Gargano M. Cao J. Bronson R.T. Heimler I. Hutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). CCS+/+ and CCS-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from E12.5 embryos were isolated and cultured in basal media. After the first passage MEFs were genotyped by PCR analysis as described. Freshly isolated MEFs from SOD+/+ and SOD-/- E12.5 embryos were isolated, allowed to adhere to tissue culture plates for 4 h, and then used immediately for metabolic experiments. CCS-/- cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 7 × 105 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μg of specified plasmid as outlined in the manufacturer's specifications. In some experiments, after transfection cells were pooled and split into medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal bovine serum and either 200 μm bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS) or 150 μm CuCl2 for the subsequent 48 h. In all experiments the effectiveness of the treatment of cells with BCS and copper was confirmed by assaying SOD1 activity, previously shown to change with these agents, and by direct measurement of the intracellular copper content after treatment. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For copper labeling cells were incubated in Opti-MEM media containing 200 μCi/ml 64Cu for 2 h followed by collection of media and lysate as described previously (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Samples were then prepared in Laemmli buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and gels were exposed directly to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). To determine the half-life of CCS in MEFs from SOD+/+ and SOD-/- mice, cells were initially incubated in cysteine methionine-deficient medium and subsequently pulsed for 1 h in this medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples were then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Signal intensity was determined using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software (Systat). These experiments were replicated twice, and in all cases one embryo was used per cell culture for metabolic labeling, and at least three separate embryos from individual genotypes were used in each experiment to derive the half-life data. The half-life of wild type and mutant CCS in transfected CCS-/- MEFs was determined 60 h post-transfection with 48 h of treatment of 200 μm BCS or 150 μm CuCl2 as indicated in 1% fetal bovine serum media. Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine Translabel confirmed the absence of new CCS protein synthesis at this starting time point by immunoprecipitation analysis. In some experiments, 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) was added to the cell media at the beginning of the time period and maintained throughout all time points. Time points were then collected relative to the initial harvested sample, lysed, and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described below. Signal intensity was quantified using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 software and normalized to the 0-h time point. Data were graphed using Sigma Plot 8.0 (Systat). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed at 4 °C with an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system and a Superose 12 column. (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS. SOD1+/+ and SOD1-/- livers were isolated and homogenized as previously described (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A total of 5 mg of liver lysates were applied to the column and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline in 0.5-ml fractions at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Immunoblot Analysis and SOD1 Activity Gels—Cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EDTA supplemented with Protease Inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentration for all samples was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For specified experiments lysates were heated at 100 °C for 7 min and subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblot analysis was carried out using the Super-Signal West Pico kit (Pierce) with goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Blots were then stripped in Restore buffer (Pierce) and analyzed in a similar fashion for actin at 1:5000 and GFP at 1:500. In all experiments for the determination of CCS abundance, differences in transfection efficiency and gel-loading were accounted for by quantification of GFP and actin expression, respectively, and then normalized accordingly. Fold difference was calculated by the normalized CCS signal intensities of BCS-treated samples divided by the copper-treated samples. One way analysis of variance statistical analysis using Dunnett's method was used to determine statistical significance in -fold difference when compared with CCS+/+ cells. SOD activity gels were performed by electrophoresing lysates under non-denaturing, non-reducing conditions and then processing for SOD activity as previously described (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of intracellular copper content on CCS abundance, the steady state amount of this chaperone was determined by immunoblot analysis of embryonic fibroblasts derived from genetically altered mice. This analysis revealed a single 29-kDa band present in the lysate of CCS+/+ cells that is absent in CCS-/- lysates, confirming the specificity of the CCS antibody used in these studies (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). The steady state abundance of CCS in Ctr1-/- cell lysates was markedly increased when compared with Ctr1+/+ cells (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). These differences in CCS signal intensity were not due to differences in protein concentration or gel loading as immunoblot analysis of actin showed equivalent intensities for all four cell lysates (Fig. 1A, lower panel). To confirm that the change in CCS abundance between Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- cells is due to the known differences in intracellular copper content between these cells (20Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- cells were treated for 48 h with either 150 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS, and then lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. In this circumstance chelation of copper with BCS increased the abundance of CCS in Ctr1+/+ cells, eliminating the difference in CCS abundance seen previously between Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 2 versus 4). The addition of excess copper decreased the steady state level of CCS in both cell types (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 3) consistent with the reported ability of Ctr1-/- cells to accumulate copper by Ctr1-independent mechanisms under circumstances of excess copper provision (20Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). When signal intensities for CCS in Ctr1+/+ and Ctr1-/- lysates were quantified, they were found to have similar -fold differences between copper and BCS treatments (Table 1) that were not statistically different from endogenously expressing CCS+/+ cells. Although these studies provide strong evidence for a Ctr1-independent mechanism of copper-dependent CCS regulation, elucidation of the precise mechanisms of Ctr1 copper delivery to CCS may provide further insight into this process. These differences in CCS abundance were not due to differences in protein concentration or gel loading as determined by actin immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B, lower panel).TABLE 1Quantification of signal intesity from immunoblot analysis (SigmaScan Pro 5.0) for CCS shown as the average-fold difference (BCS/copper) with S.D. and number of replicates-Fold differenceReplicatesCtrl+/+3.0 ± 0.2n = 3Ctrl–/–2.3 ± 1.4n = 3CCS+/+3.5 ± 1.3n = 5WT2.8 ± 0.9n = 11Δ1–863.5 ± 1.5n = 3C244S,C246S1.0 ± 0.2n = 8Y134E,G135E2.2 ± 0.9n = 4 Open table in a new tab The above findings demonstrate that genetic differences in cellular copper uptake are sufficient to alter intracellular CCS abundance and are consistent with recent observations examining the effect of copper on CCS abundance in liver cell lines (18Bertinato J. L'Abbe M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35071-35078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism of this process, SOD1 activity and copper incorporation into SOD1 was assessed in CCS-/- fibroblasts transiently transfected with CCS cDNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of wild-type CCS into CCS-/- cells restored SOD1 activity to that observed in endogenously expressing CCS+/+ cells. This restoration of SOD1 activity was the direct result of CCS function, as metabolic labeling of these cells with 64Cu revealed restoration of copper incorporation into SOD1 in transfected CCS-/- cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lanes 2 versus 3). As observed previously (21Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), in all cases this 64Cu-labeled band corresponded to SOD1 by subsequent immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Fig. 2A, lane 2 (upper panel) reveals a minimal amount of SOD1 activity in the CCS-/- lysate, consistent with what has been observed previously (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although it remains possible that this residual activity may in part be due to the CCS-independent pathway documented recently by Culotta and coworkers (24Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we speculate that this is more likely due to in vitro reconstitution of SOD1 activity, as there is a complete absence of any detectable incorporation of 64Cu into SOD1 in vivo (Fig. 2A, lane 2, lower panel). The metabolic labeling of cells for the detection of copper incorporation into SOD1 is a sensitive assay for CCS chaperone function (19Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and is, therefore, also used throughout this current study. These studies demonstrate that transfected wild-type CCS functions to deliver copper and restore SOD1 activity in CCS-/- cells. To determine whether the transfected wild-type CCS is subject to the same copper-dependent regulation observed above in endogenously expressing cells, transfected CCS-/- cells were treated for 48 h post-transfection with either 150 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS followed by immunoblot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, when transfected into CCS-/- cells, the abundance of wild-type CCS is similarly altered by intracellular copper content, being decreased in the copper-treated when compared with the copper-chelated samples (lanes 3 and 4). Because the plasmid used in these experiments is bicistronic and also expresses GFP, in all such experiments transfection efficiency was accounted for by quantification of GFP signal intensity (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Differences in protein concentration and gel-loading were determined by immunoblotting for actin (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). The results shown are representative of 11 independent experiments, and in all cases the copper-treated cells had significantly less wild-type CCS at steady state when compared with BCS treatment (Table 1). The above data indicate that wild-type CCS transfected into CCS-/- fibroblasts is subject to the identical copper-dependent regulation observed in endogenous cells, providing an experimental system to examine the role of CCS in this process. Because the transfected plasmid contains only the open-reading frame of CCS, these findings also support the concept that this copper-dependent regulation is mediated by a process of post-translational protein turnover (18Bertinato J. L'Abbe M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35071-35078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the structure of human CCS consists of three unique domains that serve specific functions in the process of copper delivery to SOD1. Domain I includes the copper binding motif, MTCQSC, thought to be critical for copper acquisition under the physiologically copper limiting conditions of the cell (25Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Domain I in the copper-dependent turnover of CCS, a Domain I deletion mutant Δ1-86 CCS was created and transfected into CCS-/- cells. Consistent with a role for this domain in CCS copper acquisition in mammalian cells, transfected cells were deficient in SOD1 activity when compared with cells transfected with wild-type CCS (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). This loss of SOD1 activity was the result of impaired copper delivery by CCS, as CCS-/- cells transfected with Δ1-86 CCS lacked 64Cu-labeled SOD1 when compared with cells transfected with wild-type CCS or endogenously expressing CCS+/+ cells (Fig. 3B, middle panel, lanes 4 versus 1 and 3). The absence of SOD1 activity was not due to lack of Δ1-86 CCS expression as immunoblot analysis revealed that the abundance of this protein was equivalent to that observed in cells transfected with wild-type CCS (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). As anticipated from previous studies in yeast (25Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), this loss of function of Δ1-86 CCS was due to impaired copper binding as a C22S,C25S CCS mutant as altering the cysteines in the MTCQSC motif also failed to restore SOD1 activity in transfected CCS-/- cells (data not shown). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the role of CCS Domain I in copper acquisition can be bypassed with increased exogenous copper in the media (25Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The experimental system shown here allowed this same concept to be tested in mammalian cells, and therefore, SOD1 activity was examined in CCS-/- cells transfected with wild-type or Δ1-86 CCS and treated for 48 h with either 150 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS. Δ1-86 CCS and CCS-/- lysates showed no observable SOD1 activity in both untreated and BCS-treated samples (Fig. 3C, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). Although SOD1 activity was detected in the cells transfected with Δ1-86 CCS and treated with excess copper (Fig. 3C, lane 1), this SOD1 activity is independent of CCS function as similar SOD1 activity was observed in the untransfected CCS-/- cells exposed to excess copper (Fig. 3C, lane 4). This observation is consistent with prior observations in CCS-/- mice and recent studies by Culotta that demonstrate a CCS-independent pathway for copper incorporation into SOD1 (24Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B. Ulloa J.L. Subramaniam J.R. Wong P.C. Valentine J.S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5964-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although the data in Fig. 3C reveal that in contrast to yeast CCS, Domain I of human CCS is required for CCS-dependent copper incorporation into SOD1 in mammalian cells, Domain I plays no role in the copper-dependent regulation of CCS abundance as immunoblot analysis of Δ1-86 and wild-type CCS transfected into CCS-/- cells and treated for 48 h with either 150 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS revealed identical responses to copper conditions (Fig. 3D). Consistent with this immunoblot, quantitation of the results of multiple such experiments revealed an average -fold difference with the Δ1-86 CCS similar to that observed with wild type (Table 1). Domain III of CCS is required for the insertion of copper into SOD1, and this is mediated by a CXC motif that binds copper and participates in the disulfide isomerase activity essential for metallation (26Schmidt P.J. Kunst C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Brown N.M. Torres A.S. Doan P.E. O'Halloran T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Because Domain III is also required for interaction with SOD1, the function of this domain in the copper-dependent regulation of CCS abundance was examined by generating a C244S,C246S CCS mutant that was then transfected into CCS-/- cells. Consistent with previous findings in yeast, CCS-/- cells expressing C244S,C246S CCS showed no detectable levels of SOD1 activity above that seen in CCS-/- cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel), and this was due to the lack of incorporation of copper into SOD1 (Fig. 4A, middle panel). As for the previous experiments, the abundance of mutant and wild-type CCS was comparable by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to the findings with Δ1-86 CCS, when CCS-/- cells expressing C244S,C246S CCS were treated for 48 h with either 150 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS, no apparent difference in t"

This undecapeptide enhances proliferation of neuronal precursor cells in a SorLA-dependent manner. Using specific inhibitors we found previously that head activator activates shedding of SorLA by the metalloprotease TACE close to the transmembrane domain releasing the large extra-cellular part of the receptor. Here we show that the remaining COOH-terminal membrane fragment of SorLA is processed by γ-secretase. Inhibition of γ-secretase by specific inhibitors or overexpression of dominant negative presenilin mutants and knock out of the presenilin genes led to accumulation of the SorLA membrane fragment and also of full-length SorLA in the membrane. In an in vitro assay we observed the γ-secretase-dependent release of the two soluble cleavage products, the SorLA cytoplasmic domain and the SorLA β-peptide. These processing steps are reminiscent of a novel signaling pathway that has been described for the notch receptor. Here, the notch cytoplasmic domain is released into the cytoplasm by the γ-secretase and migrates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional regulator. In parallel we found that a fusion protein of the released cytoplasmic tail of SorLA with EGFP located to the nucleus only if the nuclear localization signal of SorLA was intact. In a reporter gene assay the cytoplasmic domain of SorLA acted as a transcriptional activator indicating that SorLA might directly regulate transcription after activation by γ-secretase.

Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2004; 1: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In recent years, γ-secretase substrates in addition to APP were discovered (3Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). All of them are single spanning type I transmembrane proteins. Usually, γ-secretase does not proteolyse the full-length proteins, but so-called COOH-terminal fragments (CTFs). These CTFs are produced from the full-length proteins in a process called “ectodomain shedding,” in which another protease, often a metalloprotease, cleaves the precursor proteins close to the outer face of the transmembrane region. In the case of the notch protein, this “regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP, for comparison see Fig. 8)” is part of a signal transduction cascade (4Medina M. Dotti C.G. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 829-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After a preceding activation by the Golgi-localized protease furin, the notch receptor can bind its ligand. The ligand-bound receptor is subsequently a substrate for a metalloprotease, which sheds the notch ectodomain. The remaining CTF is cleaved by γ-secretase into a β-peptide at the outer face of the membrane and the notch intracellular domain. The notch intracellular domain migrates into the nucleus and, after binding to transcription factors, it regulates the transcription of target genes (5Selkoe D. Kopan R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 565-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Such a signaling cascade was proposed for other γ-secretase substrates, such as APP, ErbB-4, CD44, LRP1, and the β2 sodium channel subunit (6Lammich S. Okochi M. Takeda M. Kaether C. Capell A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23251-23261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For CD44 a signaling cascade similar to that of notch indeed seems to exist (10Nagano O. Saya H. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the other cases either the ligand is unknown (APP, β2), the ICD could not be shown to enter the nucleus (LRP1), or transcriptional activation has not been observed (ErbB-4). Therefore it was proposed that the function of the γ-secretase complex for most of its substrates lies in the degradation of membrane spanning segments and only in some instances in signal transduction (3Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). SorLA, also called LR11, is a type I transmembrane receptor with a 56-amino acid-long cytoplasmic COOH-terminal tail strongly expressed in neurons (11Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. Lund A.H.

Its large extracellular part is composed of a VPS10 domain followed by repeats as found in the family of lipoprotein receptors and fibronectin type III domains. The best characterized human protein with a VPS10 domain is sortilin (14Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), which binds the neuropeptide neurotensin (15Mazella J. Zsurger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M.

Sortilin can form heterodimers with the G-protein-coupled neurotensin receptors (16Martin S. Navarro V. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1135-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition it also initiates a neurotensin signaling cascade in cells lacking other neurotensin receptors by activation of Erk/Akt kinases (17Dicou E. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 78: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The first neuropeptide ligand identified for SorLA was the head activator. Head activator is involved in head regeneration of coelenterates (18Hampe W. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Schaller H.C. Richter D. Regulatory Peptides and Cognate Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 323-337Google Scholar) and binds to the hydra orthologue of SorLA with nanomolar affinity (19Franke I. Buck F. Hampe W. Eur. J.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, head activator mediates entry into mitosis and proliferation of neuronal and neuroendocrine precursor cells after binding to the VPS10 domain of SorLA (22Lintzel J. Riedel I.B. Franke I. Schaller H.C. Hampe W. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Other ligands of SorLA include lipoproteins (12Yamazaki H. Bujo H. Kusunoki J. Seimiya K. Kanaki T. Morisaki N. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24761-24768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), PDGF-BB (23Gliemann J. Hermey G. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Jacobsen C. Andreasen P.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and GDNF (24Westergaard U.B. Sorensen E.S. Hermey G. Nielsen M.S. Nykjaer A.

In accordance with the multiple ligands, SorLA also seems to be involved in several functions including protein sorting (25Jacobsen L. Madsen P. Nielsen M.S. Geraerts W.P. Gliemann J. Smit A.B. Petersen C.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), lipoprotein uptake (26Taira K. Bujo H. Hirayama S. Yamazaki H. Kanaki T. Takahashi K. Ishii I. Miida T.

Kanaki T. Shibasaki M. Takahashi K. Schneider W.J. Saito Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but so far no signaling cascade has been identified. Recently, SorLA was identified to be involved in trafficking APP in neuronal cells. The presence of SorLA seems to inhibit the production of the amyloid Aβ-peptide. Therefore, SorLA might play an important role in the development of Alzheimer disease (28Andersen O.M. Reiche J. Schmidt V. Gotthardt M. Spoelgen R. Behlke J. von Arnim C.A. Breiderhoff T. Jansen P. Wu X. Bales K.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Gliemann J. Mufson E.J. Hyman B.T. Paul S.M. Nykjaer A. Willnow T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurol. 2004; 61: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). SorLA is proteolytically processed in several steps. After removal of the signal peptide, a propeptide is cleaved off in the Golgi apparatus by furin (32Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a second step the large ectodomain of SorLA can be released by the metalloprotease TACE (32Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Guo L. Eisenman J.R. Mahimkar R.M. Peschon J.J. Paxton R.J. Black R.A. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 30-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This shedding seems to be constitutive at a low level, but is stimulated by phorbol esters and by the neuropeptide head activator (32Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the released ectodomain is of the same apparent molecular mass as the transmembrane precursor, the metalloprotease cleavage site has to be close to the transmembrane domain. These processing steps are reminiscent of the above mentioned notch signaling cascade. Therefore we analyzed whether SorLA is, like notch, a substrate for the γ-secretase. Here we provide evidence that the SorLA-CTF is cleaved in a presenilin-dependent manner into a β-peptide and the SorLA intracellular domain (SorICD). Dependent on a nuclear localization signal the SorICD can migrate into the nucleus where it might regulate the transcription of target genes. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with APP695 containing the Swedish mutation (swAPP) (34Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar) and either presenilin 1 wild-type (wt) or presenilin 1 D358N (35Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml zeocin to select for presenilin 1 expression, and 200 μg/ml G418 to select for swAPP expression. In addition, these cell lines were stably transfected with a construct expressing full-length SorLA or SorLA-CTF*-myc (Fig. 1). After hygromycin B selection (200 μg/ml) SorLA expression was analyzed by Western blotting. For most experiments cell lines generated from single cells were used. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from presenilin 1+/+/presenilin 2+/+ or presenilin 1–/–/presenilin 2–/– mice (36Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K.

A. 1999; 96: 11872-11877Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2 (Ntera2/D1) (37Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) was cultured in optimized modified Eagle's medium (Opti-MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. African green monkey kidney fibroblasts (COS-7) were cultured and transfected by electroporation as described (38Boels K. Glassmeier G. Herrmann D. Riedel I.B. Hampe W. Kojima I. Schwarz J.R. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3599-3606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) for HEK-293 cells or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for mouse embryonic fibroblasts according to the supplier's instructions. For γ-secretase inhibition cells were treated for 15 h with DAPT (N-[N-(3,5 difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) or L685,458 (both from Calbiochem) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or, as control, with dimethyl sulfoxide alone. cDNA Constructs and Protein Expression—The full-length SorLA cDNA (22Lintzel J. Riedel I.B. Franke I. Schaller H.C. Hampe W. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1727-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen, Fig. 1). The SorLA-CTF* construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers L5-StubSorLA (5′-GGAAGCTTAACCAGATCTGTGGGGAGCCT-3′) and L3-SorLAStop(–) (5′-GGCTCGAGGGCTATCACCATGGGGACGTC-3′) and the full-length SorLA cDNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into pSecTag B (Invitrogen). The resulting construct SorLA-CTF*-myc (Fig. 1) encoding an NH2-terminal signal peptide and a COOH-terminal myc/His-tag was transfered into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+). FLAG-SorLA-CTF*-myc was generated by inserting the annealed primers 5FLAG (5′-TGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCAGC-3′) and 3FLAG (5′-GCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCAGCT-3′) into the SfiI site of SorLA-CTF*-myc. For the EGFP constructs SorICD was amplified by PCR with the primers 5SICD (5′-GGAAGCTTCTACACGAAGCACCGGAGGCTG-3′) and 3SICD (5′-GGGGATCCTCAGGCTATCACCATGGGGAC-3′) from pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+)-SorLA and cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). pEGFP-MutSorICD was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of pEGFP-SorICD with the primers fNLS-Mut (5′-CTTCTACACGAAGCACGCCGCGCTGCAGAGCAGCTTCAC-3′) and rNLS-Mut (5′-GTGAAGCTGCTCTGCAGCGCGGCGTGCTTCGTGTAGAAG-3′). The pBind-SorICD construct expressing SorICD fused to the NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain of Gal4 was synthesized by cloning the SorICD fragment from pEGFP-SorICD into the pBind vector (Promega). All cDNA constructs have been verified by sequencing. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed using STEN-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoblotting was performed as described (21Hampe W. Urny J. Franke I. Hoffmeister-Ullerich S.A.H. Herrmann D. Petersen C.M. Lohmann J. Schaller H.C. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4077-4086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a polyclonal antiserum (anti-SorICD, 1:3000) directed against a COOH-terminal peptide of the intracellular domain of SorLA (32Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibodies against the myc- and the FLAG-M2-epitope (Sigma). Detection was performed by peroxidase-based chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Dura Extended, Pierce). In Vitro Generation of SorICD—HEK-293 cells stably transfected with SorLA-CTF*-myc were resuspended (0.5 ml/10-cm dish) in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mix (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science)) and homogenized by passing them 10 times through a syringe (23-gauge). The post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 40 min and resuspended (50 μl/10 cm dish) in assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, protease inhibitor mix). For the generation of SorICD, 25-μl membrane aliquots were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Soluble proteins were separated from the membranes by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy—24 h after transient transfection with EGFP-SorICD, EGFP-MutSorICD, or EGFP, COS-7 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Microscopy was performed using a LSM 510 Meta instrument (Zeiss), which allows the quantification of fluorescence intensity in selected areas. To account for the different absolute fluorescence of the cells, the ratio of nuclear over cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity was calculated. The ratio of 40 cells for each construct was determined and the constructs compared by a paired two-sided Student's t test. Luciferase Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with equal DNA amounts of the pG5Luc luciferase reporter (Promega), pBIND (Promega), or pBIND-SorICD. As positive control cells were transfected with pG5Luc, pACT-MyoD (Promega), and pBind-Id (Promega). 48 h later cells were tested for luciferase expression with BrightGlo (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. All values were calculated over pBIND activation. Data represent the average of duplicate wells in five independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation—SorLA-CTF* was precipitated from solubilized cell membranes using anti-SorICD as described (32Hampe W. Riedel I.B. Lintzel J. Bader C.O. Franke I. Schaller H.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4475-4485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sorβ was precipitated from the conditioned medium of HEK-293 cells 24 h after transient transfection with the FLAG-SorLA-CTF*-myc construct using anti-FLAG-M2-agarose for 3 h at 4° C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and analyzed for Sorβ by immunoblotting with the FLAG-M2 antibody. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) as primer and the polymerase Moloney murine leukemia virus (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. 2 μg of cDNA were used for the amplification of SorLA-specific cDNA in a quantitative real-time PCR in a LightCycler system (Roche Applied Science) with the primers L5-StubSorLA and L3-SorLAStop(–) using the LC-DNA Master-SYBR-Green Kit (Roche Applied Science). In parallel all samples were subjected to a quantitative PCR to amplify glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with the primers AS03 (GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT) and AS04 (TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG). The integrity of the amplified DNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were run in triplicates; all runs included a negative control. PCR efficiency of each value was taken into account using the freeware program LinRegPCR (39Ramakers C. Ruijter J.M. Deprez R.H. Moorman A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 339: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2824) Google Scholar). Target gene values were normalized to their corresponding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase values. Degradation of SorICD—SorICD was generated in the in vitro assay as described above in the absence of protease inhibitors in a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Cytosol was prepared from NT2 cells by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. To test the stability of the SorICD, 5 μl of NT2 cytosol were added to 20 μl of the SorICD sample and incubated for 2 h at 37° C in the absence or presence of insulin, EDTA, or bovine serum albumin in the indicated amounts. The undegraded SorICD was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SorICD. Presenilin-dependent Release of SorICD—To find out whether SorLA is a substrate for presenilin-dependent proteolytic processing, we expressed a short membrane-anchored form of SorLA (SorLA-CTF*), which resembles the putative γ-secretase substrate after ectodomain shedding (SorLA-CTF). To investigate the influence of the γ-secretase, we stably expressed SorLA-CTF*-myc (Fig. 1) in HEK-293 cells producing presenilin 1 wt or the dominant negative presenilin 1 mutant D385N (40Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Using Western blots with antibodies directed against SorICD or the attached myc-tag we identified the SorLA-CTF*-myc as an ∼20-kDa protein in HEK-293 cells stably expressing wt presenilin 1 (Fig. 2A). Incubation with the specific γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (41Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L.

Johnstone E.M. Li W.Y. Little S.P. Mabry T.E. Miller F.D. Audia J.E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) led to accumulation of SorLA-CTF*-myc (Fig. 2A). This accumulation is even more pronounced in cells stably expressing the dominant negative presenilin 1 mutant D385N (Fig. 2B). To exclude side effects of the γ-secretase inhibitor or the presenilin 1 mutant D385N on the expression of SorLA-CTF*-myc we verified the results with immortalized mouse embryonic fibrobasts from wt and double knock-out mice for presenilin 1 and 2. As in cells expressing the dominant negative presenilin 1 mutant, SorLA-CTF*-myc was enriched in the fibroblasts from the knock-out mice (Fig. 2C). One product of the γ-secretase intramembrane proteolysis should be the released intracellular domain of SorLA (SorICD). The cytoplasmic domain of SorLA consists of 56 amino acid residues. Together with some residues of the transmembrane domain and the attached tags (Fig. 1) we estimated the molecular mass of SorICD to be about 9 kDa. In Western blots of cell lysates the SorICD was usually missing. Nevertheless, in some experiments an immunoreactive fragment of ∼13 kDa was detected in the cell lysate of HEK-293 cells overexpressing the SorLA-CTF*-myc. Upon incubation with DAPT this band vanished (Fig. 2A). For a more reliable analysis we adapted an in vitro assay developed for the detection of the intracellular domain of APP (42Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The idea of the assay is to remove cellular proteases by a membrane preparation prior to the in vitro generation of the otherwise unstable SorICD. Incubation of membranes prepared from HEK-293 cells stably expressing SorLA-CTF*-myc led to a soluble SorICD fragment of ∼13 kDa (Fig. 3). This fragment has the same apparent molecular mass as the SorICD detected in cell lysates (Fig. 2A) and could be visualized with antisera directed against the SorICD itself or against the attached myc-tag. Upon reduction of the temperature to inhibit proteases the fragment was absent. A similar inhibition was observed in the presence of the specific γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT and L685,458 (Fig. 3). Metalloprotease inhibitors like EDTA and proteasome inhibitors like lactacystin did not interfere with the SorICD production (data not shown). The molecular mass of 9 kDa calculated for the myc/His-tagged SorICD is smaller than the observed apparent molecular weight of 13 kDa. This might be due to a reduced electrophoretic movement as observed for other proteins with highly charged tags or to phosphorylation of the intracellular domain. Taken together, these data indicate that SorLA is a novel γ-secretase substrate. Secretion of the Sorβ-peptide—Processing of βAPP through γ-secretase results in the production of the cytoplasmic APP intracellular domain and the secreted Aβ-peptide. To analyze the production of the equivalent Sorβ-peptide, we transiently transfected HEK-293 cells expressing wt or dominant negative presenilin with an NH2-terminally FLAG-tagged and a COOH-terminally myc/His-tagged SorLA-CTF* (FLAG-SorLA-CTF*-myc, Fig. 1). Similar to SorLA-CTF*-myc, the FLAG-tagged CTF* accumulated in cells expressing the dominant negative presenilin 1 mutant demonstrating that also FLAG-SorLA-CTF*-myc is a substrate for the γ-secretase (Fig. 4). We then precipitated soluble secreted FLAG-tagged proteins from conditioned medium of transfected HEK-293 cells with anti-FLAG-agarose. In a Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody we identified the FLAG-tagged Sorβ with a molecular mass of ∼7 kDa in the precipitate (Fig. 4). Cells expressing the dominant negative presenilin 1 mutant did not produce Sorβ. Accumulation of Full-length SorLA after γ-Secretase Inhibition—To investigate the influence of presenilin on full-length SorLA (SorLA-FL), we stably expressed SorLA-FL (Fig. 1) in HEK-293 cells. In addition to full-length SorLA (Fig. 5A), the native SorLA-CTF was barely detectable with a molecular mass of 13 kDa. Incubation of the cells with DAPT led to an accumulation of SorLA-CTF as it was seen even more pronounced in cells expressing the dominant negative presenilin mutant. Interestingly, full-length SorLA also seems to accumulate depending on the level of p"

We report here that migfilin, a recently identified component of cell-matrix adhesions, is a biphasic regulator of cell migration. Loss of migfilin impairs cell migration. Surprisingly, overexpression of migfilin also reduces cell migration. Molecularly, we have identified vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) as a new migfilin-binding protein. The interaction is mediated by the VASP EVH1 domain and a single L104PPPPP site located within the migfilin proline-rich domain. Migfilin and VASP form a complex in both suspended and adhered cells, and in the latter, they co-localize in cell-matrix adhesions. Functionally, migfilin facilitates VASP localization to cell-matrix adhesions. Using two different approaches (VASP-binding defective migfilin mutants and small interfering RNA-mediated VASP knockdown), we show that the interaction with VASP is crucially involved in migfilin-mediated regulation of cell migration. Our results identify migfilin as an important regulator of cell migration and provide new information on the mechanism by which migfilin regulates this process.

Cell migration is a tightly controlled process that is crucially involved in embryonic development, wound repair, and other physiological processes (1Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr.

Abnormal cell migration is an important causal factor for the pathogenesis and/or progression of a wide variety of diseases. Understanding how cells control their motility therefore is an important topic in molecular biology. Migfilin is a recently identified widely expressed focal adhesion protein that provides a link between cell-matrix adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Migfilin consists of three structurally distinct regions. The C-terminal region of migfilin is composed of three LIM domains, which mediates the interaction with Mig-2, a focal adhesion protein that is critically involved in cell-matrix adhesion and shape modulation (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 6Rogalski T.M. Mullen G.P. Gilbert M.M. Williams B.D. Moerman D.G. J.

Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), an actin-binding protein whose deficiency or mutations cause defects in cell migration (7Stossel T.P.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Between the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions lies a proline-rich domain. Unlike the N- and C-terminal domains, however, neither the binding partners nor the functions of the migfilin proline-rich domain were known. Interestingly, some human cells express not only migfilin but also a splicing variant (termed as migfilin(s)) lacking the proline-rich domain (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In this study, we have sought to identify proteins that interact with the proline-rich domain of migfilin and investigated the roles of migfilin in regulation of cell migration. Our results show that vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), 2The abbreviations used are: VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: VASP, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. an actin cytoskeletal regulatory protein (reviewed in Refs. 9Renfranz P.J.

Depletion of migfilin diminished VASP localization to cell-matrix adhesions and impairs cell migration. Surprisingly, overexpression of migfilin also reduces cell migration. Using two different approaches (overexpression of VASP-binding defective migfilin mutants and siRNA-mediated VASP knockdown), we show that the interaction with VASP is crucially involved in migfilin regulation of cell migration. Antibodies—The following primary Abs were used in this study: mouse anti-VASP mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal anti-VASP Ab (Calbiochem), rabbit polyclonal anti-focal adhesion kinase Ab (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-GFP Ab (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-migfilin mAb (clone 43) (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), mouse anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma), and mouse anti-vinculin mAb (Sigma). All secondary Abs were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—A cDNA fragment encoding human migfilin residues 1–189 was inserted into the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). The construct was used as bait to screen a human keratinocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library following the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Sixteen positive clones were obtained from the library screening. Five of them were sequenced, among which three were found to encode VASP. To identify the VASP domain that mediates migfilin binding, cDNA fragments encoding human VASP sequences were inserted into the pGADT7 vector. The cDNA fragments encoding migfilin sequences were inserted into the pGBKT7 vector. The pGADT7 and pGBKT7 vectors containing VASP or migfilin sequences were introduced into yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109) and the interaction was analyzed following the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). DNA Constructs, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—DNA vectors encoding FLAG-migfilin or FLAG-migfilin(s) were described (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Gkretsi V. Zhang Y. Tu Y. Chen K. Stolz D.B. Yang Y. Watkins S.C. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Deletion or substitution mutations (as specified in each experiment) were introduced into the migfilin coding sequence by PCR. To generate the vector encoding the GFP-tagged migfilin proline-rich domain, a cDNA fragment encoding migfilin residues 84–180 was ligated into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). DNA vectors encoding wild type or mutant forms of migfilin were generated by ligating the wild type or mutant forms of migfilin cDNAs (including the stop codon) into the p3xFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma). The migfilin coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected with the vectors encoding various forms of migfilin using Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation analyses, the transfectants were lysed with the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were mixed with agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma) or a rabbit anti-GFP Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and UltraLink Immobilized Protein G (Pierce). The beads were washed four times and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with Abs as specified. Co-precipitation of Endogenous Migfilin and VASP—WI-38 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in culture plates for 1 day. The cell monolayers (adhered) were lysed with the lysis buffer. In parallel, WI-38 cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were re-suspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and maintained in suspension on a rocking platform for 45 min (suspension). The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with the lysis buffer. Migfilin was precipitated from the lysates with GST-FLN21 fusion protein (containing filamin A residues 2282–2395) as described (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). siRNA and Transfection—The migfilin siRNA and control RNA were described (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A second migfilin Stealth™ siRNA (target sequence: 5′-gaagaggguggcaucgucugucuuu-3′) was generated by Invitrogen. The migfilin Stealth siRNA was used in some experiments as specified. Two different VASP siRNAs were used. The first one (termed VASP siRNA1 herein) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number: sc-29516) and the second one (termed VASP siRNA2 herein, target sequence: 5′-aaagaggaaatcattgaagcc-3′) was purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were transfected with the siRNA or the control RNA using Oligofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The cells were analyzed 2 days after transfection. In double DNA/RNA transfection experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the DNA vector encoding migfilin or a control vector using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). One day after DNA transfection, the cells were transfected with VASP siRNA or a control RNA using Lipofectamine 2000. The double transfectants were analyzed 2 days after the RNA transfection. Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described (13Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4777-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips, fixed, and dually stained with primary mouse mAbs and rabbit polyclonal Abs as specified. The primary mouse and rabbit Abs were detected with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Rhodamine RedTX-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Abs, respectively. Preparation of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble Fractions—Cells were plated on collagen I-coated 60-mm plates and incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for 2 h to allow formation of cell-matrix adhesions. The cells were rinsed once with a PIPES buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4 m glycerol) containing protease inhibitors, and then extracted with the same buffer supplemented with 0.75% Triton X-100. The cell extracts were collected, vortexed, and centrifuged at 20,800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations in the Triton X-100-soluble (cytosol) fractions were determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). The pellets (the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions) were extracted with 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. The Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-migfilin and anti-VASP Abs. Cell Migration—The cells (HeLa, HT-1080, or MDA-MB-231) were transfected with the siRNA duplexes or DNA vectors as specified in each experiment. Two days after the transfection, cell migration was analyzed using Transwell® motility chambers as described (14Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, the undersurfaces of the 8-mm pore diameter Transwell motility chambers (Costar) were coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin. The cells were suspended in 0.1 ml of DMEM containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and added to the upper chambers (2 × 104 cells/chamber). After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated period of time, the cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed. The membranes were fixed and the cells on the undersurface were stained with Gills III hematoxylin. The cells from five randomly selected microscopic fields were counted. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to migrate into a cell-free area as described (15Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FBS in plates that were pre-coated with 30 μg/ml collagen I. The cell monolayers were wounded by scratching with a plastic pipette tip. After washing, the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 1% FBS and 0.5 μg/ml mitomycin C for the indicated periods of time. Images of three different segments of the cell-free area were recorded, and the distances traveled by the cells at the front in three different segments of the wound were measured. For statistical analyses, paired t test was used to compare two groups of data. For comparison among three or more groups of data, one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test were used. All values are presented as the mean ± S.D. from n experiments as indicated. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cell Adhesion—MDCK cells were transfected with a control vector lacking the migfilin sequence or vectors encoding different forms of migfilin as specified in the experiments. Two days after the transfection, the cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded in quadruplicate in 96-well plates that were pre-coated with 30 μg/ml collagen I. After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were quantified using crystal violet as described (16Humphries M.J. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 9.1.1-9.1.11Google Scholar). The percentages of the adhered cells were presented as the absorbance at 570 mm from the adhered cells divided by the absorbance at 570 mm from the total seeded cells. The data from two experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-test. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Identification of VASP as a Binding Protein of Migfilin—We used two approaches to identify proteins that interact with the migfilin proline-rich domain. One is a structure-based “candidate” approach. VASP was a strong candidate because of the presence of multiple LPPPP motifs, potential docking sites for VASP (9Renfranz P.J. Beckerle M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 88-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Krause M. Dent E.W. Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Gertler F.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 541-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), in migfilin proline-rich domain. To test whether VASP interacts with migfilin, we transfected HeLa cells with a vector encoding FLAG-migfilin and a vector lacking migfilin sequence as a control, respectively. Expression of FLAG-migfilin in the FLAG-migfilin transfectants (Fig. 1A, lane 2) but not the control transfectants (Fig. 1A, lane 1) was confirmed by Western blotting. FLAG-migfilin was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Fig. 1A, lane 4) and the immunoprecipitates were probed by Western blotting with an anti-VASP Ab. VASP was readily detected in the FLAG-migfilin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In control experiments, no VASP (Fig. 1B, lane 3) was detected in control precipitates lacking FLAG-migfilin (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In the second approach, we screened a human yeast two-hybrid cDNA library (containing 2.5 × 106 independent clones) with a migfilin fragment containing the proline-rich domain as bait. Five positive clones were sequenced, among which three encoded VASP. To further analyze this, we performed yeast two-hybrid binding assays using vectors encoding different domains of VASP and migfilin. The results showed that the VASP EVH1 domain is both necessary and sufficient for interacting with migfilin (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, no interaction was detected between VASP and the C-terminal LIM region of migfilin (Fig. 1C). These results identify VASP as a migfilin-binding protein and map the migfilin-binding site to the EVH1 domain of VASP. Endogenous Migfilin and VASP Form a Complex in Cells—We next tested whether endogenous migfilin and VASP form a complex in cells. To do this, we precipitated migfilin from human cells with a GST fusion protein containing filamin repeat 21 (GST-FLN21), which recognizes the N-terminal region of migfilin (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As expected, migfilin (Fig. 2A, lane 3) was readily precipitated with GST-FLN21 (Fig. 2C, lane 3) from lysates of the adhered cells. Probing the migfilin precipitates with an anti-VASP Ab showed that VASP was co-precipitated with the endogenous migfilin (Fig. 2B, lane 3). In control experiments, neither migfilin (Fig. 2A, lane 5) nor VASP (Fig. 2B, lane 5) were precipitated with GST (Fig. 2C, lane 5). To test whether the formation of the migfilin-VASP complex depends on cell-matrix adhesion, we precipitated migfilin from the cells that were kept in suspension (Fig. 2A, lane 4) with GST-FLN21 (Fig. 2C, lane 4). In suspended cells, VASP, like that in adhered cells, formed a complex with migfilin (Fig. 2B, lane 4), suggesting that the formation of the migfilin-VASP complex does not require the prior formation of cell-matrix adhesions. VASP is phosphorylated by protein kinase A on its first phosphorylation site upon cell detachment (17Howe A.K. Hogan B.P. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38121-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which causes a characteristic shift of VASP from 46 to approximately 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. Consistent with the finding that the formation of the migfilin-VASP complex occurs prior to the formation of cell-matrix adhesions, the 50-kDa phosphor-VASP also formed a complex with migfilin (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Mapping the VASP-binding Site to a Single LPPPP Site within the Proline-rich Domain of Migfilin—To facilitate structure-function analyses, we sought to define the VASP-binding site on migfilin. Toward this end, we first tested whether the migfilin proline-rich domain is necessary for interaction with VASP. To do this, we transfected HeLa cells with vectors encoding FLAG-migfilin(s), which lacks the proline-rich domain (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and FLAG-migfilin, respectively. The expression of FLAG-migfilin (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and FLAG-migfilin(s) (Fig. 3A, lane 3) was confirmed by Western blotting. FLAG-migfilin (Fig. 3A, lane 5) and FLAG-migfilin(s) (Fig. 3A, lane 6) were immunoprecipitated from the corresponding transfectants but not the control transfectants (Fig. 3A, lane 4) with an anti-FLAG mAb. As expected, VASP was readily co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-migfilin (Fig. 3B, lane 5). By marked contrast, no VASP was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-migfilin(s) lacking the proline-rich domain (Fig. 3B, lane 6) or with the anti-FLAG mAb in the absence of migfilin (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Thus, the proline-rich domain of migfilin is required for the interaction with VASP. Although migfilin contains several polyproline motifs that can potentially serve as binding sites for profilin, it was not detected in the migfilin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3C, lane 5), suggesting that the proline-rich domain of migfilin is preferentially recognized by VASP. Next, we tested whether the migfilin proline-rich domain is sufficient for interaction with VASP. To do this, we expressed GFP (Fig. 3D, lane 2) and a GFP fusion protein (GFP-PR) containing only the proline-rich domain (residues 84–180) (Fig. 3D, lane 1) in HeLa cells. GFP-PR (Fig. 3D, lane 3) and GFP (Fig. 3D, lane 4) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP Ab. Western blotting analyses showed that VASP was co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-PR (Fig. 3E, lane 3) but not GFP (Fig. 3E, lane 4), indicating that the migfilin proline-rich domain is sufficient for mediating the interaction with VASP. The migfilin proline-rich domain contains multiple polyproline sites including two LPPPP sites (starting from Leu residues at positions 104 and 166, respectively). To map the VASP-binding site, we introduced deletion mutations (Δ84–112 and Δ142–170) into the migfilin proline-rich domain (Fig. 3F). Cells were transfected with vectors encoding FLAG-tagged Δ84–112 or Δ142–170 and VASP binding was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation as described in Fig. 3, A and B. Deletion of residues 84–112, but not that of residues 142–170, eliminated VASP binding (Fig. 3F). To define the VASP-binding site, we introduced Ala substitution mutations into the Leu104 polyproline site. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding the FLAG-tagged Leu104 polyproline substitution mutant or FLAG-migfilin (as a positive control), or a vector lacking the migfilin sequence as a negative control. Expression of the FLAG-Leu104 polyproline mutant (Fig. 3G, lane 3) and FLAG-migfilin (Fig. 3G, lane 2) were confirmed by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the Leu104 polyproline mutant (Fig. 3G, lane 6), unlike the wild type migfilin (Fig. 3G, lane 5), failed to bind to VASP (Fig. 3H, compare lanes 5 and 6). These results demonstrate that VASP binding is mediated by a single LPPPPP site located at positions 104–109 within the proline-rich domain. Migfilin Facilitates VASP Localization to Cell-Matrix Adhesions—Consistent with the interaction between migfilin and VASP, migfilin and VASP proteins co-localized in cell-matrix adhesions (Fig. 4, compare A and B). To test whether migfilin plays a role in VASP localization to cell-matrix adhesions, we suppressed migfilin expression by transfection with the migfilin siRNA (5Tu Y. Wu S. Shi X. Chen K. Wu C. Cell. 2003; 113: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining with an anti-migfilin mAb revealed that the level of migfilin at cell-matrix adhesions was substantially reduced in the migfilin siRNA transfectants compared with that in the control transfectants (compare Fig. 4, C with A). As expected, clusters of VASP were readily detected in focal adhesions in control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). To analyze the effect of migfilin knockdown on VASP localization, we randomly selected 50 migfilin knockdown cells and found that all of them exhibited diminished focal adhesion localization of VASP (a representative migfilin knockdown cell is shown in Fig. 4, C and D). To confirm this, we transfected HeLa cells with a second migfilin siRNA (the migfilin Stealth siRNA, Invitrogen). Transfection of the cells with the migfilin Stealth siRNA effectively knocked down migfilin and diminished the localization of VASP to cell-matrix adhesions (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest an important role of migfilin in facilitating VASP localization to cell-matrix adhesions. In contrast to VASP, we found that focal adhesion kinase was clustered at cell-matrix adhesions in both the control (Fig. 4, E and F) and migfilin knockdown cells (Fig. 4, G and H). To further analyze this, we dually stained the migfilin knockdown cells and control cells with mouse anti-vinculin and rabbit anti-VASP Abs. Clusters of vinculin and VASP were readily detected in control cells (Fig. 4, I and J). As expected, VASP was largely diffusely distributed in migfilin knockdown cells. We randomly selected 30 migfilin knockdown cells. Clusters of vinculin were detected at cell-matrix adhesions in all these cells, despite the diminished level of VASP in these adhesion structures (a representative cell is shown in Fig. 4, K and L). The vinculin clusters, however, appeared somewhat smaller in migfilin knockdown cells compared to those in the control cells (Fig. 4, compare I and K). Protein clusters at cell-matrix adhesions and cytoskeleton are often resistant to nonionic detergent (e.g. Triton X-100) extraction (12Gkretsi V. Zhang Y. Tu Y. Chen K. Stolz D.B. Yang Y. Watkins S.C. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further analyze the effect of migfilin on VASP distribution, we extracted the migfilin siRNA transfectants and the control transfectants with a buffer containing 0.75% Triton X-100. As expected, transfection of the cells with the migfilin siRNA reduced the level of migfilin in the Triton X-100-soluble (cytosol) as well as the Triton X-100-insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions (Fig. 4M). VASP was detected in both the Triton X-100-soluble (Fig. 4N, lane 3) and Triton X-100-insoluble (Fig. 4N, lane 1) fractions. Knockdown of migfilin reduced the level of VASP in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 4N, compare lane 1 with lane 2) and concomitantly increased the level of VASP in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 4N, compare lane 3 with lane 4). Re-probing the same membrane with an anti-vinculin Ab showed that the level of vinculin in these fractions was not significantly altered (Fig. 4O). The biochemical extraction results, together with those of the immunofluorescent staining, suggest that depletion of migfilin selectively attenuates the localization and clustering of VASP at cell-matrix adhesions. Migfilin Is Not Required for VASP Localization to Lamellipodia—We next tested whether migfilin is required for VASP localization to lamellipodia. Human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were used in these studies as a high percentage of them form extensive VASP-positive lamellipodia that were often present in a polarized fashion (Fig. 5, B and F). Among 53 cells that were analyzed, 34 (64%) of them exhibited strong VASP-positive lamellipodia (two representative images are shown in Fig. 5, B and F). Despite the presence of VASP in lamellipodia, migfilin was not detected in this structure. Instead, it was highly concentrated in cell-matrix adhesions (Fig. 5, A and E), where VASP clusters were also detected (Fig. 5, B and F). Transfection of HT-1080 cells with migfilin siRNA substantially reduced the level of migfilin (Fig. 5, C and G). Immunofluorescent staining of migfilin knockdown cells with the mouse anti-migfilin mAb and rabbit anti-VASP Ab showed that, as expected, depletion of migfilin reduced the clustering of VASP at cell-matrix adhesions (Fig. 5, D and H). We analyzed 36 migfilin knockdown cells and detected VASP-positive lamellipodia in 25 (69%) of them. However, they often appeared shorter or un-polarized (Fig. 5, D and H). These results suggest that migfilin is not absolutely required for VASP localization to lamellipodia, albeit it may influence the length and polarity of lamellipodium. Migfilin Is a Biphasic Regulator of Cell Migration—The role of migfilin in regulation of cell migration had not been previously investigated. To test whether migfilin is required for cell migration, we transfected HeLa cells with the migfilin siRNA and the control RNA, respectively. As expected, the level of migfilin in the migfilin siRNA transfectants were substantially reduced (Fig. 6A). The levels of other cellular proteins, including actin (Fig. 6B) and other focal adhesion proteins such as Mig-2, filamin, VASP, paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, ILK, PINCH, and α-parvin (not shown) were not altered, confirming the specificity of the migfilin siRNA. We next compared the migration of the migfilin-deficient cells with that of the control cells. The results showed that depletion of migfilin significantly reduced cell migration (Fig. 6, C–E). To f"

Using a steady state binding assay in which the chaperone-substrate complex is directly detected, we demonstrate that the mutations result in a substantial increase in the level of binding to non-native states of the model substrate T4 lysozyme. The structural basis of the enhanced binding is investigated through equivalent substitutions in the homologous heat shock protein 27. The mutations shift the oligomeric equilibrium toward a dissociated multimeric form previously shown to be the binding-competent state. In the context of a recent thermodynamic model of chaperone function that proposes the coupling of small heat shock protein activation to the substrate folding equilibrium (Shashidharamurthy, R., Koteiche, H. A., Dong, J., and McHaourab, H. S. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 5281-5289), the enhanced binding by theαA-crystallin mutants is predicted to shift the substrate folding equilibrium toward non-native intermediates, i.e. the mutants promote substrate unfolding. Given the high concentration of αA-crystallin in the lens, the molecular basis of pathogenesis implied by our results is a gain of function that leads to the binding of undamaged proteins and subsequent precipitation of the saturated α-crystallin complexes in the developing lens of affected individuals.

Lens optical properties, refractivity and transparency, are derived from a unique cellular and molecular architecture. The predominant cellular components are terminally differentiated, organelle-free fiber cells (1Bassnett S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1678-1687PubMed Google Scholar) that contain a highly concentrated solution of three families of water-soluble proteins, the crystallins (2Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The crystallins pack in a glass-like state characterized by a short range spatial order (3Delaye M. Tardieu A. Nature. 1983; 302: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Molecular diversity, generated by multiple homologues in each crystallin family, polydisperse structures, and hetero-oligomerization, hinders long range interactions that can cause pockets of crystallization and thus fluctuations in the refractive index (4Jaenicke R. Slingsby C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 435-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the origin of the time axis, protein-protein interactions are tuned to yield a uniform protein distribution on dimensions comparable with the wavelength of visible light.In the process of aging, post-translational modifications and protein damage (5Ajaz M.S.

Consequently, the balance of intermolecular forces is disturbed, and protein aggregation and precipitation can occur. Because fiber cells do not have machineries to degrade and synthesize proteins, these events are detrimental to lens optical properties. Age-related cataract, a leading cause of blindness, is a protein unfolding and condensation disease that is intimately associated with changes in the biophysical properties of the crystallins and protein aggregate formation (12Benedek G.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1911-1921PubMed Google Scholar).A built-in mechanism inhibits aggregation processes primarily by segregation of proteins that show enhanced excursions to partially unfolded states. αA- and αB-crystallins, major protein components in lens fiber cells, are small heat-shock proteins (sHSP) 2The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat-shock proteins; Hsp27, heat-shock protein 27; T4L, T4 lysozyme; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; L, large oligomer; M, multimer. 2The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat-shock proteins; Hsp27, heat-shock protein 27; T4L, T4 lysozyme; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; L, large oligomer; M, multimer.

Mechanistic studies have linked the stability of sHSP oligomers and their dynamics to the recognition and binding of unfolding substrates (18Giese K.C. Vierling E. J. Biol.

The prevalent model of lens transparency hypothesizes a central role for α-crystallin chaperone activity in delaying the onset of scattering and loss of optical properties (21Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).Consistent with this model is the identification of inherited mutations in both α-crystallin coding regions that are associated with congenital cataract (23Mackay D. Andley U. Shiels A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W. Weleber R.G. Hum. Mol.

Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Molecular studies focused predominantly on the ability of the mutants to suppress light scattering by aggregating, unfolded model substrates. Light scattering in the presence of the mutants but not WT αA-crystallin was interpreted to reflect a reduction in chaperone-like efficiency as a consequence of the mutations (26Shroff N.P. Cherian-Shaw M. Bera S. Abraham E.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Kumar L.V. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Such loss of chaperone efficiency, however, cannot be responsible for the congenital phenotype since αA-crystallin knock-out mice are born with morphologically normal lenses and develop early onset cataract (31Brady J.P. Garland D. Duglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cobb and Petrash (27Cobb B.A. Petrash J.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) argued that the mutations must result in a toxic gain of function. Enhanced binding to membranes was proposed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis associated with the αA-R116C mutation.In this report, we reexamine the binding properties of two αA-crystallin mutants that have been linked to autosomal dominant cataract (23Mackay D. Andley U. Shiels A. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 11: 784-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Litt M. Kramer P. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Lovrien E.W. Weleber R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The experimental paradigm is a novel binding assay that is more relevant to chaperone-substrate interactions in the lens than other assays in the literature (32Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The premise of the assay is that most protein damage in the lens does not cause complete unfolding. The α-crystallins are presented with thermodynamically destabilized proteins that have more frequent excursions to partially non-native states. Therefore, the model substrate is a series of destabilized T4 lysozyme (T4L) site-specific mutants that have progressively reduced free energy of unfolding yet are predominantly in the folded state under the assay conditions. sHSP bind to dynamically populated non-native or excited states of T4L (32Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The equilibrium population of bound T4L reflects the energetic balance between association with the sHSP and refolding from the non-native state recognized by the sHSP. We used this assay to gain insight into the determinants of substrate recognition and binding and to explore the binding-competent states of these chaperones. For Hsp27, complex formation is mediated by multimers that are populated by equilibrium dissociation of the native oligomer in agreement with previous studies on sHSP (20Shashidharamurthy R.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Binding occurs through two modes that correlate with the extent of substrate unfolding (37Sathish H.A. Stein R.A. Yang G. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44214-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This mechanistic outline has been shown to describe the interaction of α-crystallin with destabilized mutants of the lens protein βB2-crystallin (39Sathish H.A. Koteiche H.A. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In contrast to previous studies that reported a loss of chaperone efficiency as a consequence of cataract-linked mutants, our analysis reveals significant enhancement of T4L binding by the αA-crystallin mutants relative to the WT. Equivalent mutations in the homologous Hsp27 lead to similar binding enhancement and shift the oligomer equilibrium toward the binding-competent multimers. A previously proposed and tested thermodynamic model predicts that an extreme shift in the oligomer equilibrium can result in an unfolding-like activity by the sHSP (20Shashidharamurthy R. Koteiche H.A. Dong J. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5281-5289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our results confirm this prediction and imply that the cataract phenotype is a consequence of the almost immediate titration of α-crystallin buffering capacity by undamaged lens proteins leading to the precipitation of substrate-saturated α-crystallin oligomers. A preliminary report of this work has appeared as an abstract (40Koteiche H.A. Mchaourab H.S. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44 (E-Abstract): 2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Monobromobimane was purchased from Molecular Probes. Source Q media and the Superose 6 column were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Details of T4L and αA-crystallin site-directed mutagenesis were described in previous publications (41Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 42Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). R49C and R116C substitutions were introduced in a cysteine-less background of αA-crystallin in which residue Cys-131 was replaced with alanine to prevent the formation of disulfide bonds. The cysteine-less background, hereafter referred to as αA-WT, was previously shown to retain all the αA-crystallin structural and functional characteristics (41Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).R56C and R140C mutations were introduced into Hsp27 cysteine-less background, hereafter referred to as Hsp27-WT, where the native cysteine at position 137 was replaced with an alanine. The cysteine-less background was previously shown to retain all Hsp27 structural and functional characteristics (43Mchaourab H.S. Berengian A.R. Koteiche H.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14627-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmids were sequenced to confirm the mutations and the absence of unwanted changes. Single-site mutants are named by specifying the original residue and the number of the residue followed by the new residue.Expression, Purification, and Labeling—Expression, purification, and labeling of T4L mutants followed the protocols described by Sathish et al. (37Sathish H.A. Stein R.A. Yang G. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44214-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). αA-crystallin, Hsp27, and their mutants were expressed as described previously (20Shashidharamurthy R.

Briefly, plasmids containing the appropriate vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Cultures, inoculated from overnight seeds, were grown to midlog phase at 37 °C until A600 ≈ 0.8. The cultures were then induced with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for 3 h at a temperature of 32 °C for αA-WT, αA-R49C, and the Hsp27 mutants and a temperature of 29 °C for αA-R116C. After cell lysis and precipitation of DNA by polyethyleneimine, the mutants were purified using sequential anion exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described previously (41Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 43Mchaourab H.S. Berengian A.R. Koteiche H.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14627-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The buffer for SEC contained 9 mm MOPS, 6 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3 at pH7.2 and was used for subsequent binding studies.Binding of T4L Mutants to αA-Crystallin and Hsp27 Variants— Intensity binding isotherms of bimane-labeled T4L mutants were constructed as follows. Samples containing fixed T4L concentrations and varying concentrations of αA-crystallin or Hsp27 were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. All samples contained 0.3 mm dithiothreitol. The experiments were carried out on a PTI L-format spectrofluorometer equipped with an RTC2000 temperature controller and a sample holder containing a Peltier heater/cooler. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the 420-500 nm range after excitation of the bimane molecule at 380 nm. The data were plotted as the normalized emission intensity at 465 nm versus the molar ratio of αA-crystallin or Hsp27 to T4L.Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—The fluorescence anisotropy (r) was measured using a PTI T-format spectrofluorometer, by comparing the polarization of the emitted light to the polarization of the excitation light according to the equation, r=(Ivv−G Ivh)/(Ivv+2 G IvhEq. 1 where Ivv and Ivh refer to the amplitude of fluorescence emission parallel and perpendicular to the plane of light excitation, respectively. The G-factor was determined for each sample to correct for bias in each channel. Samples for anisotropy measurements containing 5 or 10 μm bimane-labeled T4L and varying concentrations of αA-crystallin were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. All samples contained 0.3 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were excited at 380 nm, and the emission was collected at 465 nm. Each measurement represents an average of 10 readings. The data are plotted as the measured anisotropy versus the molar ratio of αA-crystallin to T4L mutant.Analysis of Binding Isotherms—Curve fitting, using the appropriate equations for single- or two-mode binding (37Sathish H.A. Stein R.A. Yang G. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44214-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was performed using the program Origin (OriginLab Inc.). The Levenberg-Marquardt method was used for non-linear least squares fits.SEC—Analytical SEC was performed on a Superose 6 column on an Agilent 1100 chromatography system equipped with a scanning fluorescence and absorption detectors. Samples were prepared at concentrations of 1, 0.5, and 0.1 mg/ml in the SEC buffer described above. Samples were injected from 100-μl volumes and chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min.For molar mass determination, a multiangle laser light-scattering detector (Wyatt Technologies) was connected in line with the absorption detector. The signal at the 90° angle was analyzed to obtain molar mass values (22Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar).RESULTSMethodology—The structural and thermodynamic characteristics of the T4L mutants, L99A and D70N, used in this study were previously described (32Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40557-40566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The site-specific substitutions reduce the free energy of unfolding (ΔGunf), reflecting a lower preference of the folded state relative to the unfolded state. Nevertheless, ΔGunf values of 4.7 and 6 kcal/mol, for L99A and D70N, respectively, imply equilibrium folding constants in the 103-104 range at 37 °C, and the mutants do not aggregate under the conditions of the binding assay. Although the crystal structure of L99A native state is similar to that of T4L-WT (45Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 747-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), solution NMR spectroscopy reveals the excursion to a partially unfolded, excited state with an equilibrium population of 3% (46Mulder F.A. Mittermaier A. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 932-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Our model postulates that binding is triggered by recognition of such states.An introduced cysteine residue at site 151 of each T4L mutant allows the attachment of either a paramagnetic spin label or the fluorescent group bimane. Formation of a chaperone-substrate complex restricts the rotational motion of the spin label and changes the emission intensity of the bimane (32Mchaourab H.S. Dodson E.K. Koteiche H.A. J. Biol.

Binding is also expected to increase the steady state anisotropy of the bimane, an observable used in this report to compare affinities between mutants of αA-crystallin with significantly different levels of binding. α-Crystallin binding to T4L is bimodal as manifested by distinct dissociation constants and the number of binding sites (37Sathish H.A.

The apparent affinities correlate with the free energy of unfolding of the T4L mutants.Both αA-crystallin mutations investigated in this study are arginine to cysteine substitutions. R116C is in a β-strand located at a 2-fold symmetric interface of the oligomer. A spin label introduced at this site has virtually no exposure to water-soluble paramagnetic reagents, and the substitution is accompanied by substantial changes in the apparent oligomer mass (41Berengian A.R. Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9951-9957Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Arg side chain is likely involved in a salt bridge critical for oligomer stability, a conclusion subsequently confirmed by the crystal structures of two sHSP (38van Montfort R.L. Basha E.

Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Similarly, a spin label introduced at R49C has no accessibility to the water phase, although the cysteine substitution did not result in significant changes in the molecular mass (data not shown).αA-Crystallin Mutants Exhibit Enhanced T4L Binding—Fig. 1a compares anisotropy binding isotherms of the three αA-crystallin forms: WT, R49C, and R116C to the T4L mutant D70N. Detection of binding by change in anisotropy is intrinsically complicated as its value is determined by both the mole fraction of bound T4L and its quantum yield. Therefore, anisotropy isotherms were quantitatively analyzed only under conditions that favor high affinity binding, which has been shown previously to have a similar quantum yield to unbound, folded T4L (37Sathish H.A.

The addition of αA-crystallin increases the steady state anisotropy of bimane-labeled T4L, consistent with the formation of large complexes (20Shashidharamurthy R. Koteiche H.A. Dong J.

Limiting anisotropy values of ∼0.35 ± 0.03 suggest substantial restrictions of probe rotation upon binding due to contacts of the probe with the chaperone in agreement with the binding-induced transition in the motional state of a spin label attached at the same position (32Mchaourab H.S.

Fig. 1a shows that at similar molar ratios, T4L is bound to a higher level by the αA-crystallin mutants than by the WT. Non-linear least squares analysis reveals a substantially smaller KD for the mutants than the WT at physiological temperatures and pH (Table 1). At the T4L concentration used, high affinity binding dominates as reflected by the number of T4L binding sites per αA-crystallin monomer, n, of about 0.25 (37Sathish H.A. Stein R.A. Yang G.

A similar transition in the shape of the isotherm was previously observed as a consequence of phosphorylation-mimicking mutations of αB-crystallin (48Koteiche H.A. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10361-10367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The two modes are associated with different emission intensities of the bimane-labeled T4L in the bound state (37Sathish H.A. Stein R.A. Yang G. Mchaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44214-44221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reduced emission in the 1-2 range of molar ratios reflects the quenching of bimane fluorescence in the low affinity mode (n ≅ 1) previously correlated with extensive unfolding of bound T4L (37Sathish H.A.

In contrast, the intensity isotherm of αA-WT is monophasic, although with a number of binding sites consistent with a minor contribution from low affinity binding (Table 2). Dissociation constants of the high affinity mode are an order of magnitude smaller for the mutants than the WT, and the overall number of binding sites is larger (Table 2). Similar trends in the extent of binding by the αA mutants were observed in binding isotherms constructed at concentrations as high as 50 μm using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy detection of spin-labeled T4L (data not shown).TABLE 2Number of binding sites, n, and dissociation constants, KD, of T4L-L99A binding to αA-crystallin at 37 ± 1 °C, pH 7.2 Fi is the fractional bimane fluorescence relative to free T4L associated with binding to each mode.αA-crystallinniKDaiFiμmWTn1 = 0.4 ± 0.12 ± 0.35R49Cn1 = 0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.51.3n2 = 1.2 ± 0."

We show here that exposure of cells to osmotic shock induces the hyperphosphorylation of Dlg and its concomitant accumulation within the cell membrane at sites of cell contact, a process that requires an intact actin filament network. In addition, hyperphosphorylation of Dlg also renders it more susceptible to degradation induced by the HPV-18 E6 oncoprotein. Mutational analysis of Dlg identifies a region within the first 185 amino acids as being important for this, with phosphorylation on residue S158 being responsible for its enhanced targeting by the E6 oncoprotein. Using specific kinase inhibitors, we show that Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is in part responsible for this phosphorylation, and for the subsequent Dlg accumulation at sites of cell contact. These results further support the notion of a complex phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Dlg, both with respect to its precise cellular localisation and to its susceptibility to proteasome-mediated degradation."

Protein kinase B/Akt is a crucial regulator of oncogenic signal and can phosphorylate p27Kip1 to enhance p27Kip1degradation, thereby promoting cell growth. Here, we show that 14-3-3σ-mediated cell cycle arrest concurred with p27Kip1 upregulation and Akt inactivation. We show that 14-3-3σ blocks Akt-mediated acceleration of p27Kip1 turnover rate. 14-3-3σ inhibits Akt-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation that targets p27Kip1 for nuclear export and degradation. 14-3-3σ inhibits cell survival and tumorigenicity of Akt-activating breast cancer cell. Low expression of 14-3-3σ in human primary breast cancers correlates with cytoplasmic location of p27Kip1. These data provide an insight into 14-3-3σ activity and rational cancer gene therapy by identifying 14-3-3σ as a positive regulator of p27 and as a potential anticancer agent."

Under these conditions, a decrease in the rate of mitochondrial phosphorylation can increase the production of oxygen-free radicals, in the form of superoxide (O2·¯), from the early stages of the electron transport chain. Two segments of the electron transport chain have been implicated in O2·¯ generation. One, on the NADH dehydrogenase of Complex I, operates via electron leakage from the reduced flavin mononucleotide (8Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 9Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 10Kudin A.P.

The other, on Complex III, mediates O2·¯ generation through the Q cycle mechanism (Fig. 1), in which electron leakage presumably results from the autoxidation of ubisemiquinone (12Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and reduced cytochrome bL (13Nohl H. Jordan W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the Q cycle mechanism, there are two ubisemiquinones formed in different parts of the cycle. An unstable ubisemiquinone (Qo·¯) formed near the cytoplasmic site (Fig. 1) is considered to be the major source of O2·¯; therefore, inhibitors such as stigmatellin and myxothiazol that block the formation of Qo·¯ would be expected to decrease overall O2·¯ generation. The other ubisemiquinone (Qi·¯), formed near the matrix site, is stable and EPR-detectable (Fig. 1). Although generally Qi·¯ is not thought to be a source of O2·¯ production because of its stability, when an inhibitor such as antimycin A is used to block the Qi site a reverse electron flow will be induced, thus enhancing the formation of Qo·¯ and increasing O2·¯ generation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, electron leakage for O2·¯ production mediated by low potential cytochrome bL (or b566) was postulated as shown in the Q cycle pathway (Fig. 1) (13Nohl H. Jordan W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Gong X. Yu L. Xia D. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

NO produced from endothelial cells has the capacity to modulate mitochondrial functions in regulation of metabolism, respiration, and mitochondrial biogenesis (3Moncada S. Erusalimsky J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 4Ramachandran A. Levonen A.L. Brookes P.S. Ceaser E. Shiva S. Barone M.C. Darley-Usmar V. Free Radic. Biol.

Circulation. 2005; 111: 2966-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is well known that within the electron transport chain NO serves as a physiological regulator of cellular respiration in vivo, primarily via reversible binding to the binuclear center of cytochrome c oxidase. Complex II and Complex III are also important targets of NO in respiratory regulation (17Geng Y. Hansson G.K. Holme E. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 18Welter R. Yu L. Yu C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, an independent pathway for NO utilization in mitochondria has been implicated as well: the Q cycle mechanism (19Poderoso J.J. Lisdero C. Schopfer F. Riobo N. Carreras M.C. Cadenas E. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37709-37716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Cadenas E. Poderoso J.J. Antunes F. Boveris A. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 33: 747-756Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Specifically, (a) QH2 has been suggested as the primary target of NO, as NO can oxidize QH2 in vitro, resulting in ubsemiquinone and nitroxyl anion (NO–); and (b) ubisemiquinone at the Qo site provides a source of electron leakage, forming O2·¯, which is in turn trapped by NO to generate OONO– (Fig. 1). The mechanism of NO consumption, as mediated by the Q cycle of Complex III, is not well understood, especially with regard to interaction with O2·¯. An ideal model for investigation of this mechanism is the succinate-cytochrome c reductase (SCR) supercomplex purified from the bovine heart, comprising succinate-ubiquinone reductase (SQR or Complex II) and the cytochrome bc1 complex (QCR or Complex III) (21Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gwak S.H. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7675-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the SCR supercomplex mediates electron transfer from succinate to cytochrome c during mitochondrial respiration. The redox centers of SQR contain flavin adenine nucleotide (FAD), three iron-sulfur clusters (S-1, S-2, and S-3), cytochrome b560, and ubiquinone (Q). The redox centers of QCR consist of ubiquinol (QH2), cytochromes bL, bH (high potential b or b562), and c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster (RISP). Succinate serves as an electron donor for SQR to reduce FAD, after which an electron is transferred from the reduced FAD to the iron-sulfur clusters and cytochrome b560, and Q is reduced to QH2. The electron transfer from QH2 to cytochrome c is catalyzed by QCR and follows the Q cycle mechanism (Fig. 1). The use of succinate as an electron donor for SCR has the advantage of avoiding artifactual O2·¯ generation derived from ubiquinol autoxidation (23Zhang L. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33972-33976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this work we have used purified SCR as a model system to address the fundamental question of how the Q cycle mediates O2·¯ generation and NO consumption. We have: 1) used EPR to obtain direct evidence of SCR-mediated O2·¯ generation; 2) used electrochemical detection with an NO electrode to obtain direct evidence of SCR-mediated NO consumption; and 3) demonstrated that NO scavenges O2·¯ generated from the ferrocytochrome b moiety of SCR by forming OONO–. Reagents—Ammonium sulfate, antimycin A, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, horse heart cytochrome c (highest grade available in commercial, and prepared without using trichloroacetic acid), Zn,Cu-superoxide dismutase (SOD), succinic acid, and sodium cholate were purchased from Sigma and used as received. Ascorbic acid, potassium cyanide, and sodium dithionite were purchased from Aldrich. Myxothiazol, stigmatellin, and thenoyl trifluoroacetone (TTFA) were from Fluka BioChemika (St. Louis, MO). The 5-diethoxylphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO) spin trap was purchased from ALEXIS Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Preparations of Mitochondrial Succinate-Cytochrome c Reductase (SCR)—Bovine heart mitochondrial SCR was prepared and assayed according to the published method (21Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified SCR contained 4–4.2 nmol of heme b per mg of protein and exhibited an activity of ∼1.5 μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/mg of protein. Purified SCR was stored in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA. Analytical Methods—Optical spectra were measured on a Shimadzu 2401 UV-visible recording spectrophotometer. The enzyme concentration (based on the heme b) of SCR was calculated from the differential spectrum between dithionite reduction and ferricyanide oxidation, using an extinction coefficient of 28.5 mm–1 cm–1 for the absorbance difference of A562 nm–A576 nm. The enzyme activity of SCR was assayed by measuring cytochrome c reduction. An appropriate amount of SCR was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm EDTA, 19.8 mm succinate, and 50 μm ferricytochrome c. The SCR activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 550 nm. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Experiments—EPR measurements were performed using the EPR Core Facilities at the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute. Experiments were carried out on a Bruker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.86 GHz with 100 kHz modulation frequency at room temperature. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 50-μl capillary, which was then positioned in the HS cavity (Bruker Instrument, Billerica, MA). The sample was scanned using the following parameters: center field, 3510 G; sweep width, 140 G; power, 20 milliwatt; receiver gain, 2 × 105; modulation amplitude, 1 G; time of conversion, 81.92 ms; time constant, 327.68 ms. The spectral simulations were performed using the WinSim program developed by Duling (24Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson.

Nitric Oxide Consumption Rate by SCR—NO consumption rate was measured electrochemically at 37 °C in an electrochemical vial using a Free Radical Analyzer (World Precision Institute, Sarasota, FL) and Clark NO electrode (World Precision Institute, Sarasota, FL). For measuring the NO consumption rate under anaerobic conditions, a slow flow of argon gas was maintained in the space above the solution. The electrochemical detector continuously recorded the current collected by the electrode, which is proportional to the NO concentration in the solution. The sensor was calibrated with known concentrations of NO, using NO-equilibrated solutions as described in the literature (25Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A.

The quantitation of the SCR-mediated NO consumption rate with succinate or without succinate was based on: (a) the initial rate of the kinetic curve from NO decay in PBS, or (b) the decrease of peak current from the kinetic curve of NO decay in PBS (27Chen Y.R.

DEPMPO Spin Trapping of O2·¯ Generated from SCR in the Presence of Succinate—To obtain direct evidence for O2·¯ production mediated by SCR, we employed the EPR spin-trapping technique to measure O2·¯ generation unambiguously and directly. Of the available spin traps, DEPMPO is ideal for quantitating O2·¯ production by SCR based on the following advantages: (a) DEPMPO is 40-fold more sensitive than the cytochrome c assay for the detection of O2·¯ (28Roubaud V.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and (c) the O2·¯ adduct of DEPMPO/·OOH is more stable than that of DMPO/·OOH (29Frejaville C. Karoui H. Tuccio B. Le Moigne F.

When purified SCR (2 μm, based on the heme b concentration) was incubated with DEPMPO (20 mm) in PBS and the reaction was initiated by the addition of succinate (18 μm), a multi-line EPR spectrum was produced that was characteristic of DEPMPO/·OOH (Fig. 2A, solid line) based on the hyperfine coupling constants (isomer 1: aN = 13.14 G, aβH=11.04G, aγH=0.96G, aP = 49.96 G (80% relative concentration); isomer 2: aN = 13.18 G, aβH=12.59G, aγH=3.46G, aP = 48.2 G (20% relative concentration) (11Chen Y.R.

Trapping of SCR-mediated O2·¯ by DEPMPO was thus highly specific and suitable for quantitative analysis. That the DEPMPO/·OOH adduct arose from the trapping of O2·¯ was confirmed by the addition of Zn,Cu-containing superoxide dismutase (SOD, 100 units/ml) to the reaction system (Fig. 2B); upon its addition the adduct formation was completely prevented. In the absence of SCR, no DEPMPO/·OOH was detected (Fig. 2C), indicating the enzymatic dependence of the DEPMPO adduct formation. When native SCR was replaced with heat-denatured (70 °C for 5 min) SCR, the formation of DEPMPO/·OOH was inhibited (Fig. 2D), indicating that the electron transfer activity in the enzyme is required for O2·¯ generation. The detection of the superoxide adduct of DEPMPO was strongly inhibited when succinate was omitted from the system (Fig. 2E), supporting a direct role for succinate as the electron donor for SCR-mediated O2·¯ production. In the presence of an electron acceptor, ferricytochrome c (cytochrome c, 6 μm), the production of O2·¯ by succinate-energized SCR was nearly completely inhibited (Fig. 2F), suggesting two possibilities: (a) electron leakage from SCR was efficiently prevented by a stoichiometric amount of cytochrome c under the conditions of enzyme turnover, i.e. in the presence of both succinate and cytochrome c; and (b) any O2·¯ produced by SCR was presumably quenched by cytochrome c reduction. The enzymatic activity of SQR in SCR is sensitive to TTFA, which inhibits electron transfer from SQR to QCR through binding to the S3 center and the cytochrome b560 binding protein in SQR (30Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of SCR with TTFA (10 mm) inhibited ∼87% of the electron transfer activity from succinate to cytochrome c but only 65% of the O2·¯ generation (Fig. 2G), whereas complete inhibition of electron transfer activity and O2·¯ generation can be achieved by higher dosage of TTFA (50 mm); implying that QCR controlled most of the SCR-mediated O2·¯ generation. Electron Leakage to Oxygen by SCR under the Conditions of Enzyme Turnover—To measure the electron leakage from SCR to oxygen under the conditions of enzyme turnover, Zn,Cu-SOD (0.5 units/μl) was added to the reaction mixture containing 36 pmol of SCR and 30 μm cytochrome c in PBS. The reduction of cytochrome c was subsequently induced by the addition of various amounts of succinate (30 μm to 1.2 mm). Electron leakage to oxygen under these turnover conditions was calculated as the amount of SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction. The observed electron leakage was dependent upon the ratio of succinate/cytochrome c. There was no detectable O2·¯ generation under the ratio of 15 or below. Above a ratio of 15, the observed electron leakage increased as the succinate/cytochrome c increased, reaching a plateau at a maximum of 14% of the total cytochrome c reduction when the ratio was greater than 30 (data not shown). Involvement of the Q Cycle Mechanism in SCR-mediated O2·¯ Generation—Antimycin A is a well known inhibitor of QCR; it blocks the transfer of the second electron of QH2 from cytochrome bH to Q, and inhibits the formation of Qi·¯ (see Fig. 1). In the presence of antimycin A, electrons would accumulate in the high-potential heme b (bH) of QCR, and electron leakage to molecular oxygen should be accelerated due to enhanced formation of Qo·¯, a potential source of O2·¯. Two other inhibitors of QCR, myxothiazol and stigmatellin, block electron transfer at the Qo site. Myxothiazol is bound in the Qo pocket slightly toward low-potential heme bL, which causes the release the RISP into a mobile conformation (31Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 32Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It inhibits the first electron transfer from QH2 to RISP (Fig. 1). Whereas stigmatellin is bound at a different subsite in the Qo pocket, which immobilizes the RISP in the b conformation (31Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 32Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It interrupts the transfer of the first electron from the Qo site to cytochrome c1 (Fig. 1). Both inhibitors and QH2 are mutually competitive for binding, so either would prevent QH2 occupying the site, and therefore would prevent the formation of Qo·¯ (33Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15826Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), presumably inhibiting O2·¯ generation. The above three inhibitors inhibited more than 99.9% of the electron transfer activity of SCR at concentrations the same as the enzyme. In spin trapping with DEPMPO in the absence of cytochrome c, their effects on O2·¯ generation by SCR varied. When SCR (2 μm) was pretreated with antimycin A (10 μm), O2·¯ generation by SCR was enhanced by up to 20%, whereas both stigmatellin and myxothiazol inhibited succinate-initiated O2·¯ production by up to 20–30% (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with the idea that the ubisemiquinone at the Qo site (Qo·¯) contributes an appreciable fraction of the total O2·¯ generation. In the presence of cytochrome c at one-third the level of the succinate concentration (6 μm), DEPMPO/·OOH was not detected (Fig. 3B). However, O2·¯ generation was significantly stimulated when SCR was preincubated with any of the above three inhibitors (Fig. 3B). This stimulation could be due to blocking of the electron transfer pathway by the inhibitors, leading to electron leakage to molecular oxygen. Antimycin A was observed to induce marginally higher stimulation of O2·¯ production under the condition of enzyme turnover, presumably due to the formation of Qo·¯. As indicated in the Fig. 3A, the Qo site inhibitors, stigmatellin and myxothiazol, caused only partial inhibition of the SCR-mediated O2·¯ generation in the absence of cytochrome c. Furthermore, both inhibitors stimulated electron leakage and subsequent O2·¯ production under the conditions of enzyme turnover in the presence of cytochrome c (Fig. 3B). Therefore, other mechanisms apart from Qo·¯ must be involved in the mediation of O2·¯ production. To address the possible involvement of the heme components of SCR, we pretreated SCR with a high concentration of the heme protein inhibitor KCN (5 mm), which resulted in the inhibition of 67% of its electron transfer activity and 70% of its O2·¯ generating ability (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the heme components were critical for SCR-mediated O2·¯ generation. It is worth noting that cyanide (5 mm) inhibited the electron transfer activity of QCR, but did not affect the electron transfer activity of SQR. In further support of this hypothesis, the UV-visible absorption spectra of stigmatellin-inhibited SCR (stig-SCR in Fig. 4) following the addition of succinate (10 μm) were obtained. As indicated in the initial spectrum (1st scan) of Fig. 4A, stigmatellin blocked the reduction of cytochrome c1, but did not block the reduction of cytochrome b, which is the typical effect of the Qo site inhibitor on the spectrum of Complex III (33Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained UV-visible absorption spectra further indicated that the decrease or oxidation of ferrocytochrome b was accompanied by an increase of ferrocytochrome c1 during repeat scanning (Fig. 4A, 2nd–8th scans). Oxidation of ferrocytochrome b (absorbance decrease in A562 nm) was even more obvious when a lower level of succinate (4 μm) was used as indicated in Fig. 4B. However, the observed spectral interchange between heme b and heme c1 was partially inhibited by DEPMPO (Fig. 4C, dashed line) and completely inhibited by SOD (Fig. 4C, dotted line). Under conditions of argon saturation, spectral interchange between heme b and heme c1 was not observed (Fig. 4D). These data imply that oxygen mediates the intra-molecular electron transfer of succinate-reduced SCR via the formation of an O2·¯ intermediate from the autoxidation of ferrocytochrome b (Equations 1 and 2). Ferrocytochromeb(Fe2+)+O2→ferricytochromeb(Fe3+)+O2·¯(Eq. 1) Ferricytochromec1(Fe3+)+O2·¯→ferrocytochromec1(Fe2+)+O2(Eq. 2) It is known that O2·¯ can be quenched by ferricytochrome c via one-electron reduction (rate constant, k ∼ 106 m–1 s–1) (35Butler J. Koppenol W.H. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10747-10750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in Em,7 between cytochrome c and cytochrome c1 is small (<10 mV), and both share an identical heme configuration (c-type heme). Therefore, cytochrome c1 should be as efficient as cytochrome c at oxidizing O2·¯. It is worth noting that similar intramolecular electron transfer mediated by O2·¯ as an intermediate was also observed in the case of native SCR, antimycin A-treated SCR, and myxothiazol-treated SCR (data not shown). Therefore, these data provide strong evidence that reduced cytochrome b is a source of O2·¯. This concept was further supported by measurement of the NO consumption rate by stigmatellin-inhibited SCR (see below). Interaction of NO with SCR Prevents O2·¯ Generation—Poderoso et al. (19Poderoso J.J. Lisdero C. Schopfer F. Riobo N. Carreras M.C. Cadenas E. Boveris A. J. Biol.

Therefore, the Q cycle has been implicated as an important target for NO-mediated respiratory regulation. This cytochrome c oxidase-independent pathway is proposed to regulate O2·¯ generation by forming peroxynitrite (OONO–"

In currently available structural models of F1, the P-loop (amino acid residues 156GGAGVGKT163) contributes to substrate binding at the β subunit catalytic sites. Here, we report the first transition state-like structure of F1 (ADP·Vi·Mg·F1) from rat liver that was crystallized with the phosphate (Pi) analog vanadate (VO3-4 or Vi). Compared with earlier “ground state” structures, this new F1 structure reveals that the active site region has undergone significant remodeling. P-loop residue alanine 158 is located much closer to Vi than it is to Pi in a previous structural model. No significant movements of P-loop residues of the α subunit were observed at its analogous but noncatalytic sites. Under physiological conditions, such active site remodeling involving the small hydrophobic alanine residue may promote ATP synthesis by lowering the local dielectric constant, thus facilitating the dehydration of ADP and Pi.

The mammalian mitochondrial ATP synthase (F0F1) is a large protein complex (Fig. 1A) located in the inner membrane, where it catalyzes ATP synthesis from ADP, Pi, and Mg2+ at the expense of an electrochemical gradient of protons generated by the electron transport chain (reviewed in Refs. 1Pedersen P.L.

In addition, more recent studies show that in mitochondria, the entire “double motor” ATP synthase complex is itself in complex formation with the phosphate carrier and adenine nucleotide carrier, forming an ATP synthase-phosphate carrier-adenine nucleotide carrier supercomplex named the “ATP synthasome” (13Ko Y.H.

To fully understand how ATP synthases work, we must elucidate three different levels of mechanism (Fig. 1A), these being (a) the mechanism (electrochemical) of proton gradient-driven rotation of the centrally located γ subunit; (b) the mechanism (mechanical) of coupling γ subunit rotation at every 120° to conformational/binding changes in each αβ subunit pair; and finally (c) the mechanism (chemical) of ATP synthesis from ADP, Pi, and Mg2+ on each αβ subunit pair followed by release of the bound ATP (2Pedersen P.L. Ko Y.H. Hong S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is this last step of the overall mechanism of ATP synthesis that is the focus of this study. Specifically, we wanted to know to what extent active site remodeling occurs when the substrate-bound state (“ground state”) of F1 moves into a more transition-like state (i.e. that state where ADP and Pi are dehydrated in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP is formed). Both of our earlier biochemical studies (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) studies on the ATPase myosin. Significantly, the studies with myosin employed vanadate (Vi) 5The abbreviations used are: Vi, orthovanadate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; OSCP, oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein. (VO3-4), a phosphate analog that in the presence of ADP and Mg2+ resulted in an ADP·Vi·Mg·myosin transition-like state where Vi substituted for the γ-phosphate of ATP. Since Vi is photoreactive, it was possible in the presence of UV light plus O2 to cleave the myosin backbone (17Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an oxidative event that occurred at the conserved serine in the third position within the P-loop (GESGAGKT). This finding was subsequently found to be consistent with a crystal structure of the ADP·Vi·Mg·myosin complex (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Thus, studies on myosin provided strong support for the view that in the transition state, the γ-phosphate of ATP and the third residue (serine) within the P-loop consensus region (GESGAGKT) reside close to one another. Although these same investigators used phosphate analogs other than Vi (e.g. AlF-4 to give an ADP·AlF4·Mg·myosin complex, the crystal structure of which was solved also at atomic resolution (19Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemisty. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), they concluded that the ADP· Vi·Mg·myosin structure resembled most closely that expected for a true transition state (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). With the above in mind, our earlier biochemical studies (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J.

In control studies, prior incubation of F1 with Vi alone, ADP + Vi, and ADP + Mg2+ had little or no effect on ATPase activity. Taken together, these findings suggested, consistent with experiments that had been observed earlier for myosin (17Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol.

Here, we report the first crystal structure of an ATP synthase F1 moiety (catalytic unit) crystallized in the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and Vi and discuss its apparent validation of the conclusions made from our earlier biochemical studies (15Ko Y.H.

The Vi stock solution was carefully prepared as described previously (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a very important series of steps, and the concentration was determined by measuring the optical density at 265 nm using the extinction coefficient 2925 m-1 cm-1. Single crystals (prepared by YHK) were selected for analysis, equilibrated in cryoprotectant (10% glycerol), cooled in liquid nitrogen, and then transferred into a gaseous nitrogen stream at 100 K for x-ray data collection. After screening numerous crystals ranging in size from 0.2 to 1 mm at the National Institutes of Health facility (Rockville, MD), it was concluded that a relatively small crystal size (0.2-0.3 mm) and 10% glycerol are critical factors in obtaining the best diffraction data. Crystal Properties and Structure Determination—Data on selected crystals (0.2-0.3 mm) were collected in 1° oscillations at 100 K on beam-line 19ID of the Structural Biology Center (Argonne National Laboratory). A single data set composed of 120 frames was used for the study reported here. Data were corrected for image distortion and nonuniformity by D*TREK (25Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar), processed by MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. No. 26.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), and scaled by SCALA (28Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). These new crystals, designated here as “ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 crystals,” belong to space group R32 as originally reported by Amzel and Pedersen (29Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2067-2069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rat liver F1 crystallized in the presence of ATP and Pi and designated here as “ADP·Pi·F1 crystals,” and in the Protein Data Bank as 1MAB. In an earlier study (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the ADP·Pi·F1 crystals resulted in a 2.8-Å structure of F1 containing ADP and Pi in catalytic sites located predominantly on β subunits and MgATP in noncatalytic sites located predominantly on α subunits. The MgATP is endogenously and tightly bound to the noncatalytic sites on α subunits of rat liver F1 as isolated and is not derived from the crystallization medium. Structure factor amplitudes were produced with TRUNCATE (28Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A random set of the reflections containing 5% of the data were chosen as a test set that were excluded in refinement and used to calculate Rfree. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (28Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with 1MAB (see above) as the search model. An initial model was obtained with Rwork/Rfree = 0.357/0.356 in the 20-3.0 Å range using all of the data. The model was further improved by rounds of refinement with the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Rfree was used throughout the process as a parameter for quality control. The final Rwork/Rfree is 0.309/0.321 (20-3.0 Å, no cut-off) with no water molecules built into the model. The positions of vanadate (Vi) and Mg2+ were located at sites of 3σ density at the active site in the σA weighted Fo - Fc. omit map, where Vi and Mg2+ were omitted in the phase calculation. The trigonal-bipyramidal model of Vi was obtained from the ADP·Vi·Mg2+·myosin structure (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and manually docked into the 3σ density distal to ADP. The Mg2+ was modeled into the 3σ density proximal to ADP. Electron density maps were calculated using the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Figures—Figures were prepared and rendered with Pymol (available on the World Wide Web at www.pymol.org), Xtalview, and Raster3D (32Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3878) Google Scholar). Structural alignments for comparison were made using LSQKAB (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) or the LSQ fit function implemented in xfit. Schematic interactions were made using LIGPLOT (33Wallace D.E. Laskowski R.A. Thorton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4434) Google Scholar). Rationale for Crystallization Conditions—Pi added to the medium to obtain the earlier ADP·Pi·F1 crystals (1MAB) of rat liver (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was omitted from the crystallization medium designed to obtain ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 crystals in order to minimize competition between Pi and Vi for the active site of F1. A final crystallization mixture consisting of ATP, MgCl2,Vi, and azide was selected (see “Experimental Procedures”). Azide, an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by F1, was included, since it is known that this inhibitor does not immediately prevent the cleavage of the γ-phosphate of ATP (34Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fintin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Rather, azide inhibits after some ATP hydrolysis has occurred, implicating its stabilization of intermediate states (34Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fintin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was rationalized that subsequent to F1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of Vi, the transition-like state may be stabilized. In fact, ADP·Vi·Mg·F1-containing crystals were obtained. Description of ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 Crystals—Table 1 provides a summary of the x-ray data collected and refinement statistics. Like the earlier ADP·Pi·F1 crystals (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 crystals (Fig. 2A, inset) obtained in the presence of ATP, MgCl2, and Vi belong to space group R32, indicating that the three α/β subunit pairs of the functional unit have 3-fold crystallographic symmetry and that the single γ subunit in the crystal lattice resides in one of three possible orientations. Therefore, the occupancy of the γ subunit is 0.33. Space groups other than R32 were considered and excluded. These included three other possible C2 space groups, which are subgroups of R32, and space group P1. There is no difference in the Rsym among these space groups even to the highest resolution shell. Finally, twinning was excluded based on the ratio 〈I2 〉/ 〈I2 〉 calculated by the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

The Rfree was carefully checked throughout the refinement, which included many trials of simulated annealing and energy minimization that were performed until no further improvement could be achieved.TABLE 1Summary of data collection and refinement statisticsParametersValuesData collectionSpace group and unit cell (Å)R32, a = b = 144.6, c = 363.0Wave length (Å)/X-ray source0.99092/ANL 191DResolution (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.73.5-3.0 (3.16-3.0)Observed/Unique reflections257,373/29,647Redundancy8.7 (8.9)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)Rsym (%)bRsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii - 〈I 〉|/ΣhklΣiIi, where Ii is an intensity I for the ith measurement of a reflection with indices hkl, and <I> is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.14.3 (75)I/σ12.1 (3.2)RefinementResolution (Å)20.0-3.0 (3.11-3.0)No. of reflections (total/work/free)29,509/28,026/1483No. of atoms from protein/ligands8177/59Rwork (%)cRwork = Σhkl||Fo(hkl)| - k|Fc(hkl)||)/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)| for the working set of reflections; Rfree is 5% of the reflections randomly chosen to be excluded from the refinement.30.6 (40.5)Rfree (%)cRwork = Σhkl||Fo(hkl)| - k|Fc(hkl)||)/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)| for the working set of reflections; Rfree is 5% of the reflections randomly chosen to be excluded from the refinement.32.0 (37.7)r.m.s. deviation bond lengths (Å)/angles (degrees)0.018/2.1r.m.s. deviation dihedrals/improper (degrees)24.1/1.4a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.b Rsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii - 〈I 〉|/ΣhklΣiIi, where Ii is an intensity I for the ith measurement of a reflection with indices hkl, and <I> is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.c Rwork = Σhkl||Fo(hkl)| - k|Fc(hkl)||)/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)| for the working set of reflections; Rfree is 5% of the reflections randomly chosen to be excluded from the refinement. Open table in a new tab Description of the Overall ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 Structure Relative to the ADP·Pi·F1 Structure (1MAB)—The ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure (Fig. 2) was solved by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP (28Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with the ADP·Pi·F1 structure (1MAB) as the search model (see “Experimental Procedures”). The coordinates of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure described here (red) were aligned with those (blue) of the original ADP·Pi·F1 structure (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A depicts the alignment of the αβγ parts of each structure, and Fig. 2B shows the alignment of the α3β3γ catalytic unit. The alignment was based on amino acid residues 24-91 of the α subunit that have been reported to undergo little conformational change during catalysis (21Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Overall, the two structures almost overlap as the r.m.s. difference of the peptide atoms is only 0.52 Å. Thus, the presence of Vi·Mg at the active site of rat liver F1 induces little global conformational movement. (Although present, the small δ and ϵ subunits are not resolved in either the 2.8 Å ADP·Pi·F1 structure (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure reported here but have been visualized in one F1 structure (35Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) in 1:1 complex formation associated with the bottom of the γ subunit.) The αβγ part of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure (Fig. 2A) contains one α subunit (residues 23-502), one β subunit (residues 1-399 and 406-477), one γ subunit (residues 1-45, 74-87, and 206-270, occupancy 0.33), one ATP, one ADP, two Mg2+, and one Vi. The ATP is complexed with Mg2+ to give ATPMg (yellow)inthe α subunit site, and the ADP is complexed with both Mg2+ and Vi to give ADP·Vi·Mg (green)inthe β subunit “catalytic” site (Fig. 2, A and B). Within the β subunit, the Vi·Mg part of the ADP·Vi·Mg was located as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown to interact with the P-loop (Fig. 2C). The Active Site—Fig. 3A shows the atoms around the active site of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure relative to the P-loop, 156GGAGVGKT163. The Mg2+ (dark blue) is coordinated by P-loop Thr163 that plays the same role in myosin (18Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and the vanadate (red) lies in a charged pocket surrounded by Lys162, Glu188, the catalytic base, and also Arg189 and Arg260 that are not shown. The stick model depicted without nucleotide in Fig. 3B shows that the P-loop of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure is stabilized also by hydrogen bonds between Arg337 and the carbonyl oxygens of Gly157 and Ala158 and by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Gly156 and the imino nitrogen of Val312. Finally, both A and B of Fig. 3 show that within the active site of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure, the distance between the β carbon of P-loop Ala158 and the nearest oxygen atom of vanadate (red) is 3.8 Å, a value significantly less than the distance of 5.2 Å between the β carbon of Ala158 in the ADP·Pi·F1 structure and the nearest oxygen atom of phosphate. This finding indicated that, whereas Vi·Mg had induced little global change in the F1 structure as noted above, significant changes within the active site had occurred. Structural Differences between the Active Sites of ADP·Vi·Mg·F1, and ADP·Pi·F1—As indicated above, a distinct difference in the active sites of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure and the ADP·Pi·F1 structure (1MAB) was observed as it relates to the distance from the β carbon of Ala158 to the Vi and Pi oxygen atoms, respectively. To determine whether structural differences in β subunits were confined to the active site, the β subunits of the two structures were aligned, the average distance between all amino acid atoms within residues 1-399 and 406-477 in each structure was determined, and the differences were calculated. A plot was then made of the differences versus residue number. The results presented in Fig. 4A show clearly that a distinct difference exists between the locations of β subunit atoms in the two structures within that part of the active site that includes the P-loop. Thus, the overall average difference in distance among all β subunit atoms is only 0.36 Å, whereas the average difference among atoms in the P-loop region is 1.0 Å. Some positional differences also occur between residues 406 and 440 near the C terminus that are unlikely to be involved with function. These differences result from our use of different side chain rotamers from those used in 1MAB to fit the electron density encountered in this region. Consistent with a change in the P-loop regions induced by Vi·Mg as inferred by our earlier biochemical studies (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Ko Y.H. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28853-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Fig. 4B shows an overlay of the P-loop region of the β subunit of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure (black) with that of the earlier ADP·Pi·F1 structure (gray). From this overlay, it is clear that a significant difference exists between the position of Ala158 in the P-loop in the two structures and also a significant difference in the position of Vi and Pi. Thus, the α-carbon of Ala158 in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure (black) has moved 1.1 Å in the N-terminal direction of the main chain, away from the α-carbon of Ala158 in the ADP·Pi·F1 structure (gray). In addition, the Vi (red) is much closer to the P-loop in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure than is the Pi (green) in the ADP·Pi·F1 structure. These conformational changes bring Ala158 in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure much closer to the Vi such that this phosphate analog resides in a more hydrophobic environment than does the phosphate in the ADP·Pi·F1 structure. Thus, the distance from the Cβ atom of Ala158 (black) to the vanadium atom of Vi (red) in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure is 4.7 Å, compared with 6.2 Å between the Cβ atom of Ala158 (gray) and the phosphorus atom of Pi (green) in the ADP·Pi·F1 structure. Table 2 provides additional information about distances between Vi and Pi atoms to nearby amino acid residues in the two structures.TABLE 2Distances (Å) between atoms of γ-phosphate or analogues to Ala158 and Lys162 in the ADP, Pi-F1 (Protein Data Bank code 1MAB) structure and the ADP,Vi-Mg-F1 structureAtomLys162 ∈-NAla158CαCβÅÅADP·Pi-bound (1MAB)aCalculated from coordinates of Protein Data Bank code 1MAB; P is the phosphorus atom of phosphate, and the closest oxygen atom of phosphate was selected.P3.55.66.2O3.04.55.2ADP·Vi·Mg boundbCalculated from coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 2F43) of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure in this study; V is the vanadium atom of vanadate, and the closest oxygen atom of vanadate was selected.V3.93.84.7O2.73.23.8a Calculated from coordinates of Protein Data Bank code 1MAB; P is the phosphorus atom of phosphate, and the closest oxygen atom of phosphate was selected.b Calculated from coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 2F43) of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure in this study; V is the vanadium atom of vanadate, and the closest oxygen atom of vanadate was selected. Open table in a new tab Absence of Structural Differences in the P-loop Regions of Nucleotide Binding Sites Located within the α-Subunits of the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 and ADP·Pi·F1 Structures—Although the α subunit of the F1 unit of the ATP synthase is noncatalytic, it also has a P-loop region (169GDRQTGKT176) that helps bind MgATP. Relative to the P-loop in the catalytic β subunit, the P-loop located in an α subunit nucleotide binding site would be predicted to remain stationary in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure relative to the ADP·Pi·F1 structure. To determine whether this is the case, the α subunits of the two structures were aligned, the average distance between all amino acid atoms was determined, and the differences were plotted versus residue number. The results presented in Fig. 5A show that no obvious differences between the two α-subunit structures occur in the P-loop region. This is shown more clearly in Fig. 5B, which depicts an overlay of the P-loop regions in the two cases. Comparison of Changes Observed in the P-loop Active Site Region When ADP, Vi, and Mg 2+ Are Present Relative to When ADP, AlF-4/AlF3, and Mg 2+ Are Present—Aluminum fluoride, a phosphate analog and potential transition state analog (22Kleuss C.R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), has been co-crystallized recently with bovine heart F1 (20Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 15: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), resulting in two different high resolution structures, one designated by the authors as (ADP·AlF3)F1 (Protein Data Bank code 1E1R) with a single β-subunit catalytic site filled with ADP, AlF3, and Mg2+, and a second designated (ADP·AlF-4)2F1 (Protein Data Bank code 1H8E) with two β-subunit catalytic sites filled with ADP, AlF-4, and Mg2+. Therefore, it was important to inquire to what extent ADP, AlF-4/AlF3, and Mg2+ induce changes in the P-loop/active site region within these bovine F1 structures relative to that induced by ADP, Vi, and Mg2+ in the rat liver F1 structure. With regard to the first reported structure, (ADP·AlF3)F1, that contained ADP, AlF3, and Mg2+ in a single β-subunit (20Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 15: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the authors state that there is little change in the structure of this subunit relative to that of the same β-subunit (βDP)in the original bovine F1 structure that contained ADPMg (9Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1BMF). With regard to the second reported bovine F1 structure, (ADP·AlF-4)2·F1, in which two β-subunits are filled with ADP, AlF-4, and Mg2+, no obvious change is observed (Fig. 6A) in the P-loops relative to the β-subunit (βDP) of the original bovine F1 structure that contained only ADPMg (9Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Therefore, both aluminum fluoride-containing bovine F1 structures appear to be very near “ground state,” a conclusion reached earlier by Allison et al. (37Allison W.S. Ren H. Dou C. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2000; 32: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) for the (ADP·AlF3)F1 structure. This is in sharp contrast to that of the rat liver ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure (Fig. 6B) reported here in which the P-loop region has undergone a significant conformational change, moving the β-carbon atom of Ala158 and the vanadium atom nearly 1.5 Å closer than the β-carbon atom of Ala158 to phosphate atom distance in the original ADP·Pi·F1 structure (10Bianchet M.A. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Conclusions—For the past 3 decades, a major objective related to work on the mitochondrial ATP synthase (F0F1) has been to understand the mechanism by which ATPMg is made from ADP, Pi, and Mg2+,a process that takes place primarily on β subunits. The study reported here, in which the F1 catalytic moiety has been crystallized for the first time in the presence of Vi, a known transition state analog, has resulted in a structure (ADP·Vi·Mg·F1) that meets two expectations of a transition state-like structure. One expectation is that one or more residues at the active site that surround the reacting species, in this case ADP and Pi (represented here by Vi), will undergo a positional change. This expectation is met, since the third amino acid within the P-loop (156GGAGVGKT163)(i.e. Ala158 (β-carbon atom)) and the nearest oxygen atom of Vi move much closer (1.4 Å), consistent with interpretations of our earlier biochemical studies (15Ko Y.H. Bianchet M.A. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18875-18881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Ko Y.H. Hong S. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28853-28856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In fact, other amino acids within the P-loop region also undergo positional changes as deduced from Table 2 and as illustrated in Fig. 6B. A second expectation of a transition state-like structure is that the reacting substrates, in this case ADP and Pi in the presence of Mg2+, will be closer together in the transition state than in the ground state. The distance of 3.9 Å between the β-phosphate (phosphorus atom) of ADP and the vanadium of Vi in the β subunit in the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure described here is less than in the closest representative ground state structure, the βE subunit of the (ADP·AlF-4)2F1 structure (21Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This β subunit structure, containing bound ADP, Mg2+, and the phosphate analog SO2-4, has a distance between the β-phosphate of ADP and the sulfur atom of SO2-4 of 5.4 Å. Significantly, the 3.9-Å distance between β-phosphate of ADP and the vanadium atom of Vi in our ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure lies between the ground state distance (5.4 Å) and the distance of 2.9 Å between the β- and γ-phosphates of the ATP product analog AMP-PNP (Mg2+ present) in the bovine heart F1 structure (9Abrahams J.B. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ADP·Vi·Mg·F1 structure reported here satisfies the two expectations of a transition state-like structure noted above. Finally, Fig. 7 emphasizes the potentially important roles of Mg2+ and the methyl group of Ala158 in the final events of ATP synthesis in mitochondria catalyzed by the F1 moiety of the ATP synthase (F0F1). Mg2+ is suggested to help bring the β-phosphate of ADP and Pi in the ground state (Fig. 7, top) closer together in the transition state (Fig. 7, center), whereas the methyl group of Ala158 that has moved into the active site helps lower the dielectric constant and facilitate release of water (Fig. 7, center) and ATP formation (Fig. 7, bottom).

https://openalex.org/W2097471645,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein ϵ (C/EBPϵ) plays a critical role in terminal myeloid differentiation. Differentiation is an integrated process of cell cycle arrest, morphological change, functional maturation, and apoptosis. However, the molecular networks underlying these events in C/EBPϵ-induced differentiation remain poorly understood. To reveal these mechanisms, we performed a detailed molecular analysis of C/EBPϵ-induced differentiation using an inducible form of C/EBPϵ. The activation of C/EBPϵ induced growth arrest, morphological differentiation, the expression of CD11b and secondary granule proteins, and apoptosis in myeloid cell lines. Unlike C/EBPα, C/EBPϵ dramatically up-regulated p27 with a concomitant down-regulation of cdk4/6 and cyclin D2/A/E. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x were down-regulated, whereas pro-apoptotic protein Bax remained unchanged. Using a variety of mutants, we revealed that these events were all regulated by the N-terminal activation domain of C/EBPϵ. Interestingly, some of the differentiation processes such as the induction of secondary granule protein genes were clearly inhibited by c-Myc; however, inhibition of apoptosis by Bcl-x did not affect the entire differentiation processes. These data indicate the N terminus of C/EBPϵ to be solely responsible for most aspects of myeloid differentiation, and these events were differentially affected by c-Myc."
https://openalex.org/W2096935605,"Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that functions as a prosthetic group in carboxylation reactions. In addition to its role as a cofactor, biotin has multiple roles in gene regulation. We analyzed biotin effects on gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrated by microarray, Northern, and Western analyses that all yeast genes encoding proteins involved in biotin metabolism are up-regulated following biotin depletion. Many of these genes contain a palindromic promoter element that is necessary and sufficient for mediating the biotin response and functions as an upstream-activating sequence. Mutants lacking the plasma membrane biotin transporter Vht1p display constitutively high expression levels of biotin-responsive genes. However, they react normally to biotin precursors that do not require Vht1p for uptake. The biotin-like effect of precursors with regard to gene expression requires their intracellular conversion to biotin. This demonstrates that Vht1p does not act as a sensor for biotin and that intracellular biotin is crucial for gene expression. Mutants with defects in biotin-protein ligase, similar to vht1Δ mutants, also display aberrantly high expression of biotin-responsive genes. Like vht1Δ cells, they have reduced levels of protein biotinylation, but unlike vht1Δ mutants, they possess normal levels of free intracellular biotin. This indicates that free intracellular biotin is irrelevant for gene regulation and identifies biotin-protein ligase as an important element of the biotin-sensing pathway in yeast.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to the presence of a variety of environmental nutrients via sensing and signaling pathways capable of identifying the nutrients, determining their concentration, and using this information to regulate gene expression, metabolism, and cell growth. The nutrient sensors identified to date are either typical plasma membrane receptors, plasma membrane proteins with transporter-like structures, or cytoplasmic nutrient-binding proteins (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Boles E. Andre B. Boles E. Krämer R. Molecular Mechanisms Controlling Transmembrane Transport. Springer, Berlin2004: 121-153Google Scholar and 2Holsbeeks I. Lagatie O. Van Nuland A. Van de Velde S. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 556-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, some plasma membrane transporters have been claimed to have additional functions as sensors for their transported substrate (3Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 4Donaton M.C. Holsbeeks I. Lagatie O. Van Zeebroeck G. Crauwels M. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Mol.

Biotin, a water-soluble vitamin (vitamin H) that functions as a prosthetic group of carboxylases, is an essential nutrient for most yeast species (5Koser S.A. Vitamin Requirements of Bacteria and Yeasts. Charles C. Thomas Publishers, Springfield, IL1968Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, six biotin-containing proteins are known. These include two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, cytosolic Acc1p (6Hasslacher M. Ivessa A.S. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mitochondrial Hfa1p (7Hoja U. Marthol S. Hofmann J. Stegner S. Schulz R. Meier S. Greiner E. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21779-21786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the two cytosolic isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc1p and Pyc2p (8Stucka R. Dequin S. Salmon J.M. Gancedo C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and urea amidohydrolase (Dur1,2p (9Sumrada R.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9119-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Although these proteins use biotin in carboxylation reactions, the biotin group linked to Arc1p is currently not known to fulfill an enzymatic function (10Kim H.S. Hoja U. Stolz J. Sauer G. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42452-42455Google Scholar). The establishment of a covalent linkage of biotin to these proteins is catalyzed by biotin-protein ligase, which is encoded by the essential BPL1 gene (11Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All known biotin ligases operate via a two-step mechanism. First, a biotinyl-AMP intermediate is formed from biotin and ATP that is then transferred to a selected lysine residue in the biotin domain of an acceptor protein (12Chapman-Smith A. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 359-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because Acc1p is the only essential substrate of Bpl1p, the essential function of Bpl1p lies in the biotinylation of Acc1p that is necessary for the production of malonyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation. Most strains of S. cerevisiae are not able to synthesize biotin de novo. However, they can perform the last three steps of biotin biosynthesis and generate biotin from the precursors KAPA, 2The abbreviations used are: KAPA, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid; BRE, biotin-response element; DAPA, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid; DTB, desthiobiotin; strep-PO, streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ONPG, ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside; UAS, upstream-activating sequence. 2The abbreviations used are: KAPA, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid; BRE, biotin-response element; DAPA, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid; DTB, desthiobiotin; strep-PO, streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ONPG, ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside; UAS, upstream-activating sequence. DAPA, or DTB (13Ohsugi M. Imanishi Y. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1985; 31: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by making use of the enzymes encoded by BIO3 (DAPA aminotransferase), BIO4 (DTB synthase), and BIO2 (biotin synthase) (14Phalip V. Kuhn I. Lemoine Y. Jeltsch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Zhang S. Sanyal I. Bulboaca G.H. Rich A. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Uptake of DTB is mediated by the biotin permease Vht1p (16Stolz J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and uptake of KAPA and DAPA requires the high affinity plasma membrane permease Bio5p (14Phalip V. Kuhn I. Lemoine Y. Jeltsch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the BIO3, BIO4, and BIO5 genes is their presence in a closely packed gene cluster on chromosome XIV (14Phalip V. Kuhn I. Lemoine Y. Jeltsch J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, sake-producing strains of S. cerevisiae, as well as a few laboratory strains, have been found to produce biotin de novo (17Wu H. Ito K. Shimoi H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6845-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Prototrophic strains contain Bio6p, a protein required for an early step of biotin biosynthesis, which is absent from most laboratory strains (17Wu H. Ito K. Shimoi H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6845-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Pioneering studies by Rogers and Lichstein (18Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 557-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that biotin uptake in yeast is a high affinity process that leads to biotin accumulation. Moreover, biotin uptake appeared to be regulated and to correlate inversely with the biotin concentration present in the medium (19Rogers T.O. Lichstein H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the biotin transporters of S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe had been identified, these results were confirmed and demonstrated to be due to the increased expression of the transporter genes (VHT1 in S. cerevisiae and vht1+ in S. pombe) in low biotin medium (16Stolz J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Together, this demonstrates that biotin uptake in yeast is regulated at the level of transcription and raises the question of which mechanism allows the cells to measure the abundance of biotin. Regulation of gene expression by biotin is not unique to yeast cells. This field was pioneered by Dakshinamurti and co-workers (21Dakshinamurti K. Cheah-Tan C. Can. J. Biochem. 1968; 46: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Chauhan J. Dakshinamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and many biotin-controlled genes are now known from both biotin-prototrophic (plants, most bacteria) and biotin-auxotrophic organisms, including mammals (23Che P. Weaver L.M. Wurtele E.S. Nikolau B.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Rodriguez-Melendez R. Zempleni J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2003; 14: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Mammalian biotin-regulated genes include the biotin transporter, biotin-dependent carboxylases, cytokines, and oncogenes (reviewed in Ref. 24Rodriguez-Melendez R. Zempleni J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2003; 14: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The sensor for biotin or the precise signaling pathway that mediates the effect of biotin on gene expression has not been unveiled in any eukaryotic system. This is different from the situation in some eubacteria and archaea, where biotin-protein ligase contains an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and acts as a repressor of the biotin operon (25Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). DNA binding requires that BirA contains bound biotinyl-AMP, which is an intermediate in the biotinylation reaction that accumulates when the biotin acceptor proteins are completely present in the holo-form (26Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 427-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This regulatory circuit ensures that biotin is not produced in higher amounts than required for protein biotinylation (26Cronan Jr., J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 427-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Many prokaryotic and all eukaryotic biotin-protein ligases, in contrast, lack DNA-binding domains, indicating that these organisms use different mechanisms to monitor biotin availability (27Polyak S.W. Chapman-Smith A. Brautigan P.J. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32847-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Guillen-Navarro K. Encarnacion S. Dunn M.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 246: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we address the question of where the biotin signal is generated and which target genes are affected by biotin deficiency in S. cerevisiae cells. We demonstrate that yeast mutants with defects in protein biotinylation display typical features of low biotin grown cells, which identifies biotin-protein ligase as a critical element in controlling biotin-responsive genes. In addition, we identify a conserved DNA sequence that confers biotin-dependent regulation. Pathways that may link the low biotin signal to gene expression are discussed. Yeast Strains, Media, and Culture Conditions—W303-1A (MATα ura3-1 ade2-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 (29Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar)) was used as a wild-type strain for most experiments. The vht1Δ::HIS3 allele was amplified with specific primers from JSYΔvht1 (20Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and transformed into W303-1A. Correct transformants were identified by PCR. To replace the promoter (nucleotides –167 to –5) of BPL1 with the galactose-regulated GAL1 promoter, we fused a HindIII-SpeI fragment from pYES2 (Stratagene) containing the GAL1 promoter to the kanMX4 marker gene (obtained as a SpeI/SmaI fragment from pFA6a-kanMX (30Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) in a HindIII/SmaI cut pUC19 plasmid. The kanMX-GAL1 promoter fusion was amplified with oligonucleotides that contained terminal regions of homology derived from BPL1 and mediated homologous recombination after transformation of the PCR product. The same strategy was used to replace the promoter (nucleotides –213 to –5) of ACC1 with that of GAL1 to create strain GAL-ACC1. Correct transformants, as verified by PCR, displayed slow growth on glucose-containing plates. Epitope-tagged versions of Bio5p or Vht1p were generated by PCR-mediated homologous recombination using S. pombe his5+ (VHT1-3HA) or kanMX4 (BIO5-9myc) as a marker (30Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 31Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Correct integration and C-terminal fusion were verified by Western analysis that detected Vht1p-3HA and Bio5p-9myc at the expected molecular weight. The W303-1A pyc1Δ::LEU2 deletion strain was described before (8Stucka R. Dequin S. Salmon J.M. Gancedo C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The pyc2Δ::kanMX4 deletion in W303-1A was generated by transformation with a PCR fragment containing the pyc2Δ::kanMX4 allele from an EUROSCARF strain (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) and isogenic bio2Δ::kanMX4, arc1Δ::kanMX4, hfa1Δ::kanMX4, and dur1,2Δ::kanMX4 strains were also received from EUROSCARF. Identical growth conditions produced lower β-galactosidase activities in BY strains when compared with W303, but the induction of VHT1 in low biotin medium was similar in both strain backgrounds. SC medium contained 2% glucose or 2% galactose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without vitamins (Bio 101, Inc.). Amino acids and nucleobases were added as required. SC was supplemented with all vitamins except biotin for standard concentrations (32Wickerham L.J. Burton K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1946; 56: 363-371Crossref Google Scholar), and biotin, DTB, or KAPA was added as indicated. Difco bacto-agar was used for solidification. Growth assays on plates were performed as described (33Stolz J. Vielreicher M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig. 7A made use of bpl1-3826 (34Mishina M. Roggenkamp R. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 35Hoja U. Wellein C. Greiner E. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Medium for bpl1-3826 additionally contained 0.03% hydrolyzed butter and 1% Tween 40. Medium for both pyc mutants contained 40 mm l-aspartate and 15 mm potassium hydrogen phthalate and was adjusted to pH 5.0 with KOH. β-Galactosidase Assays—Most reporter assays made use of a construct that fused the VHT1 promoter (starting from the natural HindIII site at nucleotide –760) to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene in the S. cerevisiae centromeric plasmid YCplac33 (36Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 1000 bp of the BIO2 promoter were amplified by PCR and fused to lacZ in YCplac33. Binding sites for Gcn4p, Aft1p, or the BRE were replaced by unrelated sequences of identical length using PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. Alternatively, the fragments of the VHT1 promoter depicted in Fig. 3 were cloned as PCR products with terminal XhoI or SalI sites into the unique XhoI site of pMEL-β2, a centromeric yeast vector that contains the UAS-less MEL1 promoter fused to lacZ (37Melcher K. Sharma B. Ding W.V. Nolden M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids were transformed into yeast cells, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed according to published protocols (38Kaiser C.S.M. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Standard assays were performed by growing cells overnight in SC containing 2 μg/liter biotin. The cells were centrifuged, washed, and used to inoculate three cultures in SC with 2 μg/liter biotin and three cultures with 0.02 μg/liter biotin for A600 = 0.2. Six hours later, when the cultures had reached A600 ∼1.0, about 10 A600 units of cells were broken with glass beads in 250 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using a Systems FastPrep instrument (Bio 101, Inc.). After addition of 250 μlof 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, the extract was centrifuged for 5 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined in Bradford assays (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). In parallel, the β-galactosidase activity of the supernatant was determined with ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG) at 37 °C as described (38Kaiser C.S.M. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). One unit of β-galactosidase corresponds to 1 μmol of ONPG hydrolyzed per mg of protein per min at 37 °C. The data reported are mean values obtained from the three individual cultures ± S.D. Immunological Techniques—A serum against Vht1p was produced by immunization of rabbits with a protein containing amino acids 4–126 of Vht1p fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein. The fusion protein was produced from pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) as a soluble protein in E. coli and purified using amylose columns as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Polyclonal sera to detect the 9myc (sc-789) or 3HA (sc-805) epitope tags were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antisera against Bio2p and porin were a gift from U. Mühlenhoff and R. Lill (Marburg, Germany). Secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. Alternatively, proteins harboring covalently bound biotin were detected with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (strep-PO) (catalog number 21126; Pierce). Determination of Intracellular Free Biotin—To quantify cellular free biotin, 30–100 A600 units of cells were washed, resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), boiled for 10 min at 95 °C, and centrifuged to remove cell fragments and denatured proteins. Free biotin present in the supernatant was determined with a competition ELISA (40Duval M. Job C. Alban C. Douce R. Job D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Biotinylated BSA for coating of ELISA plates was prepared by incubation of 25 mg of BSA (catalog number A0846; Applichem) with 5 mg of biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (catalog number B2643; Sigma) in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.8, for 6 h at room temperature, followed by extensive dialysis against the same buffer. Plates were coated with a solution containing 3 μg/ml biotinyl-BSA in PBS overnight, followed by blocking with 10 mg/ml unlabeled BSA in PBS. Strep-PO (Pierce) was used in a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBST and either incubated with biotin standard solutions or with cell extracts for 60 min at 25 °C before incubation with the plates for 60 min at 25 °C. After washing with PBST, peroxidase activity was determined as described (40Duval M. Job C. Alban C. Douce R. Job D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The biotin concentration in the cell extracts was determined as described (40Duval M. Job C. Alban C. Douce R. Job D. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, a curve was generated with biotin solutions in PBS to determine the minimal amount of biotin required to saturate strep-PO and thus prevent strep-PO binding to the biotinyl-BSA-coated plates. Next, different volumes of cell extracts were used as competitors of strep-PO binding, and the smallest volume of extract, which already prevented binding of strep-PO, was determined. The biotin concentration of the extract was calculated by division of the above-determined amount of biotin with the extract volume. Cellular concentrations are based on an assumed intracellular volume of 11.25 μl/10 A600 units of cells. DNA Microarrays—A yeast culture was grown to saturation in SC medium containing 2 μg/liter biotin and used to inoculate parallel cultures containing 2 or 0.02 μg/liter biotin. The cells were harvested 6 h later (A600 = 1.0–1.1), washed with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and frozen. RNA was extracted with acid phenol according to standard protocols (41Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) and further purified using RNeasy maxi columns (Qiagen). RNA (15 μg) was converted to double-stranded cDNA (Invitrogen), followed by synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA using the BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics). Two Affymetrix yeast genome S98 GeneChips were hybridized for each condition as described by the manufacturer. Affymetrix microarray suite 5.0 was used for single array and base-line comparison analysis, using a global scaling strategy and setting the average signal intensity of all arrays to a target value of 100. Northern Analysis—To confirm the results of the microarray experiment, we performed Northern analysis using an independent preparation of RNA prepared by the procedure described above. RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated on formaldehyde gels and blotted to nitrocellulose filters. Probes were obtained by random labeling of PCR products derived from the coding regions of VHT1, BPL1, BIO2, BIO5, or ACT1 (encoding actin) with [α-32P]dCTP. A Conserved DNA Element in the Promoters of Genes Involved in Biotin Metabolism—We have shown previously that S. cerevisiae and S. pombe possess plasma membrane biotin permeases (named Vht1p for vitamin H transporter 1 in both yeasts) that are transcriptionally regulated by the amount of biotin present in the growth medium (16Stolz J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To investigate this regulation, we aligned the promoter of VHT1 from S. cerevisiae and other Saccharomyces species (42Cliften P. Sudarsanam P. Desikan A. Fulton L. Fulton B. Majors J. Waterston R.

This approach identified a DNA element, which we name BRE, that was present in all species (Fig. 1A). We next used the 20-bp BRE motif to search the intergenic regions of other genes that were likely candidates of biotin-mediated regulation. The genes of biotin synthase (BIO2) and biotin-protein ligase (BPL1) contained a similar element in their 5′-sequences (Fig. 1, B and C). In all cases investigated, the distance of the BRE to the start ATG was between 250 and 370 bp (Fig. 1). Within the BRE, some positions were >90% identical (Fig. 1, A–C, boldface), but others appeared to be less conserved. The same conclusion follows from a graphical representation that shows that the terminal positions of the BRE are more similar than the central six nucleotides (Fig. 1D). Strikingly, the conserved terminal positions form a palindrome, which often constitutes the binding site for a DNA-binding protein. Taken together, the promoters of biotin metabolic genes from related Saccharomyces species contain conserved DNA elements that could play a role in their regulation by biotin. The BRE Mediates the Low Biotin Response—To determine whether the BRE is the site of biotin regulation, we fused 760 bp from the VHT1 promoter (from –760 to –1) to the lacZ reporter in a centromeric vector. The plasmid was transformed into an S. cerevisiae wild-type strain, and the transformants were grown in medium containing biotin concentrations of 2 μg/liter (the standard concentration present in SC medium) or 0.2 or 0.02 μg/liter. Following growth, the activity of β-galactosidase was determined. The assays demonstrated that cells from high biotin medium possessed only a low activity of the reporter enzyme (Fig. 2). The reporter activity increased 4.2× when cells were grown with 1/10 of the normal biotin concentration and 5.4× for cells from medium with 1/100 of the normal biotin content (Fig. 2). Thus, the increased expression of lacZ reflects the activation of the VHT1 promoter in low biotin medium (20Stolz J. Hoja U. Meier S. Sauer N. Schweizer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18741-18746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the reporter construct can be used to investigate the biotin status of the cells. Genome-wide analyses have demonstrated that VHT1 is a target of the iron-responsive transcription factor Aft1p, which mediates up-regulation of VHT1 in low iron conditions (44Shakoury-Elizeh M. Tiedeman J. Rashford J. Ferea T. Demeter J. Garcia E. Rolfes R. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An Aft1p-binding site (–70TACACCC–64 (45Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar)) is present in the VHT1 promoter but is not conserved in other sequenced Saccharomyces species. Another study demonstrated that the transcription factor Gcn4p, a central player in the response to amino acid starvation, targets VHT1 (46Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In the case of Gcn4p, a canonical binding site (UASGCRE (47Hill D.E. Hope I.A. Macke J.P. Struhl K. Science. 1986; 234: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)) is present in the VHT1 promoter (–110ATGACTCTT–102) and conserved in all sequenced Saccharomyces species. To address the question whether Gcn4p or Aft1p mediate the low biotin response, we individually deleted their binding sites from the VHT1 promoter. Deletion of the Gcn4p site caused an overall reduction of β-galactosidase activity, which was apparent at all biotin concentrations tested (Fig. 2). The promoter lacking the UASGCRE, however, still responded to low biotin concentrations, which caused a 7.8× increase in activity (Fig. 2). Deletion of the Aft1p site caused no gross alterations of the promoter activity and did not influence the response to low biotin concentrations (Fig. 2). Another promoter element, which is present in S. cerevisiae VHT1 but not conserved in all Saccharomyces species, is a binding site for the heterodimeric Ino2p/Ino4p transcription factors (–417CTTTCACATGG–407 (48Schüller H.J.

https://openalex.org/W1998381304,"Kremen1 and 2 (Krm1/2) are coreceptors for Dickkopf1 (Dkk1), an antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and play a role in head induction during early Xenopus development. In a proteomic approach we identified Erlectin, a novel protein that interacts with Krm2. Erlectin (XTP3-B) is member of a protein family containing mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH-, or PRKCSH-) domains implicated in N-glycan binding. Like other members of the MRH family, Erlectin is a luminal resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. It contains two MRH domains, of which one is essential for Krm2 binding, and this interaction is abolished by Krm2 deglycosylation. The overexpression of Erlectin inhibits transport of Krm2 to the cell surface. Analysis of its embryonic expression pattern in Xenopus reveals that Erlectin is member of the endoplasmic reticulum synexpression group. Erlectin morpholino antisense injection leads to head and axial defects during organogenesis stages in Xenopus embryos. The results indicate that Erlectin functions in N-glycan recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that it may regulate glycoprotein traffic.

Secreted growth factors and their receptors play eminent roles in development and differentiation, and it is increasingly recognized that their activity is regulated by proteins functioning in secretory protein traffic. Thus, despite the presumed housekeeping role of genes functioning in protein secretion, their mutation frequently gives rise to embryonic phenotypes of surprising specificity. Examples are members of the rab family of small GTPases (1Starr C.J. Kappler J.A. Chan D.K. Kollmar R. Hudspeth A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schupbach T. Stein D. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many genes functioning in the ER are coexpressed during Xenopus development and form a synexpression group. Thus far 38 member genes have been described (supplemental Table 1), and examples are α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the ER translocation protein sec61, signal recognition particle, protein-disulfide isomerase, and the KDEL receptor required for ER retention. These genes are coexpressed in a characteristic pattern encompassing organs with high secretory activity. The ER synexpression group also contains genes without known function, and their synexpression predicts that they are involved in protein secretion as well (10Gawantka V. Pollet N. Delius H.

Balch W.E. Traffic. 2001; 2: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One of the growth factor cascades, which is regulated at the level of secretory protein traffic is the Wnt/β-catenin cascade, where the ER chaperones Mesd and Shisa regulate folding and transport to the cell surface of the Wnt receptors LRP5/6 and Frizzled 7/8, respectively (5Hsieh J.C.

Likewise, we have shown that LRP6 is negatively controlled by regulated endocytosis via its antagonist Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) and the Dkk1 coreceptor Kremen2 (Krm2), a single transmembrane-spanning protein. Dkk1, LRP6, and Krm2 form a ternary complex, which is rapidly endocytosed, leading to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (15Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B. Delius H. Hoppe D.

To gain a deeper insight into the regulation of Dkk1 mediated Wnt inhibition we aimed to identify binding partners of Krm2. In this study we describe a novel protein, Erlectin, which contains mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domains and interacts with Krm2. Proteins containing MRH domains are implicated in N-glycan recognition. In addition to the cation-dependent and- independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors there are four genes in the human genome sharing this domain (18Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R499-R501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Three of these MRH domain genes have been studied, the glucosidase II β-subunit, OS-9, and the γ-subunit of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase (GNPTAG). The β-subunit of glucosidase II is the non-catalytic subunit of a dimeric ER-resident enzyme involved in the processing of N-glycans on nascent proteins (19D'Alessio C. Fernandez F. Trombetta E.S.

It is a luminal ER-resident protein and member of the ER synexpression group in Xenopus embryos. Erlectin binds Krm2 via N-linked glycans and affects its transport to the plasma membrane. Morpholino knock down of Erlectin in Xenopus embryos leads to head and axial defects during organogenesis stages. The results suggest that Erlectin regulates glycoprotein traffic and is required for late head and axial development. Erlectin Sequences and Homologies—The following sequences of Erlectin were obtained from databases: human (NM_015701, GeneID: 27248), mouse (NM_025745), chicken (XM_419295), Danio rerio (BC044498), Xenopus tropicalis (AAH67973), Ciona intestinalis (AK114497), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (XP_784270), and Drosophila melanogaster (NM_135693). The two Xenopus laevis alleles are BC074469 (allele1) and CB558691 (allele2). CB558691 is a partial sequence of contig XGI TC228200. Expression Constructs—Human erlectin cDNA was obtained from RZPD (IMAGE ID 3447840). Tagged erlectin constructs were generated by inserting erlectin into pCS-based vectors containing N-terminal FLAG and V5 epitopes after the signal peptide of mouse krm2 or by using the endogenous signal peptide in a pCS vector providing a C-terminal HA tag. Erlectin point mutation (G379S) and PRKCSH domain deletions were prepared by PCR directed mutagenesis: (ΔD1, ΔS111-N180; ΔD2, ΔS342-G418; ΔD1/D2, ΔS111-N180, ΔS342-G418). pCS-V5-mdkk3 was constructed like pCS-V5-erlectin. pCS-myc-mkrm2 was generated by insertion of mkrm2 into a vector containing an N-terminal myc-tag. pCS-flag-mkrm2ΔTMC was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Other expression constructs used were as described (15Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C.

Large Scale Purification of the myc-Krm2 Protein Complex—HEK293 cells stably expressing myc-mKrm2 and flag-LRP6 were generated by transfection with pCI-Neo (Promega), pCS-myc-mkrm2, and pCS-flag-LRP6. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml neomycin, and selected clones were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. HEK293 cells expressing only flag-LRP6 were constructed similarly. Cells harvested from 50 15-cm plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended on ice in 15 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 7.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet/25 ml (Roche Diagnostics)), and dounced. A postnuclear cell lysate was subjected to a second clarifying spin (1 h, 100,000 × g). The resulting membrane pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40 buffer) for 1 h on ice. Following a clarifying spin, the supernatant was incubated under gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C with anti-myc IgG, precoupled to anti-mouse IgG-agarose. After four washing steps at 4 °C with Nonidet P-40 buffer, the protein complex was eluted from beads with myc peptide (0.5 mg/ml) in 150 mm ammonium carbonate, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and the eluate was concentrated by evaporation in vacuum. The protein complex was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Protein identification was performed by LC-MS/MS as described (35Schirle M. Heurtier M.A. Kuster B. Mol. Cell.

In Vitro Binding Assays, Endoglycosidase H/N-Glycosidase F Treatment, and Cell Surface Biotinylation—Recombinant proteins used for binding assay experiments were produced as conditioned media by transient transfection of HEK293T cells with pCS-V5-erlectin,pCS-flag-erlectin or relevant mutants thereof, pCS-V5-mdkk3, pCS-Xdkk1-AP, pCS-flag-mkrm2ΔTMC, pCS-mkrm2ΔTMC-V5, and pCS-myc-LRP6ΔTMC in serum-free medium (Optimem I, Invitrogen). Media were concentrated ∼50-fold using Centricon Plus-20 filters (Millipore). Protein production and integrity were controlled by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For in vitro CoIPs, equal amounts of V5-tagged proteins were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and incubated with anti-V5 antibody beads (Sigma) under gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C. The IPs were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and then incubated for 5 h with FLAG-tagged or myc-tagged proteins, or Dkk1-AP, respectively. CoIPs were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For CoIPs with cell lysates, HEK293T cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 5 μg of pCS2-V5-LRP6, pCS2-mKrm2-V5, pCS2-ΔKR-V5, pCS2-ΔWSC-V5, pCS2-ΔCUB-V5 and empty vector pCS2 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 48 h cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer, containing 0.8% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 for 1 h on ice. Following a clarifying spin (30 min, 226,000 × g) detergent extracts were subjected to IP with anti-V5 antibody beads (Sigma), washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and incubated with recombinant Flag-Erlectin for 5 h. CoIPs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For deglycosylation of Krm2, cell lysates from Krm2-transfected cells were subjected to Endo H (Roche Diagnostics) treatment (0.3 units/ml) in 100 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5, or N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) treatment (62 units/ml) for 40 min at 37 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the deglycosylation experiment followed by in vitro CoIP, recombinant Krm2ΔTMC-V5 was treated with 62 units/ml N-glycosidase F for 1 h at 37°C, resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and subjected to IP with anti-V5 antibody beads overnight at 4 °C. IPs were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, incubated with recombinant Flag-Erlectin for 5 h, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cell surface biotinylation was carried out on HEK293T cells transfected in a 12-well plate with 5 ng of pCS2-mkrm2-V5, 2.5 ng of pCS2-GFP and 200 ng of pCS2-flag-erlectin using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer. Cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer, containing 0.8% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, and Krm2-V5 was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As control for cell surface biotinylation, cells were transfected with 50 ng of pCS2-V5-nme1 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, (36Bosnar M.H. De Gunzburg J. Bago R. Brecevic L. Weber I. Pavelic J.

Antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA (Roche), anti-GFP (Chemikon), and anti-myc 9E10 (M. Eilers). Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were transfected with 200 ng of pCS2-erlectin-HA and 100 ng of EYFP-ER (Clontech). 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to immunostaining. Erlectin-HA was detected with rat anti-HA antibody and cy3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (Dianova). The trans-Golgi network and endosomes were stained with mouse anti-TGN38- and anti-EEA1-antibody, respectively (BD Bioscience), followed by cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dianova). Fractination of Cultured Cells and Protease Protection Assay—The microsomal fraction was isolated from HEK293T cells after transfection of erlectin-HA using an ER isolation kit protocol (Sigma, ER0100). Aliquots were pretreated ±1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice, then incubated ±250 μg/ml Proteinase K (Gerbu), for 1 h on ice. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antibodies used were mouse anti-calnexin antibody (BD Biosciences) and mouse anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma, B512). Embryos, in Situ Hybridization, and RT-PCR—In vitro fertilization, embryo culture, staging, whole-mount in situ hybridization, and micro-injection were carried out as described (37Gawantka V.

Primers used for RT-PCR of erlectin were 5′-TGAAGGAGAAGTTCTCCAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTTGCACTTTAGTTTCACTATC-3′ (reverse) for allele1 and 5′-TGAAAGAGAAGTTCTCCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTTGCACTTTAATTTCACAACG-3′ (reverse) for allele2. Morpholino Injections and Histology—Morpholino (MO) antisense oligonucleotides with the following sequences were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC: MO1, 5′-GAGAATGTGCAGGAGTTACCGGTTA-3′, MO2, 5′-AGAGAATGCGCAGGAGCGACAGGTT-3′, and a MO standard control oligonucleotide designed by Gene Tools. Unless indicated otherwise, embryos were injected at 4 cell stage four times into the marginal zone. For histological analysis 10-μm sections of paraffin-embedded embryos were cut and stained with Mayer's hemalaun/eosin following standard procedures. Erlectin Is a Novel MRH Domain Protein and Specifically Interacts with Krm2—To identify binding partners of Krm2 we employed a proteomic approach. We generated a HEK293 cell line stably expressing mouse Krm2 and LRP6 and performed a large scale affinity purification of the Krm2 protein complex from cellular membrane lysates. The purified protein complex was separated by SDS-PAGE, and individual bands were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). As control for background binding we performed a similar purification from HEK293 cells expressing only LRP6. One of the proteins found in two independent Krm2 purifications but not in the LRP6 control purification was a novel protein we termed Erlectin (for ER lectin, see below; other GenBank designations are XTP3-B, C2orf30, CL25084). We identified seven independent peptides that all matched this protein (Fig. 1A). The open reading frame of erlectin consists of 483 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kDa. Data base searches revealed homologues of erlectin in deuterostomes (chordates, echinoderms) and protostomes including Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1B). Erlectin is member of the MRH domain protein family. It contains a signal peptide and two MRH domains (Fig. 1C). To confirm the physical association of Erlectin with Krm2 we carried out in vitro binding studies of recombinant Erlectin and Krm2ΔTMC, a soluble form of Krm2 lacking the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal tail (15Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). As control protein we used recombinant Dkk3, which unlike Dkk1 does not bind to Krm2 (15Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were produced as conditioned medium from cells individually overexpressing secreted forms of the proteins. Under the conditions tested Erlectin specifically binds to Krm2ΔTMC (Fig. 2A, lane 1) but not to Dkk3 (lane 2). Also in the reverse CoIP, Krm2ΔTMC is precipitated by Erlectin (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Krm2 forms a ternary complex with Dkk1 and LRP6 that triggers internalization of LRP6 (15Mao B. Wu W. Davidson G. Marhold J. Li M. Mechler B. Delius H. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Walter C. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2002; 417: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Erlectin also interacts with LRP6. LRP6ΔTMC, a soluble form of LRP6 consisting of the extracellular domain of the protein, does not bind to Erlectin (Fig. 2C, lane 1). As shown previously (38Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), LRP6ΔTMC also does not interact with Dkk3 (Fig. 2C, lane 2). In addition, Erlectin neither binds full-length LRP6 nor Dkk1 (supplemental Fig. 1). In summary, Erlectin specifically interacts with the Dkk1 coreceptor Krm2. The transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domain of Krm2 are not required for this interaction. The MRH Domain 2 of Erlectin Mediates Binding to Krm2—We performed in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins to test the requirement of the two Erlectin MRH domains for Krm2 binding. Deletion within the MRH domain 2 but not 1 impairs the binding of Erlectin to Krm2 (Fig. 3). Because a point mutation (G106S) in the MRH domain of GNPTAG (see Fig. 1C, arrow) leads to the lysosomal storage disease mucolipidosis type III in humans (28Raas-Rothschild A. Bargal R. Goldman O. Ben-Asher E. Groener J.E. Toutain A. Stemmer E. Ben-Neriah Z. Flusser H. Beemer F.A. Penttinen M. Olender T. Rein A.J. Bach G. Zeigler M. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we also tested the homologous mutation of Erlectin in the MRH domain 2. Interestingly, this mutation abolishes binding of Erlectin to Krm2 (Fig. 3, lane 5). The Krm2 Kringle Domain and N-Glycans Are Required for Interaction with Erlectin—Krm2 contains an extracellular kringle-, WSC-, and CUB-domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4A). To determine which domain interacts with Erlectin, we analyzed Krm2 deletion constructs for their ability to bind Erlectin in CoIP. While deletion of the WSC-as well as the CUB-domain does not influence binding to Erlectin (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5), deletion of the kringle domain strongly impairs this interaction (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Thus, the interaction of Krm2 with Erlectin is mediated by the kringle domain. Because MRH domains are implicated in N-glycan recognition, we analyzed whether binding of Erlectin to Krm2ΔTMC is glycan-dependent. When Krm2ΔTMC is subjected to deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F, a shift in apparent molecular weight is observed, indicating that Krm2ΔTMC is indeed N-glycosylated. Furthermore, deglycosylated Krm2ΔTMC fails to bind Erlectin in vitro (Fig. 4C, lane 2). These results suggest that Erlectin recognizes and binds to oligosaccharides linked to the kringle domain of Krm2. Consistent with this, the Krm2 kringle domain contains one potential N-glycosylation site (N48 in mouse, N55 in X. laevis). Erlectin Is a Member of the Endoplasmic Reticulum Synexpression Group in Xenopus—We studied the expression pattern of erlectin during Xenopus development by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Two alleles are present in X. laevis showing 82% identity in their open reading frames. We therefore designed PCR primer pairs as well as in situ probes specific for each allele. RT-PCR analysis shows no difference in the expression pattern of both alleles. Likewise, in situ hybridization indicates a comparable expression pattern of both alleles. RT-PCR analysis shows that erlectin is expressed maternally. Levels of mRNA decrease during gastrulation (stages 10.5-13) and are then increasingly up-regulated during neurulation (stages 17-21) and tailbud stages (Fig. 5A). By whole mount in situ hybridization, erlectin expression is observed in the animal hemisphere of blastula stage embryos (Fig. 5C). During neurula stages expression is seen in the notochord (Fig. 5E). At late neurula stage strong expression is also detected in the anlagen for cement gland and hatching gland and is very similar to the expression of XAG, a marker for this tissues (39Sive H. Hattori K. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, F and G). In tailbud embryos erlectin expression occurs in otic vesicle and pronephros and continues in cement and hatching gland (Fig. 5I). A weak ubiquitous expression of erlectin is observed at all stages. This expression is highly reminiscent of the expression pattern of the ER synexpression group (11Niehrs C. Pollet N. Nature. 1999; 402: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), of which the KDEL receptor is one example (Fig. 5H). We conclude that erlectin is a member of the ER synexpression group, which strongly suggests that the protein plays a role in secretory protein traffic. Erlectin Is a Luminal Protein of the Endoplasmic Reticulum—To further corroborate an involvement of Erlectin in ER function, we studied its subcellular distribution in cultured cells. When expressed in HeLa cells, Erlectin colocalizes with the ER marker EYFP-ER (Fig. 6, A-A″) and with the luminal ER protein calnexin (data not shown). In contrast, the localization of Erlectin-HA does not overlap with that of the trans-Golgi network marker TGN38 (40Ponnambalam S. Rabouille C. Luzio J.P. Nilsson T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 253-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, B-B″), nor with the endosome marker EEA1 (41Wilson J.M. de Hoop M. Zorzi N. Toh B.H. Dotti C.G. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, C-C ″). To further clarify the membrane topology of Erlectin, we performed a protease protection assay with membranes prepared from transfected HEK293T cells. We compared the protease accessibility of the luminal domain of the ER chaperone calnexin (42Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy Jr., R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Erlectin. Erlectin is protease-resistant in the absence of non-ionic detergent as was calnexin, whereas both are degraded in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 6D). The change of the gel migrat"

However, there is no complete understanding of the molecular events underlying these changes. It is likely that epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that are involved in chromatin dynamics and structure are also involved in the nuclear events described. In this report we have shown that apoptosis is associated with global DNA hypomethylation and histone deacetylation events in leukemia cells.

These findings provide one of the first links between apoptotic nuclear events and epigenetic markers. Apoptosis is a form of cell death essential for the morphogenesis, development, differentiation, and homeostasis of eukaryotic multicellular organisms. The activation of a genetically controlled cell death program leading to apoptosis results in characteristic biochemical and morphological features that take place both outside and inside the nucleus (1Lawen A. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 888-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms responsible for key nuclear events, such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and release of nuclear proteins, although commonly used as markers for apoptosis, are not fully understood (2Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tazzari P.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 634-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The regulated nature of apoptosis makes it likely that nuclear changes experienced by apoptotic cells are mediated by epigenetic markers. This epigenetic information is basically stored as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications. These two groups of modifications play an active role in organizing, compartmentalizing, and regulating genetic information encoded in DNA by defining nuclear architecture, and gene expression (3Khorasanizadeh S. Cell. 2004; 116: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). With regard to gene regulation, the major functional consequence of DNA methylation is the repression of transcription (4Cedar H. Cell. 1988; 53: 3-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In the case of histone modifications, the type of modification (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, etc.) and the specific amino acid residue that is modified determine the functional effect. Histone modifications also determine the nature of chromatin regions, such as heterochromatin. For example, the inactive X chromosome is characterized by trimethylation of Lys-27 of H3 and dimethylation of Lys-9 of H3 (5Plath K. Fang J. Mlynarczyk-Evans S.K. Cao R. Worringer K.A.

Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In the context of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation have been associated with changes in histone modifications (10Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2001; 412: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For instance, apoptotic phosphorylation of histone H2A, H2B, and H3, dephosphorylation of histone H1, and H2A deubiquitylation (12Waring P. Khan T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Lee E. Nakatsuma A. Hiraoka R. Ishikawa E. Enomoto R. Yamauchi A.

These results suggest that a conformational change in chromatin structure is needed prior to condensation, although the mechanism and functional significance remain unclear. A global decrease in histone acetylation in apoptosis has also been reported (17Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Alberti I. Barboro P. Sanna P. Melchiori A. Parodi S. Balbi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10817-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Wojciechowski J. Horky M. Gueorguieva M. Wesierska-Gadek J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), although some authors have interpreted this result to be a loss of hyperacetylated histones by degradation rather than the consequence of the active hypoacetylation of histones during apoptosis (19Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24470-24478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a need to clarify the role of these modifications in different nuclear events during apoptosis. Regarding apoptotic release of histones and other nuclear proteins, it has been proposed that this process is associated with chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (20Wu D. Ingram A. Lahti J.H. Mazza B. Grenet J. Kapoor A. Liu L. Kidd V.J. Tang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). Histone release may not merely be a simple by-product of chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation and could be the result of specific chromatin modifications in particular nuclear compartments. In fact, during apoptosis a series of nuclear matrices and membrane proteins that are fundamental to the maintenance of internal nuclear structures are degraded by caspases (22Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 23: 7-22Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Rao L. Perez D. White E. J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 45-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, degradation of nuclear lamins, which maintain nuclear structure by attaching chromatin to the nuclear membrane through heterochromatic structures (25Pyrpasopoulou A. Meier J. Maison C. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7108-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Makatsori D. Kourmouli N. Polioudaki H. Shultz L.D. McLean K. Theodoropoulos P.A. Singh P.B. Georgatos S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25567-25573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), coincides with chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. Although the breakdown of internal nuclear structures is a prerequisite for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (27Krystosek A. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 265-276Google Scholar, 28Robertson J.D. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the maintenance of high order chromatin structures is essential for proper chromatin condensation (29Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In fact, drugs that modify chromatin structure are able to block apoptotic chromatin condensation (30Johnson C.A. Padget K. Austin C.A. Turner B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4539-4542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this report, we have focused our attention on the global characterization of histone modification and DNA methylation changes associated with the apoptotic process, in particular in connection with the release of nuclear material to the cytosol. Significant global deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 associated with its release during apoptosis has been observed. Most interestingly, we have identified a unique pattern of post-translational modifications that is characteristic of histones released early on in apoptosis. Released histone H4 is specifically hypoacetylated and trimethylated at Lys-20, whereas released histone H3 is hypoacetylated, demethylated, and dephosphorylated. These histones are released and cofractionate with internucleosomally fragmented DNA with a greater 5-methylcytosine content than the DNA that remains in the nucleus. This released DNA originates in the heterochromatic perinuclear region of the cell. These data, together with the observed pattern of modification of released histones, suggest that the released material results from the degradation of perinuclear heterochromatin and internal structures of the nucleus early on in apoptosis. Materials—Jurkat and HL60 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used: anti-histone H3 (Abcam) directed against a C-terminal peptide of H3, anti-dimethyl Lys-4 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-dimethyl Lys-9 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-phospho Ser-10 histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-acetyl histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-acetyl Lys-9 histone H3 (Abcam), anti-acetyl histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), anti-acetyl Lys-5 histone H4 (Abcam), anti-acetyl Lys-8 histone H4 (Abcam), anti-acetyl Lys-12 histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), and anti-acetyl Lys-16 histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Camptothecin and etoposide (Sigma) were used as apoptosis inducers. Apoptosis was analyzed using the Vybrant® apoptosis assay kit, 4-YO-PRO®-1/propidium iodide (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). This kit is based on the use of the green fluorescent YO-PRO®-1 dye that specifically stains apoptotic cells that remain impermeant to propidium iodide (a dead cell stain). Live cells are not stained with YO-PRO®-1. Cells are then sorted by flow cytofluorometry. Induction of Apoptosis—Jurkat and HL60 cells were exposed to 100 μm etoposide or 2 μg/ml of camptothecin and incubated for 3–8 h (30Johnson C.A. Padget K. Austin C.A. Turner B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4539-4542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry. Isolation of Histones—Histones were extracted from cell pellets by acid extraction on 0.25 m HCl followed by acetone precipitation (31Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). To investigate the release of histone to the cytosolic fraction during apoptosis, we performed hypotonic lysis with 20 mm pH 8.0 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 as described in Wu et al. (20Wu D. Ingram A. Lahti J.H. Mazza B. Grenet J. Kapoor A. Liu L. Kidd V.J. Tang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two fractions are obtained in this case: a cell lysate, containing the cytosolic fraction, and a nuclear pellet. In this case, the supernatant corresponding to the cytosolic fraction was precipitated using 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and washed once with acetone. Histones were then obtained by acid extraction as described above. Quantification of Global Histone Acetylation by High-performance Capillary Electrophoresis—The degree of histone acetylation was quantified by a modification of a previously described method (32Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Lund G. Andersson L. Lauria M. Lindholm M. Fraga M.F.

Individual histones were fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 4The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HPCE, high-performance capillary electrophoresis; MS, mass spectrometry; mC, methylcytosine. on a Delta-Pak C18 column (Waters) eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (20–60%) in 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (34Ballestar E. Abad C. Franco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 271: 18817-18824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using a Beckman HPLC gradient system. Purity of histones was measured by PAGE. The non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated histone derivatives of H3 fraction were resolved by high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE). A non-coated fused silica capillary (Beckman-Coulter) (60.2 cm × 75.0 mm, effective length 50.0 cm) was used in a CE system (P/ACETM MDQ; Beckman-Coulter) connected to a data processing station (32 Karat™ Software). The running buffer was 110 mm phosphate buffer, pH 2.0, containing 0.03% (w/v) hydroxylpropylmethyl-cellulose. Running conditions consisted of a temperature of 25 °C and an operating voltage of 12 kV. On-column absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Before each run, the capillary system was conditioned by washing with 0.1 m NaOH for 3 min and 0.5 m H2SO4 for 2 min and equilibrated with the running buffer for 3 min. Samples were injected under pressure (0.3 psi) for 3 s. Samples were obtained in triplicate, and all samples were analyzed in duplicate. Error bars in graphs represent standard deviation. Western Blotting—Histones were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane of 22-μm pore size (Immobilon PSQ; Millipore). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) and immunoprobed with antibodies raised against different peptides containing different histone modifications as described above. The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) (Amersham Biosciences) and sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:3000). Bands obtained in Western blot were scanned and analyzed by Quantity One software (Gel Doc 2000; Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Semiquantitative significance of the differences was estimated by direct comparison of the obtained values. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Histones—Histone H4 global acetylation and acetylation at the specific lysine 16 site were analyzed by mass spectrometry. We separated acid-extracted histones by SDS-PAGE, excised the Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to histone H4, subjected them to acetylation with D6-acetic anhydride, and finally digested with trypsin as previously described (35Bonaldi T. Regula J.T. Imhof A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 377: 111-130Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected, vacuum-dried, and redissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS analysis of the samples was carried out in a mass spectrometer Autoflex (Bruker Daltonics) in a positive ion reflector mode. Samples were added to a matrix consisting of 0.5 ml of 5 mg/ml of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in water:acetonitrile (2:1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The ion acceleration voltage was 20 kV. Each spectrum was internally calibrated with the masses of two trypsin autolysis products. MS/MS analyses were performed in a linear LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a nano-electrospray ionization source by using coated GlassTip PicoTip emitters (New Objective). Samples were desalted and concentrated with Zip Tips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The spectrometer was operated according to the manufacturer's instructions with manual adjustment of the collision energies. Fragment spectra were interpreted manually. Global 5-Methylcytosine Quantification—The 5-methylcytosine (mC) content was quantified by HPCE as previously described (36Fraga M.F. Esteller M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 632-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In brief, DNA samples were speed-back preconcentrated to 0.1 mg/ml and enzymatically hydrolyzed in a final volume of 5 ml. Samples were then directly injected into a Beckman MDQ high-performance capillary electrophoresis apparatus, and mC content was determined as the percentage of mC of total cytosine: mC peak area × 100/(C peak area + mC peak area). Error bars in graphs represent standard deviation. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Competitive Hybridization of Apoptotic DNA Fractions in Metaphase Chromosomes—To study the distribution along the chromosomes of the DNA isolated from nuclear pellet and cell lysate fractions, we modified the competitive genomic hybridization strategy (37Cigudosa J.C. Rao P.H. Calasanz M.J. Odero M.D. Michaeli J. Jhanwar S.C. Chaganti R.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 3007-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this hybridization, we compared the DNA isolated from each of the fractions (either the cell lysate or the nuclear pellet) with the DNA isolated from intact cells. The DNA isolated from each of the fractions was labeled with Spectrum Red dUTP by CGH nick-translation kit (Vysis, Inc., Downer Grov, IL), and the total genomic DNA was labeled with Spectrum Green. The metaphases were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60) equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics Sensys camera) and then analyzed using the chromofluor image analysis system (Cytovision; Applied Imaging Ltd, Newcastle, UK). 13–25 chromosomes were analyzed for each hybridization. Staining with Fluorescent DNA Probes and Fluorescence Microscopy— Control cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature or methanol (-20 °C) for 1 min and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline-0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature as previously described (38Espada J. Ballestar E. Fraga M.F. Villar-Garea A. Juarranz A. Stockert J.C. Robertson K.D. Fuks F. Esteller M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37175-37184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). DNA from the cell lysate fraction labeled with Spectrum Red was used to hybridize fixed cells. Confocal optical sections were obtained using a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GMbH) equipped with krypton and argon lasers, and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Global Reduction in Histone Acetylation Occurs during Apoptosis— As a first screening approach to investigating a potential connection between epigenetic alterations and nuclear changes in apoptosis, we analyzed global changes in the modification status of histones during apoptosis by Western blot. A change in the pattern of histone modifications could be associated with morphological changes that occur in the nucleus in apoptosis. We treated Jurkat cells with etoposide and acid extracted their histones at different times. For each sample, the level of apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A, bottom). Antibodies against the global hyperacetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 and others against the monoacetylated form at specific residues of histone H3 (Lys-9) and histone H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16) were used. Antibodies against other modifications, such as phospho-Ser-10, dimethyl-Lys-4 and dimethyl-Lys-9 of histone H3, were also included. We first observed a significant decrease in global levels of histone H4 acetylation in apoptotic samples (Fig. 1A). However, when looking at specific lysine residues of H4 only Lys-8 and Lys-16 exhibited a loss of acetylation during apoptosis. No significant variations of acetylation were observed at Lys-5 and Lys-12. These results are consistent with previous reports that also suggest that the acetylation patterns of the pairs Lys-8 and Lys-16, on one hand, and Lys-5 and Lys-12, on the other, are coupled (39Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 38: 269-272Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In contrast to H4, no significant changes in acetylation (either global or site-specific) were observed for histone H3. Also, phosphorylation of Ser-10 and methylation of Lys-4 and Lys-9 of H3 appeared to remain stable (Fig. 1A). Because the only changes observed were associated with acetylation status, an alternative quantitative approach was used to estimate changes in histone acetylation of H3 and H4. The method requires the fractionation of histones by reversed phase HPLC followed by HPCE separation (35Bonaldi T. Regula J.T. Imhof A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 377: 111-130Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Fraga M.F. Esteller M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 632-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 37Cigudosa J.C. Rao P.H. Calasanz M.J. Odero M.D. Michaeli J. Jhanwar S.C. Chaganti R.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 3007-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This allows the resolution and quantification of all acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4. In this analysis, for histone H4 each of the non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated histone derivatives appeared as a doublet of peaks (Fig. 1B, top panel). The first and second peaks of the doublet had been previously identified as di- and trimethyl-Lys-20 histone H4, respectively (40Fraga M.F. Ballestar E. Villar-Garea A. Boix-Chornet M. Espada J. Schotta G. Bonaldi T. Haydon C. Petrie K. Ropero S. Perez-Rosado A. Calvo E. Lopez J.A. Cano A. Piris M.A. Ahn N. Imhof A. Caldas C. Jenuwein T. Esteller M. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Trimethylation of Lys-20 in H4 is a marker of constitutive heterochromatin (9Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, relative losses of about 8 and 4% in the acetylated species of H4 were observed concomitantly with equivalent increases in non-acetylated forms for the etoposide (70% apoptosis after 8 h) and camptothecin (56% apoptosis after 8 h) treatments, respectively. The results obtained for HL60 cells also showed relative losses of 10 and 5% of acetylated H4 for the etoposide (78% apoptosis after 8 h) and camptothecin (60% after 8 h) treatments, respectively (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). In the case of histone H3, treatment of HL60 cells with etoposide and camptothecin resulted in respective relative losses of 5 and 3% of acetylated forms (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). These decreases were concomitant with an increase in the non-acetylated form of H3. Identical results were obtained with Jurkat cells (data not shown). These small decreases had not been observed when using Western blot to detect changes in the acetylation status of H3, although the HPCE analysis indicated that this is a very reproducible result. On the other hand, it is possible that the acetyl-H3 antibody does not detect all acetylated forms (mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-) that are quantified by HPCE. At any rate, the decrease in acetylation of H3 was significantly smaller than the variations observed for H4. Histone H4 Released from Nuclei Early in Apoptosis Is Hypoacetylated and Trimethylated—Having analyzed the global changes in histone H3 and H4 modifications, we next compared the specific modifications exhibited by histones that are massively released from the nucleus during apoptosis (23Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) with those that are retained. Thus, we induced apoptosis with etoposide and camptothecin and treated the cells with a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, in which cells are lysed but the integrity of nucleus is preserved (20Wu D. Ingram A. Lahti J.H. Mazza B. Grenet J. Kapoor A. Liu L. Kidd V.J. Tang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Shelton E.R. Wassarman P.M. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 225: 771-782Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), it is possible to separate histones released to the cytosol in apoptosis from those remaining in the chromatin. Therefore, each sample yielded two fractions that we call cell lysate, corresponding to the cytosolic fraction and nuclear pellet (Fig. 2). Histones were virtually absent from the cell lysate of uninduced control samples (Fig. 3A). In apoptotic samples, we observed a time-dependent increase of histones in the cell lysates, which were in fact released from the nucleus during apoptosis. The amount of histones reached about a quarter of that remaining in the pelleted fraction 8 h after inducing apoptosis (Fig. 3A). The analysis of H4 by HPCE showed that histones retained in the nuclear pellet did not exhibit significant differences between control and apoptotic samples (Fig. 3B), unlike the results obtained when total histone H4 had been analyzed where there were 5–10% decreases in acetylated histone H4 (Fig. 1B). However, a comparison of cell lysates with their corresponding nuclear pellets showed striking differences in the modification pattern of histone H4. Histone H4 isolated from cell lysates was found to be consistently hypoacetylated compared with its counterpart in apoptotic nuclear pellets, with an up to 15% relative decrease in the acetylated form of histone H4 during early apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, differences in H4 acetylation between released and retained histone H4 became smaller at longer incubation times. Thus, shortly after apoptosis was induced, released histone H4 was enriched in hypoacetylated forms and the proportion of acetylated forms increased as apoptosis advanced, and the released histones more closely resembled those retained in the nuclear pellet. However, the most striking finding about histone H4 modification profiles was that released and retained H4 fractions exhibited different patterns of methylation. Most specifically, the characteristic doublets corresponding to different methylation forms of histone H4 were absent from both fractions, and whereas the cell lysate exhibited only the trimethylated form of histone H4, the nuclear pellet only contained the dimethylated form for short times after apoptosis induction (Fig. 3C). This is evident from the comparison of the electropherograms of these two samples, where each of the single peaks that corresponds to the di- and trimethylated forms of H4 had been fractionated during the isolation of the released histones (Fig. 3C). These data indicated that 3 h after apoptosis induction, almost 100% of histone H4 was trimethylated in the cell lysate (Fig. 3, D and E). This specific release of trimethylated H4 was progressively lost as apoptosis advanced. Indeed, after 6 and 8 h of incubation the relative trimethylation of released histone H4 dropped to 50 and 25%, respectively,"
https://openalex.org/W1991883683,"Follicular thyroid tumors are often aneuploid. It was advanced that chromosomal instability is closely associated to RAS mutations, but such association remains unproven. H-RAS can be alternatively spliced in two different proteins, p21 and p19, the former being the active protein. In order to investigate the relationship between RAS mutational status and ploidy in thyroid tumors, we analysed RAS genes in a series of 99 follicular lesions (14 nodular goiters, 70 follicular adenomas and 15 follicular carcinomas), eight thyroid carcinoma cell lines and a control group of 102 blood donors, correlating the presence of RAS mutations with the ploidy of the tumors and evaluating the two spliced forms of H-RAS. Overall, 20% of the follicular tumors harbored RAS mutations and 62% of the patients with follicular tumors (and 51% of blood donors) harbored the H-RAS 81T --> C polymorphism. The presence of RAS mutations was not associated with aneuploidy. The H-RAS polymorphism did not seem to confer a higher propensity for neoplastic transformation as it was also found in hyperplastic lesions, but was strongly associated with aneuploidy (P<0.0001). The presence of the H-RAS 81T --> C polymorphism was associated with significantly higher amounts of total H-RAS mRNA expression, higher amounts of p21 isoform and a higher fraction of neoplastic cells in S phase. Our results suggest that the H-RAS 81T --> C polymorphism may induce aneuploidy through overexpression of the active p21 isoform of H-RAS."

https://openalex.org/W2156262955,"After spending more than 55 years doing research and 45 years teaching a graduate course in physical biochemistry with the last 5 years spent attempting to teach ethics in a required course on Responsible Conduct of Research, I had wondered about what to write in response to Herb Tabor's kind invitation and urging to submit an article on “Reflections.” Tempting as it is to write about my love affairs with the ultracentrifuge, tobacco mosaic virus, nucleic acids, ribosomes, and a host of proteins including aspartate transcarbamoylase in particular (1Schachman H.K. Still looking for the ivory tower.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), I decided instead to look back at the way science was done at the start of my career and how our research environment and academia, in particular, have changed in the past half-century. In doing so, I offer apologies at the outset. This account cannot be construed as “history.” Instead it offers personal recollections, biases, impressions, and evaluations, frequently without documentation. Indeed many of the papers and historical records that I would cite are not readily available. Regrettably from my point of view, Stanley Hall, my home on the Berkeley Campus for 50 years, was demolished several years ago to be replaced by a much larger laboratory, and this Reflections is being written in a temporary office.The following pages present my views on various topics such as how careers in science have changed, how federal funding of research in universities was initiated, and how politics interfered with the funding process. In addition, the peer review system is discussed along with the plight of dissatisfied applicants. Finally, I present my impression of the impact of federal funding on universities, the controversy over indirect costs, the burden of government regulations, the enduring struggle over fraud in science, and the major changes in the culture of academia and the commercialization of universities stemming from the Bayh-Dole Act. On many of these controversial issues I was personally involved both in advocating and opposing policies under consideration by government agencies. As President of the American Society of Biological Chemists (ASBC), now the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), and later as President of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) and Chair of the Public Affairs Committee of ASBMB, I traveled extensively to Bethesda and, in concert with other concerned biomedical researchers, helped to formulate positions that we hoped represented the working scientist's point of view. Moreover, I had the privilege of serving for 6 years as an advisor to the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Harold Varmus, and as its Ombudsman in the Basic Sciences. This part-time activity involved extensive visits to more than 45 universities and medical schools where I learned a great deal about the conduct of biomedical research and the problems encountered by investigators. To some extent, therefore, this Reflections, although not about my research, is indeed a personal memoir.Although a significant amount of material presented below is critical of government agencies and policies, university administrators, and actions of fellow scientists, I wish to emphasize that the triumphs of biochemistry in the past 60 years are almost impossible to encompass. Although biochemistry formerly was concentrated in medical schools and a few schools of agriculture, now university campuses throughout the country have thriving departments. Moreover biochemistry is “invading” chemistry and physics departments as well as engineering schools. Leadership in research is now in the hands of innumerable creative young people who have fallen in love with biochemistry and are largely responsible for the startling discoveries of the past half-century. The training of these scientists and the support of their research resulted from the magnificent contributions of those great institutions, NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Conducting scientific research today is dramatically different from what I and others of my age experienced, and the pace of discovery is much more rapid. Superb commercial instruments for numerous techniques are now available. In addition, innumerable reagents biochemists formerly prepared in their laboratories can now be purchased, thereby freeing investigators to perform imaginative experiments. New journals, numbering in the thousands, are available for publication of the findings. Who could have imagined that the Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC), which in 1945 had an Editorial Board of 12 members and published 365 articles comprising about 3600 pages, would 60 years later have 650 biochemists on the Editorial Board leading to the publication of about 5000 articles comprising 43,000 pages? And today's JBC pages are much larger than those in the 1950s. How did this come about? What factors led to such dramatic growth? How did little Biochemistry morph into Molecular Biology and Cell Biology, Big Science, and Big Business? How did academia change from “Publish or Perish” to “Patent and Prosper?” What may we expect for the next 60 years?Independence in Research Comes Later in CareersAs a newly minted Instructor in Biochemistry at Berkeley in 1948 just after receiving my Ph.D., I was acutely aware of the unpredictability and hazards of an academic career. My training as an undergraduate in chemical engineering at MIT followed by graduate school in physical chemistry at Princeton provided me with little knowledge of biochemistry, and there I was, by good luck, on the faculty of a biochemistry department. Accordingly, by auditing various courses, I slowly became familiar with metabolic pathways leading me to describe the auspicious position of Instructor as a “Hypothetical Unstable Intermediate.” Today, virtually no one is appointed as an Instructor. On the contrary, most individuals enter academia in science as Assistant Professors or even Associate Professors. Such appointments are made after they have spent several years, and often too many years, as postdoctoral fellows. It is now commonplace for young investigators to have two, or even three, different postdoctoral stints. As a consequence, researchers in the biomedical sciences do not become independent investigators until a significantly older age than was the case 40–60 years ago. Appointments to faculty positions at an older age coupled with the termination of mandatory retirement have resulted in numerous reports bemoaning the aging of the research community.I can recall joking 30 years ago that consideration of promotion of a biochemistry faculty member to tenure no longer involved reading their papers. The inability to comprehend the contents of the burgeoning literature resulted, according to folklore, in the practice of “weighing” the papers and, at a later time, of “counting” them. Finally, a rebellion occurred over the “quickies,” and academic departments began considering content again. However in the past 10 years, it appears that more consideration is focused on where an article was published rather than on what was published. Fortunately, leading academics responsible for this “need” to publish in Cell, Nature, Science, or the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) are now realizing that they have become captives of their own creation; papers in those journals are essential for winning prizes and for promotion of younger faculty members to tenure. Although there is still considerable “hype” by Editors of these prestigious journals in order to attract papers, resentment is now growing in the academic community about this emphasis on where to publish. Whether this change in the culture of academia will have an impact on young investigators and their decisions as to where to send their “hot” papers remains to be seen. In that regard, it is relevant to ask whether the almost limitless proliferation of journals will ever end. Professional societies justify publishing new specialized journals based on the growth of science, and private companies have found science reporting a profitable venture.Federal Support of ScienceFrom the perspective of today it is difficult for those whose careers began in the 1940s to recall how research was done before federal funds became commonplace. The birth of the NSF in 1950 was the outcome of the remarkable report (2Bush V. Science—the endless frontier.A Report to the President on a Program for Postwar Scientific Research. U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1945Crossref Google Scholar) by Vannevar Bush to the President of the United States on July 5, 1945. That insightful and visionary report, entitled “Science—The Endless Frontier,” should be required reading today for Members of the United States House of Representatives and the Senate as they are perilously close to reducing the budget of NIH for next year. The report of only 40 pages, plus the more detailed appendices by various subcommittees, has only 6 parts (or chapters). Individual sections are devoted to research aimed at understanding and eliminating disease, the benefits to public welfare from scientific research, the need for training future generations of scientists, the importance of openness in science and the “freedom of inquiry,” and finally the establishment of a government agency to foster and fund scientific research in universities. Basic scientific research and training in this country today stem directly from the Bush report, an outgrowth of his experience as head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) in supervising civilian scientific activities during World War II. The recognition of the invaluable contributions to the war effort made by the scientific community led to extensive deliberation of the potential role of government in the support of science in peacetime.Not only is the NSF the direct beneficiary as spelled out magnificently in the section termed “The Means to the End” but also, to a substantial extent, that “great invention,” NIH, from which most biochemists receive research support, owes its largesse to the spirit of the Bush Report in the part entitled “The War Against Disease.” However it should be noted that 5 years elapsed between the submission of the Bush Report and the establishment of the NSF. During that interval of debate and political bickering over the governance of the proposed agency (3Lomask M. A Minor Miracle: an Informal History of the National Science Foundation. National Science Foundation, Washington, D. C.1975Google Scholar), the medical community, many of whose members were not enthusiastic about biomedical research being centered in the new foundation, devoted efforts to steer more government funds to the Public Health Service and thereby to NIH. That activity led to the astonishing increase in NIH funding for extramural research from less than 1 million dollars in 1946 to about 4 million in 1947 (4Allen E.M. Early years of research grants.NIH Alumni Association Newsletter. 1980; 2: 6-8Google Scholar). Ever since, NIH has become the sponsor of most biomedical research and training. The role of NSF in supporting basic biological research is meager by comparison. Whereas there was substantial support for doubling the NIH budget recently, a similar effort to double the NSF budget has not been successful. Indeed Congress and the public have been extremely enthusiastic about increasing funding for research aimed at improving the health of the citizenry. Almost invariably over the past 60 years, the annual increases in NIH funding approved by Congress exceeded those proposed by the President. Some have attributed that to the personal interests of members of Congress in their own health. Whatever the motivation, funding of NIH has increased phenomenally, reaching the present staggering level of about $29 billion. But it should not come as a surprise that the “doubling” policy of funding from 1999 to 2003 was bound to end. The scientific community was hoping for “a soft landing” with increases of 7–9% annually as contrasted to the 15% increase during the doubling period. That soft landing has not materialized, and complaints are now widespread about the inadequacy of annual increases that do not even account for inflation.As can be readily gleaned from this brief history of federal funding, scientists of my generation did not spend much time writing grant applications as they launched their careers. In my first few years as a faculty member, I received funds kindly provided by Wendell Stanley who, as a Nobel Laureate, had grants from various private foundations. The first graduate student in my laboratory was supported by university funds. Several years after initiating my research in Berkeley, I received my first grant. Actually it was a contract, of about $7,000, from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) for research on tobacco mosaic virus and the ultracentrifuge. Administrators at ONR were enthusiastic about basic science and provided enormous freedom to investigators. After a few years, many of the staff at ONR moved to NSF, and I began receiving funding from NSF. That support continued for many years, culminating years later in an annual budget of about $70,000. In the early days of federal support, I had the narrow view that my laboratory was not doing biomedical research, and I didn't apply to NIH even though larger grants were readily available. My NSF grant was adequate for many years. Graduate students in the early 1950s were supported as teaching assistants or research assistants funded by small grants to faculty members or departmental funds. A typical laboratory would have one or two graduate students, a technician, and perhaps one postdoc, a far cry from the research group of today.Intrusion of Politics in Federal Support of ResearchAlthough most scientists were ecstatic about the Bush report and the concept of federal funding of research at universities, some expressed reservations; there was considerable apprehension about the possibility of political interference and curtailment of free inquiry. Indeed over the years, there have been periods, such as the 1950s, when NIH grants to individuals were terminated because of their presumed political activities. In 1953, while McCarthyism was rampant, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began screening grantees. Based on FBI reports, Oveta Culp Hobby, as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) in the Eisenhower administration, interceded and ordered the cancellation of grants to Linus Pauling and other prominent scientists. Protests were mounted both within NIH and in the extramural community. Some leading administrators at NIH were so appalled about the policy dictated by the Secretary that they suggested to some of the “debarred” investigators that they substitute a colleague's name as the Principal Investigator, in which case the grant would still be funded to the institution. About 4 years elapsed before the policy of screening grantees under the policy initiated by Secretary Hobby was essentially abandoned. During that period, William Consolazio, who headed the section on Molecular Biology at NSF and was one of the pioneers at both ONR and NSF, sent me an urgent request for a prompt review of an application from Pauling for funding his research previously supported by NIH. According to my recollection, I sent Consolazio two responses. One was a detailed review of the proposal along with a summary indicating that the proposed research was ground-breaking and would have a great impact on our understanding of protein structure. In addition, my formal evaluation included, “The principal investigator is a giant in the field of science and is eminently and uniquely qualified to perform the research that is outlined.” That was for the record. The second response was much more personal because I knew Consolazio well and served on his panel. It asked rhetorically, “Who am I to evaluate a research grant application from God?” For anyone interested in physical chemistry and its application to biological problems, Linus Pauling was God! Not only did NSF, through Consolazio's intervention, fund Pauling's grant application, but others who were cut off by NIH also received funds from NSF.There have been other episodes of political interference in the operation of the granting agencies, with the most serious threats occurring during the Nixon administration. Beginning in 1971, for example, the training grant function at NIH was taken away from the Institutes, the number of review committees was reduced drastically, appropriated funds were impounded, and plans to separate the National Cancer Institute from NIH were initiated. Finally, Robert Q. Marston, Director of NIH for 5 years, was summarily fired in 1973 for refusing to cooperate with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in cutting basic research programs. At that time the entire peer review process was in jeopardy. Other less serious assaults on the grant systems at NSF and NIH dealt mainly with appointments to high level positions, such as the Director of the NSF or advisory councils at NIH. Some grant applications have also been rejected because a political official thought that government should not support the type of research described in the proposal. One prominent former senator, William Proxmire, who crusaded against waste in government, periodically ridiculed granting agencies over grants whose titles he didn't like by publishing his list of “Golden Fleece Awards.” His complaints were often unwarranted. These interferences with peer review arose primarily in areas of social or political controversy such as sexual behavior, AIDS, reproduction science, or climate control. However by and large, granting agencies have managed to resist external political pressure, with the exception of the response to priorities in the appropriation process during times of budgetary constraints. Apprehensions expressed in the 1940s that funding of research by government would be swayed or dominated by politics have not materialized. Although actions in the past few years have caused concern about political interference jeopardizing the peer review process and interfering with the freedom of inquiry, the granting agencies have functioned magnificently.Unhappy and Dissatisfied Applicants—Peer ReviewThe success of the grant programs does not mean that applicants for grants were not complaining. On the contrary, over the past 40 years there have been many periods when the scientific community has been up in arms about the shortage of funds. Young investigators of today almost certainly will conclude that my description of experience on study sections of NSF and NIH in the 1950s and 1960s is apocryphal.As members of an NSF panel, we were obligated to read all of the applications being considered at a specific meeting even though some of them were outside our area of expertise. The reviews at home, in preparation for the meeting in Washington, required several weeks of intense study. Applications receiving ratings in the highest two grades (out of five) were generally funded. Many of the applications did not receive sufficiently high scores to warrant funding, and a significant number were actually disapproved. For me, as a young Assistant Professor, it was a humbling experience, reading superb applications and attending meetings with older panel members who were my heroes in science. I can recall being pleased to see that senior members on the panel were thorough in their review of the proposals as well as generous and fair in their criticisms. After about 4 years my term ended, and I was appointed to an NIH Study Section where I experienced a culture shock. When we were about to record our vote on a particularly bad proposal, one of the more experienced panel members sitting next to me asked how I was going to rate it. My response was, “Disapprove; it is terrible; the investigator will not learn anything interesting, and the research is not worth doing.” To which he responded, “On NIH panels we hardly ever disapprove grant applications.” At that time NIH was growing rapidly with budgets increasing substantially every year, and “disapproval” was devastating to young investigators. NIH staff justified requests for additional funds on the grounds that so many approved applications were unfunded because of insufficient funds. Quickly recognizing the differences in culture and funding between NSF and NIH, I indicated that I would rate the proposal so low (about 3.0) that the research would not be funded. But my colleague at the table quickly informed me that applications with a rating of 3.0 would be funded. Even many of those with a score of 4.0 were funded. In that one meeting, I learned how much easier it was to receive support from NIH than from NSF. That is still true today, but now applicants to NIH are experiencing major difficulties and even first class proposals receiving ratings of 1.5 or better are not being funded.Grievances about poor ratings are many, diverse and contradictory. They include “those young guys on the panel don't even know about my classical work”; “starting scientists don't have a chance because of the prejudiced senior members on the study sections”; or “the reviewers succumb to fashions and you can't get funds for research on prokaryotic enzymes.” During my tenure in the 1990s as NIH Ombudsman in the Basic Sciences, I had the dubious pleasure of sitting in at many sessions of different Study Sections. Like those scientists whose applications did not lead to funding, I can cite shortcomings in the system. There is much too much nitpicking by members of the panels, such as “the magnesium ion concentration is too low.” Also, the summary statement on the “Pink Sheet” is not consistent with the score. Old timers still refer to Pink Summary Sheets; they haven't been pink for some years and are now replaced by electronic messages. Reviewers, in trying to be kind in their write-ups, frequently offer complimentary comments thereby giving applicants an erroneous impression about the real evaluation of the proposal. Scores often are not consistent with the commentary. As a result, applicants submit a slightly revised request that again receives a poor rating. Hence there are too many amended applications. Panels often have too many “ad hoc” members. Some of them, flattered by the opportunity to evaluate the research of others, go to great lengths to demonstrate their erudition by essentially rewriting the proposals. Applications are too long; experimental minutiae are included thereby becoming the focus of nitpicking. Despite these criticisms, I find the Peer Review System remarkable.One of the most common and often repeated complaints is that panel members don't support highly original proposals. Innovative proposals, according to the complainants, are dismissed with the remark: “it won't work.” Based on my experience as an observer at Study Section meetings as Ombudsman, I have no doubt that panel members prematurely and inappropriately conclude that very original proposals won't work. Despite their favorable comments about the excellent “track record” of the investigators, they give low ratings to such applications. But this criticism of the peer review system is not new. About 50 years ago in a talk on a fictitious enzyme “Money Transferase” at the Gordon Conference on Proteins, I showed the enclosed plot of the probability of obtaining a grant versus the originality of the grant request (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, it still has some validity.Many of the complaints about the peer review system are legitimate, but it is astonishing to hear scientists, whose grant applications were not funded, criticize NIH or NSF when the decisions were rendered largely by panels of outside reviewers. My rejoinder to the critics is that the ratings are attributable to the judgments of the panel members on the review committees and “the enemy is us.”Numerous committees have studied the peer review process (5Mandel R. The Division of Research Grants: a Half Century of Peer Review from 1946 to 1996. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar), and their recommendations invariably have led to improvements in the system. The Division of Research Grants (DRG), established in 1946, initiated many reforms over the years in response to suggestions from the extramural community, and an important change occurred when that division was converted in 1997 to the Center for Scientific Review (CSR). A major reclassification of Study Sections is now being implemented. Although individual scientists have expressed concern about which Study Section will review their application, this reorganization was necessary because developments in biomedical science over the past 50 years have resulted in radical changes in the way research is conducted. Whether this new classification will reduce the number of times that important areas of scientific research fall between the cracks remains to be seen. Much will depend on the conduct of reviewers, and attempts by NIH staff to overcome bias in rating approaches to science. It should not be a surprise, for example, that a panel comprising many NMR spectroscopists and crystallographers would give high scores to proposals using these techniques. However in the process, scientists using other physical-chemical tools found themselves disadvantaged, and the ratings of their proposals were poor. In my judgment, this type of bias has occurred in the area of biophysical chemistry and in other areas of scientific research. This deficiency is likely to be mitigated as a result of the reorganization.Doubtless complaints about peer review will continue and probably even increase because the demand for more R01s from the growing scientific community far exceeds the available source of funds. That government has delegated to the scientific community the right to design and operate the peer review system is a remarkable achievement and criticism is invaluable.Impact of Federal Funding on UniversitiesDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the number of graduate students interested in biochemistry and molecular biology increased tremendously, appointments to the faculty grew rapidly, and new departments were established in many institutions. At Berkeley in the 1960s, we had both a biochemistry department and a virology department that was later converted into a Department of Molecular Biology. Both thrived despite occasional competition for space, faculty positions, graduate students, and university funds. Growth was rampant, influenced in large measure by the increased federal funding for biomedical research. My own laboratory group, including students from both Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, had grown to about 5 graduate students, several undergraduates, 2 postdocs, and 2 technicians. Despite the large increase in the number of postdoctoral fellowships and the establishment of NIH Training Grants, there was a need for additional funding to individual faculty members. Accordingly in 1964, I applied to NIH for funds and received my first, and still continuing, NIH grant entitled “Structure-Interactions of Biological Macromolecules,” which was significantly larger than the existing NSF grant. Other faculty members experienced similar growth, and not surprisingly, space problems became acute. New buildings became the issue in nearly every research-oriented university. Amalgamation of departments ensued shortly thereafter. Here at Berkeley about 15 years ago there was a major reorganization. The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology group of about 25 faculty members was restructured as 1 of 5 divisions in the mega-Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) comprising about 90 faculty. This reorganization clearly has been advantageous in recruiting faculty and graduate students, and the resulting clout on campus coupled with the size of MCB has led to occasional calls for even more independence and authority. Why not establish a College of Biology? Whether this growth has resulted in a loss of community and collegiality is for others to judge. Moreover, it will be of interest to observe the interactions of the diverse groups in the new, greatly expanded Stanley Hall. Will there be extensive collaboration leading to Big Science, or will there be just more scientists in the enlarged building not talking to one another?University administrators reacted to the growth of federal funds and desires for additional faculty by encouraging, and even requiring, full time faculty to raise substantial parts of their salaries through grant funds. The practice began when faculty members on 9-month appointments used some of their grant funds to pay summer salaries for 2 or sometimes 3 months. Soon using grant funds to supplement faculty salaries became widespread. That step led to the policy of establishing “soft money” faculty positions. This practice is particularly prevalent in medical schools. In one state institution I visited, a large department had state funds for 30 FTEs (full time equivalents) with about 300 faculty members occupying those slots. Each faculty member had to raise about 90% of the salary from federal funds. Clearly NIH was subsidizing universities to an extent not anticipated. This increase in the number of faculty positions led, of course, to greater demands for research grants and for additional laboratory space. In turn lobbying was initiated for government funds to build new buildings on university campuses. This effort was partially successful but for only a limited period. Some agencies participated in matching fund programs with universities, and there have be"

Understanding of the molecular basis of hormone binding and receptor activation should provide insights that are helpful in the development of such drugs. We previously examined the unique second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor, identifying key epitopes in perimembranous locations at each end of this long loop (Matsuura, B., Dong, M., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9834–9839). Here, we have extended that work, examining the other predicted extracellular domains of the motilin receptor by using sequential deletions of segments ranging from one to six amino acid residues and site-directed alanine replacement mutagenesis approaches. Each construct was transiently expressed in COS cells, and characterized for motilin- and erythromycin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses and motilin radioligand binding. Only those receptor segments that included key Cys residues in positions 25, 30, and 111 or perimembranous regions at the ends of the amino terminus and the first and third extracellular loops disrupted motilin biological activity. Each of these Cys deletions also disrupted action of erythromycin. Alanine replacements for each of the potentially important amino acid residues in the perimembranous segments revealed that residues Gly36, Pro103, Leu109, and Phe332 were responsible for the selective negative impact on motilin biological activity, while responding normally to erythromycin. These results support the presence of functionally important disulfide bonds in the motilin receptor ectodomain and demonstrate that the structural determinants for binding and biological activity of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands are distinct, with a broad extracellular perimembranous base contributing to normal motilin binding.

However, this receptor family is unique in that its natural ligands include substantial structural diversity, such as the rare, yet critical, post-translational modification representing octanoylation of ghrelin (3Kojima M.

As an initial effort to localize key receptor regions for motilin action, we examined the second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor, which is structurally divergent from the other members of this family, being much longer than that of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Of note, only the perimembranous ends of this loop that are conserved in the related receptors were shown to be functionally important for motilin binding and biological activity, with the long inserted sequence not contributing to motilin function (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have extended that analysis to include all of the other predicted extracellular regions of the motilin receptor. This includes the amino-terminal tail and the predicted first and third extracellular loop regions. Each of these receptor regions was studied by analogous approaches to those that have been utilized to examine the second extracellular loop region. We have performed serial segmental deletions of the regions of current interest to identify functionally important areas and have further focused on specific residues within these regions using site-directed alanine replacement mutagenesis. These studies have further supported the theme that agonists having distinct chemical structures, here a peptide and a non-peptidyl antibiotic, can act to stimulate receptor activation via interaction with distinct domains. The broad and diffuse base for natural motilin action is also further defined and found to be consistent with regions identified in photoaffinity labeling studies using probes with photolabile sites of covalent attachment in motilin peptide residues 1 and 5 (8Coulie B. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35518-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Matsuura B.

This work also adds insights into key structural features of this receptor, confirming the presence of a disulfide bond that is highly conserved across this superfamily (10Strader C.D. Fong T.M.

Materials—Motilin, erythromycin, and protease-free cell dissociation buffer were from Sigma-Aldrich. Eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1(–), was from Invitrogen. The human motilin receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. A. D. Howard of Merck Research Laboratories (1Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D.

Science. 1999; 284: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Enzymes used for receptor mutagenesis were purchased from Roche Applied Science or Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) 3The abbreviations used are: AM, acetoxymethyl ester; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The mouse 12CA5 monoclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was from Roche Applied Science. Receptor Constructs—Motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included segmental deletions of one to six amino acid residues and site-directed alanine replacement mutations in regions predicted to represent the amino-terminal tail and the first and third extracellular loops. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. Constructs were prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed with Pfu Turbo™ DNA polymerase, running 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 14 min. Products of PCR and restriction enzyme digestions were separated on 1% agarose gels and purified using the Qiagen reagent (Valencia, CA). Receptor constructs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1(–). Sequences of each of the receptor constructs were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism (Foster City, CA) DNA sequencer. Additionally, a series of HA-tagged constructs were also prepared for immunostaining studies; these included HA-tagged wild-type, alanine site mutants (G36A, P103A, L109A, and P332A), and cysteine deletion mutants (Δ25C, Δ30C and Δ111C). They were prepared using the same strategy as described above, by placing the HA sequence (YPYDVPDYA) at the amino terminus between residues Met1 and Gly2 of the wild type or mutant receptors. Receptor Expression—Receptor constructs were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection). In brief, 0.5 × 106 cells plated on tissue culture plasticware were transfected with 3 μg of DNA using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested with cell dissociation medium and used in biological activity and/or radioligand binding assays. Biological Activity Assays—The ability of each motilin receptor construct to stimulate an intracellular signal in response to motilin and erythromycin was studied using a well established assay for intracellular calcium in Fura-2/AM-loaded transfected COS cells. In this assay, 2.0 × 106 receptor-bearing cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium (KRH; 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 2 mMCaCl2) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantified in a LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excitation was performed at both 340 and 380 nm, with emission determined at 520 nm. Calcium concentrations were calculated from the ratios of these values as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (12Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peak intracellular calcium concentrations achieved were utilized to determine the agonist concentration-dependence of the biological responses. All assays were repeated at least four times. Receptor Binding Assays—Radioligand binding assays utilized various mutant motilin receptor-bearing cells with a constant amount of radioligand (3–5 pm [125I-Ile13]-motilin) and varied concentrations of unlabeled motilin (ranging from 0 to 1 μm) in KRH medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Incubations were carried out for 60 min at 25 °C. The binding assays were performed in 24-well tissue culture plates. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm motilin and represented less than 20% of total binding. All assays were repeated at least four times. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For morphological assessment of receptor expression on the cell surface, COS cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged wild type or mutant motilin receptors were replated to grow on coverslips for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After being washed once with PBS and twice with 1% normal goat serum in PBS, cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:500) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 1 h after three washes with 1% normal goat serum in PBS. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS, mounted on slides, and examined with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped for epifluorescence. All of the above procedures were performed at room temperature. Statistical Analysis—Biological activity curves and binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis program in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding kinetics were determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (13Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). All observations were expressed as means ± S.E. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed two-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keul test for multiple comparisons. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Mutagenesis of the Amino Terminus of the Motilin Receptor—In this series of studies, we deleted sequential segments ranging in length from one to four amino acid residues from the predicted amino-terminal tail region of the motilin receptor. These started immediately after the initiator methionine residue and were extended through Gly36 (Fig. 1). Constructs were transiently expressed in COS cells and were characterized functionally (quantitative analysis in Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of only three segments in this region resulted in marked reduction in motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. These included deletion of residues 33 through 36, adjacent to the first transmembrane segment, and deletion of each of the two cysteine residues in this region, Cys25 and Cys30.TABLE 1Binding and biological activity dataReceptor constructsMotilin bindingIntracellular calcium response to motilinIntracellular calcium response to erythromycinKiBmax binding sites/cellEC50 [motilin]Emax [Ca2+]EC50 [erythromycin]Emax [Ca2+]nm×103nmnmmmnmWT1.8 ± 0.3103 ± 255.4 ± 0.531 ± 30.82 ± 0.0645 ± 3Δ2-42.9 ± 0.699 ± 244.9 ± 0.430 ± 4Δ5-81.9 ± 0.4101 ± 195.1 ± 0.329 ± 3Δ9-123.8 ± 0.889 ± 164.2 ± 0.328 ± 3Δ13-162.6 ± 0.695 ± 174.5 ± 0.328 ± 3Δ17-201.4 ± 0.1111 ± 304.5 ± 0.229 ± 3Δ21-242.3 ± 0.496 ± 184.0 ± 0.326 ± 3Δ25C>1,000>1,00011 ± 2>10029 ± 8Δ26-281.6 ± 0.3109 ± 205.1 ± 0.529 ± 5Δ298.1 ± 2.479 ± 184.2 ± 0.328 ± 3Δ30C>1,000>1,0009 ± 1>10028 ± 5Δ31-322.0 ± 0.3101 ± 323.7 ± 0.327 ± 3Δ33-36>1,000>1,00012 ± 2Δ103-104>1,000>1,00011 ± 1Δ105-110>1,000>1,0008 ± 1Δ111C>1,000>1,0008 ± 2>10025 ± 6Δ328-3306.3 ± 1.988 ± 265.1 ± 0.229 ± 2Δ331-332>1,000>1,00013 ± 5F33A7.9 ± 0.785 ± 235.4 ± 0.329 ± 3P34A4.2 ± 1.690 ± 104.8 ± 0.329 ± 4L35A3.7 ± 1.187 ± 163.9 ± 0.328 ± 3G36A>1,000>1,00010 ± 20.84 ± 0.0645 ± 10P103A>1,000>1,00012 ± 20.79 ± 0.0546 ± 8W104A12.2 ± 1.368 ± 124.8 ± 0.329 ± 3V105A1.8 ± 0.4109 ± 354.6 ± 0.329 ± 4F106A1.9 ± 0.5105 ± 264.5 ± 0.327 ± 3G107A1.0 ± 0.1122 ± 364.2 ± 0.427 ± 3P108A2.0 ± 0.397 ± 254.1 ± 0.428 ± 4L109A>1,000>1,0009 ± 21.01 ± 0.0344 ± 5L110A2.3 ± 0.594 ± 154.5 ± 0.429 ± 4Y331A2.9 ± 0.483 ± 224.9 ± 0.430 ± 4F332A>1,000>1,00012 ± 10.83 ± 0.0543 ± 8 Open table in a new tab To identify potentially important residues in the region between Phe33 and Gly36, each of the relevant four residues was mutated to Ala. Fig. 2B shows that in F33A, P34A, and L35A mutants the intracellular calcium responses to motilin were similar to that in wild-type motilin receptor (quantitative analysis in Table 1). In contrast, the mutation of G36A of the predicted carboxyl-terminal perimembranous end of this extracellular domain resulted in a decreased intracellular calcium response to motilin. The maximal calcium response to motilin for this mutant was only 25% of that for the wild-type motilin receptor. Shown in Fig. 2, C and D, are the motilin competition-binding curves for each of the deletion (Fig. 2C) and Ala replacement site mutants (Fig. 2D) (quantitative analysis in Table 1). These curves correlated nicely with the activity assays for these constructs (Fig. 2, A and D), with the most dramatic reduction in binding observed for deletion mutants (ΔCys25, ΔCys30, and Δ33–36) and the G36A site mutant. Mutagenesis of the First Extracellular Loop of the Motilin Receptor—In this region, segments ranging in length from one to six amino acid residues were deleted (Fig. 1). The constructs, representing Δ103–104, Δ105–110, and Δ111C were transiently expressed in COS cells and functionally characterized (quantitative analysis in Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3A, all of the three mutants decreased the intracellular calcium response relative to that in the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, none of these mutants exhibited detectable binding (Fig. 3C). These data are consistent with photoaffinity labeling data using a photolabile motilin analogue that incorporates a benzoylphenylalanine in position 1 (8Coulie B. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M.

The Cys111 residue that was deleted in the Δ111 construct can be aligned with a Cys residue that is conserved throughout the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors and that contributes to the formation of the highly conserved disulfide bond linking the first and second extracellular loops of these receptors. The Cys111 deletion mutant had a profoundly negative impact (Fig. 3, A and C). To identify other important residues in this extracellular loop region, we mutated each of eight residues between Pro103 and Leu110 to Ala (Fig. 3B) and characterized them functionally in COS cells (quantitative analysis in Table 1). The mutation of P103A within the predicted amino-terminal perimembranous end of this loop and the mutation of L109A within the predicted carboxyl-terminal perimembranous end of this loop resulted in loss of the intracellular calcium responses to motilin. The maximal calcium response to motilin for these mutants was only 25% of that for the wild-type motilin receptor. Once again, motilin radioligand binding data correlated with the biological activity studies (Fig. 3D). Mutagenesis of the Third Extracellular Loop of the Motilin Receptor—This is a small region, consisting of only five residues. Therefore, only two deletion constructs (Δ328–330 and Δ331–332) were prepared (Fig. 1). They were expressed in COS cells and characterized for biological activity and binding studies (quantitative analysis in Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4A, of the two constructs tested, only the carboxyl-terminal deletion of this loop (Δ331–332) decreased the intracellular calcium response (Fig. 4A) and binding (Fig. 4C). To further explore the importance of individual residues, we mutated Tyr331 and Phe332 to Ala. The mutation of F332A within the predicted carboxyl-terminal end of this loop resulted in loss of intracellular calcium response to motilin (Fig. 4B) and motilin binding (Fig. 4D). This is consistent with our most recent identification of this residue as the site of covalent labeling with a photolabile motilin analogue incorporating a benzoylphenylalanine in position 5 (9Matsuura B. Dong M. Coulie B. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Evidence of Surface Expression of the Functionally Impaired Mutant Motilin Receptor Constructs—To examine cell surface expression of the functionally impaired motilin receptor constructs as identified above, each of the relevant HA-tagged constructs was transfected into COS cells and immunostained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, each mutant receptor construct was shown to be expressed on the cell surface in density similar to the wild-type receptor. No fluorescence was observed in negative control cells that had been transfected with an empty expression vector or in cells transfected with wild-type receptor but stained with the second antibody only. It should be noted that the HA-tagged motilin receptor had motilin-stimulated biological activity response similar to the wild-type receptor (data not shown). Biological Responses to Erythromycin—In contrast to the markedly reduced biological responses to motilin for each of the four key alanine site mutants (G36A, P103A, L109A, F332A), these mutants exhibited normal intracellular calcium responses to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin (Fig. 6A, Table 1). Maximal responses were not different for these constructs from values for the wild-type motilin receptor. These support the normal biosynthesis and delivery to the cell surface for each of these important constructs while at the same time supporting differential molecular determinants for peptide and non-peptidyl agonist action. The constructs that represented the deletion of Cys residues in positions 25, 30, and 111 resulted in decreases in intracellular calcium responses to the natural peptide agonist, motilin, and also resulted in decreased responses to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin (Fig. 6B, Table 1). We previously reported that deletion of Cys235 resulted in reduced intracellular calcium responses to both motilin and erythromycin (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These findings support the importance of the conserved disulfide bond linking Cys111 with Cys235 in maintaining the receptor architecture important for responses to both peptide and non-peptidyl agonist action. The molecular basis of ligand binding to a receptor is dependent on the structural and physicochemical characteristics of both molecules. For the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, the heptahelical structure and confluence of these helices in the lipid bilayer are thought to be largely conserved. However, the loop and tail regions are quite varied and likely provide the diversity of themes allowing the binding of structurally diverse natural ligands. This diversity is reflected in different modes of binding for distinct groups of ligands. It is noteworthy that the receptors with structures that are most closely related to each other often have natural ligands that are also structurally related and that bind with similar mechanisms. The motilin receptor is noteworthy because it is structurally similar to the receptors for growth hormone releasing factor and ghrelin. The latter represents the first peptide hormone found to have an octanoylation modification, which is critical for binding and biological activity. Presumably this leads to directing ghrelin to a binding domain at or within the lipid bilayer. Current insights into the mechanism of binding of motilin have come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Coulie B. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Ther. 2005; 313: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The only existing mutagenesis studies have carefully examined the predicted second extracellular loop region of the motilin receptor (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). That region was targeted for study because it is quite long in the motilin receptor and much shorter in the ghrelin receptor. The rationale was that this might be critical for the binding of a peptide but less important for the binding of the octanoylated ligand. It turned out that the only regions of importance for peptide binding were the residues at the membrane interface at each end of the long loop (Val179, Leu245 and Arg246) (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The current report examines all of the other predicted extracellular regions of the motilin receptor following similar experimental strategies of segment deletion and alanine replacement mutagenesis. Here, too, the regions of importance for motilin binding and action were the residues at the membrane interface at the ends of the amino-terminal tail and extracellular loop domains (Gly36, Pro103, Leu109, and Phe332). Although all of these regions were critical for the binding and action of motilin, their mutation had no effect on the action of erythromycin, a non-peptidyl agonist acting at this receptor (7Matsuura B. Dong M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9834-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Of note, this mutagenesis approach also revealed the functional importance of two cysteine residues (Cys25 and Cys30) within the amino-terminal tail domain that are likely involved in an intradomain disulfide bond within this receptor. Such a bond was not previously suspected to exist. It is particularly interesting that this bond was shown to have functional significance for both motilin and erythromycin action. Although these data are of great interest and suggest the presence of a platform at the interface between plasma membrane and extracellular domains for natural peptide motilin binding to its receptor, these results are indirect and require complementation. Such loss-of-function studies can be explained by allosteric effects rather than as representing a site of direct ligand interaction with the receptor. These results are nicely supported by the results of photoaffinity labeling studies in which ligand probes were used that had photolabile benzoylphenylalanine sites of covalent attachment in positions one and five (8Coulie B. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35518-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Matsuura B. Dong M. Coulie B. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The former probe labeled motilin receptor regions between residues 99 and 129, including the first extracellular loop domain, and between residues 130 and 185, including the beginning of the second extracellular loop (8Coulie B. Matsuura B. Dong M. Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Feighner S.D. Howard A.D. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35518-35522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The latter probe was shown to specifically label Phe332 in the third extracellular loop domain (9Matsuura B. Dong M. Coulie B. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The other interesting and important insight coming from the current work is the clear establishment of distinct mechanisms of binding and action of peptide and non-peptidyl agonists acting at the motilin receptor. Erythromycin is a non-peptidyl motilin receptor agonist that is used therapeutically as a prokinetic agent in motility disorders (14Peeters T.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1886-1899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 15Janssens J. Peeters T.L. Vantrappen G. Tack J. Urbain J.L. De Roo M. Muls E. Bouillon R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Disruption of motilin binding and biological activity by mutagenesis of the perimembranous residues in the amino terminus and each of the extracellular loops of this receptor had no negative impact on the action of erythromycin. It is likely that such ligands will bind to intramembranous regions of this receptor. The erythromycin data also represent an important positive control for the normal folding and architecture of the mutant motilin receptors that disrupted motilin binding and action. In conclusion, we have now demonstrated that residues at each of the predicted perimembranous regions of the amino-terminal tail and extracellular loop domains of the motilin receptor contribute to natural peptide ligand binding and action and are not important for non-peptidyl erythromycin action at this receptor. Additionally, we report evidence for a functionally critical disulfide bond within the amino-terminal tail of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1994107973,"P-type ATPases of the IIC subfamily exhibit large differences in sensitivity toward ouabain. This allows a strategy in which ouabain-insensitive members of this subfamily are used as template for mutational elucidation of the ouabain-binding site. With this strategy, we recently identified seven amino acids in Na,K-ATPase that conferred high affinity ouabain binding to gastric H,K-ATPase (Qiu, L. Y., Krieger, E., Schaftenaar, G., Swarts, H. G. P., Willems, P. H. G. M., De Pont, J. J. H. H. M., and Koenderink, J. B. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 32349–32355). Because important, but identical, amino acids were not recognized in that study, here we used the non-gastric H,K-ATPase, which is rather ouabain-insensitive, as template. The catalytic subunit of this enzyme, in which several amino acids from Na,K-ATPase were incorporated, was expressed with the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A chimera containing 14 amino acids, located in M4, M5, and M6, which are unique to Na,K-ATPase, displayed high affinity ouabain binding. Four of these residues, all located in M5, appeared dispensable for high affinity binding. Individual mutation of the remaining 10 residues to their non-gastric H,K-ATPase counterparts yielded five amino acids (Glu312,Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802) whose mutation resulted in a loss of ouabain binding. In a final gain-of-function experiment, we introduced these five amino acids in different combinations in non-gastric H,K-ATPase and demonstrated that all five were essential for high affinity ouabain binding. The non-gastric H,K-ATPase with these five mutations had a similar apparent affinity for ouabain as the wild type Na,K-ATPase and showed a 2000 times increased affinity for ouabain in the NH4+-stimulated ATPase activity in membranes of transfected Sf9 cells. P-type ATPases of the IIC subfamily exhibit large differences in sensitivity toward ouabain. This allows a strategy in which ouabain-insensitive members of this subfamily are used as template for mutational elucidation of the ouabain-binding site. With this strategy, we recently identified seven amino acids in Na,K-ATPase that conferred high affinity ouabain binding to gastric H,K-ATPase (Qiu, L. Y., Krieger, E., Schaftenaar, G., Swarts, H. G.

Non-gastric H,K-ATPase is a member of the IIC subfamily of P-type ATPases. This subfamily includes two other members: Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase, which both transport K+ in exchange for either Na+ (Na,K-ATPase) or H+ ions (gastric H,K-ATPase) (1Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F812-F824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three enzymes are heterodimers, composed of a catalytic α-subunit that spans the membrane 10 times and a glycosylated β-subunit that crosses the membrane once. The members of this subfamily (also called X,K-ATPases) exhibit a high level of sequence homology (65% amino acid identity) between their α-subunits. To date, α2-subunits of non-gastric H,K-ATPase have been described in five different species: human (2Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D.

Horisberger J.D. Geering K. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). No specific β-subunit for the non-gastric H,K-ATPase has been found. Most studies support the idea that the β1-subunit of Na,K-ATPase fulfills this function (7Codina J. Delmas-Mata J.T. DuBose Jr., T.D. J. Biol.

Ouabain, a cardiac glycoside, specifically inhibits the Na,K-ATPase activity and binds to the α-subunit (11Forbush B. II I Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ouabain binds from the extracellular side, so that the extracellularly located parts of this subunit are putative candidates for ouabain binding. Two polar amino acids (Gln111 and Asn122) located at the extracellular border of the M1/M2 hairpin have been established to be important for high affinity binding to Na,K-ATPase, since mutation of these amino acids into charged residues, as present in rat and mouse, lowers the ouabain affinity considerably (12Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These two polar amino acids are present in both gastric and non-gastric H,K-ATPase of the rat. We previously demonstrated that the introduction of the transmembrane hairpins M3-M4 and M5-M6 of Na,K-ATPase into a backbone of gastric H,K-ATPase results in the formation of a high affinity ouabain-binding site (13Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In follow-up studies we showed that a gastric H,K-ATPase in which only seven amino acids were replaced by their counterparts from Na,K-ATPase bound ouabain with the same affinity as native Na,K-ATPase (14Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Qiu L.Y. Krieger E.

These residues (Glu312, Val314, Ile315, Gly319, Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) are all present in the extracellularly located parts of M4, M5, and M6 of Na,K-ATPase. The above-mentioned method cannot detect amino acid residues that are important for ouabain binding if these residues are similar in Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase. Whereas the gastric H,K-ATPase activity is not at all inhibited by ouabain, the non-gastric H,K-ATPase activity can be inhibited by relatively high ouabain concentrations (4Asano S. Hoshina S. Nakaie Y. Watanabe T. Sato M. Suzuki Y. Takeguchi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

Apparently, the binding pocket for ouabain in non-gastric H,K-ATPase contains elements that are not suited for optimal ouabain binding. We therefore decided to use the non-gastric H,K-ATPase as a template to introduce dissimilar amino acids from Na,K-ATPase. This could also give an answer to the question why the affinity of the non-gastric H,K-ATPase for ouabain is so low. Because of the results obtained with the gastric H,K-ATPase (see above), we decided to restrict ourselves to the amino acids present in the extracellularly located parts of M4, M5, and M6. In this study we found that a chimera with non-gastric H,K-ATPase as template and containing large parts of the M4, M5, and M6 membrane segments from Na,K-ATPase could bind ouabain with high affinity. In this chimera 14 amino acids were unique to Na,K-ATPase, but only 10 of these were shown to be needed for high affinity ouabain binding. By a systematic series of mutations we could reduce this number to five amino acid residues (Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802) without loosing high affinity ouabain binding. This finding enlarges our knowledge on the ouabain-binding site in Na,K-ATPase and explains why the non-gastric H,K-ATPase has a low affinity for this drug. Construction of Chimeras and Mutants—The chimeras and mutants were constructed from the rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit containing the R111Q and D122N mutations (12Price E.M. Lingrel J.B.

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the mutants described in this paper. All introduced mutations were verified by sequencing. For clarity reasons we used the numbering of the pig Na,K-ATPase, also for residues in parts originating from H,K-ATPase. The generation of the pFD vector containing the α2-subunit of rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase and the β1-subunit of rat Na,K-ATPase (pFD-HKα2-NaKβ1) that is suited for the baculovirus expression system has been reported before (10Swarts H.G.P.

After injection, the oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C in modified Ringer's solution (17Koenderink J.B. Geibel S. Grabsch E. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. J. Biol.

Preparation of Total Membranes—Oocytes were disrupted by passing them ± 20 times through a standard 200-μl Gilson pipette in homogenization buffer (10 μl/oocyt; 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), and “Complete Protease Inhibitor” (according to the instructions of the manufacturer, Roche Diagnostics. The yolk granules were removed by centrifugation of the samples (1000 × g, 4 °C, 3 min), and the supernatant was collected. This step was repeated twice.

Finally, the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (3 μl/oocyte), and the samples were stored at -20 °C. Generation of Recombinant Viruses—The pFD vectors containing the different cDNAs were transformed to competent DH10bac Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) harboring the baculovirus genome (bacmid) and a transposition helper vector.

For production of H,K-ATPase, 1.5·106 cells·ml-1 were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1–3 in the presence of 1% (v/v) ethanol (22Klaassen C.H.W. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem.

Hermsen H.P.H. Koenderink J.B. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3029-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After 3 days, Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The cells were washed once at 0 °C with 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.0), resuspended in sucrose/EDTA/Tris buffer, and sonicated at 60 watts (Branson Power Co., Denbury, CT) for 30 s at 0 °C. After centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g the supernatant was collected and recentrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in the above-mentioned buffer and stored at -20 °C. Protein Determination—The protein concentrations were quantified with the modified Lowry method according to Peterson (24Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western Blotting—The total membrane fraction of X. laevis oocytes was solubilized in sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels containing 10% acrylamide according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Milipore, Co., Bedford, MA). The α-subunits of non-gastric H,K-ATPase and the various chimeras were detected with the polyclonal antibody C384-M79 that recognizes the Glu528–Met554 region of the rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase α2-subunit (10Swarts H.G.P.

The primary antibody was detected using an anti-rabbit secondary antibody, which was labeled with peroxidase (Dako Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). [3H]Ouabain Binding—A total membrane fraction equivalent to 3.3 oocytes was incubated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1 mm ATP, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 250 nm (or 25 nm) [3H]ouabain and either 1 mm ATP or 1 mm H3PO4 at a final volume of 50 μl. After 1 h the reaction mixture was chilled for 15 min on ice. The ouabain-protein complex was collected by filtration over a 0.8-μm membrane filter (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany). After washing twice with ice-cold water, radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity was determined using a radiochemical method (26Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M.A.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7890-7895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this purpose, 5 μg of Sf9 membranes were added to 100 μl of medium containing 2 mm Mg-[γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm NH4Cl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm TrisN3, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.0), and concentrations of ouabain as indicated. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl 10% (w/v) charcoal in 6% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, and after 10 min at 0 °C the mixture was centrifuged for 10 s at 10,000 × g. To 0.15 ml of the clear supernatant, containing the liberated inorganic phosphate (32Pi), 3 ml of OptiFluor (Canberra Packard, Tilburg, The Netherlands) was added, and the mixture was analyzed by liquid scintillation analysis. In general, blanks were prepared by incubating in the absence of membranes. ATPase activity is presented as the difference in activity between membranes of HKα2-expressing cells and mock-infected cells. Calculations—Data are presented as mean values with standard error of the mean. Differences were tested for significance by means of Student's t test. IC50 values were determined by analyzing the plots using the non-linear curve-fitting program (Hill equation function) of Orgin 6.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northhampton, MA). Materials—[3H]Ouabain (17 Ci mmol-1) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol-1) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). Very recently we showed that substitution of seven unique amino acids present in extracellularly located parts of transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6 of the α2-subunit of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase by the corresponding amino acids of the α1-subunit of rat Na,K-ATPase (Glu312, Val314, Ile315,Gly319, Phe783, Thr797, and Asp804) results in a high affinity ouabain-binding site in the gastric H,K-ATPase (15Qiu L.Y. Krieger E. Schaftenaar G. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Koenderink J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32349-32355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study we use the non-gastric H,K-ATPase that has a low affinity for ouabain to investigate the binding site in more detail. Since the seven amino acids mentioned above are all located in the M4, M5, and M6 regions that can be reached from the extracellular space, only amino acid residues located in this region were chosen for further investigation. The extracellularly located parts of M4, M5, and M6 contain 14 amino acids that are different between Na,K-ATPase and non-gastric H,K-ATPase (Fig. 1). To identify the amino acids in this region that are important for ouabain binding, the rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase residues were replaced by their rat Na,K-ATPase counterparts. Different combinations of these mutations were made (Table 1), and expressed together with the rat Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit in X. laevis oocytes, whereupon ouabain binding was measured. The polyclonal antibody C384-M79 that recognizes the Glu528-Met554 region of the rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase α2-subunit (10Swarts H.G.P. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33115-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used to determine the expression levels in the total membrane proteins on a Western blot. Fig. 2A shows that the expression level of each of the mutants was rather similar to that of the recombinant non-gastric H,K-ATPase. [3H]Ouabain binding levels were determined in the presence of either 1 mm ATP or 1 mm Pi to obtain the phosphorylated intermediate E2-P, which is optimal for ouabain binding. We previously found that ouabain binding to Na,K-ATPase results in a higher level when phosphorylation was carried out with Pi, whereas phosphorylation of a chimera between Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase (HN34/56) only occurs when phosphorylation is carried out with ATP. Studies with vanadate indicate that the latter chimera is mainly in the E1-form, whereas the wild type enzyme in mainly in the E2 form.TABLE 1Description of the used mutants The mutants used in this study have the rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase α2-subunit as a backbone and contain the β1-subunit of rat Na,K-ATPase.ConstructsMutationsMutation AY309T-V310W-D312E-I314V-S319GMutation BA778P-C781TMutation CY786F-V788I-G790N-L791IMutation DI795L-I798V-F802CMutant 1A+B+CMutant 2A+B+DMutant 3A+C+DMutant 4B+C+DMutant 5A+B+C+D Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2[3H]Ouabain binding of non-gastric H,K-ATPase mutants.

B, [3H]ouabain binding was determined by incubating the membranes at room temperature in 5.0 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-acetic acid (pH 7.0), 1.0 mm ATP, and 250 nm [3H]ouabain.

Mean values ± S.E. of three enzyme preparations are shown. ni = not injected. The five mutants (mutants 1–5) are described in Table 1. *, significantly different from non-gastric H,K-ATPase wild type (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants 2 (= mutations A+B+D) and 5 (= mutations A+B+C+D) (Fig. 2, B and C), as determined with 250 nm ouabain in the presence of either 1 mm ATP or 1 mm Pi, were significantly higher than that of the recombinant non-gastric H,K-ATPase wild type (p < 0.05). This shows that the mutations A, B, and D together are sufficient for gaining the ability to bind ouabain with a high affinity. The [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants 1, 3, and 4 were rather similar to that of the non-gastric H,K-ATPase wild type (p > 0.05). This demonstrates that none of the later mutants were able to bind ouabain under these conditions. This means that amino acid residues in group C, located in M5, are apparently not important for high affinity ouabain binding. There was hardly any difference between the results with either ATP or Pi, suggesting that the enzyme can be easily converted from the E1 into the E2 form and oppositely. As a control, wild type Na,K-ATPase gave higher ouabain binding levels when the binding was carried out in the presence of Pi (13Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutants can apparently easily move between the E1 and E2 form, so that the forward or backward reaction gives similar results. Taken together, these findings suggest that maximally 10 amino acid residues that are present in the catalytic subunit of Na,K-ATPase but not in that of non-gastric H,K-ATPase are important for ouabain binding. Five of these amino acids are located in M4, two in M5, and three in M6 of Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 1). To assess which of these 10 amino acids are important for high affinity ouabain binding, we generated individual mutants of mutant 2, in which each of these ten amino acids was back mutated into the original non-gastric H,K-ATPase residue. Western blotting showed again similar expression levels of the new mutants compared with mutant 2 (Fig. 3A). All mutants could be phosphorylated by ATP (data not shown), which excludes the possibility that the loss of ouabain binding capacity of these mutants is due to the impossibility to form a phosphorylated intermediate. Fig. 3, B and C, show that the [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants Mut2-E312D, Mut2-G319S, Mut2-P778A, Mut2-L795I, and Mut2-C802F were significantly lower than those of mutant 2, indicating that these five mutants lost their ability to bind ouabain with high affinity. We cannot distinguish whether this loss is due to a change in affinity or in a decrease in the stoichiometry of binding sites. The [3H]ouabain binding levels of mutants Mut2-T309Y, Mut2-V314I, Mut2-T781C, and Mut2-V798I were not significantly different from those of mutant 2 (p > 0.05). The [3H]ouabain binding level of mutant Mut2-W310V was even significantly higher than that of mutant 2 (p < 0.05). Also in this case the results in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3B) were rather similar to those in the presence of Pi (Fig. 3C). In the latter case significance was reached for all mutants except mut2-E312D, which is probably due to the relatively larger experimental variations. Taken together, these observations indicate that Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802 are essential for high affinity ouabain binding. However, these kinds of “loss-of-function” experiments could not exclude the possibility that the loss of ouabain binding capacity of the mutations is due to indirect effects on ouabain binding. Therefore we performed “gain-of-function” experiments by introducing different combinations of the above-mentioned five amino acids into non-gastric H,K-ATPase. Fig. 4A shows similar expression levels of all tested mutants. None of the mutants showed higher [3H]ouabain binding levels than those of non-gastric H,K-ATPase except the mutant with all five mutations, HKα2-EGPLC (Fig. 4, B and C). Since the individual mutants all could be phosphorylated, it is unlikely that the lack of ouabain binding of most of these mutants is due to an inability to become phosphorylated. These findings confirm that the combination of Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802 is essential for high affinity ouabain binding. To compare the apparent affinity for ouabain of chimera HKα2-EGPLC and Na,K-ATPase, we performed an ouabain replacement assay (Fig. 5) in the presence of 1 mm Pi. The figure shows that the apparent ouabain binding affinity of chimera HKα2-EGPLC (0.22 ± 0.03 μm) is not significantly different from that of Na,K-ATPase (0.19 ± 0.01 μm) (p > 0.05), indicating that chimera HKα2-EGPLC has gained high affinity ouabain binding. Finally, we expressed chimera HKα2-EGPLC and the rat Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. The expressed non-gastric H,K-ATPase EGPLC had an NH4+-stimulated ATPase activity of 9.8 ± 0.9 μmol/mg of protein/h that was about 40% of that of the wild type enzyme (26.8 ± 2.8 μmol/mg of protein/h). The phosphorylation level of the chimera was 9.0 ± 0.8 pmol/mg of protein that is also about 40% of that of the wild type enzyme (22.5 ± 2.3 pmol/mg of protein). This means that the mutations had no effect on the turnover number of this enzyme. Next, we determined the effect of ouabain on the NH4+-stimulated ATPase activity in membranes isolated from these cells. Fig. 6 shows that the IC50 for ouabain under these conditions is a factor 2000 lower than that of the same preparation without these mutations. This strongly supports the conclusion of this paper that the presence of these five amino acid residues in non-gastric H,K-ATPase is sufficient for yielding a high affinity ouabain-binding site. This paper shows that the low affinity binding site for ouabain in the rat non-gastric H,K-ATPase can be converted into a high affinity binding site by replacement of only five amino acids by their counterparts present in the catalytic subunit of rat Na,K-ATPase. This result was obtained by a systematic mutational approach. Advantage was taken from our previous study (15Qiu L.Y. Krieger E. Schaftenaar G. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Koenderink J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32349-32355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in which we were able to transfer the high affinity binding site for ouabain to the ouabain-insensitive gastric H,K-ATPase by mutation of only seven amino acids, originating from Na,K-ATPase. All these seven amino acids are present in extracellularly located parts of M4, M5, and M6 of Na,K-ATPase. It is known that ouabain binds to the Na,K-ATPase from the extracellular side and that the highest affinity for ouabain is obtained when the enzyme is in the phosphorylated E2-P form (27Matsui H. Schwartz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the extracellular half of M4, M5, and M6 there are 14 amino acids that are different between non-gastric H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase. Introduction of these 14 amino acid residues from Na,K-ATPase into non-gastric H,K-ATPase resulted in an enzyme with a high affinity for ouabain. These 14 amino acid residues were divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, containing five, two, four, and three mutated amino acid residues, respectively. We next showed that mutant C, which represents a region with a relatively large species difference, did not alter ouabain binding and that only the 10 amino acid residues originating from the groups A, B, and D might be important for the high affinity ouabain binding. Next, individual mutational analysis revealed that only mutants mut2-E312D, mut2-G319S, mut2-P778A, mut2-L795I, and mut2-C802F partly or completely lost the ability to bind [3H]ouabain. Finally, we introduced Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802 into the ouabain-insensitive non-gastric H,K-ATPase, resulting in chimera HKα2-EGPLC that demonstrated high affinity ouabain binding (Fig. 5). The apparent affinity of this chimera is much higher than that of the parent non-gastric H,K-ATPase and the rat Na,K-ATPase, whereas it is similar to that of the recombinant high affinity rat (R111Q and D122N) Na,K-ATPase. In addition, the NH4+-stimulated ATPase activity measured in membranes isolated from Sf9 cells in which this chimera had been expressed showed a 2000 times higher affinity for ouabain than the wild type non-gastric H,K-ATPase (Fig. 6). These results revealed that Na,K-ATPase residues Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802 are important for high affinity ouabain binding. Glu312 and Gly319 were also found to be important for high affinity ouabain binding in our previous study in which a high affinity ouabain site was transferred to gastric H,K-ATPase (15Qiu L.Y. Krieger E. Schaftenaar G. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Koenderink J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32349-32355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In that paper we presented a docking model (Fig. 7), in which Glu312 forms a hydrogen bridge with a hydroxyl group of the rhamnose sugar in the ouabain molecule, suggesting that Glu312 has a direct interaction with ouabain. Gly319 is present in the α-helix of M4 that has van der Waals interactions with the steroid part of ouabain. It is striking that a Gly is also present in non gastric H,K-ATPase in man, guinea pig and Bufo. In rabbit, however, it is an Ala, and in rat a Ser. Asano et al. (4Asano S. Hoshina S. Nakaie Y. Watanabe T. Sato M. Suzuki Y. Takeguchi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the guinea pig non-gastric H,K-ATPase expressed in mammalian cells had a relatively high ouabain sensitivity (IC50 = 52 μm). The 86Rb uptake in Bufo bladder, which is mediated by non-gastric H,K-ATPase, was about two times more sensitive to ouabain than that of the rat enzyme following expression in X. laevis oocytes (16Cougnon M. Planelles G. Crowson M.S. Shull G.E. Rossier B.C. Jaisser F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7277-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Oocytes co-injected with the human non-gastric H,K-ATPase cRNA and that of rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit showed an 86Rb+ uptake that was rather sensitive to ouabain (Ki = 13 μm) (2Modyanov N.N. Mathews P.M. Grishin A.V. Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C992-C997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the presence of any side chain on position 319, as present in rat and rabbit has a structurally inhibitory effect on ouabain binding. Interestingly, we found that when Trp310 was back mutated into the Val residue in mutant 2, the [3H]ouabain binding level of this mutant significantly increased, suggesting that this mutation leads to an ouaba-in-binding-favorable enzyme conformation. This observation is consistent with the finding that a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the EYTW310LE sequence at the M3-M4 junction of Na,K-ATPase enhances the rate of ouabain binding (28Kano I. Satoh K. Nagai F. Ushiyama K. Nakao T. Hara Y. Kano K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Trp310 can give apparently spatial hindrance for ouabain binding. Substitution of this residue in mutant 2 or binding of an antibody to this residue (or its environment) in Na,K-ATPase can remove this spatial hindrance. The other three amino acids that were found to be important for high affinity ouabain binding Pro778, Leu795, and Cys802 have not been described before to be important for ouabain binding in Na,K-ATPase. Pro778 and Leu795 are present in both Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase and were therefore not identified by making chimeras between these two enzymes. Ala and Ile are present at the corresponding locations in non-gastric H,K-ATPase. Two of the three newly detected amino acids (Pro778 and Cys802) are most likely not directly involved in ouabain binding (Fig. 7) but support ouabain binding indirectly. Leu795 might directly contribute to ouabain binding. From a structural point of view, Pro is an unusual amino acid in which the side chain is cyclized back to the backbone amide position. The backbone conformation is therefore restricted, which leads to a kinked structure (29Williamson M.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). A Pro kink provides a way to make curved helices that could be packed into a funnel-like or cage-like structure (30Woolfson D.N. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Such a packing is important for membrane proteins in which structural interactions between helices can be maximized (31Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar). Because Pro778 is not included in the proposed ouabain binding pocket (15Qiu L.Y. Krieger E. Schaftenaar G. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Koenderink J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32349-32355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that the dramatic structural difference that occurs when Ala is replaced by Pro will help the enzyme to build up a conformation favorable for ouabain binding. Leu795 is located close to the extracellular loop (PLPL795GTV) between M5 and M6 (Fig. 7). It is likely to be involved in ouabain binding, since ouabain binds to the enzyme from the extracellular side. In addition, substitution of its neighboring amino acid Leu793 with Pro has been reported to lead to ouabain resistance. The apparent affinity of the L793P mutant for K+ is 2-fold lower than that of wild type Na,K-ATPase pump, indicating that the mechanism of ouabain insensitivity of L793P is due to a perturbation in the region of the enzyme that may include the K+-binding site (32Burns E.L. Nicholas R.A. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15879-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, substitution of another neighboring residue, Thr797 with Val and Ala, was found to result in a 79- and 66-fold increase in the IC50 values for ouabain, respectively (33Feng J. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In agreement with this we demonstrated before that Thr797 is one of the three amino acids in transmembrane hairpin M5-M6 of Na,K-ATPase that play a key role in ouabain binding (14Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings show that the loop region (PLPL795GTV) is clearly important for the interaction between ouabain and Na,K-ATPase. Therefore, replacement of Leu795 with Ile might modify the loop structure that harbors Leu793 and Thr797 in such a way that ouabain cannot bind very well. We also found that replacement of Cys802 by a Phe resulted in a loss of ouabain binding. Cys802 is located in the neighborhood of the cation-binding site and cannot be part of the ouabain-binding site. This mutation gives a large structural change from a hydrophilic residue with side chains containing sulfur atoms to hydrophobic amino acid with an aromatic ring. It is possible that this large structural change affects the enzyme conformation and so changes the ouabain affinity. Surprisingly, a similar change in our previous study with gastric H,K-ATPase had much less effect (14Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The direct environment of Cys802 in gastric H,K-ATPase is different from that of non-gastric H,K-ATPase, which might explain the different result. For instance, in gastric H,K-ATPase a Glu is present on position 804, whereas in non-gastric H,K-ATPase, like in Na,K-ATPase, an Asp is present on this position. We showed before that the presence of Asp804, which is part of the cation-binding pocket, is necessary for high affinity ouabain binding (13Koenderink J.B. Hermsen H.P.H. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Qiu L.Y. Koenderink J.B. Swarts H.G.P. Willems P.H.G.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47240-47244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that Cys802 may alter the ouabain binding affinity indirectly by changing enzyme-cation interactions. In summary, we presented evidence that the presence of Glu312, Gly319, Pro778, Leu795 and Cys802 in Na,K-ATPase is necessary for obtaining high affinity ouabain binding. Moreover, we demonstrated that only these five amino acids present in the extracellular half of M4, M5, and M6 of Na,K-ATPase are sufficient to confer high affinity ouabain binding to non-gastric H,K-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W1999109109,"Many if not most tissues need a controlled number of stem cells to maintain normal function. Cancer can be seen as a process of disturbed tissue homeostasis, in which too many cells have or acquire too primitive identity. Here we measured how oncogenes and tumour suppressors affect the differentiation capacity, proportion and characteristics of progenitor cells in a model tissue. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were exposed to human papilloma virus E6, E7 or E6/E7 oncogenes, which degrade tumour suppressors p53 and pRb family members, respectively. E6/E7-expressing or p53-/- NPCs were able to differentiate, but simultaneously retained high capacity for self-renewal, proliferation, ability to remain multipotent in conditions promoting differentiation and showed delayed cell cycle exit. These functions were mediated through p53 and pRb family, and involved MEK-ERK signalling. Decreased amount of p53 increased self-renewal and proliferation, whereas pRb affected only proliferation. Our results suggest that the oncogenes increase whereas p53 and pRb family tumour suppressors decrease the number and proportion of progenitor cells. These findings provide one explanation how oncogenes and tumour suppressors control tissue homeostasis and highlight their importance in stem cell self- renewal, linked both to cancer and life-long tissue turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1963949441,"The dystroglycan (DG) complex is involved in agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering downstream of muscle-specific kinase where it regulates the stability of acetylcholine receptor aggregates as well as assembly of the synaptic basement membrane. We have previously proposed that this entails coordinate extracellular and intracellular interactions of its two subunits, α- and β-DG. To assess the contribution of the extracellular and intracellular portions of DG, we have used adenoviruses to express full-length and deletion mutants of β-DG in myotubes derived from wild-type embryonic stem cells or from cells null for DG. We show that α-DG is properly glycosylated and targeted to the myotube surface in the absence of β-DG. Extracellular interactions of DG modulate the size and the microcluster density of agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor aggregates and are responsible for targeting laminin to these clusters. Thus, the association of α- and β-DG in skeletal muscle may coordinate independent roles in signaling. We discuss how DG may regulate synapses through extracellular signaling functions of its α subunit.

It is encoded by a single gene (dag1) and is expressed initially as a propeptide that gets cleaved to generate two distinct subunits as follows: α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a peripheral mucin-like protein, and β-dystroglycan (β-DG), a transmembrane protein (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

In mature skeletal muscle, both subunits associate noncovalently and localize to the plasma membrane where they form the functional core of the DGC. Dystroglycan is crucial for muscle fiber integrity and survival and is widely thought to act as a structural element of the cell surface by linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton to protect the cell against the stress of contractions (3Ervasti J.M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), indicating a role for DG in the condensation and stabilization of AChR microclusters. In addition, laminin, perlecan, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are greatly reduced at the NMJs of DGdeficient muscle (12Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The NMJ represents a highly specialized compartment within the multinucleated myotube that extends from the nerve terminal through the intervening synaptic basement membrane and plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton and subsynaptic nucleus (19Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72 (suppl.): 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Formation of this synaptic compartment is associated with expression, highly restricted localization, and stabilization of molecules. The mechanisms involved are fundamental to our understanding of structural and functional mosaicism within the cells. For example, one of the hallmarks of mature NMJs is the presence of a high density of AChRs (104 receptors/μm2) at the tops of folds in the postsynaptic membrane (20Salpeter M.M. Harris R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These receptors are trapped in a region of the plasma membrane directly apposed to the nerve terminal, degrade very slowly (21Xu R. Salpeter M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and are unable to diffuse within the plasma membrane. Initially, AChR aggregation is a muscle-intrinsic process that does not require innervation (22Lin W. Burgess R.W. Dominguez B. Pfaff S.L. Sanes J.R. Lee K.F. Nature. 2001; 410: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 23Yang X. Arber S. William C. Li L. Tanabe Y. Jessell T.M. Birchmeier C. Burden S.J. Neuron. 2001; 30: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), but reorganization of the AChRs within the membrane is regulated by secretion from the motor nerve of agrin, a heparan-sulfate proteoglycan (24McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Agrin acts via MuSK, a muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, together with a myotube-associated specific coreceptor within the postsynaptic membrane (25Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), an important requirement for enhanced linkage of AChRs to the cytoskeleton (34Borges L.S. Ferns M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As a specialized domain of skeletal myofibers, the NMJ offers insights into DG functions in fundamental cellular processes. For example, DG functions in basement membrane assembly by anchoring AChE via interactions with perlecan (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35Peng H.B. Xie H. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that the glycosylation of α-DG is regulated by the nerve and that it functions in NMJ formation (37Leschziner A. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Gee S.H. Butterworth J. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Also, we proposed that α- and β-DG function coordinately to assemble an extracellular and intracellular matrix of proteins (38Jacobson C. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Ferns M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6340-6348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with a recent report suggesting novel extracellular interactions for DG (39McDearmon E.L. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44868-44873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, we have taken advantage of the well defined role of DG at NMJs to determine whether the extracellular domains of DG function independently in AChR aggregation. We describe here that the functions of DG in AChR aggregation and basement membrane assembly in myotubes can be rescued by viral expression of full-length DG in DG-/- myotube cultures. Interestingly, DG constructs consisting of α-DG alone or of α-DG and the extracellular regions of β-DG can regulate aspects of AChR aggregation, namely the size of AChR aggregates, the distribution of microclusters within them, and the assembly of laminin at these aggregates. The implications of these observations for synapse formation and signaling via DG are discussed. Generation of Dystroglycan cDNA Constructs—Dystroglycan cDNA constructs (Fig. 1A) were generated by PCR amplification using specific oligonucleotides for mouse dag1. PCR products were subcloned inframe into the peGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech) to generate eGFP fusion transcripts. The CD4 ectodomain/transmembrane sequence expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. R. Dunn (McGill University). Constructs α-DG and α/ΔectoβDG were obtained from Dr. S. Winder (University of Sheffield, UK). All constructs were sequenced for validation (Genome Center, McGill University). Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Replication-defective adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy system (Qbiogene) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, eGFP, CD4-eGFP, DG, α-DG, ΔcytoDG, and α/ΔectoβDG cDNA fusion constructs were subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pShuttle-CMV. All vectors were linearized using PmeI, and cotransfected with pAdEasy-1 into the BJ5183 electrocompetent E. coli strain. Recombinants were screened by colony size and by restriction digests as described (40He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar). Recombinants were linearized using PacI, purified, and transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Adenovirus production was observed by plaque formation, and particles were isolated from cellular lysates and amplified through several rounds of infections in HEK293 cells. Titers were determined by TCID50 infection test as described by the manufacturer (Qbiogene). Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infections—DG+/+ and DG-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells were generated previously (12Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained undifferentiated on a layer of mitomycin (Sigma)-treated neomycin-resistant STO feeder cells (ATCC) in culture medium consisting of 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (Invitrogen), 20% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 7 × 10-4 % β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1000 units per ml of leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon). For differentiation, ES and feeder cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), resuspended in fresh growth medium, and plated twice on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes for 1 h (preplating steps) to remove feeder cells. ES cells were resuspended in differentiation medium made of 85% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (Invitrogen), 15% horse serum (Wisent), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% dimethyl sulfoxate (Me2SO; Sigma). Cells were counted and seeded on the inside lid of bacterial Petri dishes in 20-μl drops containing 800 cells. They were grown for 4 days at 37 ° in these hanging drops after which they were transferred to 0.1% gelatin-coated dishes in differentiation medium containing 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium (Invitrogen) for 20-25 days. ES cell cultures were infected at day 15-20 with 108 adenoviral plaque-forming units for 16 h in differentiation medium. Quantification of AChR Aggregation—Soluble recombinant rat agrin was a generous gift from Dr. M. Ferns (University of California, Davis). To assay AChR clustering in ES cells, differentiated cultures (20-25 days old) were treated with 0.5 nm agrin for 16 h. Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Invitrogen) and incubated with 2 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 25 °. Cells were washed twice with DPBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 37 ° for 20 min. Cultures were mounted on glass coverslips using ImmunoFloure mounting medium (ICN) and observed with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Digital images observed with a ×63 Zeiss objective were captured with a QImaging Retiga 1300 10-bit digital camera under normalized exposures and quantifications of cluster number, size, and density were generated using Northern Eclipse software (Empix). For confocal images, cultures were observed using a Leica DM LFSA microscope equipped with an Ultraview confocal scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and images were captured and processed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). For cells infected with adenovirus, AChR aggregate size was determined by circling each aggregate with a trace from the free hand tool and by measuring total area as calibrated for the objective used (Fig. 2B). AChR aggregate density was determined as a percentage of total aggregate area (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 41Shiao T. Fond A. Deng B. Wehling-Henricks M. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Tidball J.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), where the area of each aggregate that was labeled with α-bungarotoxin was highlighted using the threshold function (values of 18-255 pixels), and the highlighted area was determined within the traced area (Fig. 2B). AChR aggregate numbers were determined by counting the number of aggregates present in each microscopic field observed. At least 30 nonoverlapping fields were visualized for each set of cultures, and data were collected from at least three separate experiments. For statistical analyses, we normalized the data obtained as described above for AChR aggregate size and density by a logarithmic transformation, and we then performed multiple comparisons using unbalanced one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons (Tukey-Kramer and Fisher's tests) on the normalized data. All probability (p) values stated in the text are for analysis on normalized values. All analyses and percentile plots were generated using StatView 4.5 package (Abacus) or SAS (SPSS). All images and figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Immunocytochemistry—Cultures were stained with α-bungarotoxin as described above and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/DPBS at 37 ° for 20 min. If applicable, cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 10 min at 25 °. Cells were blocked with 10% donkey or horse serum at 25 ° for 1 h. This was followed by incubation with either monoclonal antibody IIH6 to α-DG (1:50) (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), rabbit anti-sera to laminin (homemade, 1:100), anti-GFP antibody (Living Colors; 1:50) (Clontech), or rabbit anti-sera to β-DG (homemade, 1:100) at 25 ° for 1 h. Cells were washed extensively with DPBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:100), aminomethylcoumarin acetate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:100), or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), at 25 ° for 1 h. Following a second series of washing, cells were mounted on glass coverslips and analyzed as described above. For laminin-AChR overlap observations, we scored positive only the aggregates that discretely overlapped with laminin immunoreactivity. We normalized to the total number of clusters observed in each case. A minimum of 20 nonoverlapping fields was scored in three experiments for each set of cultures, and differences were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Fisher's test. A simple model for DG function predicts that extracellular interactions mediated by α-DG would in turn signal intracellularly via β-DG. This model is complicated by the fact that most ligands for α-DG bind to an extended carbohydrate side chain (for review see Ref. 42Montanaro F. Carbonetto S. Neuron. 2003; 37: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and transmembrane signaling would require the unprecedented translation of this interaction into conformational changes in both α- and β-DG. Considering that interactions of the α subunit are extracellular and of the β subunit are intracellular, we suggest to determine whether α- and β-DG might have independent functions in organizing cell surface proteins by generating a series of DG cDNA constructs bearing deletions of β-DG (Fig. 1). We fused these cDNA constructs at their C terminus to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP; see “Experimental Procedures”). In this study, we focused on constructs that reveal distinct functions of α-DG versus full-length DG (Fig. 1). Construct DG encodes full-length α- and β-DG subunits; construct ΔcytoDG lacks all cytoplasmic domains of β-DG; construct α-DG encodes the α subunit of DG; construct ΔectoβDG lacks the extracellular domains of β-DG leaving its transmembrane region following the C-terminal end of α-DG. All constructs were transiently expressed by infecting muscle cells derived from DG-/- (dag1) ES cells (12Cote P.D. Moukhles H. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) using serotype Ad5 replication-defective adenoviruses under the CMV promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). DG-/- cells form diffuse aggregates of AChRs in response to agrin (Fig. 2A), and the area occupied by the AChR microclusters as well as their density were quantified by computer-assisted image analysis (Fig. 2B) (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Expression of DG Constructs in Myotubes Derived from DG-/- ES Cells—Infection of agrin-treated myotubes with DG-expressing adenoviruses resulted in a diffuse intracellular accumulation of the eGFP-tagged constructs (Fig. 3, A-L), a consequence of the constitutive nature of the promoter. To assess the expression of these constructs at the cell surface in infected myotubes, we immunolabeled cultures using three antibodies as follows: monoclonal antibody (mAb) IIH6 against glycosylated α-DG on nonpermeabilized cultures (43Gee S.H. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Cell. 1994; 77: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) to visualize cell surface expression; a rabbit antiserum to the last 15 amino acids of β-DG (38Jacobson C. Montanaro F. Lindenbaum M. Carbonetto S. Ferns M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6340-6348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on permeabilized cultures; and an anti-serum to eGFP. DG+/+ cells infected with a control eGFP-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 3, A and B) showed regions of aggregated surface labeling of α-DG (Fig. 3A′) and of β-DG (Fig. 3B′) in a distribution that is identical to uninfected DG+/+ cells (data not shown). As expected, DG-/- cells infected with eGFP (Fig. 3, C and D) expressed neither α-DG (Fig. 3C′) nor β-DG (Fig. 3D′). Expression of full-length DG in DG-/- cells (Fig. 3, E and F) showed aggregates of α-DG (Fig. 3E′) and β-DG (Fig. 3F′) similar to that in DG+/+ cells (Fig. 3, A′ and B′). Our immunofluorescence analysis indicated approximately equivalent levels of expression of DG constructs in DG-/- cells when compared with endogenous levels in DG+/+ cells. Expression of ΔcytoDG (Fig. 3, G and H) resulted in surface expression of this construct which encompasses both α-DG (Fig. 3G′) and the extracellular and transmembrane regions of β-DG as detected by anti-eGFP (Fig. 3H′). In this instance, labeling with mAb IIH6, which recognizes a functional carbohydrate epitope on α-DG, indicated that proper glycosylation of α-DG does not require β-DG cytoplasmic domains. Expression of α-DG lacking any anchor to the cell surface via β-DG (Fig. 3, I and J) also resulted in its surface deposition on myotubes as detected by both IIH6 and anti-GFP antibodies in nonpermeabilized cells (Fig. 3, I′ and J′). The distribution of this α-DG construct on DG-/- cells was similar to the endogenous α-DG expression observed on DG+/+ cells (Fig. 3A′). α-DG was not readily detected on the surface of infected non-muscle cells (data not shown), suggesting that α-DG, when expressed alone, preferably bound to muscle cells. The heterogeneity of ES-derived cell cultures and their low abundance in myotubes prevented us from assessing glycosylation or expression of α-DG by Western blot analysis. Nonetheless, in another study, we determined that expression of α-DG alone in adenovirus-infected COS cells resulted in its secretion into the culture medium (data not shown), and it could be identified by Western blotting using mAb IIH6 (data not shown). Finally, expression of construct α/ΔectoβDG (Fig. 3, K and L) showed surface labeling of α-DG (Fig. 3K′) and β-DG (Fig. 3L′) as observed for endogenous or ectopic full-length DG (Fig. 3, E′ and F′). Taken together, these observations show that DG cDNA constructs could be expressed in myotubes derived from DG-/- ES cells using adenoviruses and that both α- and β-DG were normally expressed at the cell surface. Proper surface targeting and glycosylation of α-DG could occur in the absence of β-DG expression. Moreover, the association of a form of α-DG lacking any anchorage to β-DG still was able to interact with cell surface proteins either in the ECM or in the plasma membrane possibly affecting interactions and functions of the DG complex. Expression of Dystroglycan in DG-/- Myotubes Restores the Size of AChR Aggregates—Myotubes derived from both DG+/+ and DG-/- ES cells express AChRs and respond to soluble agrin by forming aggregates of receptors on their surfaces (17Grady R.M.

Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), indicating that DG is downstream of the agrin/MuSK signaling pathway (44Montanaro F. Gee S.H. Jacobson C. Lindenbaum M.H. Froehner S.C. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1250-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the absence of DG, these agrin-induced aggregates are an abnormally large, diffuse, and unstable collection of microclusters of AChRs (Fig. 2A) (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these DG-deficient aggregates lack laminin, merosin, perlecan, and AChE (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether α- and β-DG act only as a complex in response to MuSK activation, we infected DG-/- myotubes with adenoviruses expressing either eGFP or DG constructs (Fig. 1), and 5-7-day post-infection, treated the cultures with a saturating concentration (0.5 nm) of soluble agrin to induce AChR aggregation at the surface of myotubes (45Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and labeled AChRs using rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin. As controls for the assays, we used soluble cytoplasmic eGFP or submembrane eGFP (CD4-eGFP). This latter construct allowed us to control for any effect due to membrane expression of eGFP on AChR aggregation. Expression of either control constructs in DG+/+ or DG-/- cells did not affect the aggregation of AChRs after agrin treatment (Figs. 2A and 4). After agrin treatment, DG+/+ myotubes infected with eGFP had several small, tight aggregates of AChRs (Fig. 4) with about 85% of aggregates below 100 μm2 (mean size, 45.8 ± 5.0 μm2; see Fig. 5). DG-/- myotubes expressing eGFP responded to agrin, but the resulting aggregates were more diffuse, punctate, and significantly larger (Figs. 2A and 4, inset) with 50% or more of the aggregates above 100 μm2 (mean size, 121.5 ± 9.9 μm2; p < 0.0001; see Fig. 5). Essentially identical results were found in DG+/+ and DG-/- cells uninfected with adenoviruses (Fig. 2A and data not shown) (18Jacobson C. Cote P.D. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or in myotubes expressing CD4-eGFP (Fig. 2A) (mean size, 101.0 ± 8.1 μm2; p < 0.05). When DG-/- cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing full-length DG, AChR aggregates were smaller and essentially identical to those in DG+/+ cells (Fig. 4). About 80% of the aggregates were below 100 μm2 (mean, 49.5 ± 4.9 μm2; see Fig. 5), were not significantly different in size from DG+/+ cells (p = 0.7787), and were clearly smaller than those on DG-/- cells expressing either eGFP or CD4-eGFP controls (p < 0.0001). Thus, expression of full-length DG in DG-/- myotubes w"

Recombination is initiated by cleavage of conserved recombination signal sequences (RSS) by RAG1 and RAG2 during lymphocyte development. Recent evidence demonstrates that recombination can occur at noncanonical RSS sites within Ig genes or at other loci, outside the context of normal lymphocyte receptor gene rearrangement. We have characterized the ability of the RAG proteins to bind and cleave a cryptic RSS (cRSS) located within an Ig VH gene segment. The RAG proteins bound with sequence specificity to either the consensus RSS or the cRSS. The RAG proteins nick the cRSS on both the top and bottom strands, thereby bypassing the formation of the DNA hairpin intermediate observed in RAG cleavage of canonical RSS substrates. We propose that the RAG proteins may utilize an alternative mechanism for double-stranded DNA cleavage, depending on the substrate sequence. These results have implications for further diversification of the antigen receptor repertoire as well as the role of the RAG proteins in genomic instability.

The primary repertoire of antigen-binding receptors is produced by V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development (1Lewis S.M. Adv.

Functional Ig and T cell receptor genes are initially generated by recombination in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, by assembly of component V (variable), J (joining), and sometimes D (diversity) gene segments (5Hesslein D. Schatz D. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 78: 169-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to V(D)J recombination, the Ig repertoire is further expanded by somatic hypermutation in germinal centers (GC) 4The abbreviations used are: GC, germinal center(s); CDR, complementarity-determining region; RSS, recombination signal sequence; cRSS, cryptic recombination signal sequence; DSB, double-stranded breaks; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HMGB1, high mobility group protein B1; HRR, homologous recombination repair; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining; nt, nucleotide; IgH, Ig heavy chain; MHMN, mutant heptamer and nonamer. of peripheral lymphoid organs, where Ig class switching and B cell maturation to plasma and memory cells also occurs (6de Villartay J.P. Fischer A. Durandy A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Together, these mechanisms produce the almost infinite variety of Ig specificities required to recognize all possible antigens the organism may encounter. Site-specific DNA cleavage in the V(D)J process is catalyzed by the recombination activating proteins, RAG1 and RAG2 (3Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The site specificity of the DNA cleavage reaction is governed by the recombination signal sequence (RSS) that flanks each of the V, D, and J gene segments. The RSS contains conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by 12 ± 1 or 23 ± 1 poorly conserved base pairs, referred to as the 12-RSS and 23-RSS, respectively. After DNA cleavage, the gene segments are joined by factors that mediate DNA repair via the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Efficient V(D)J recombination between two gene segments requires that each be flanked by RSS of differing spacer length, a restriction referred to as the 12/23 rule (3Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The RAG proteins together produce DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) between the RSS heptamer and the flanking coding sequence via two concerted steps (7McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). First, the RAG proteins form a single-stranded nick 5′ to the RSS heptamer. In the second step, the RAG proteins mediate transesterification of the newly formed 3′-OH with the phosphate group directly opposite on the complementary strand. Overall, RAG-catalyzed DNA DSB yields coding sequences terminated by covalently sealed hairpins (coding ends) and blunt-ended breaks terminated at RSS heptamers (signal ends). The 12/23 rule is enforced at formation of the coding end hairpins, since transesterification preferentially occurs in the context of the synaptic complex, which consists of the RAG proteins bound to both a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS (8Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Yu K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nicking reaction may occur with RAG proteins bound to a single 12- or 23-RSS. Enforcement of the 12/23 rule at the hairpin formation step ensures that production of DSB occurs at correct sequences, thereby reducing the possibility of cleavage at incorrect sites. In addition to their role in formation of the primary repertoire of Ig genes, the RAG proteins also mediate secondary recombination events on Ig gene loci that have been previously rearranged. Immature B cells that have defective or self-reactive B cell receptors must be removed from the repertoire. This may occur by deletion of the cell or by a secondary recombination event, referred to as receptor editing (10Casellas R. Shih T. Kleinewietfeld M. Rakonjac J. Nemazee D. Rajewsky K. Nussenzweig M. Science. 2001; 291: 1503-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Nemazee D. Hogquist K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this case, the RAG proteins generate a de novo rearrangement of Ig genes (generally the light chain genes), which yields a modification of the Ig receptor specificity, and thus mediates tolerance. Secondary rearrangements at the Ig heavy chain (IgH) locus were believed to be unlikely due to the deletion of the remaining D segments after the primary recombination event. However, several reports indicate that secondary rearrangements can occur at this locus and are thought to require the use of cRSS elements embedded within the VH genes. For example, a cRSS that is conserved at the 3′ end of all VH gene segments has been proposed to govern RAG-mediated receptor editing, in which an entire VH gene segment replaces a portion of the rearranged VH gene, resulting in the addition of several nucleotides at the V-DJ border (12Radic M. Zouali M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 505-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To accomplish complete VH gene replacement, it has been proposed that the RAG proteins create DSB at both the cRSS and the conventional RSS flanking the replacing VH gene segment. Consistent with this proposal, recent studies demonstrated that in in vitro DNA cleavage assays, the RAG proteins create DSB at the cRSS combined with either a 12- or 23-RSS via the standard nick-hairpin mechanism (13Zhang Z. Zemlin M. Wang Y.H. Munfus D. Huye L.E. Findley H.W. Bridges L.S. Roth D.B. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2003; 19: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the RAG proteins can presumably bind to both the cRSS and the conventional 12- or 23-RSS in a synaptic complex. Additional secondary rearrangement events have been proposed to occur in mature, peripheral B cells in a process referred to as receptor revision (14Kouskoff V. Nemazee D. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Evidence for novel receptor revision events at the IgH locus have been reported in peripheral human B cells, which include tonsillar B cells (15Wilson P.C. Wilson K. Liu Y.J. Banchereau J. Pascual V. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), in the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis patients (16Itoh K. Meffre E. Albesiano E. Farber A. Dines D. Stein P. Asnis S. Furie R. Jain R. Chiorazzi N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1151-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in NOD/SCID mice reconstituted with human cord blood mononuclear cells (17Kolar G.R. Capra J.D. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 60: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and in certain B cell lymphomas (18Lenze D. Greiner A. Knorr C. Anagnostopoulos I. Stein H. Hummel M. Mol. Pathol. 2003; 56: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Bellan C. Lazzi S. Zazzi M. Lalinga A.V. Palummo N. Galieni P. Marafioti T. Tonini T. Cinti C. Leoncini L. Pileri S.A. Tosi P. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 11: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was found that the 5′ portion of a rearranged VH gene was replaced with the homologous portion of another VH gene segment to form a hybrid antibody gene. In human tonsillar B cells, somatically hypermutated and rearranged VH 4–34 gene segments apparently recombined with other members of the VH 4 family such that the original CDR3, formed by primary V(D)J rearrangement, was conserved (15Wilson P.C. Wilson K. Liu Y.J. Banchereau J. Pascual V. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The most frequently identified “donor” sequences were rearranged VH 4–34 alleles, with recipient sequences derived from VH 4–39 and VH 4–61 gene segments. Due to the high degree of sequence similarity between VH gene segments, particularly those of the same family, it is impossible to determine the exact break point at which hybrid formation occurred. However, inspection of the sequences revealed that each hybrid had been formed in close proximity to a cRSS, leading to the hypothesis that these secondary recombination events were mediated by RAG1 and RAG2 (15Wilson P.C. Wilson K. Liu Y.J. Banchereau J. Pascual V. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Despite the compelling evidence for RAG-mediated receptor revision, the re-expression of the RAG proteins in GC B cells in humans remains controversial (20Jankovic M. Casellas R. Yannoutsos N. Wardemann H. Nussenzweig M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 485-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Hillion S. Rochas C. Youinou P. Jamin C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1050: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and alternative mechanisms based on the induction of homologous recombination following cleavage by activation-induced cytidine deaminase have been proposed (22Darlow J.M. Stott D.I. Immunology. 2005; 114: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, a recent report identified hybrid IgH genes in B cells of human B cell reconstituted NOD/SCID mice, indicating that such events can occur independently from the GC (17Kolar G.R. Capra J.D. Scand. J. Immunol. 2004; 60: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); thus, an exclusive role for activation-induced cytidine deaminase is unlikely. To ascertain if the reported VH gene replacements are RAG-mediated, we tested the activity of the RAG proteins on a cRSS (located 3′ to CDR2 of VH 4–34), which is closely similar to the consensus 12-RSS. Whereas the RAG proteins could efficiently perform double-stranded cleavage at the cRSS, it did not occur via a mechanism consistent with V(D)J recombination. Rather, the cleavage occurred by a process that would bypass the requirement for the 12/23 rule. In addition, the resulting cleavage products would be viable substrates for either NHEJ or homologous recombination repair (HRR), which particularly in the latter case could lead to the hybrid IgH genes that have been observed in peripheral human B cells. Protein Expression and Purification—Purified RAG1 and RAG2 proteins consisted of the core regions, which are the minimal regions required for DNA recombination activity (3Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). MBP-core RAG1 (residues 384–1008 of the full-length RAG1 protein fused to maltose-binding protein) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (23Arbuckle J.L. Fauss L.J. Simpson R. Ptaszek L.M. Rodgers K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37093-37101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were disrupted by sonication, and protein was purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin, followed by ion exchange chromatography through a Q-Sepharose fast flow column. In the final purification step, the fusion protein was chromatographed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. The protein was judged to be >95% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentration of the purified protein was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 129.5 mm–1 cm–1. GST-core RAG2 consisted of residues 1–387 of the full-length RAG2 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase. GST-core RAG2, either alone or co-expressed with MBP-core RAG1, was transiently expressed and purified from 293T cells as previously described (24Spanopoulou E. Zaitseva F. Wang F.-H. Santagata S. Baltimore D. Panayotou G. Cell. 1996; 87: 263-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell lysis, the fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-linked agarose resin, followed by extensive washing, and then released from the resin with purification buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione. Mammalian expressed proteins were judged to be >90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentrations were determined by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-GST or anti-MBP antibodies where appropriate. Standard curves were constructed using known concentrations of GST or MBP proteins, which were subjected to SDS-PAGE on the same gel as the respective GST- or MBP-RAG fusion protein. Purified HMGB1 was obtained from Sigma. Construction of Oligonucleotide Duplexes—Oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Integrated DNA Technologies). The 12-RSS, 23-RSS, and VH 4–34 cRSS substrates were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. The sequences of the top strand oligonucleotides were as follows: 12-RSS, d(GATATGGCTCGTCTTACACAGTGATATAGACCTTAACAAAAACCTCCAATCGA); 23-RSS, d(GGCTCGTCTTACACAGTGATGGAAGCTCTATCGGATCTCCGACAAAAACCTCGAGCGGAG); and VH 4–34 cRSS, d(CGTCCCTCAAGAGTCGAGTCACCATATCAGTAGACACGTCCAAGAACCAGTCT). The mutant heptamer and nonamer (MHMN) 12-RSS oligonucleotide sequences are identical to that of consensus 12-RSS, except that the heptamer sequence (CACAGTG) has been replaced by the sequence GAGAAGC, and the nonamer sequence (ACAAAAACC) has been replaced by the sequence AGGCTCTTG. Prior to annealing, either the top or bottom strand of each duplex was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. To generate nicked substrates, two separate oligonucleotides were synthesized that corresponded to the sequence 5′ and 3′ to the nick site, respectively. The oligonucleotides were annealed to the full-length complement. For example, to construct the duplex containing the nick 5′ to the heptamer in the consensus 12-RSS, two oligonucleotides, one containing bases 1–16 and the other bases 17–53 of the top strand, were annealed with the 12-RSS bottom strand oligonucleotide. In each experiment, the oligonucleotide 3′ to the nick was phosphorylated at the 5′ end using nonradiolabeled ATP. In addition, prior to annealing, either the oligonucleotide 5′ to the nick or full-length complement were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. To anneal substrate duplexes, the appropriate oligonucleotides were combined at equimolar ratios and heated to 95 °C, and the mixture was slowly cooled to ambient temperature. The nicked VH 4–34 con-hep cRSS substrate was identical to the wild type VH 4–34 cRSS sequence, except that the cryptic heptamer (CACCATA) was replaced with the consensus heptamer (CACAGTG). Likewise, in the nicked VH 4–34 con-non cRSS sequence, the cryptic nonamer (CCAAGAACC) was replaced with the consensus nonamer (ACAAAAACC). Single RSS Substrate DNA Cleavage Assays Analyzed by Denaturing Polyacrylamide Gels—Single RSS (or cRSS) DNA cleavage assays were performed with buffer containing 5 mm MnCl2, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. MBP-core RAG1 and GST-core RAG2 were mixed with 1 nm 32P-labeled duplex substrate and incubated for the time indicated at 37 °C. In the experiments with the fusion proteins expressed separately, MBP-core RAG1 was incubated with GST-core RAG2 for 15 min at 4 °C prior to the addition to DNA substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide gel loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The cleavage products were separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging using an Amersham Biosciences SI PhosphorImager. Where indicated, bands were quantitated using the program ImageJ. DNA Cleavage Assays Analyzed by Nondenaturing Polyacrylamide Gels—DNA cleavage assays analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels were performed as described above with the following exceptions. The RAG proteins were incubated with 1 nm radiolabeled oligonucleotide duplex for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, EDTA and SDS were added to each sample to final concentrations of 7.5 mm and 0.4%, respectively. The cleavage products were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. DNA Coupled Cleavage Assays—DNA coupled cleavage assays were performed as described under “Single RSS Substrate DNA Cleavage Assays Analyzed by Denaturing Polyacrylamide Gels” with the following exceptions. The reactions were performed in 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. MBP-core RAG1 and GST-core RAG2 were incubated with unlabeled consensus 12-RSS or VH 4–34 cRSS for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 10 nm 32P-labeled 23-RSS duplex substrate for 1 h at 37 °C. Measurement of Protein-DNA Interactions—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrating binding of the RAG proteins to consensus 12-RSS and VH 4–34 cRSS substrates were performed as previously described (25Godderz L.J. Rahman N.S. Risinger G.M. Arbuckle J.L. Rodgers K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EMSA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on discontinuous, nondenaturing gels of 3.5/8% polyacrylamide and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimaging using a Molecular Dynamics SI phosphorimager. Bands were quantitated using the program ImageJ. Specificity of Protein-DNA Interactions—The buffer used in the competition assays was the same as for the protein-DNA interaction assays (25Godderz L.J. Rahman N.S. Risinger G.M. Arbuckle J.L. Rodgers K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Competition assays were accomplished by adding MBP-core RAG1 and GST-core RAG2 proteins to a mixture of 1 nm 32P-labeled VH 4–34 cRSS duplex with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor DNA (5–10 nm), which was either the VH 4–34 cRSS or MHMN 12-RSS oligonucleotide duplex. Several cRSS have been implicated in partial VH gene replacement (supplemental Fig. 1). In these cases, the replacement resulted in a portion of the VH gene replacing the homologous region in the rearranged V-DJ gene to create a hybrid IgH gene (Fig. 1A). Since one of the more commonly observed hybrid joints occurred at a cRSS with a sequence closely similar to the consensus 12-RSS (Fig. 1B), this event was proposed to be RAG-mediated (15Wilson P.C. Wilson K. Liu Y.J. Banchereau J. Pascual V. Capra J.D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test this proposal, we have examined the action of the RAG proteins on this cRSS, which we refer to as VH 4–34 cRSS. Binding of the RAG Proteins to VH 4–34 cRSS Versus Consensus 12-RSS—To confirm that the RAG proteins could bind the VH 4–34 cRSS, EMSA were used (Fig. 2). RAG1-RAG2 complexes bound to both the consensus 12-RSS (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5) and the VH 4–34 cRSS (lanes 9 and 10) substrates. At the protein concentrations used, the RAG proteins shifted ∼50% less of the latter substrate, corresponding to a decreased binding affinity of 2–3-fold to the VH 4–34 cRSS compared with the consensus 12-RSS substrate. Protein-DNA complexes were formed inefficiently with RAG1 alone (lanes 2 and 7), requiring prolonged exposure for detection (data not shown). As expected, in the absence of RAG1, there is no detectable complex formed between RAG2 and either DNA substrate (lanes 3 and 8) even with longer exposure times (data not shown). The addition of increasing concentrations of RAG2 produced substantial interaction of the RAG proteins together to both the consensus 12-RSS (lanes 4 and 5) and the VH 4–34 cRSS (lanes 9 and 10). These results are consistent with previous reports that RAG2 enhances the affinity of RAG1 for the DNA by up to 20-fold (25Godderz L.J. Rahman N.S. Risinger G.M. Arbuckle J.L. Rodgers K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The RAG proteins bound with detectable sequence specificity to the VH 4–34 cRSS as determined by competition assays (Fig. 2B). Each sample contained the combined RAG proteins with radiolabeled VH 4–34 cRSS. To each sample, increasing concentrations (5–10 nm) of unlabeled VH 4–34 cRSS duplex (lanes 2 and 3) or mutated 12-RSS (lanes 4 and 5) were added. The mutated 12-RSS duplex (referred to as MHMN 12-RSS) was identical to consensus 12-RSS, except that the heptamer and nonamer were replaced with unrelated sequences. With the higher concentration of VH 4–34 cRSS competitor, <4% of radiolabeled protein-DNA complexes were detected (lane 1 versus lane 3). In contrast, the MHMN 12-RSS duplex was a weaker competitor, since 19% of the radiolabeled complex remained at the higher competitor concentration (lane 1 versus lane 5). The RAG Proteins Catalyze Cleavage of the VH 4–34 cRSS—We tested the ability of RAG1-RAG2 complexes to cleave the VH 4–34 cRSS substrate using an in vitro DNA cleavage assay. The RAG proteins were incubated with the consensus RSS or cRSS substrates in Mn2+-containing buffers and analyzed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, the DNA strands remain annealed to each other; thus, the appearance of smaller products demonstrated the creation of a DSB. Upon the addition of both RAG proteins to the radiolabeled consensus 12-RSS duplex, a product of faster mobility was formed, presumably corresponding to the DNA hairpin product (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed with the VH 4–34 cRSS duplex in that a cleavage product was produced upon the addition of both RAG proteins (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that the RAG proteins are capable of creating DSB on the cRSS substrate. To determine where DNA cleavage occurred in the VH 4–34 cRSS substrate, the in vitro DNA cleavage assays were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4). As expected, the reaction containing consensus 12-RSS duplex with the top strand 5′-labeled yielded the nicked product (at the expected location 5′ to the heptamer) and the hairpin product (Fig. 4B, lane 4) in the presence of both RAG proteins. Moreover, when the bottom strand of the consensus 12-RSS duplex was 5′-labeled, treatment with both RAG proteins produced the expected byproduct of hairpin formation (Fig. 4B, lane 8). In comparison, using the VH 4–34 cRSS duplex as substrate, the RAG proteins together mediated cleavage on the top strand (Fig. 4D, lane 4) as well as on the complementary bottom strand (Fig. 4E, lane 4). However, the major product formed from the top strand was 21 nucleotides (nt) in length (Fig. 4D, lane 4). This fragment resulted from cleavage not 5′ of the CAC, as expected, but between the A and C (at CA↓C). A minor cleavage product of 34 nt was evident on overexposure of the gel, which was probably due to cleavage at a second CAC sequence in the VH 4–34 cRSS duplex. On the bottom strand of the VH 4–34 cRSS duplex, two major pairs of cleavage products at 15 and 16 nt and 33 and 34 nt in length were produced upon incubation with both RAG proteins (Fig. 4E, lane 4). We observed identical cleavage products on the cRSS substrate using RAG proteins (MBP-core RAG1 and GST-core RAG2) that were co-expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 4, D and E, lanes 6), showing that the activity is independent of the expression system for RAG1. Moreover, no cleavage products from the MHMN 12-RSS substrate were observed upon incubation with RAG1 and RAG2, indicating that cleavage is specific to RSS or cRSS sequences (data not shown). Thus, the RAG proteins are able to perform double-stranded DNA cleavage on the VH 4–34 cRSS substrate, although the formation of hairpin products was not observed. Kinetic analyses of the DNA cleavage reactions with the cRSS substrate were also inconsistent with a nick-hairpin mechanism (Fig. 5). In the normal nick-hairpin mechanism, the top strand is nicked by the RAG1-RAG2 complex, and then hairpins are formed by attack of the bottom strand by the 3′-hydroxyl; thus, formation of the hairpin product lags behind that of the nicked product, as observed for products from the consensus 12-RSS substrate (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–5). Likewise, the appearance of the cleavage product from the bottom strand matched that of hairpin formation (Fig. 5A, lanes 7–10). However, with the VH 4–34 cRSS substrate, the sequential appearance of two cleavage products of n and 2n nt in length, along with formation of a corresponding product on the opposite strand, were not apparent (Fig. 5B). Instead, cleavage on the top strand occurred within the cryptic heptamer, yielding the 21-nt product with no additional products of ∼42 nt formed. With the 32P-labeled bottom strand substrate, products of 15 and 16 nt and 33 and 34 nt in length were produced, which could correspond to hairpin formation. However, significant levels of products on the top strand of ∼38–39 nt in length were not observed. RAG1 and RAG2 proteins expressed separately showed similar results in the kinetics of DNA cleavage as compared with the co-expressed proteins (data not shown). However, the 15- and 16-nt products on the bottom strand were formed more efficiently by the co-expressed proteins. The RAG Proteins Do Not Cleave the 4–34 Cryptic RSS via a Hairpin Intermediate—To further show that the RAG proteins did not efficiently catalyze hairpin formation on the VH 4–34 cRSS substrate, nicked substrates were used in the in vitro DNA cleavage assays. To test if the double-stranded cleavage of the VH 4–34 cRSS can occur via the nick-hairpin mechanism, we used the nicked VH 4–34 cRSS substrate, in which the nick occurred between bases 21 and 22 of the cRSS duplex (Fig. 6A, lane 1). With the addition of both RAG proteins, the input substrate, along with minor levels of the 42-nt hairpin, were observed (Fig. 6A, lane 2). The formation of the hairpin product was very inefficient and only occurred after long incubation time with the RAG proteins. In contrast, the nicked VH 4–34 cRSS substrate with the bottom strand labeled at the 5′-end (Fig. 6A, lane 3), yielded efficient formation of the 33- and 34-nt products after incubation with the RAG proteins (Fig. 6A, lane 4). Significantly, the levels of the bottom strand 33- and 34-nt products at 30% of total DNA (lane 4) versus the 42-nt product from the 5′-labeled top strand at <2% of total DNA (lane 2) were not consistent with the same DNA cleavage event, demonstrating that the 33- and 34-nt fragments produced from the bottom strand were not due to the hairpin formation but rather to"

To investigate the functional importance of its coiled coil dimerization domain, a series of internal deletions including each individual residue between Lys-100 and Ala-105 (bΔK100-bΔA105), bΔK100-A103, and bΔK100-Q106 as well as a control bK100A missense mutation were prepared. All of the mutants supported assembly of ATP synthase, but all single-residue deletions failed to support growth on acetate, indicating a severe defect in oxidative phosphorylation, and bΔK100-Q106 displayed moderately reduced growth. The membrane-bound ATPase activities of these strains showed a related reduction in sensitivity to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicative of uncoupling. Analysis of dimerization of the soluble constructs of bΔK100 and the multiple-residue deletions by sedimentation equilibrium revealed reduced dimerization compared with wild type for all deletions, with bΔK100-Q106 most severely affected. In cross-linking studies it was found that F1-ATPase can mediate the dimerization of some soluble b constructs but did not mediate dimerization of bΔK100 and bΔK100-Q106; these two forms also were defective in F1 binding analyses. We conclude that defective dimerization of soluble b constructs severely affects F1 binding in vitro, yet allows assembly of ATP synthase in vivo. The highly uncoupled nature of enzymes with single-residue deletions in b indicates that the b subunit serves an active function in energy coupling rather than just holding on to the F1 sector.

This function is proposed to depend on proper, specific interactions between the b subunits and F1. Oxidative or photophosphorylation, occurring in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, utilizes the enzyme F1F0-ATP synthase for the synthesis of ATP. The enzyme, which uses the energy of the transmembrane proton gradient developed through cellular respiration or light-driven H+ pumping, is composed of two sectors, both of which act as molecular motors. In the prototypical enzyme from Escherichia coli, the membrane-integral portion, F0, has three subunits in the stoichiometry ab2c10 and translocates protons through the membrane via rotation of the c subunit ring. The membrane-peripheral sector, F1, is comprised of five subunits, α3β3γδϵ. This portion of the enzyme houses the three catalytic nucleotide binding sites and couples rotation of the centrally located γϵ to the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP at catalytic sites found at α/β interfaces (1Boyer P.D.

The 156-residue b subunit forms an elongated dimer that has been divided into four domains: the transmembrane domain (residues 1–24), the tether domain (residues 25–52), the dimerization domain (residues 53–122), and the δ-binding domain (residues 123–156), as arranged from the N to the C terminus (6Dunn S.D.

Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a RHCC the sequence of the individual helices has a characteristic 11-residue “hendecad” repeat pattern (13Gruber M. Lupus A.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 14Gruber M. Lupus A.N. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In the 2-stranded RHCC of b, positions a and h are most often occupied by small residues, while positions d and e are often large, hydrophobic residues (6Dunn S.D. Cipriano D.J. Del Rizzo P.A. Futai M. Wada Y. Kaplan J.H. Handbook of ATPases. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004: 311-338Google Scholar, 8Del Rizzo P.A. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. Shilton B.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6875-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These four positions occupy one face of a helix, and it is anticipated that the hydrophobic surfaces form the core of the dimerization interaction.In the two-stranded RHCC the side chains cannot pack together in the favorable knobs-into-holes manner seen in left-handed coiled coils. Instead, it has been anticipated that steric clashes between side chains at the interface would lead to notable reduction in stability (15Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). While such clashes may be reduced by the small size of residues in a and h positions, the strength of b dimerization remains low relative to that of two-stranded left-handed coiled coils (11Revington M. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mutations to Ala-79, an “h” position in the hendecad, disrupt dimerization of soluble b constructs and prevent binding to F1-ATPase (16McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The occurrence of the unusual RHCC in ATP synthase suggests some functional importance of this specific structure.Mutants bearing deletions or insertions of a number of residues between positions 50 and 74 have been constructed (18Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36261-36266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Sorgen P.L. Caviston T.L. Perry R.C. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27873-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Deletions of up to 11 residues and insertions of up to 14 residues were tolerated, the mutants retaining biologically significant levels of activity. More recently, it was shown that insertion of 4 residues, which maintained the amphipathic nature of the helix, at several sites within the dimerization domain had no severe effects (20Bhatt D. Cole S.P. Grabar T.B. Claggett S.B. Cain B.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These findings imply an inherent flexibility and tolerance to length changes in the b dimer of ATP synthase and raise the question of whether more dramatic disruptions within the core of the b dimerization domain would cause structural or functional defects.In the present study, a series of single-residue deletion mutations between residues Lys-100 and Ala-105 in the dimerization domain and two multiple residue deletion mutations beginning at residue Lys-100 were constructed. We show that enzyme function and dimerization of b were negatively affected by some of these deletions, despite apparently normal assembly of ATP synthase. The results imply that maintenance of the hydrophobic interface of the b dimer is more important than the strength of dimerization and furthermore that b has a function beyond simply acting as a stator holding F1 and F0 together.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Methods—Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford et al. (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) for all soluble proteins except for b which was determined using the Advanced Reagent from Cytoskeleton Inc., or membranes that were determined using the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 15% separating gels according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Western blotting was performed as described previously (25Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) using antibodies that were labeled with 125I by the IODO-GEN method (26Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-b antibodies were raised in a rabbit and affinity-purified from serum. The anti-α monoclonal antibody (α-II) was a generous gift from Drs. Robert Aggeler and Rod Capaldi of the University of Oregon. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was carried out at the Dr. Don Rix Protein Identification Facility at the University of Western Ontario.Enzyme Assays—Membranes were prepared and assayed for ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent proton pumping as described (27Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Membranes were labeled with 50 μm DCCD in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then diluted into that same buffer to determine the membrane bound activity or into 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for the determination of the released activity.Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Plasmid pDM8 (10McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) encoding a synthetic form of the b subunit was the parent plasmid for all full-length b constructs. Similarly, all soluble forms of b were derived from pSD114 (10McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) encoding residues 34–156 of b with an SYW leader sequence. PCR with mutagenic primers was used to create the sequences shown in Fig. 1. Following initial cloning and sequencing, the mutations were moved into pDM8 and pSD114 using unique restriction sites in the synthetic b sequence (10McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Minimal Media Growth Tests—To address the in vivo effect of b mutations, full-length b constructs were expressed in the uncF deletion strain KM2 (28McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidative phosphorylation was tested by growth on M9 media plates supplemented with 0.2% acetate as the sole carbon source.Protein Purification—b67–156 was purified as described (11Revington M. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All other b proteins were purified as follows. MM294 cells (29Meselson M. Yuan R. Nature. 1968; 217: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) bearing plasmids encoding the soluble b constructs were grown in 2× YT medium (16 g of bacto-tryptone, 10 g of bacto-yeast, and 5 g of NaCl per liter) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Cultures were induced with isopropylthiogalactoside when A600 reached 0.8 and harvested when cultures reached stationary phase. Cells were washed once, and suspended in a volume corresponding to 10 times their packed wet weight in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 1 mm, and cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor for 90 min. The soluble fraction was precipitated with 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, dialyzed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and loaded onto a DEAE column that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Protein fractions were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. Appropriate fractions were pooled, loaded onto a Q-Sepharose HP column equilibrated with 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in the same buffer.Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical centrifuge equipped with absorption optics. A four-hole An-60Ti rotor and six-channel Epon charcoal centerpieces were used. Samples were dialyzed into 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl. Initial protein concentrations were 0.1 mg/ml. Samples were equilibrated for 24 h at 20 °C and 25,000 rpm. Equilibrium was judged to be attained when scans separated by 4 h were identical. Data were fitted using Microcal Origin 4 with the sedimentation routines supplied by Beckman. Partial specific volumes were determined by the method of Cohn and Edsall (30Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides. Reinhold, New York1943: 157-161Google Scholar), and the buffer density was calculated from published tables. Data were analyzed using models for either a single ideal species or else a monomer-dimer equilibrium using the monomer molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry.Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) Cross-linking Studies—1 μg of soluble b protein, previously dialyzed into 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 (TEA buffer), was diluted into 20 μl of TEA buffer supplemented with 1 mm BS3 (Pierce). The reaction proceeded for 10 min at room temperature and was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein samples containing 0.02 μg of b were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with an 125I-labeled antibody raised against the b subunit of ATP synthase. To test for F1 induced dimerization of b, 20 μg of F1 was also added to the cross-linking mixture. Control samples without F1 or BS3 were brought up to the experimental total volume using TEA buffer. F1 was moved into TEA buffer immediately prior to the experiment using a 5-ml centrifuge column containing Bio-Gel P-10 (Bio-Rad) resin.Competitive F1 Binding Assays—The ability of soluble b constructs to compete with a b affinity resin for the binding of F1 was performed essentially as described by McLachlin et al. (31McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 31.3 μg of F1, 0.8 μgof δ, and 20 μl of the affinity resin were mixed in a final volume of 250 μlof 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and gently incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Where indicated, soluble b subunit was added to either 1 or 10 μm prior to the incubation. The samples were then centrifuged to pellet the resin, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were boiled in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT. After centrifugation, 10 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.RESULTSPlasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—To investigate the importance of the coiled coil in the dimerization domain of the b subunit of ATP synthase, a series of b deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 1). Single-residue deletions in the heart of this domain would be expected to interfere with normal helix-helix interactions in the b subunit dimer. To ensure that the observed effects were not due to loss of specific interactions of any particular residue, we constructed a series of single-residue deletions encompassing residues 100–105 as well as multiresidue deletions bΔK100-A103 and bΔK100-Q106 and a control bK100A substitution. The deletions of 4 and 7 amino acids remove one or two turns of the α-helix, respectively, and were expected to have less severe effects on the coiled coil interactions than the single-residue deletions. All mutants were made in the b subunit expression plasmid pDM8 (10McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and expressed in the uncF deletion strain KM2 (28McCormick K.A. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7240-7248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations were also moved into the expression plasmid pSD114 (10McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which encodes a soluble form of the b subunit consisting of residues Glu-34 to Leu-156 of wild type b preceded by a MSYW leader sequence.Effect of b Mutations on Oxidative Phosphorylation—The b mutants were tested for their ability to support oxidative phosphorylation by growth on M9 agar plates containing acetate as the sole carbon source. All of the single-residue deletions prevented growth on acetate, indicating an inability to establish an adequate phosphorylation potential (Table 1). The other mutations did support growth on acetate indicating a functional ATP synthase, although the bΔK100-Q106 mutant showed slow growth giving rise to colonies that were about half the size of the wild type, implying partial loss of function.TABLE 1Growth properties of cells expressing b constructsb constructPlasmid/strainAverage colony sizeΔbpSD80/KM2No growthaColony sizes are averages of five determinationsWild type bpDM8/ KM21.3 mmbK100ApKW2/ KM21.2 mmbΔK100pDC19/ KM2No growthbΔI101pSD295/ KM2No growthbΔV102pSD296/ KM2No growthbΔA103pSD297/ KM2No growthbΔQ104pSD298/ KM2No growthbΔA105pSD299/ KM2No growthbΔK100-A103pDC29/ KM20.9 mmbΔK100-Q106pDC28/ KM20.6 mma Colony sizes are averages of five determinations Open table in a new tab Effect of b Mutations on ATP Synthase Assembly—To address the effect the b mutants might have on the assembly and stability of ATP synthase, membranes were prepared and Western blotting was performed, using antibodies raised against the b and α subunits of ATP synthase (Fig. 2). There was no b and extremely little α detected in the membranes prepared from the Δb deletion strain, while all strains carrying mutant b subunits with single residues or groups of residues deleted produced membranes containing amounts of b and α similar to those seen in the wild type, indicating that enzyme assembly was essentially normal.FIGURE 2Western blot of membranes prepared from cells containing F1F0 bearing various b mutations. Membrane samples containing 2 μg of membrane protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Blots were probed with 125I-labeled antibodies raised against α and b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of b Mutations on Enzymatic Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined for both membrane-bound F1F0 and released F1. The single-residue deletions all gave similar results in the ATP hydrolysis assay (data not shown). Since deletion of each individual residue between Lys-100 and Ala-105 also led to virtually identical effects on oxidative phosphorylation and enzyme assembly, these results imply that the effects are not due to specific roles of individual residues but rather to the proper coiled coil structure. Based on these results the single bΔK100 deletion, for which there is a bK100A control, was chosen as a representative for further detailed analysis.As seen in Table 2, the Δb mutant had almost no activity, showing 0.07 unit/mg of bound activity and 0.1 unit/mg of released activity. Among the b mutants presented here, there was some small variation in the released activities, with released activities ranging from 1.08 to 1.62 units/mg, suggesting modest differences in expression or assembly that were not detectable by Western blotting. To correct for differences in the amount of ATP synthase present in the membrane vesicles, the normalized rates of ATP hydrolysis (27Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Cipriano D.J. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 501-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were determined by taking the ratio of bound:released activities. In no case was there a substantial difference in the normalized ATPase activities between membranes carrying the b mutations and the wild type, indicating that the b mutations had little effect on the turnover number of the membrane-bound enzyme. There were, however, large differences in the DCCD sensitivity. Of the three deletion mutants shown in Table 2, the DCCD sensitivity followed the same trend as the in vivo growth tests, with the worst being the bΔK100 mutant at 34% sensitivity, followed by the bΔK100-Q106 with 56% sensitivity, and the bΔK100-A103 with 60% sensitivity. The other five single-residue deletions gave between 0.34 and 0.47 normalized activity units and showed between 19–34% DCCD sensitivity (data not shown). These results suggest that although the b deletions had little effect on the assembly or activity of ATP synthase, they did result in significant uncoupling of the enzyme. It is important to note that the bK100A mutation had no effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis nor the DCCD sensitivity showing that the lysine residue at position 100 is not essential.TABLE 2ATPase activity of membrane vesiclesATP synthase typeMembrane-bound ATPase activityDCCD sensitivityReleased ATPase activityNormalized activityaMembrane-bound activities were normalized to the activity released from membranes and expressed as the fraction of units bound per units released.units/mg%units/mgΔb0.07 ± 0.02N/AbN/A, not applicable.0.10 ± 0.03N/AWild type b0.60 ± 0.0175.71.62 ± 0.050.37 ± 0.01bK100A0.60 ± 0.0178.71.52 ± 0.050.39 ± 0.02bΔK1000.43 ± 0.0133.81.08 ± 0.030.40 ± 0.02bΔK100-A1030.45 ± 0.0160.11.31 ± 0.020.34 ± 0.01bΔK100-Q1060.47 ± 0.0256.41.16 ± 0.020.41 ± 0.02a Membrane-bound activities were normalized to the activity released from membranes and expressed as the fraction of units bound per units released.b N/A, not applicable. Open table in a new tab To further test for coupling of ATP hydrolysis to movement of protons through the membrane, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine quenching assays were performed (Fig. 3). Membranes prepared from the Δb control strain showed no proton pumping activity, while those from the wild type b and bK100A control strains showed a very strong quenching response bringing the relative fluorescence to less than 20% within 1 min of adding ATP. Despite their marked differences in DCCD sensitivity, membranes carrying the bΔK100, bΔK100-A103, and bΔK100-Q106 all gave similar levels of proton pumping. This level is reduced in comparison with the wild type, confirming that these enzymes are partially uncoupled.FIGURE 3ATP-dependent proton pumping by membrane vesicles carrying F1F0 bearing the different b mutations. 500 μg of membranes were suspended in 2 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl (HMK buffer) and 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine was added to 0.3 μg/ml. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 410 and 490 nm, respectively. At the times indicated ATP and carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) were added to 2 mm and 2 μm, respectively. Traces represent Δb (curve a), wild type b (curve b), bK100A (curve c), bΔK100 (curve d), bΔK100-Q106 (curve e), and bΔK100-A103 (curve f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dimerization Interactions in Soluble b Mutants—To determine the effect of deletions on the dimerization of b, the mutations were moved into a soluble form of the protein consisting of residues 34–156 (b34–156), purified, and analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (Table 3). To distinguish these soluble forms of b from their full-length counterparts, they will be referred to as “soluble bmutation.” At 20 °C, soluble b showed an average molecular mass of 24,000 Da, almost twice the calculated monomer molecular mass of 13,324 Da. Analysis of the same data using a monomer-dimer model yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.65 μm. Soluble bK100A showed similar results with an average molecular mass of 21,600 Da or a Kd of 3.3 μm. While the dissociation constants may seem significantly different, it should be noted that a limitation of this method is the high degree of error involved in calculating a Kd near the extremes of either complete monomer or complete dimer. With this limitation in mind, it is clear that the deletion mutants show clear deficiencies in their ability to form a dimer in solution. Soluble bΔK100 showed an average molecular mass of 15,600 Da, and a much elevated Kd of 78 μm. Similarly, soluble bΔK100-A103 and soluble bΔK100-Q106 showed average molecular masses of 16,700 and 13,900 Da, giving Kd values of 36 and 310 μm, respectively. Given the failure of soluble bΔK100 to support oxidative phosphorylation in vivo, and the greater expected disruption of the hydrophobic surface, it was surprising that the bΔK100-Q106 mutant led to the most drastic destabilization of the soluble dimer.TABLE 3Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of soluble b mutantsPolypeptidePlasmidMonomer molecular massbMonomer molecular masses are based on mass spectrometry results, which indicated the removal of the N-terminal methionine residue.
