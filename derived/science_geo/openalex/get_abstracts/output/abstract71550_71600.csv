Hepatic lipids, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and the activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes (aniline hydroxylase and nitroreductase) were increased with the adequate diet but more so with the deficient one. These results may explain the increased tolerance by alcoholics of drugs such as sedatives."

Individual half-lives ranged from 1.2 to 7.3 days. Subjects with identical genotypes (monozygotic twins) exhibited very similar phenylbutazone half-lives; significantly greater differences in half-life occurred in dizygotic twins. The previously established large variations among individuals in phenylbutazone metabolism appear to be genetically, rather than environmentally, determined."

https://openalex.org/W2171523925,Chloroplast ribosomes from tobacco leaves show the same stereospecificity of inhibition by chloramphenicol as bacterial ribosomes do. Cytoplasmic ribosomes from the same leaves are unaffected by chloramphenicol. These results remove doubts raised by nonstereospecific effects of chloramphenicol on higher plant cells and support the concept that chloroplasts have evolved from prokaryotes.
https://openalex.org/W1532383707,"Abstract The complete loss of enzymic activity on reaction with alkylating agents, aromatic nitro compounds, or aliphatic mercaptans indicates the importance of sulfhydryl groups for catalysis. Analyses during the course of inactivation with any of these reagents revealed the loss of one of the two —SH groups in the rhodanese monomer when inactivation was complete. Amino acid analysis of iodoacetate-inactivated enzyme showed that half its cysteine residues had been carboxymethylated. Sedimentation experiments showed that dinitrobenzene-inactivated enzyme was an oxidized dimer, indicating the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between monomers. Reduction of mercaptoethanol-inactivated enzyme resulted in the appearance of two —SH-groups, suggesting the existence of a mixed disulfide of the reagent and the enzyme. In addition, competitive inhibition of rhodanese activity by aromatic ions, but not by the corresponding aliphatics, supported previous evidence suggesting the presence of a tryptophanyl residue at the active center. Further results suggested close proximity of the essential sulfhydryl and aromatic groups in the active site of rhodanese."

https://openalex.org/W2014401146,"Mating behavior of the subterranean mole rat, Spalax ehrenbergi, consists of three distinct stages-agonistic, courtship, and copulation. Spalax sexual behavior reflects certain cricetid affinities, some features general in rodents, and others presumably related to its subterranean, territorial life. Within four groups of Spalax ehrenbergi, each with different numbers of chromosomes, recently found in Israel, mating behavior seems to provide partial reproductive barriers. Selective matings between chromosome forms may complement a cytologic isolating mechanism to prevent widespread natural hybridization."

Inhibitors of RNA synthesis interfere with the differentiation of infection structures if present during this heat treatment. Inhibitors of protein synthesis prevent differentiation if present following heat treatment. Apparently infection structure formation is accompanied by synthesis of RNA, and the completion of infection structure development requires protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1604628787,"Abstract The bovine pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Kazal's inhibitor) undergoes a limited and specific proteolysis by catalytic amounts of trypsin in the presence of calcium ions at acidic pH. The pH optimum for both the initial rate of reaction and the extent of reaction is pH 2.7. Incubation of inhibitor with 0.7 mole % trypsin at pH 2.7 for 3 hours at 25° results in the modification of 25% of the inhibitor molecules. We have shown, by isolation and characterization of peptide fragments, that a single arginyl-isoleucyl peptide bond (residues 18 and 19) is hydrolyzed. This modified inhibitor is active, but is inactive when arginine 18 is removed by carboxypeptidase B. The features of the reaction thus far examined are similar to those described by Ozawa and Laskowski (J. Biol. Chem., 241, 3955 (1966)) for the soybean trypsin inhibitor-trypsin system. On this basis the arginine residue at position 18 is identified as the reactive site of the inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1963896048,"The hypothesis that norepinephrine is a transmitter in the temperature regulating center of the hypothalamus is based on observations of changes in the rectal temperatures of animals after injections of norepinephrine into the hypothalamus. By introducing tritiated norepinephrine as a label into the endogenous norepinephrine stores in the brain and then measuring the disappearance of tritiated norepinephrine from discrete areas, one can monitor the activity of norepinephrine-containing neurons in those areas. In the rat exposed to heat, the turnover of endogenous norepinephrine appears to be increased selectively in the hypothalamus, whereas exposure to cold has no effect."
https://openalex.org/W1978827166,"Reasons are given for rejecting the two-point threshold as the standard measure of spatiotactile resolution. As alternative techniques, thresholds were obtained for disc-size and disc-annulus discriminations. Disc-annulus thresholds are comparable to two-point values, but disc-size thresholds are smaller by a factor of 10. Thus, at least part of the cutaneous system is better organized for localization and sizing of a stimulus than for detection of discontinuities in it."
https://openalex.org/W1597450087,"Abstract The inactivation of RNase A that accompanies dinitrophenylation at pH 8 is in major part due to substitution at lysine-41. The amino group of this lysine residue has been postulated to be part of, or close to, the site responsible for binding the phosphate moiety in the substrate. In elaboration of this concept, the consequences that derive from the replacement of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) by a negatively charged reagent with similar chemical and steric properties have been explored. This reagent, 4-sulfonyloxy-2-nitro-fluorobenzene (SNFB), inactivates RNase A at pH 8 by substitution at position 41. It also attacks the enzyme at the α-amino group to produce 1-α-sulfonyloxynitrophenyl (SNP)-RNase A, a fully active derivative. Dinitrophenylation at lysine-41 occurs about 7 times faster than at the α-amino group. By contrast both of these amino groups are about equally reactive toward SNFB at pH 8, an observation interpreted in terms of an oriented approach of the reagent in a configuration unfavorable for reaction at lysine-41. Both 1-α- and 41-SNP-RNase A have been isolated and the locations of the substituents identified by degradative procedures similar to those used in previous studies of the corresponding dinitrophenyl-derivatives. These monosubstitution products and 1-α,41-e-bis-SNP-RNase A, which was also isolated and identified, constitute the principal products formed in the initial stages of the reaction. In contrast to the behavior with FDNB, subsequent reaction at position 7 either does not take place or is strongly suppressed with SNFB. This behavior indicates that 41-dinitrophenyl- and 41-SNP-RNase A may exist in different conformations, with the difference ascribable to the affinity of the sulfonate moiety in the SNP group for the phosphate-binding site. SNFB has a number of advantages over FDNB as a reagent for the modification of RNase A. These include a higher specificity for amino groups, convenient solubility, and the fact that spectra of the reagent and the derivatives that it forms do not overlap as much as with FDNB. The disadvantage of lowered reactivity toward amino groups is offset by the feasibility of studies at relatively high pH values."

https://openalex.org/W1507861229,"The kinetics of the reaction of various amino groups in RNase A with 4-sulfonyloxy-2-nitrofluorobenzene (potassium salt) was studied as a function of pH and temperature. Substitution at lysine-41 and inactivation of the enzyme proceed at identical rates (pH-independent second order rate constants at 28° are 0.43 ± 0.04 and 0.46 ± 0.06 M −1·min−1, respectively). The dissociation constant of the e-amino group of lysine-41 measured from the pH dependence was anomalously low, 7.7 ± 0.4 × 10−10 M (pKapp = 9.11) and 6.9 ± 0.3 × 10−10 M (pKapp = 9.16) for substitution and inactivation, respectively. The fact that the anomalous behavior of lysine-41 is observed at least as far as pH 10 reveals that an arginine side chain interacts with the amino group of this residue. Moreover, the kinetic behavior in the region above pH 10 is compatible with the view that the protein undergoes a conformational change which disrupts the configuration responsible for the anomalous behavior of lysine-41. The average value of the dissociation constant for the nine normal e-amino groups in RNase A from the kinetic analysis is 7.4 ± 0.9 × 10−11 M (pKapp = 10.1), in agreement with titration data. The pH-independent second order rate constant was found to be 0.93 ± 0.07 M −1·min−1. The corresponding quantities for the α-amino group in RNase A were 7.2 ± 0.1 × 10−9 M (pKapp = 8.14) and 0.057 ± 0.009 M −1·min−1, respectively. A linear relationship between pKapp and the pH-independent second order rate constant was observed to apply for the kinetically distinguishable amino groups. This relationship was used to estimate indirectly the enthalpy of ionization of the e-amino group at position 41. With the aid of this quantity, the pH-independent second order rate constants for the reaction at lysine-41 at each of six temperatures between 3.6 and 65° were determined. Transition state analysis revealed normal behavior as far as the region in which the protein enters its thermal transition above 50°. The rate constant found at 65° was of a magnitude consistent with normalization of the pKapp of lysine-41."

For half the subjects from each group, each angle was superimposed on a light of 555-nanometer wavelength, the positive stimulus during training; for the other half, the angles were on a black background. When tested to the angularity alone, the group which had made errors (pecked at the negative stimulus) during discrimination training showed a typical incremental (inverted) gradient of responding to the negative stimulus dimension. The control group and the one learning the discrimination without errors showed no differential control by the negative stimulus dimension. When each angle was superimposed on the positive stimulus during testing, a decremental gradient with maximum response strength to the negative stimulus was evidenced by the group learning with and the one group learning without errors."

https://openalex.org/W1510678684,"Abstract DNA nucleotidyltransferase was partially purified from Shope fibroma tissue. The final preparation was free of terminal transferase but contained traces of deoxyribonuclease and nonspecific phosphodiesterase. The preparation was active with either native or denatured DNA as template. When assayed with native DNA as template, the activity was purified 61-fold, whereas when denatured DNA was used as template, purification was 179-fold. The Km for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for the native DNA- and denatured DNA-primed activities were 0.046 mm and 0.16 mm, respectively. The Km for native DNA varied with the source of the DNA. The denatured DNA reaction alone was inhibited by high concentrations of substrate. The Km values (20 to 25 µg per ml) for denatured DNA were almost the same for denatured DNA from four different sources, but the K's values varied widely (90 to 650 µg per ml). Brief treatment with DNase I greatly increased the Vmax of the native but not the heat-denatured DNA-primed reaction. The Km of the native DNA-primed reaction was not affected. Despite the affinities for template demonstrable kinetically, the DNA nucleotidyltransferases and DNA failed to form complexes that were stable in neutral sucrose gradients. The data for the reaction primed by denatured DNA suggest competition by 2 molecules of denatured DNA for a secondary binding site for template DNA. The increase in Vmax but not in Km of the reaction primed by native DNA after partial digestion of the template by DNase I may have been due to the increased ease of unwinding of the molecule after the introduction of single strand breaks, whereas the failure of the same preparations to exhibit enhanced priming activity after denaturation indicates the necessity for DNA of some minimum length for the denatured DNA-primed enzyme activity. The data suggest that the preparation contains two different DNA nucleotidyl-transferases, but the possibility that a single molecule is responsible for both activities is not ruled out."
