https://openalex.org/W2037496050,"Plastic debris in the marine environment is widely documented, but the quantity of plastic entering the ocean from waste generated on land is unknown. By linking worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate that 275 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million MT entering the ocean. Population size and the quality of waste management systems largely determine which countries contribute the greatest mass of uncaptured waste available to become plastic marine debris. Without waste management infrastructure improvements, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025."

Fosque et al. designed and thoroughly validated a fluorescent protein–based reagent that allows permanent marking of active cells over short time scales. This indicator, termed CaMPARI, switches from its native green to a red fluorescent state by simultaneous illumination with violet light and exposure to increased levels of intracellular calcium. CaMPARI successfully marked active nerve cells in Drosophila , zebrafish, and mouse brains. Science , this issue p. 755"

HCV encodes a polymerase called NS5B that catalyzes replication of the viral RNA genome. Drugs inhibiting NS5B have shown impressive antiviral activity in recent clinical trials. Appleby et al. (see the Perspective by Bressanelli) reveal the inner workings of HCV RNA replication by analyzing crystal structures of stalled NS5B polymerase ternary complexes during the initiation and elongation of RNA synthesis. They also define the way in which sofosbuvir, a drug with potent clinical efficacy, interacts with the NS5B active site. Science , this issue p. 771 ; see also p. 715"

Gordon et al. analyzed the composition of tooth enamel from a variety of rodents at the nanometer scale (see the Perspective by Politi). In regular and pigmented enamel, which contain different trace elements at varying boundary regions, two intergranular phases—magnesium amorphous calcium phosphate or a mixed-phase iron oxide—control the rates of enamel demineralization. This suggests that there may be alternative options to fluoridation for strengthening teeth against decay. Science , this issue p. 746 ; see also p. 712"

If your goal is to get to the top of the highest hill, and you only take steps toward higher ground, you might never find a peak on a route that requires a preliminary descent. So it is in chemistry, where optimizing each structural feature of a catalyst consecutively might gloss over subtle tradeoffs that in combination offer the best performance. Milo et al. use multidimensional analysis techniques to generate a predictive model of how selectivity depends on multiple characteristics of the catalyst and substrate in a C-N bond-forming reaction (see the Perspective by Lu). They then apply this model to improve the catalyst globally. Science , this issue p. 737 ; see also p. 719"
https://openalex.org/W2066744554,"How a toxin makes epithelial sheets leaky The entire human body and its many compartments are shielded from their external environments by the barrier function of epithelial cell sheets. The paracellular barrier function of tight junctions (TJs) is critical for maintaining homeostasis in any multicellular organism, especially in the skin and internal organs and at the blood-brain barrier. One of the major components of TJs is a family of adhesive membrane proteins known as claudins. Several members of the claudin family are receptors for the bacterial toxin Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin. This toxin often causes food-borne illness both in humans and animals. Saitoh et al. crystallized a complex between the toxin and a claudin that reveals just how the toxin damages epithelial barriers (see the Perspective by Artursson and Knight).

In a RCT, 251 caregivers, of whom six were lost at baseline, were randomly assigned to two groups. Caregivers in the experimental group (N = 149) were compared to caregivers who received a minimal intervention consisting of e-bulletins (N = 96). Outcomes were symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale: CES-D) and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS-A). All data were collected via the Internet, and an intention-to-treat analysis was carried out.Almost all caregivers were spouses or children (in-law). They were predominantly female and lived with the care recipient in the same household. Age of the caregivers varied from 26 to 87 years. Level of education varied from primary school to university, with almost half of them holding a bachelor's degree or higher. Regression analyses showed that caregivers in the experimental group showed significantly lower symptoms of depression (p = .034) and anxiety (p = .007) post intervention after adjustment for baseline differences in the primary outcome scores and the functional status of the patients with dementia. Effect sizes were moderate for symptoms of anxiety (.48) and small for depressive symptoms (.26).The Internet course 'Mastery over Dementia' offers an effective treatment for family caregivers of people with dementia reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. The results of this study justify further development of Internet interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia and suggest that such interventions are promising for keeping support for family caregivers accessible and affordable. The findings are even more promising because future generations of family caregivers will be more familiar with the Internet.Dutch Trial Register NTR-2051 www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2051."
https://openalex.org/W2016464448,"Toward drugging the undruggable in cancer Many human cancers are characterized by inappropriate activity of transcription factors. These proteins are attractive drug targets in principle, but normalizing their function requires drugs that modulate specific protein-protein interactions, a goal that has been challenging. In acute myeloid leukemia, a chromosomal translocation creates an aberrant form of the transcription factor CBF-beta, which outcompetes “normal” CBF-beta for binding to another transcription factor called RUNX1, thereby deregulating its activity. Illendula et al. identified and chemically optimized a small molecule that selectively disrupts the interaction between the aberrant CBF-beta and RUNX1 (see the Perspective by Koehler and Chen). This molecule restored normal gene expression patterns and delayed leukemia progression in mice. Thus, transcription factors may not be as undruggable as once thought.

https://openalex.org/W2073929683,"Aphid saliva is predicted to contain proteins that modulate plant defenses and facilitate feeding. Armet is a well-characterized bifunctional protein in mammalian systems. Here we report a new role of Armet, namely as an effector protein in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Pea aphid Armet's physical and chemical properties and its intracellular role are comparable to those reported for mammalian Armets. Uniquely, we detected Armet in aphid watery saliva and in the phloem sap of fava beans fed on by aphids. Armet's transcript level is several times higher in the salivary gland when aphids feed on bean plants than when they feed on an artificial diet. Knockdown of the Armet transcript by RNA interference disturbs aphid feeding behavior on fava beans measured by the electrical penetration graph technique and leads to a shortened life span. Inoculation of pea aphid Armet protein into tobacco leaves induced a transcriptional response that included pathogen-responsive genes. The data suggest that Armet is an effector protein mediating aphid-plant interactions.—Wang, W., Dai, H., Zhang, Y., Chandrasekar, R., Luo, L., Hiromasa, Y., Sheng, C., Peng, G., Chen, S., Tomich, J.

The authors placed the layer on top of a thin crystal of an organic material. When they shone UV light on the spiropyran, the adjacent material became superconducting, thanks to the carriers induced at the interface. Science , this issue p. 743"

https://openalex.org/W2171882839,"Five fundamental taste qualities (sweet, bitter, salty, sour, umami) are sensed by dedicated taste cells (TCs) that relay quality information to gustatory nerve fibers. In peripheral taste signaling pathways, ATP has been identified as a functional neurotransmitter, but it remains to be determined how specificity of different taste qualities is maintained across synapses. Recent studies demonstrated that some gut peptides are released from taste buds by prolonged application of particular taste stimuli, suggesting their potential involvement in taste information coding. In this study, we focused on the function of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in initial responses to taste stimulation. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) null mice had reduced neural and behavioral responses specifically to sweet compounds compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Some sweet responsive TCs expressed GLP-1 and its receptors were expressed in gustatory neurons. GLP-1 was released immediately from taste bud cells in response to sweet compounds but not to other taste stimuli. Intravenous administration of GLP-1 elicited transient responses in a subset of sweet-sensitive gustatory nerve fibers but did not affect other types of fibers, and this response was suppressed by pre-administration of the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin-4(3-39). Thus GLP-1 may be involved in normal sweet taste signal transmission in mice.— Takai, S., Yasumatsu, K., Inoue, M., Iwata, S., Yoshida, R., Shigemura, N., Yanagawa, Y., Drucker, D. J., Margolskee, R.

https://openalex.org/W2059897175,"We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate changes in the thalamus functional connectivity in early and late stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Data of 25 late stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) patients, 30 early stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) patients and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We focused on the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the thalamus and those in all other brain regions. Compared to healthy controls, we found functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and a set of brain areas was decreased in LMCI and/or EMCI including right fusiform gyrus (FG), left and right superior temporal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus extending into supplementary motor area, right insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) extending into middle occipital gyrus (MOG). We also observed increased functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and several regions in LMCI and/or EMCI including left FG, right MOG, left and right precuneus, right MTG and left inferior temporal gyrus. In the direct comparison between the LMCI and EMCI groups, we obtained several brain regions showed thalamus-seeded functional connectivity differences such as the precentral gyrus, hippocampus, FG and MTG. Briefly, these brain regions mentioned above were mainly located in the thalamo-related networks including thalamo-hippocampus, thalamo-temporal, thalamo-visual, and thalamo-default mode network. The decreased functional connectivity of the thalamus might suggest reduced functional integrity of thalamo-related networks and increased functional connectivity indicated that aMCI patients could use additional brain resources to compensate for the loss of cognitive function. Our study provided a new sight to understand the two important states of aMCI and revealed resting-state fMRI is an appropriate method for exploring pathophysiological changes in aMCI."
https://openalex.org/W2086877638,"X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) is a group of genetically heterogeneous disorders caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Deleterious mutations in ~10% of X chromosome genes are implicated in causing XLID disorders in ~50% of known and suspected XLID families. The remaining XLID genes are expected to be rare and even private to individual families. To systematically identify these XLID genes, we sequenced the X chromosome exome (X-exome) in 56 well-established XLID families (a single affected male from 30 families and two affected males from 26 families) using an Agilent SureSelect X-exome kit and the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. To enrich for disease-causing mutations, we first utilized variant filters based on dbSNP, the male-restricted portions of the 1000 Genomes Project, or the Exome Variant Server datasets. However, these databases present limitations as automatic filters for enrichment of XLID genes. We therefore developed and optimized a strategy that uses a cohort of affected male kindred pairs and an additional small cohort of affected unrelated males to enrich for potentially pathological variants and to remove neutral variants. This strategy, which we refer to as Affected Kindred/Cross-Cohort Analysis, achieves a substantial enrichment for potentially pathological variants in known XLID genes compared to variant filters from public reference databases, and it has identified novel XLID candidate genes. We conclude that Affected Kindred/Cross-Cohort Analysis can effectively enrich for disease-causing genes in rare, Mendelian disorders, and that public reference databases can be used effectively, but cautiously, as automatic filters for X-linked disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1986926476,"Geraniol (GO) potent antitumor and chemopreventive effects are attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the current study, the potential efficacy of GO (250 mg/kg) in ameliorating metabolic syndrome (MetS) induced by fructose in drinking water was elucidated. Moreover, the effect of pioglitazone (5 and 10 mg/kg; PIO) and the possible interaction of the co-treatment of GO with PIO5 were studied in the MetS model. After 4 weeks of treatment, GO and/or PIO reduced the fasting blood glucose and the glycemic excursion in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. GO and PIO5/10 restrained visceral adiposity and partly the body weight gain. The decreased level of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ transcriptional activity in the visceral adipose tissue of MetS rats was increased by single treatment regimens. Though GO did not affect MetS-induced hyperinsulinemia, PIO5/10 lowered it. Additionally, GO and PIO5/10 suppressed glycated hemoglobin and the receptor for advanced glycated end products (RAGE). These single regimens also ameliorated hyperuricemia, the disrupted lipid profile, and the elevated systolic blood pressure evoked by MetS. The rise in serum transaminases, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as hepatic lipid peroxides and nitric oxide (NO) was lowered by the single treatments to different extents. Moreover, hepatic non-protein thiols, as well as serum NO and adiponectin were enhanced by single regimens. Similar effects were reached by the combination of GO with PIO5; however, a potentiative interaction was noted on fasting serum insulin level, while synergistic effects were reflected as improved insulin sensitivity, as well as reduced RAGE and triglycerides. Therefore, GO via the transcriptional activation of PPAR-γ reduces inflammation and free radical injury produced by MetS. Thereby, these effects provide novel mechanistic insights on GO management of MetS associated critical risk factors. Moreover, the co-administration of GO to PIO5 exalted the antidiabetic drug anti-MetS efficacy."

Unexpectedly, the active site of EtgA has features in common with both lytic transglycosylases and hen egg white lysozyme. Most notably, the β-hairpin region resembles that of lysozyme and contains an aspartate that aligns with lysozyme Asp-52 (a residue critical for catalysis), a conservation not observed in other previously characterized lytic transglycosylase families to which the conserved T3SS enzymes had been presumed to belong.

https://openalex.org/W2063234392,"Background and Aim Previous studies have indicated that neck circumference is a valuable predictor for obesity and metabolic syndrome, but little evidence is available for fatty liver disease. We examined the association of neck circumference with fatty liver disease and evaluated its predictive value in Chinese adults. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised 4053 participants (1617 women and 2436 men, aged 20-88) recruited from the Health Examination Center in Guangzhou, China between May 2009 and April 2010. Anthropometric measurements were taken, abdominal ultrasonography was conducted and blood biochemical parameters were measured. Covariance, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were employed. Results The mean neck circumference was greater in subjects with fatty liver disease than those without the disease in both women and men after adjusting for age (P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that the age-adjusted ORs (95% CI) of fatty liver disease for quartile 4 (vs. quartile 1) of neck circumference were 7.70 (4.95-11.99) for women and 12.42 (9.22-16.74) for men. After further adjusting for other anthropometric indices, both individually and combined, the corresponding ORs remained significant (all P-trends<0.05) but were attenuated to 1.94-2.53 for women and 1.45-2.08 for men. An additive interaction existed between neck circumference and the other anthropometric measures (all P<0.05). A high neck circumference value was associated with a much greater prevalence of fatty liver disease in participants with both high and normal BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio values. Conclusions Neck circumference was an independent predictor for fatty liver disease and provided an additional contribution when applied with other anthropometric measures."
https://openalex.org/W1996209431,"The influence of intrauterine environment on the risk of endometriosis is still controversial. Whether birth weight modifies the risk of endometriosis in adulthood remains an open question. For this purpose, we designed a case-control study involving 743 women operated on for benign gynecological indications from January 2004 to December 2011. Study group included 368 patients with histologically proven endometriosis: 54 superficial endometriosis (SUP), 79 endometriomas (OMA) and 235 deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). Control group included 375 patients without endometriosis as surgically checked. Mean birth weights were compared between patients and controls, according to endometriosis groups and rAFS stages. Mean birth weight was significantly lower for patients with endometriosis as compared to controls (3,119g ± 614 and 3,251g ± 557 respectively; p = 0.002). When compared to controls, patients with DIE had the lowest birth weight with a highly significant difference (3,103g ± 620, p = 0.002). In univariate analysis, patients with low birth weight (LBW), defined as a BW < 2,500g, had a higher risk of endometriosis, especially DIE, as compared to the reference group (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.3 and OR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.0-2.7, respectively). Multivariate analysis, adjusted on ethnicity and smoking status, showed the persistence of a significant association between endometriosis and LBW with a slight increase in the magnitude of the association (aOR = 1.7, 95%CI: 1.0-2.6 for endometriosis, aOR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1-2.9 for DIE). In conclusion, LBW is independently associated with the risk of endometriosis in our population. Among patients with LBW, the risk is almost two-times higher to develop DIE. This association could reflect common signaling pathways between endometriosis and fetal growth regulation. There is also the possibility of a role played by placental insufficiency on the development of the neonate’s pelvis and the occurrence of neonatal uterine bleeding that could have consequences on the risk of severe endometriosis."

Substitution of the glutamic acid present in αinh with glycine relieves intramolecular autoinhibition, resulting in Fic enzymes with significantly enhanced auto-AMPylation as well as enhanced target AMPylation. Fic protein activity is not limited to the transfer of AMP onto small GTPases: the Legionella pneumophila Fic protein AnkX is also translocated into host cells, where it anchors a phosphorylcholine unit onto Ser-79 of Rab1 GTPases, thereby modulating host vesicle trafficking (11Mukherjee S.

Finally, the bacterial Fic protein Doc, the toxin unit of the Doc-PhD toxin-antitoxin system present in E. coli, phosphorylates Thr-382 of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu, inhibiting translation (14Castro-Roa D. Garcia-Pino A. De Gieter S. van Nuland N.A. Loris R. Zenkin N. The Fic protein Doc uses an inverted substrate to phosphorylate and inactivate EF-Tu.Nat. Chem.

Thus, Fic protein activity is not linked exclusively to the transfer of AMP onto target proteins. Rather, all Fic proteins share a common substrate preference (nucleoside triphosphates) for their enzymatic activities. To date, some ∼2700 Fic proteins have been identified, mostly in bacteria. Eukaryotes, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens, encode at least one Fic protein each, with the exception of most fungi, which contain no known AMPylases (16Woolery A.R. Luong P. Broberg C.A. Orth K. AMPylation: something old is new again.Front. Microbiol. 2010; 1: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Itzen A. Blankenfeldt W. Goody R.S.

The Drosophila Fic protein, referred to as CG9523 or dFic, possesses auto-AMPylation activity in vitro; this activity is diminished upon mutation of the conserved histidine residue within the Fic motif (18Rahman M. Ham H. Liu X. Sugiura Y. Orth K. Krämer H. Visual neurotransmission in Drosophila requires expression of Fic in glial capitate projections.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mutant flies that lack dFic are blind, but otherwise viable. Photoreceptor cells in dFic-deficient animals depolarize normally following light stimulation, but fail to activate post-synaptic neurons, indicative of a defect in neurotransmission. Expression of enzymatically active dFic on capitate projections of glia cells, but not neurons, rescues the null phenotype. The catalytic site of dFic resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumVHHheavy chain-only antibody variable domainNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidCDRcomplementarity-determining region. lumen, where it AMPylates Thr-366 of BiP/GRP78, a conserved HSP70 family member important for quality control and regulation of the unfolded protein response in the ER (19Ham H.

The human genome encodes a single Fic protein named HypE (Huntingtin-associated yeast-interacting protein E; also referred to as FICD); it exhibits AMPylation activity against Cdc42, Rac1, and BiP in vitro (8Worby C.A. Mattoo S. Kruger R.P. Corbeil L.B. Koller A. Mendez J.C. Zekarias B. Lazar C. Dixon J.E. The fic domain: regulation of cell signaling by adenylylation.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). RNA expression data suggest that HypE is present in most cell types and tissues, albeit at low levels. Overexpression of wild-type HypE in cultured cells has few obvious consequences, suggesting a tight regulation of HypE activity by its inhibitory α-helix or by other, yet unidentified regulatory proteins (10Engel P. Goepfert A. Stanger F.V. Harms A. Schmidt A. Schirmer T. Dehio C. Adenylylation control by intra- or intermolecular active-site obstruction in Fic proteins.Nature. 2012; 482: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The physiological role of HypE remains elusive; however, HypE is assumed to interact with Huntingtin, a protein that, when mutated, causes Huntington disease (20Goehler H. Lalowski M. Stelzl U. Waelter S. Stroedicke M. Worm U. Droege A. Lindenberg K.S. Knoblich M. Haenig C. Herbst M. Suopanki J. Scherzinger E. Abraham C. Bauer B. Hasenbank R. Fritzsche A. Ludewig A.H. Büssow K. Buessow K.

The study of protein AMPylation in eukaryotes is limited in part by a dearth of appropriate tools to selectively track Fic proteins or modulate their activity. A threonine/AMP-specific mouse serum was used to confirm VopS-mediated AMPylation of Cdc42 and Rac1 and to study HypE-mediated BiP AMPylation (21Hao Y.H. Chuang T. Ball H.L. Luong P. Li Y. Flores-Saaib R.D. Orth K. Characterization of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against threonine-AMPylation.J. Biotechnol. 2011; 151: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, a set of small molecules inhibiting VopS in in vitro assays has been characterized (22Lewallen D.M. Sreelatha A. Dharmarajan V. Madoux F. Chase P. Griffin P.R. Orth K. Hodder P. Thompson P.R. Inhibiting AMPylation: a novel screen to identify the first small molecule inhibitors of protein AMPylation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, such tools are few in number. It thus remains a challenge to study the regulation and consequences of AMPylation in intact cells. Camelid VHHs, derived from the variable domain of heavy chain-only antibodies, present a unique tool (23Leavy O. Therapeutic antibodies: past, present and future.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 297Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Dougan S.K. Ashour J. Karssemeijer R.A. Popp M.W. Avalos A.M. Barisa M. Altenburg A.F. Ingram J.R. Cragnolini J.J. Guo C. Alt F.W. Jaenisch R. Ploegh H.L. Antigen-specific B-cell receptor sensitizes B cells to infection by influenza virus.Nature. 2013; 503: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). VHHs, also referred to as nanobodies, are smaller and more stable than their traditional antibody counterparts and are less dependent on disulfide bond formation for proper folding. They can therefore be expressed in the cytoplasm of bacteria (e.g. E. coli) or eukaryotic cells without loss of their antigen recognition properties (25Harmsen M.M. van Solt C.B. van Zijderveld-van Bemmel A.M.

Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). VHHs are easily modified and can be equipped with fluorescent or affinity tags to track their target antigens within the cell (26Kirchhofer A. Helma J. Schmidthals K. Frauer C. Cui S. Karcher A.

Biol. 2012; 19: 117-121Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). VHHs can serve as specific and efficient protein inhibitors or modulators and can induce changes in protein conformation within cells. Furthermore, VHHs can stabilize transient protein conformations, facilitating protein crystallization (28Rasmussen S.G. Choi H.J. Fung J.J. Pardon E. Casarosa P. Chae P.S. Devree B.T. Rosenbaum D.M.

Here, we report the generation of HypE-specific VHHs that either inhibit or stimulate AMPylation activity in vitro. Three of the VHHs inhibit histone H3 AMPylation, whereas one VHH increases target AMPylation levels. Employing a HypE-specific mouse serum in combination with our VHHs, we show that HypE localizes to the nuclear envelope. Finally, we identify histones H2–H4, but not H1, as new targets for HypE-promoted protein AMPylation, suggesting a possible role for HypE in regulation of gene expression or DNA repair. HeLa, HEK293T, and A549 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Transduced HeLa and A549 cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and G418 (Difco) at a concentration of 100 μg/ml.

In-solution sortase labeling reactions with SrtAstaph7M were performed overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl; upon reaction completion, His6-tagged sortase was removed from the reaction mixture using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) beads (Qiagen). Residual GGG nucleophiles were separated from dye-coupled VHHs by size exclusion chromatography on PD10 columns (GE Healthcare). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates or 10-cm2 tissue culture dishes and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 24–48 h, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with appropriate antibodies or the respective VHH (1 μg/ml). Table 1 lists all antibodies used in this study.

Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and PBS for 20 min, permeabilized for 15 min in PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% BSA and PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1% BSA and PBS containing primary antibodies, washed three times with PBS, and incubated for another hour at room temperature in 1% BSA and PBS supplemented with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 647-coupled secondary antibodies. Alternatively, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647-coupled VHHs (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. All images were collected on a PerkinElmer Ultraview multispectral spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion ×63 objective lens and a Prior piezoelectric objective focusing device for maintaining focus. Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA ER cooled CCD camera controlled with Volocity software. Post-acquisition image manipulations were made using Fiji software. For analysis of nuclear morphology, at least 10 randomly chosen frames from three independent samples were imaged, and nuclear morphology was assessed by eye. Beads were rinsed with 1 mm HCl for 15 min, mixed with VHHs diluted in coupling buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) and 0.5 m NaCl), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation. Beads were then washed five times with coupling buffer, blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and subjected to at least five wash cycles with two alternating wash buffers (0.1 m acetic acid/sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and 0.5 m NaCl; and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m NaCl). 96-Well ELISA plates were coated with HypE or HypE E234G (0.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Following washing and blocking with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 4% milk for 2 h at 37 °C, test wells were supplemented with His-tagged unmodified VHHs (25 μg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were then washed and supplemented with biotinylated VHHs (25 μg/ml), incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and analyzed using streptavidin-HRP to trigger a colorimetric readout.

Eluted histones were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at 4 or −80 °C. 1 liter of LB medium was inoculated overnight with a 10-ml culture of E. coli WK6 containing VHH-encoding pHEN6 plasmids. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 with 1.0 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and bacteria were grown overnight at 30 °C. The following day, bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 20 ml of 1× TES (0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.65 mm EDTA, and 0.5 m sucrose), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Bacteria were then repelleted, resuspended in 60 ml of 0.25× TES, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA at 4 °C for 1 h.

Elution fractions were further purified on a Superdex S75 16/600 column and stored at −80 °C. 5–10 μg of HypE(187–437), HypE(187–437) E234G, or HypE(187–437) H363A in 10 μl were first mixed with 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT supplemented with 0.5 μCi of [α-33P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the addition of 1–5 μg of target protein (histones) in a 10-μl volume. The reaction mixture was incubated for another hour at room temperature, supplemented with 10 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For VHH inhibition assays, HypE(187–437) proteins were incubated with the respective VHHs for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of [α-33P]ATP-containing reaction buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2329659082,"To better understand some aspects of bone matrix glycation, we used an in vitro glycation approach. Within two weeks, our glycation procedures led to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) at the levels that corresponded to approx. 25–30 years of the natural in vivo glycation. Cortical and cancellous bones from human tibias were glycated in vitro using either glucose (glucosylation) or ribose (ribosylation). Both glucosylation and ribosylation led to the formation of higher levels of AGEs and pentosidine (PEN) in cancellous than cortical bone dissected from all tested donors (young, middle-age and elderly men and women). More efficient glycation of bone matrix proteins in cancellous bone most likely depended on the higher porosity of this tissue, which facilitated better accessibility of the sugars to the matrix proteins. Notably, glycation of cortical bone from older donors led to much higher AGEs levels as compared to young donors. Such efficient in vitro glycation of older cortical bone could result from aging-related increase in porosity caused by the loss of mineral content. In addition, more pronounced glycation in vivo would be driven by elevated oxidation processes. Interestingly, the levels of PEN formation differed pronouncedly between glucosylation and ribosylation. Ribosylation generated very high levels of PEN (approx. 6- vs. 2.5-fold higher PEN level than in glucosylated samples). Kinetic studies of AGEs and PEN formation in human cortical and cancellous bone matrix confirmed higher accumulation of fluorescent crosslinks for ribosylation. Our results suggest that in vitro glycation of bone using glucose leads to the formation of lower levels of AGEs including PEN, whereas ribosylation appears to support a pathway toward PEN formation. Our studies may help to understand differences in the progression of bone pathologies related to protein glycation by different sugars, and raise awareness for excessive sugar supplementation in food and drinks."
https://openalex.org/W1968604786,"Objectives We evaluated the impact of a COPD discharge care bundle on readmission rates following hospitalisation with an acute exacerbation. Design Interrupted time series analysis, comparing readmission rates for COPD exacerbations at nine trusts that introduced the bundle, to two comparison groups; (1) other NHS trusts in London and (2) all other NHS trusts in England. Care bundles were implemented at different times for different NHS trusts, ranging from October 2009 to April 2011. Setting Nine NHS acute trusts in the London, England. Participants Patients aged 45 years and older admitted to an NHS acute hospital in England for acute exacerbation of COPD. Data come from Hospital Episode Statistics, April 2002 to March 2012. Main Outcome Measures Annual trend readmission rates (and in total bed days) within 7, 28 and 90 days, before and after implementation. Results In hospitals introducing the bundle readmission rates were rising before implementation and falling afterwards (e.g. readmissions within 28 days +2.13% per annum (pa) pre and -5.32% pa post (p for difference in trends = 0.012)). Following implementation, readmission rates within 7 and 28 day were falling faster than among other trusts in London, although this was not statistically significant (e.g. readmissions within 28 days -4.6% pa vs. -3.2% pa, p = 0.44). Comparisons with a national control group were similar. Conclusions The COPD discharge care bundle appeared to be associated with a reduction in readmission rate among hospitals using it. The significance of this is unclear because of changes to background trends in London and nationally."
https://openalex.org/W2045578209,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is regulated by a network of signaling pathways to which stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) belong. Because all these pathways are located at the interface of cell cycle control and cell stress, we hypothesized a cross-regulation. Interference with SCD-1, either by small interfering (si)RNA or the specific SCD-1 inhibitor CAY10566 (EC₅₀ 1 µM; ≥ 24 h), specifically induced phosphorylation and thus activation of p38 MAPK in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts (1.5- to 2-fold; 48 hours). During lipotoxic and cell cycle stress, prolonged activation of p38 MAPK due to SCD-1 inhibition induced ER stress, the UPR, and ER/Golgi remodeling as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy (1.2- to 3.5-fold). Specific inhibition of p38 MAPK by Skepinone-L [half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) 25-50 nM] reversed these effects (at 1 µM; 48 hours). The specificity by which SCD-1 modulates the phospholipid composition and inhibits p38 MAPK signaling (among survival/stress pathways), thereby preventing ER stress (but not other SCD-1-dependent responses), suggests selective protein-lipid interactions. Palmitoleoyl/oleoyl-phosphatidylinositol (PI) was accordingly identified as potential lipid mediator using chromatography-coupled ESI tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the negative regulation of p38 MAPK mediates the protective effects of SCD-1 on ER homeostasis under distinct stress conditions."

Hereon, we aimed to re-evaluate the characteristics of Aeromonas bacteremia, including those of a novel species, Aeromonas dhakensis. Methodology/Principal Findings A retrospective study of monomicrobial Aeromonas bacteremia at a medical center in southern Taiwan from 2004–2011 was conducted. Species identification was based on rpoB sequencing. Of bacteremia of 153 eligible patients, A. veronii (50 isolates, 32.7%), A. dhakensis (48, 31.4%), A. caviae (43, 28.1%), and A. hydrophila (10, 6.5%) were the principal causative species. A. dhakensis and A. veronii bacteremia were mainly community-acquired and presented as primary bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or skin and soft-tissue infection, whereas A. caviae was associated with hospital-onset bacteremia. The distribution of the AmpC β-lactamase and metallo-β-lactamase genes was species-specific: blaAQU-1, blaMOX, or blaCepH was present in A. dhakensis, A. caviae, or A. hydrophila, respectively, and blaCphA was present in A. veronii, A. dhakensis, and A. hydrophila. The cefotaxime resistance rates of the A. caviae, A. dhakensis, and A. hydrophila isolates were higher than that of A. veronii (39.5%%, 25.0%, and 30% vs. 2%, respectively). A. dhakensis bacteremia was linked to the highest 14-day sepsis-related mortality rate, followed by A. hydrophila, A. veronii, and A. caviae bacteremia (25.5%, 22.2%, 14.0%, and 4.7%, respectively; P = 0.048). Multivariate analysis revealed that A. dhakensis bacteremia, active malignancies, and a Pitt bacteremia score ≥ 4 was an independent mortality risk factor. Conclusions/Significance Characteristics of Aeromonas bacteremia vary between species. A. dhakensis prevalence and its associated poor outcomes suggest it an important human pathogen."

In key areas of the mammalian brain, such as the hippocampus or the basolateral amygdala, the clustering of the scaffolding protein Gephyrin and of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors at inhibitory neuronal synapses is critically dependent upon the brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Collybistin (Cb). Accordingly, it was discovered recently that an R290H missense mutation in the diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology domain of Cb, which carries the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, leads to epilepsy and intellectual disability in human patients. In the present study, we determined the mechanism by which the CbR290H mutation perturbs inhibitory synapse formation and causes brain dysfunction. Based on a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and molecular dynamics simulation approaches, we demonstrate that the R290H mutation alters the strength of intramolecular interactions between the diffuse B-cell lymphoma homology domain and the pleckstrin homology domain of Cb. This defect reduces the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding affinity of Cb, which limits its normal synaptogenic activity. Our data indicate that impairment of the membrane lipid binding activity of Cb and a consequent defect in inhibitory synapse maturation represent a likely molecular pathomechanism of epilepsy and mental retardation in humans.

https://openalex.org/W2076837071,"A major challenge for the application of RNA- or DNA-oligonucleotides in biotechnology and molecular medicine is their susceptibility to abundant nucleases. One intriguing possibility to tackle this problem is the use of mirror-image (l-)oligonucleotides. For aptamers, this concept has successfully been applied to even develop therapeutic agents, so-called Spiegelmers. However, for technologies depending on RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA hybridization, like antisense or RNA interference, it has not been possible to use mirror-image oligonucleotides because Watson-Crick base pairing of complementary strands is (thought to be) stereospecific. Many scientists consider this a general principle if not a dogma. A recent publication proposing heterochiral Watson-Crick base pairing and sequence-specific hydrolysis of natural RNA by mirror-image ribozymes or DNAzymes (and vice versa) prompted us to systematically revisit the stereospecificity of oligonucleotides hybridization and catalytic activity. Using hyperchromicity measurements we demonstrate that hybridization only occurs among homochiral anti-parallel complementary oligonucleotide strands. As expected, achiral PNA hybridizes to RNA and DNA irrespective of their chirality. In functional assays we could not confirm an alleged heterochiral hydrolytic activity of ribozymes or DNAzymes. Our results confirm a strict stereospecificity of oligonucleotide hybridization and clearly argue against the possibility to use mirror-image oligonucleotides for gene silencing or antisense applications."

https://openalex.org/W2018843806,"Objective This study was to investigate whether sorafenib can inhibit the progression of renal fibrosis and to study the possible mechanisms of this effect. Methods Eight-week-old rats were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and were intragastrically administered sorafenib, while control and sham groups were administered vehicle for 14 or 21 days. NRK-52E cells were treated with TGF-β1 and sorafenib for 24 or 48 hours. HE and Masson staining were used to visualize fibrosis of the renal tissue in each group. The expression of α-SMA and E-cadherin in kidney tissue and NRK-52E cells were performed using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The apoptosis rate of NRK-52E cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis. The protein levels of Smad3 and p-Smad3 in kidney tissue and NRK-52E cells were detected by western blot analysis. Results HE staining demonstrated that kidney interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the sorafenib-treated-UUO groups were significantly decreased compared with the vehicle-treated-UUO group (p<0.05). Masson staining showed that the area of fibrosis was significantly decreased in the sorafenib-treated-UUO groups compared with vehicle-treated-UUO group (p<0.01). The size of the kidney did not significantly increase; the cortex of the kidney was thicker and had a richer blood supply in the middle-dose sorafenib group compared with the vehicle-treated-UUO group (p<0.05). Compared with the vehicle-treated-UUO and TGF-β-stimulated NRK-52E groups, the expression of a-SMA and E-cadherin decreased and increased, respectively, in the UUO kidneys and NRK-52E cells of the sorafenib-treated groups (p<0.05). The apoptotic rate of NRK-52E cells treated with sorafenib decreased for 24 hours in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Compared with the vehicle-treated UUO and TGF-β-stimulated NRK-52E groups, the ratio of p-Smad3 to Smad3 decreased in the sorafenib-treated groups (p<0.05). Conclusion Our results suggest that sorafenib may useful for the treatment of renal fibrosis through the suppression of TGF-β/Smad3-induced EMT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2037991326,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels constitute a large family of cation permeable ion channels that serve crucial functions in sensory systems by transducing environmental changes into cellular voltage and calcium signals. Within the retina, two closely related members of the melastatin TRP family, TRPM1 and TRPM3, are highly expressed. TRPM1 has been shown to be required for the depolarizing response to light of ON-bipolar cells, but the role of TRPM3 in the retina is unknown. Immunohistochemical staining of mouse retina with an antibody directed against the C-terminus of TRPM3 labeled the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and a subset of cells in the ganglion cell layer. Within the IPL, TRPM3 immunofluorescence was markedly stronger in the OFF sublamina than in the ON sublamina. Electroretinogram recordings showed that the scotopic and photopic a- and b-waves of TRPM3-/- mice are normal indicating that TRPM3 does not play a major role in visual processing in the outer retina. TRPM3 activity was measured by calcium imaging and patch-clamp recording of immunopurified retinal ganglion cells. Application of the TRPM3 agonist, pregnenolone sulfate (PS), stimulated increases in intracellular calcium in ~40% of cells from wild type and TRPM1‑/‑ mice, and the PS-stimulated increases in calcium were blocked by co-application of mefenamic acid, a TRPM3 antagonist. No PS-stimulated changes in fluorescence were observed in ganglion cells from TRPM3-/- mice. Similarly, PS-stimulated currents that could be blocked by mefenamic acid were recorded from wild type retinal ganglion cells but were absent in ganglion cells from TRPM3-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2045039699,"Aims Several socio-cultural and biomedical risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are modifiable. However, few studies globally have examined socio-cultural associations. To eliminate confounding of increased risk of diabetes in subsequent pregnancies, elucidating socio-cultural associations requires examination only of first pregnancies. Methods Data for all women who delivered their first child in Victoria, Australia between 1999 and 2008 were extracted from the Victorian Perinatal Data Collection. Crude and adjusted GDM rates were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine odds of GDM within and between socio-cultural groups. Results From 1999 to 2008, 269,682 women delivered their first child in Victoria. GDM complicated 11,763 (4.4%) pregnancies and burden increased with maternal age, from 2.1% among women aged below 25 years at delivery to 7.0% among those aged 35 years or more. Among younger women, GDM rates were relatively stable across socioeconomic levels. Amongst older women GDM rates were highest in those living in most deprived areas, with a strong social gradient. Asian-born mothers had highest GDM rates. All migrant groups except women born in North-West Europe had higher odds of GDM than Australian-born non-Indigenous women. In all ethnic groups, these differences were not pronounced among younger mothers, but became increasingly apparent amongst older women. Conclusions Socio-cultural disparities in GDM burden differ by maternal age at first delivery. Socio-cultural gradients were not evident among younger women. Health and social programs should seek to reduce the risk amongst all older women to that of the least deprived older mothers."
https://openalex.org/W1967825439,"The plasma membrane-associated sialidase NEU3 plays crucial roles in regulation of transmembrane signaling, and its aberrant up-regulation in various cancers contributes to malignancy. However, it remains uncertain how NEU3 is naturally activated and locates to plasma membranes, because of its Triton X-100 requirement for the sialidase activity in vitro and its often changing subcellular location. Among phospholipids examined, we demonstrate that phosphatidic acid (PA) elevates its sialidase activity 4 to 5 times at 50 μM in vitro at neutral pH and promotes translocation to the cell surface and cell migration through Ras-signaling in HeLa and COS-1 cells. NEU3 was found to interact selectively with PA as assessed by phospholipid array, liposome coprecipitation, and ELISA assays and to colocalize with phospholipase D (PLD) 1 in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) or serum stimulation. Studies using tagged NEU3 fragments with point mutations identified PA- and calmodulin (CaM)-binding sites around the N terminus and confirmed its participation in translocation and catalytic activity. EGF induced PLD1 activation concomitantly with enhanced NEU3 translocation to the cell surface, as assessed by confocal microscopy. These results suggest that interactions of NEU3 with PA produced by PLD1 are important for regulation of transmembrane signaling, this aberrant acceleration probably promoting malignancy in cancers.—Shiozaki, K., Takahashi, K., Hosono, M., Yamaguchi, K., Hata, K., Shiozaki, M., Bassi, R., Prinetti, A., Sonnino, S., Nitta, K., Miyagi, T.

Map elements that divide a map surface into regions, such as content-related linear symbols (e.g. streets, rivers, railway systems) or additional artificial layers (coordinate grids), provide an orientation pattern that can help users to reduce distortions in their mental representations. In recent years, the television industry has started to establish True-3D (autostereoscopic) displays as mass media. These modern displays make it possible to watch dynamic and static images including depth illusions without additional devices, such as 3D glasses. In these images, visual details can be distributed over different positions along the depth axis. Some empirical studies of vision research provided first evidence that 3D stereoscopic content attracts higher attention and is processed faster. So far, the impact of True-3D accentuating has not yet been explored concerning spatial memory tasks and cartography. This paper reports the results of two empirical studies that focus on investigations whether True-3D accentuating of artificial, regular overlaying line features (i.e. grids) and content-related, irregular line features (i.e. highways and main streets) in official urban topographic maps (scale 1/10,000) further improves human object location memory performance. The memory performance is measured as both the percentage of correctly recalled object locations (hit rate) and the mean distances of correctly recalled objects (spatial accuracy). It is shown that the True-3D accentuating of grids (depth offset: 5 cm) significantly enhances the spatial accuracy of recalled map object locations, whereas the True-3D emphasis of streets significantly improves the hit rate of recalled map object locations. These results show the potential of True-3D displays for an improvement of the cognitive representation of learned cartographic information."
https://openalex.org/W2024921031,"Hibernation is an adaptive strategy used by various mammals to survive the winter under situations of low ambient temperatures and limited or no food availability. The heart of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) has the remarkable ability to descend to low, near 0°C temperatures without falling into cardiac arrest. We hypothesized that the transcription factors GATA4 and Nkx2-5 may play a role in cardioprotection by facilitating the expression of key downstream targets such as troponin I, troponin C, and ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide). This study measured relative changes in transcript levels, protein levels, protein post-translational modifications, and transcription factor binding over six stages: euthermic control (EC), entrance into torpor (EN), early torpor (ET), late torpor (LT), early arousal (EA), and interbout arousal (IA). We found differential regulation of GATA4 whereby transcript/protein expression, post-translational modification (phosphorylation of serine 261), and DNA binding were enhanced during the transitory phases (entrance and arousal) of hibernation. Activation of GATA4 was paired with increases in cardiac troponin I, troponin C and ANP protein levels during entrance, while increases in p-GATA4 DNA binding during early arousal was paired with decreases in troponin I and no changes in troponin C and ANP protein levels. Unlike its binding partner, the relative mRNA/protein expression and DNA binding of Nkx2-5 did not change during hibernation. This suggests that either Nkx2-5 does not play a substantial role or other regulatory mechanisms not presently studied (e.g. posttranslational modifications) are important during hibernation. The data suggest a significant role for GATA4-mediated gene transcription in the differential regulation of genes which aid cardiac-specific challenges associated with torpor-arousal."

https://openalex.org/W2028715667,"The cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-dependent arachidonic acid metabolites, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), are potent survival factors and mitogens for renal epithelial cells, but the molecular identity in the cells that initiates the mitogenic signaling of EETs has remained elusive. We screened kidney cell lines for the expression of G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and found that the porcine renal tubular epithelial cell line LLCPKcl4, which has been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to the mitogenic effect of EETs, expresses higher levels of GPR40 mRNA and protein than the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293. EETs induced only a weak mitogenic EGFR signaling and mild cell proliferation in HEK293 cells. To determine whether GPR40 expression level is what mediates the mitogenic sensitivity of cells to EETs, we created a human GPR40 (hGPR40) cDNA construct and transfected it into HEK293 cells and picked up a number of stable transfectants. We found that GPR40 overexpression in HEK293 cells indeed significantly enhanced EET-induced cell proliferation and markedly augmented EGFR phosphorylation ERK activation, which were inhibited by the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478, or the HB-EGF inhibitor, CRM197. EETs significantly enhanced release of soluble HB-EGF, a natural ligand of EGFR, into the culture medium of hGPR40-transfected HEK293 cells, compared to empty vector-transfected cells. In mouse kidneys, markedly higher level of GPR40 protein was found in the cortex and outer stripe of outer medulla compared to the inner stripe of outer medulla and inner medulla. In situ hybridization confirmed that GPR40 mRNA was localized to a subset of renal tubules in the kidney, including the cortical collecting duct. Thus, this study provides the first demonstration that upregulation of GPR40 expression enhances the mitogenic response to EETs and a relatively high expression level of GPR40 is detected in a subset of tubules including cortical collecting ducts in the mammalian kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2153795765,"In this study, we compared adenoviral vaccine vectors with the capacity to induce equally potent immune responses against non-dominant and immunodominant epitopes of murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Our results demonstrate that vaccination targeting non-dominant epitopes facilitates potent virus-induced T-cell responses against immunodominant epitopes during subsequent challenge with highly invasive virus. In contrast, when an immunodominant epitope was included in the vaccine, the T-cell response associated with viral challenge remained focussed on that epitope. Early after challenge with live virus, the CD8+ T cells specific for vaccine-encoded epitopes, displayed a phenotype typically associated with prolonged/persistent antigenic stimulation marked by high levels of KLRG-1, as compared to T cells reacting to epitopes not included in the vaccine. Notably, this association was lost over time in T cells specific for the dominant T cell epitopes, and these cells were fully capable of expanding in response to a new viral challenge. Overall, our data suggests a potential for broadening of the antiviral CD8+ T-cell response by selecting non-dominant antigens to be targeted by vaccination. In addition, our findings suggest that prior adenoviral vaccination is not likely to negatively impact the long-term and protective immune response induced and maintained by a vaccine-attenuated chronic viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1989047344,"Background Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is involved in tumorigenesis and development. However, EGFR expression alone has limited clinical and prognostic significance. Recently, the cross-talk between EGFR and G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 has become increasingly recognized. Methods In the present study, immunohistochemical staining of EGFR and CXCR4 was performed on paraffin-embedded specimens from 131 patients with surgically resected PDAC. Subsequently, the associations between EGFR expression, CXCR4 expression, EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression and clinicopathologic factors were assessed, and survival analyses were performed. Results In total, 64 (48.9%) patients expressed EGFR, 68 (51.9%) expressed CXCR4, and 33 (25.2%) coexpressed EGFR and CXCR4. No significant association between EGFR and CXCR4 expression was observed (P = 0.938). EGFR expression significantly correlated with tumor differentiation (P = 0.031), whereas CXCR4 expression significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001). EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.026), TNM stage (P = 0.048), and poor tumor differentiation (P = 0.004). By univariate survival analysis, both CXCR4 expression and EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression were significant prognostic factors for poor disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Moreover, EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression significantly increased the hazard ratio for both recurrence and death compared with EGFR or CXCR4 protein expression alone. Multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (HR = 2.33, P<0.001) and OS (HR = 2.48, P = 0.001). Conclusions In conclusion, our data indicate that although EGFR expression alone has limited clinical and prognostic significance, EGFR/CXCR4 coexpression identified a subset of PDAC patients with more aggressive tumor characteristics and a significantly worse prognosis. Our results suggest a potentially important ""cross-talk"" between CXCR4 and EGFR intracellular pathways and indicate that the simultaneous inhibition of these pathways might be an attractive therapeutic strategy for PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W2002219179,"Oncogenic transformation is characterized by morphological changes resulting from alterations in actin dynamics and adhesive activities. Emerging evidence suggests that the protocadherin FAT4 acts as a tumor suppressor in humans, and reduced FAT4 gene expression has been reported in breast and lung cancers and melanoma. However, the mechanism controlling FAT4 gene expression is poorly understood. In this study, we show that transient activation of the Src oncoprotein represses FAT4 mRNA expression through actin depolymerization in the immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Src activation causes actin depolymerization via the MEK/Erk/Cofilin cascade. The MEK inhibitor U0126 blocks the inhibitory effect of Src on FAT4 mRNA expression and Src-induced actin depolymerization. To determine whether actin dynamics act on the regulation of FAT4 mRNA expression, we treated MCF-10A cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Y-27632 treatment decreased FAT4 mRNA expression. This suppressive effect was blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cofilin1. Furthermore, simultaneous administration of Latrunculin A (an actin depolymerizing agent), Y-27632, and Cofilin1 siRNA to the cells resulted in a marked reduction of FAT4 mRNA expression. Intriguingly, we also found that FAT4 mRNA expression was reduced under both low cell density and low stiffness conditions, which suggests that mechanotransduction affects FAT4 mRNA expression. Additionally, we show that siRNA-mediated FAT4 knockdown induced the activity of the Hippo effector YAP/TAZ in MCF-10A cells. Taken together, our results reveal a novel inhibitory mechanism of FAT4 gene expression through actin depolymerization during Src-induced carcinogenesis in human breast cells."
https://openalex.org/W2007723869,"The oncogenic roles of PDGF-D and its proteolytic activator, matriptase, have been strongly implicated in human prostate cancer. Latent full-length PDGF-D (FL-D) consists of a CUB domain, a growth factor domain (GFD), and the hinge region in between. Matriptase processes the FL-D dimer into a GFD dimer (GFD-D) in a stepwise manner, involving generation of a hemidimer (HD), an intermediate product containing one FL-D subunit and one GFD subunit. Although the HD is a pro-growth factor that can be processed into the GFD-D by matriptase, the HD can also act as a dominant-negative ligand that prevents PDGF-B-mediated β-PDGF receptor activation in fibroblasts. The active GFD-D can be further cleaved into a smaller and yet inactive form if matriptase-mediated proteolysis persists. Through mutagenesis and functional analyses, we found that the R340R341GR343A (P4–P1/P1′) motif within the GFD is the matriptase cleavage site through which matriptase can deactivate PDGF-D. Comparative sequence analysis based on the published crystal structure of PDGF-B predicted that the matriptase cleavage site R340R341GR343A is within loop III of the GFD, a critical structural element for its binding with the β-PDGF receptor. Interestingly, we also found that matriptase processing regulates the deposition of PDGF-D dimer species into the extracellular matrix (ECM) with increased binding from the FL-D dimer, to the HD, and to the GFD-D. Furthermore, we provide evidence that R340R341GR343A within the GFD is critical for PDGF-D deposition and binding to the ECM. In this study, we report a structural element crucial for the biological function and ECM deposition of PDGF-D and provide molecular insight into the dynamic functional interplay between the serine protease matriptase and PDGF-D. The oncogenic roles of PDGF-D and its proteolytic activator, matriptase, have been strongly implicated in human prostate cancer. Latent full-length PDGF-D (FL-D) consists of a CUB domain, a growth factor domain (GFD), and the hinge region in between. Matriptase processes the FL-D dimer into a GFD dimer (GFD-D) in a stepwise manner, involving generation of a hemidimer (HD), an intermediate product containing one FL-D subunit and one GFD subunit. Although the HD is a pro-growth factor that can be processed into the GFD-D by matriptase, the HD can also act as a dominant-negative ligand that prevents PDGF-B-mediated β-PDGF receptor activation in fibroblasts. The active GFD-D can be further cleaved into a smaller and yet inactive form if matriptase-mediated proteolysis persists. Through mutagenesis and functional analyses, we found that the R340R341GR343A (P4–P1/P1′) motif within the GFD is the matriptase cleavage site through which matriptase can deactivate PDGF-D.

https://openalex.org/W2076848746,"The tegument of all herpesviruses contains a capsid-bound large protein that is essential for multiple viral processes, including capsid transport, decapsidation at the nuclear pore complex, particle assembly, and secondary envelopment, through mechanisms that are still incompletely understood. We report here a structural characterization of the central 970 residues of this protein for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1 UL36, 3164 residues). This large fragment is essentially a 34-nm-long monomeric fiber. The crystal structure of its C terminus shows an elongated domain-swapped dimer. Modeling and molecular dynamics simulations give a likely molecular organization for the monomeric form and extend our findings to alphaherpesvirinae. Hence, we propose that an essential feature of UL36 is the existence in its central region of a stalk capable of connecting capsid and membrane across the tegument and that the ability to switch between monomeric and dimeric forms may help UL36 fulfill its multiple functions."
https://openalex.org/W1976222640,"Facial blushing may usually be undesirable but may have an ameliorative function for some individuals under some circumstances. Researchers have studied the blush in laboratory settings, but not in daily life. In the present research, conducted with young adults, we employed for the first time an event-contingent recording method for assessing facial blushing during every-day social encounters. Blushing was associated with feeling embarrassed, ashamed, and exposed. These findings, though based on correlational analyses, are consistent with the idea that blushing is often unpleasant and can be maladaptive, and may contribute to the common belief that blushing is an undesirable response. Frequent blushers generally reported lower levels of dominant behavior, higher levels of submissive behavior, and perceived their social interaction partners as more powerful and less affiliative. This was independent of whether they blushed or not, suggesting that altered social behaviors and perceptions are associated with blushing-associated traits rather than with the blushing state. The experience of the blush varied as a function of the frequency with which a person blushed. Blushing was associated with higher levels of shame in frequent blushers than in infrequent blushers. In infrequent blushers, blushing was associated with higher levels of pleasant affect, suggesting that for infrequent blushers the blush may occur in positive social encounters."
https://openalex.org/W2082689632,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes a hydroxymethyl group transfer from l-serine to tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) to yield glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-H4folate). SHMT is crucial for deoxythymidylate biosynthesis and a target for antimalarial drug development. Our previous studies indicate that PvSHMT catalyzes the reaction via a ternary complex mechanism. To define the kinetic mechanism of this catalysis, we explored the PvSHMT reaction by employing various methodologies including ligand binding, transient, and steady-state kinetics as well as product analysis by rapid-quench and HPLC/MS techniques. The results indicate that PvSHMT can bind first to either l-serine or H4folate. The dissociation constants for the enzyme·l-serine and enzyme·H4folate complexes were determined as 0.18 ± 0.08 and 0.35 ± 0.06 mm, respectively. The amounts of glycine formed after single turnovers of different preformed binary complexes were similar, indicating that the reaction proceeds via a random-order binding mechanism. In addition, the rate constant of glycine formation measured by rapid-quench and HPLC/MS analysis is similar to the kcat value (1.09 ± 0.05 s−1) obtained from the steady-state kinetics, indicating that glycine formation is the rate-limiting step of SHMT catalysis. This information will serve as a basis for future investigation on species-specific inhibition of SHMT for antimalarial drug development.

(l-serine:tetrahydrofolate 5,10-hydroxymethyl transferase; EC 2.1.2.1) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of a hydroxymethyl group from l-serine to tetrahydrofolate (H4folate), yielding glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2-H4folate) as products (1.Schirch L.

Biol. 2005; 9: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The enzyme is involved in the deoxythymidylate synthesis cycle, as CH2-H4folate is a substrate for thymidylate synthase, which synthesizes deoxythymidylate, a precursor for DNA biosynthesis (3.Kappes B.

In addition to the physiological H4folate-dependent SHMT reaction, SHMT from many organisms can also catalyze various other reactions such as H4folate-independent retro-aldol cleavage of β-hydroxy amino acids including l-threonine, l-allo-threonine, (d,l)-β-phenylserine, and l-threo-phenylserine, transaminations, racemization, decarboxylation, and condensation (2.Schirch V.

Plasmodium SHMT has been shown to be essential for parasite growth and development, making it a prime target for antimalarial drug chemotherapy development (11.Pornthanakasem W. Kongkasuriyachai D.

J. 2012; 11: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In general, both of these enzymes are similar in their enzymatic properties. The crystal structure of PfSHMT has been recently solved, revealing the unique function of a cysteine pair at the folate binding pocket in regulating enzyme function through variation of the redox states of these cysteines. This regulation is different from the mammalian and bacterial SHMTs (15.Chitnumsub P. Ittarat W. Jaruwat A. Noytanom K. Amornwatcharapong W. Pornthanakasem W. Chaiyen P. Yuthavong Y. Leartsakulpanich U. The structure of Plasmodium falciparum serine hydroxymethyltransferase reveals a novel redox switch that regulates its activities.Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 1517-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that Plasmodium SHMTs display several properties that are distinct from the human enzyme, including the inactivation kinetics toward thiosemicarbazide (16.Pinthong C. Maenpuen S. Amornwatcharapong W. Yuthavong Y. Leartsakulpanich U. Chaiyen P.

This implies that it is possible to design species-specific inhibitors for anti-malarial drug development. An in-depth understanding of Plasmodium SHMT kinetics and mechanism is therefore needed so that the differences in reaction details among SHMTs can be understood and used for the development of specific inhibitors. Although the reaction of SHMT from various species has been investigated, many of these studies focused on the non-physiological reaction, or the reverse reaction of glycine and CH2-H4folate (2.Schirch V.

The pre-steady-state kinetics of the H4folate-dependent SHMT reaction has never been investigated. Double-reciprocal plots of bi-substrate kinetics of SHMT from rabbit liver cytosol, P. vivax, and P. falciparum display intersecting lines, suggesting that the reaction occurs via a ternary complex mechanism in which the formation of an enzyme·serine·H4folate complex is required for catalysis (5.Sopitthummakhun K.

However, it was unclear whether the substrates bind in a compulsory or random order. Although the binding of l-serine or other amino acids to SHMT can be clearly monitored by spectroscopic detection based on the formation of an external aldimine, until now, evidence supporting direct binding between SHMT and H4folate has not been demonstrated. In this study, we employed various methodologies including ligand binding measurements, as well as transient and steady-state kinetics to investigate the PvSHMT reaction. Upon anaerobic titration of H4folate into the enzyme solution, a spectroscopic signal resulting from the direct binding of PvSHMT and H4folate was detected. Results from rapid-quench and HPLC/MS analysis and steady-state kinetics have clearly established glycine formation as the rate-limiting step for the overall reaction of PvSHMT. All chemicals and reagents used were analytical grade and of the highest purity commercially available as described previously (5.Sopitthummakhun K. Maenpuen S. Yuthavong Y. Leartsakulpanich U.

The solution was allowed to cool, and the absorption of the resulting stable compound, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (CH+-H4folate; ϵ350 = 26 mm−1 cm−1) was measured. Based on the assumption that all of the H4folate is converted to CH+-H4folate, the determined concentration of CH+-H4folate is equivalent to the concentration of H4folate.

Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication and then centrifuged to obtain crude extract. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using polyethyleneimine precipitation, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, and SP-Sepharose chromatography.

In brief, a mixture of enzyme solution containing PvSHMT (1 μm) and His6-tagged MTHFR (3 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT was mixed with a substrate solution containing NADH (100 μm), l-serine (2 mm), and H4folate (400 μm) at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions by using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (TgK Scientific instruments, models SF-61DX2 or SF-61SX). A stopped-flow machine was used for steady-state assays to maintain anaerobic conditions of the experiments. The anaerobic condition was achieved by rinsing the flow circuits with O2-scrubbing solution (dithionite). Before experiments, the flow system was washed with anaerobic buffer. All reagents were prepared in an anaerobic glovebox (<5 ppm O2). The reaction was measured by following the consumption of NADH, for which the absorbance at 375 nm was monitored to avoid interference from absorbance of H4folate. Slopes of the kinetic traces were analyzed by Program A (developed by Chun-Jen Chiu, Rong Chang, Joel Dinverno, and David P. Ballou from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and the initial velocities of PvSHMT were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.92 mm−1 cm−1 at 375 nm. One unit of PvSHMT was defined as the amount of the enzyme used for oxidizing 1 μmol of NADH per minute at 25 °C under pH 7.0. Two-substrate steady-state kinetics was performed and analyzed according to a protocol similar to that described in a previous report (5.Sopitthummakhun K. Maenpuen S. Yuthavong Y.

The study was carried out at pH 8.0 because PvSHMT was found to have the highest activity at this pH (5.Sopitthummakhun K. Maenpuen S. Yuthavong Y. Leartsakulpanich U. Chaiyen P.

Substrate solutions containing NADH (100 μm), various concentrations of l-serine (200–6400 μm) and H4folate (25–400 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT were mixed with an enzyme solution containing PvSHMT (1 μm) and His6-tagged MTHFR (3 μm) in the same buffer at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer.

To determine whether PvSHMT can directly bind H4folate without requiring prior binding of l-serine, we investigated the binding of PvSHMT and H4folate under anaerobic conditions to avoid interference signals from H4folate oxidation. An anaerobic solution (1 ml) of PvSHMT (∼47 μm; A422 ∼0.3) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT prepared inside the anaerobic glove box (<5ppm oxygen; Belle Technology, UK) was first scanned to record an enzyme spectrum before adding various concentrations of H4folate (0.050–2.954 mm). After adding each concentration of H4folate, the mixture was thoroughly mixed and left for 5 min before recording a spectrum again. The spectrum of free enzyme was subtracted from all spectra obtained from each titration to determine the absorbance changes (ΔA). The ΔA values were plotted against the H4folate concentration and the Kd for the binding of H4folate to PvSHMT was determined according to Equation 3, where ΔA represents the absorbance change, ΔAmax is the maximum absorbance change, [L]free is a concentration of free ligand, and Kd is a dissociation constant of the enzyme·ligand complex. The analysis was done using Marquardt-Lavenberg algorithms in the KaleidaGraph program version 4.0. ΔAΔAmax=[L]freeKd+[L]free(Eq. 3) A solution of 31 μm PvSHMT was mixed with various concentrations of l-serine (0.4–12.8 mm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT at 25 °C using a single-mixing mode stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The binding reaction was monitored at 435 nm where it gives a large absorbance change due to the formation of the external aldimine of the serine·PLP complex. All kinetic traces were analyzed using Program A. Observed rate constants (kobs) associated with each kinetic phase were plotted against the concentrations of l-serine and analyzed according to Equations 4 and 5. kf and kr are the forward and reverse rate constants for the free enzyme isomerization prior to the ligand binding according to the conformational selection model (23.Vogt A.D. Di Cera E. Conformational selection or induced fit? A critical appraisal of the kinetic mechanism.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5894-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), kmax is the maximum observed rate constant, kintercept is the rate constant at an ordinate intercept, KS represents a concentration of substrate that is a half-value of kmax. kobs=kmax⋅SKs+S+kintercept(Eq. 4) kobs=kf+(KsKs+S)kr(Eq. 5) Three different mixing setups were performed to identify the sequence of substrate binding as follows: (i) a solution of pre-equilibrated binary complex of PvSHMT·l-serine (45/30 μm) was mixed with various concentrations of H4folate (0.2–6.4 mm), (ii) a solution of pre-equilibrated binary complex of PvSHMT (45 μm) with either 0.4 or 3.2 mm H4folate was mixed with l-serine (30 μm), and (iii) a solution of PvSHMT (45 μm) was mixed with solution mixtures of l-serine (30 μm) and various concentrations of H4folate (0.2–6.4 mm). All reactions were carried out under anaerobic conditions at 25 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Because the largest signal change was observed at 496 nm, the reaction progression was monitored at this wavelength using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (single-mixing mode) to detect the formation of quinonoid species. Kinetic traces were analyzed by Program A. All concentrations specified are final mixing concentrations. An anaerobic solution of pre-equilibrated binary complex of PvSHMT·l-serine (45/30 μm) was mixed with 0.4 or 3.2 mm H4folate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mm palatinose (as internal control) using a rapid-quench flow apparatus (TgK Scientific, United Kingdom), equipped inside an anaerobic glove box in which the oxygen concentration is <5 ppm oxygen (Belle Technology, United Kingdom). The reactions were quenched at various time points (0.03–6.30 s) by addition of a HCl solution (0.15 m), and the acid-quenched reaction mixtures were then collected for analysis. Detection of glycine and serine was carried out either via phenylisothiocyanate amino acid derivatization and monitored by HPLC/UV (Agilent 1100) or directly detected by HPLC/MS analysis (Agilent 1260 equipped with Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass spectrometer). Samples from rapid-quench flow experiments were transferred into a Microcon ultrafiltration unit and then centrifuged at 12,290 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to separate the small molecules from the macromolecules. The derivatization method and HPLC/UV analysis were performed according to the protocol described previously with slight modifications (24.Harris E.L. Amino acid analysis by precolumn derivatization.Methods Mol. Biol. 1988; 3: 33-47PubMed Google Scholar). For HPLC analysis, the dried samples were redissolved in 50 μl of solvent A (0.14 m sodium acetate, pH 6.4, containing 0.05% TEA) and centrifuged at 27,670 × g at room temperature for 30 min to clarify the samples. A clear supernatant was injected onto a C18 column (Waters®; 3.9 × 150 mm) that was pre-equilibrated with 100% solvent A with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 100% solvent A for 15 min, and then a gradient of 0–53% of solvent B (60% acetonitrile/H2O) was applied, in which B was gradually increased over the course of 10 min and maintained at the highest concentration for 5 more minutes. A gradient of 53–100% solvent B was applied over the next 5 min and held for another 5 min before re-equilibrating the column in 100% solvent A. Under these conditions, derivatized serine and glycine can be clearly separated and showed retention times of 7.9 and 9.1 min, respectively. Similar amino acid derivatization as described was applied to standard glycine and l-serine solutions (1–30 μm) and a standard curve was generated by plotting the averaged peak areas as a function of glycine or l-serine concentrations. For the direct sample analysis using HPLC/MS, samples collected from rapid-quench flow experiments were filtered through a Microcon ultrafiltration unit by centrifugation at 12,290 × g for 20 min. The filtrate was injected onto a Zorbax-NH2 column (Agilent Technology; 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) that was pre-equilibrated with 80% solvent C (acetonitrile + 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 60 min. The column was then washed with 80% solvent C for 2 min before the eluent was gradually changed to 60% solvent C over the course of 3 min and further held at this condition for 15 min. The percentage of solvent C was then gradually increased to 80% over 22 min and held at this condition for 10 more minutes to re-equilibrate the column for new injections. HPLC chromatograms of glycine and serine showed retention times of 14.2 and 15.2 min, respectively. The eluent from the HPLC column was continuously flowed into the mass spectrometer equipped with an API-electrospray ionizer. Conditions for mass spectrometric detection were as follows. Nebulizer pressure was set at 35 p.s.i. The capillary source voltage was set at 3 kV. The drying gas temperature was maintained at 350 °C. Drying gas flow was 12 liters min−1. Scan mode was from 50 to 150 m/z. The polarity was set in a positively selected ion mode in which glycine and serine were detected separately at 76 and 106 m/z, respectively. The peak area for glycine and serine was quantified based on glycine and serine standard curves, for which the amino acid was treated with the same condition as those from the rapid quenched flow experiments. The amounts of glycine product formed at different time points were analyzed using a single exponential equation as shown in Equation 6, where A is the amount of glycine at any time, A0 is the total amount of glycine that can be produced from the reaction, kobs is the observed rate constant for the glycine formation and t is the reaction time. A=A0(1−e−kobst)(Eq. 6) For analysis of the products resulting from the different types of mixing setups previously described, similar reactions as those performed in the stopped-flow experiments were carried out in a rapid quench flow machine, and the reactions were quenched at 10 s to measure glycine formation and to quantify the remaining l-serine. Measurement of l-serine and glycine was carried out as described above. As PvSHMT activity is the highest at pH 8.0 (5.Sopitthummakhun K."
https://openalex.org/W2058911355,"Comprehensively sampled phylogenetic trees provide the most compelling foundations for strong inferences in comparative evolutionary biology. Mismatches are common, however, between the taxa for which comparative data are available and the taxa sampled by published phylogenetic analyses. Moreover, many published phylogenies are gene trees, which cannot always be adapted immediately for species level comparisons because of discordance, gene duplication, and other confounding biological processes. A new database, STBase, lets comparative biologists quickly retrieve species level phylogenetic hypotheses in response to a query list of species names. The database consists of 1 million single- and multi-locus data sets, each with a confidence set of 1000 putative species trees, computed from GenBank sequence data for 413,000 eukaryotic taxa. Two bodies of theoretical work are leveraged to aid in the assembly of multi-locus concatenated data sets for species tree construction. First, multiply labeled gene trees are pruned to conflict-free singly-labeled species-level trees that can be combined between loci. Second, impacts of missing data in multi-locus data sets are ameliorated by assembling only decisive data sets. Data sets overlapping with the user’s query are ranked using a scheme that depends on user-provided weights for tree quality and for taxonomic overlap of the tree with the query. Retrieval times are independent of the size of the database, typically a few seconds. Tree quality is assessed by a real-time evaluation of bootstrap support on just the overlapping subtree. Associated sequence alignments, tree files and metadata can be downloaded for subsequent analysis. STBase provides a tool for comparative biologists interested in exploiting the most relevant sequence data available for the taxa of interest. It may also serve as a prototype for future species tree oriented databases and as a resource for assembly of larger species phylogenies from precomputed trees."
https://openalex.org/W2026976020,"The level of expression of sexually selected traits is generally determined by genes, environment and their interaction. In species that use multiple sexual signals which may be costly to produce, investing in the expression of one sexual signal may limit the expression of the other, favoring the evolution of a strategy for resource allocation among signals. As a result, even when the expression of sexual signals is condition dependent, the relative level of expression of each signal may be heritable. We tested this hypothesis in the East-Mediterranean barn swallow (Hirundo rustica transitiva), in which males have been shown to express two uncorrelated sexual signals: red-brown ventral coloration, and long tail streamers. We show that variation in both signals may partially be explained by age, as well as by paternal origin (genetic father-son regressions), but that the strongest similarity between fathers and sons is the relative allocation towards one trait or the other (relative expression index), rather than the expression of the traits themselves. These results suggest that the expression of one signal is not independent of the other, and that genetic strategies for resource allocation among sexual signals may be selected for during the evolution of multiple sexual signals."
https://openalex.org/W1986392567,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are ~20 to 24 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs that play crucial roles in regulation of gene expression. In plants, sRNAs are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs), phased siRNAs (pha-siRNAs), cis and trans natural antisense transcript siRNAs (cis- and trans-nat siRNAs). Pima (Gossypium barbadense L.) is one of the most economically important fiber crops, producing the best and longest spinnable fiber. Although some miRNAs are profiled in Pima, little is known about siRNAs, the largest subclass of plant sRNAs. In order to profile these gene regulators in Pima, a comprehensive analysis of sRNAs was conducted by mining publicly available sRNA data, leading to identification of 678 miRNAs, 3,559,126 ra-siRNAs, 627 pha-siRNAs, 136,600 cis-nat siRNAs and 79,994 trans-nat siRNAs. The 678 miRNAs, belonging to 98 conserved and 402 lineage-specific families, were produced from 2,138 precursors, of which 297 arose from introns, exons, or intron/UTR-exon junctions of protein-coding genes. Ra-siRNAs were produced from various repeat loci, while most (97%) were yielded from retrotransposons, especially LTRs (long terminal repeats). The genes encoding auxin-signaling-related proteins, NBS-LRRs and transcription factors were major sources of pha-siRNAs, while two conserved TAS3 homologs were found as well. Most cis-NATs in Pima overlapped in enclosed and convergent orientations, while a few hybridized in divergent and coincided orientations. Most cis- and trans-nat siRNAs were produced from overlapping regions. Additionally, characteristics of length and the 5’-first nucleotide of each sRNA class were analyzed as well. Results in this study created a valuable molecular resource that would facilitate studies on mechanism of controlling gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2331456468,"The transient analysis of a uniform transmission line of finite length is considered in this paper. For the first time this paper provides an analytical expression for the time-domain response of an RC transmission line, which is stimulated by a step function that is fed into both ends of the transmission line. In particular, we find an analytical expression for the step response at the center of the transmission line, in order to determine the worst-case rise time. This is of interest, for example, in large charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays, where long polysilicon lines are dual-fed in order to mitigate degradation in rise time. The analytical expressions for the RC transmission line are supported by computer-simulated lumped RC models."
https://openalex.org/W1998853613,"Watching Hugues Lantuit work the cocktail hour at Arctic Change, a Canadian research conference held in Ottawa in December, is a master class in networking. He's gracious. (“It is very nice to meet you,” he tells a graduate student, shaking with two hands.) He's self-deprecating. (“I'm sure I have no shot at that job.”) He's a little coarse. (“I tried for half an hour to tie this f\***|ing bow tie; can you help me?”) He is constantly introducing one person to another. “Ah, you work at the Yukon Research Centre,” he says to the stranger he's persuaded to tie his bow tie, as a crowd forms. “We are actually collaborating on a multimillion-dollar grant proposal. So if we get it, I will remember this moment as a formative step.” Laughter all around.

In the burgeoning world of Arctic research, nearly everyone knows Lantuit, a professor at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Potsdam, Germany. At age 37, he's leveraged his deep network of contacts to build an impressive career. In 2006, he co-founded the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS), which now has more than 5000 members. Five years later, he became co–principal investigator on a 5-year, €9 million project to study permafrost in the Arctic. He serves on major international research committees. The research program he manages, on Herschel Island in the Canadian Beaufort Sea, is at an important site for monitoring erosion of Arctic permafrost coasts, which make up a third of Earth's shores. “He's the man,” says colleague Paul Overduin, a geoscientist at AWI. “He puts us on the map in a lot of ways.”

“He's just someone who's constantly connecting his peers.”

As early as graduate school, Lantuit says, he was “genuinely interested in bringing people together.” As a master's student at McGill University in 2002, he founded the Geography Graduate Society and became a key assistant on an international permafrost-mapping project. The experience taught him lessons about networking in science that have subsequently shaped his career.

First, he says, what matters isn't how impressive the title on a business card is—it's the role you play in projects or initiatives. Second, while wearing a welcoming face never hurts, it's what you offer scientifically that turns conversations into scientific opportunities.

Lantuit got connected early on, but he found few resources to help other young Arctic scientists do the same. So he and Jenny Baeseman, a microbial biologist, created APECS, which runs workshops that bring together young and established scientists to explore publishing, fieldwork, funding, and career advancement. His reputation as a connector grew as he matched colleagues with opportunities—including helping Baeseman, who was focused on Antarctica, join a project in the Arctic. “He's just someone who's constantly connecting his peers,” Baeseman says.

They connect him in return: Lantuit's CV lists the myriad partnerships, international research projects, journal special issues, panels, and conferences he's created or run. All that connecting takes time away from research, he acknowledges. “There are scientists who will publish 50 papers in Nature in their career. I won't. I'm fine with that.” Yet, none of this would be possible if he hadn't published well-regarded papers on erosion on Arctic coasts. “I tell my [Ph.D.] students, you need to deliver scientifically,” he says. Several of them wanted to attend the Ottawa meeting, but Lantuit said no. “Their dissertations are late.”

Lantuit's appetite for new projects and partnerships remains voracious. Managing his various ongoing efforts taxes his phone's scheduling app, which lists a relentless string of meetings, dinners, sessions, and cocktail hours for the 5-day meeting. “I have this inner drive to connect,” he says as he gets up to walk to the conference's gala dinner. He has assembled a colorful table of heavy hitters: influential scientists, well-known administrators, and funders. These are useful people to know, but it's clear he genuinely likes each one. “It's fun,” he says, and heads for the ballroom.
