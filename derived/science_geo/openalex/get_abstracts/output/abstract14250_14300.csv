https://openalex.org/W2018946379,A model for control of the desynchronized phase of the sleep cycle postulates reciprocal interaction between cells in the pontine gigantocellular tegmental field (FTG cells) and cells in the nucleus locus coeruleus and nucleus subcoeruleus (LC cells). This physiological model leads to equations of the Lotka-Volterra type; the time course of activity predicted by the model is in good agreement with actual long-term recordings of FTG cells and single-cycle data for LC cells.
https://openalex.org/W1966387759,A degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells develops in cats when casein is the source of dietary protein. Amino acid profiles indicate that the degeneration is associated with a selective decrease in plasma and retinal taurine concentrations. A sulfur amino acid deficit in the casein diet combined with specific amino acid requirements of the cat appear related to this unique expression of taurine deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W1633176701,"Isomers of cis-octadecenoic acid, with the double bond in each position in the hydrocarbon chain, were used to synthesize the corresponding 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3phosphorylcholines (lecithins). Differential thermal analysis of the lecithins, as a function of water content, permitted evaluation of the limiting transition temperature (Tc) of each isomer. Values of Tc plotted against double bond position fell on a smooth curve with a minimum at minus 22 degrees for the dioctadec-9'-enoyl compound. The presence of a pretransition endotherm in differential thermal analysis of 1,2-dioctadec-15'-and 1,2-dioctadec-16'-enoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine implies the existence of two beta crystalline forms. This was not observed with any of the other lecithins. Enthalpy and entropy data were then obtained from differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Values of delta H were lower (7.6 plus or minus 0.1 kcal mol- minus 1) when the center of unsaturation was near the middle of the hydrocarbon chain than they were (9.6 kcal mol- minus 1) when the center of unsaturation was close to either end of the chain. However, values of delta S showed no consistent variation with double bond position. Four positional isomers of 1-octadec-cis-enoyl-2-octadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine were synthesized. With the double bond near the middle of the chain or close to the terminal group, the Tc values of the mixed acid lecithins were higher than those of the corresponding dioctadecenoyl lecithins. 13-C nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation measurements were used to obtain information about chain motion of selected 1,2-dioctadec-cis-enoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholines at a temperature (52 degrees) above the Tc values. Spin-lattice relaxation times of the resolved resonances indicated that location of double bonds near the middle, as compared to either end, of the hydrocarbon chain favors enhanced molecular motion along the length of the chins and especially at the terminal methyl end. In the gel state, the minimum interaction potential energy of hydrocarbon chains in bilayers formed from dioctadecenoyl lipids appears to be minimized by localization of the double bond near the middle of the chains. It is suggested that in the case of homogeneous chains the double bond primarily affects the cooperativity of interactions and has very little steric effect on van der Waals' contacts. By contrast, in bilayers of mixed lecithins, with heterogeneous chains, the steric effect may become dominant, depending on double bond position. These differences in chain packing in the gel state are promulgated beyond the phase transition to the liquid crystalline state as an enhancement of chain motion as the temperature rises above Tc."

https://openalex.org/W1577456851,"In the vitamin D-depleted rat, all nucleated tissues examined (brain, lung, heart, pancreas, liver, cartilage, muscle, bone, kidney, and intestine) contained a soluble substance which bound 25-hydroxy[3H]cholecalciferol in vitro specifically and sedimented at 6.3 S in linear sucrose gradients. The serum-steroid complex sedimented a 4.1 S, and erythrocyte lysates were apparently devoid of specific binding activity. The ability of these cytosols to specifically bind the steroid was destroyed by treatment with trypsin, but not by RNase, DNase, or 1 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The sedimentation pattern was not altered in sucrose gradients containing 0.5 M KCl or following cytosol preparation and ultracentrifugation in gradients containing 0.012 M dithiothreitol. The apparent avidity for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (KA similar to 2 times 10- M) was slightly higher in muscle and kidney cytosols than in serum, but serum contained a large number of specific binding sites. The presence of widespread, high affinity binding proteins for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol raises the possibility that tissues other than the intestine, bone, and kidney may respond directly to vitamin D metabolites."

Bond length and angle constraints were applied only intermittenly during the computations. At a late stage of the refinement, atomic parameters for only the Fe4S4 cluster plus the 4 associated cystein S-gamma atoms were adjusted by least squares methods and kept fixed during the rest of the refinement. The refined model consists of 625 of the 632 nonhydrogen atoms in the protein plus 75 water molecules. Seven side chain atoms could not be located in the final electron density map. A computer program rather than visual inspection was used wherever possible in the refinement: for locating water molecules, for removing water molecules that too closely approach other atoms, for deleting atoms that lay in regions of low electron density, and for evaluating the progress of refinement. Fo-Fc Fourier refinement is sufficiently economical to be applied routinely in protein crystal structure determinations. The complete HiPIP refinement required approximately 12 hours of CDC 3600 computer time and cost less than $3000 starting from a trial structure, based upon multipe isomorphoous replacement phases, which gave an R of 43%..."
https://openalex.org/W1999634033,"WE report direct evidence that conjugation with glutathione (GSH) is a significant mechanism for detoxification of the epoxides of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We believe that the level of the enzymes may be directly relevant to the carcinogenic potential of the hydrocarbons, which are common pollutants1. They are metabolised by microsomal mixed function oxygenases and associated enzymes, to detoxified as well as carcinogenic forms2–4. One of the metabolic products of benzo(α)pyrene is the ‘K’ region epoxide, benzo(α)pyrene-4, 5-oxide. Such epoxides bind to macromolecules, are mutagenic and may be the carcinogenic forms of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons5. Benzo(α)pyrene-4,5-oxide is converted enzymatically either to the dihydrodiol by hydrolysis6 or to a thioether by conjugation with GSH7. The glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18) detoxify many compounds8,9 including alkyl epoxides10 and arene oxides11–12. Now that pure glutathione S-transferases are available (five rat10,12,13 and five human, K. Kamisaka, W. H. H., J. N. K., I. M. Arias and W. B. J., unpublished), we have been able to evaluate directly the extent to which these enzymes can produce GSH conjugates of the polycyclic aromatic oxide and, presumably, detoxify it."

We trained experimental animals in ten trials spaced 1 hour apart to withdraw from food alone by electrically shocking them if they fed or were indifferent to food. The greatest increase in the number of learned withdrawal responses occurred within 12 hours after conditioning, and was accompanied by long-lasting increases in the threshold and latency of feeding responses. Control animals, which received food and shock alternately (unpaired) every half hour, showed considerably weaker changes than experimentals. These control responses quickly returned to initial levels after conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W1490954300,"CDP-diglyceride, an important metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of phospholipids, has been isolated for the first time from a mammalian tissue. The isolated material, labeled in incubations of intact rat pineal glands with 32P, [3H]cytidine, or [3H]CTP in the presence of DL-propranolol, was chromatographically identical with authentic CDP-diglyceride and was able to serve as phosphatidyl donor in the enzymatic synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidyglycerol. It yielded the expected products upon enzymatic and chemical degradation. No dCDP-diglyceride was detected No radioactive CDP-diglyceride was detected following incubations in the absence of propranolol. Stimulation of CDP-diglyceride labeling from 32P1 occurred at propranolol concentrations between 0.03 and 1.0 mM. Net synthesis of the liponucleotide was shown. At 0.1 mM, propranolol incrased the incorporation of radioactivity into phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid. When inositol (10 mM) and propranolol (0.1 mM) were both present, phosphatidylinositol labeling was further increased, wheas stimulation of phosphatidylglycerol and CPD-diglyceride labeling was abolished. Since CDP-diglyceride did not accumulate in the absence of the drug, its availability may normally be the limiting factor in phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. When propranol is present, inositol may become limiting and thus may lead to the observed labeling pattern."

Some peaks are assigned to specific chemical groups of the molecule; others, notably the conformationally sensitive amide III vibrations, provide information on the structurally distinct regions of the molecule. Deuteration of the NH groups is instrumental in the assignment of these vibrational modes. The relative intensities of bands typical of α-helical conformations (near 1265 and 1304 cm-1) and bands associated with nonhelical structure (near 1244 cm-1) are sensitive indicators of myosin substructure and represent potentially useful probes of conformational changes."

https://openalex.org/W1552960441,"Initial velocity and isotope exchange studies confirmed that the over-all reaction, like that catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase purified from rat liver and chicken liver, was a nonclassical Ping Pong Bi Bi Uni Uni sequence with ATP and HCO3-binding randomly in the Bi Bi partial reaction. Three possible mechanisms for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis and CO2 fixation are considered: (i) Mechanism i, a concerted mechanism without the formation of a kinetically significant or detectable intermediate; (ii) Mechanism ii, activation of the enzyme by ATP to form an activated phosphoenzyme complex which can react with HCO3- by formation of a phosphorylated intermediate. On the basis of other evidence, an activated intermediate containing the ADP moiety was considered improbable. Evidence is presented which indicates that an isotopic exchange between ATP and ADP in the absence of added orthophosphate is not a property of the sheep kidney enzyme. This observation removed the need to postulate either that this exchange is an abortive reaction, or that there is a compulsory formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Two analogues of ADP, alpha,beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, have been used to provide further evidence against Mechanism ii. Both compounds were competitive inhibitors with respect to MgATP2- (Ki values respectively, 0.58 mM and 3.0 mM, compared with 0.17 mM for ADP), but neither could be phosphorylated by the enzyme. Neither analogue could replace ADP in the HCO3-: oxalacetate isotopic exchange reaction, indicating that phosphorylation of ADP is necessary for this exchange to occur, and that Mechanism ii is not applicable. Since Mechanism iii involves formation of a carbonly phosphate intermediate, analogues of this compound, namely, carbamyl phosphate and phosphonacetic acid were used to examine this pathway. The fact that the enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of ATP from ADP and carbamyl phosphate, and that phosphonacetic acid was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP2- (Ki = 0.5 mM) provides strong evidence that a carbonyl phosphate derivative is involved in the reaction mechanism. However, we have not found from initial velocity studies evidence for the formation of this intermediate, and it may therefore have only a transient existence in an essentially concerted reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1577233933,"Gel chromatography and ultracentrifugation studies show that delta5-3-ketosteroid isomerase of Pseudomonas testosteroni a dimer with a molecular weight of 26,800 at concentrations below 1 mg per ml, undergoes reversible, concentration-dependent association at higher enzyme concentrations. In the concentration range between 0.04 and 15.6 mg per ml, apparent molecular radii of 23 A to 36 A and molecular weights of 26,000 to 69,000 were observed. The latter value represents the weight average molecular weight of two or more ploymerization species in rapid equilibrium, rather than a discrete polymeric form of the enzyme. The isomerase dimer has been found to be unusually stable to dissociation upon dilution, even at concentrations in the nanogram per ml range. Evidence is presented which suggests that the enzyme is present as a dimer in P. testosteroni cells and that this is a catalytically active species. The isomerase monomer has been obtained and its molecular weight studied by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. A new determination of the extinction coefficient of the isomerase gives the value of 0.336 for the absorbance at 280 nm in a 1-cm light path of a solution containing 1 mg of the isomerase per ml."

https://openalex.org/W1561293009,"Bovine Factor X can be activated by two alternative pathways. The first, favored at high concentrations of the complex of tissue factor and Factor VII, is initiated by the action of Factor VII on Factor X to cleave an activation peptide from the NH2 terminus of the heavy chain, to produce alpha-Xa. This is then converted autocatalytically to another form of Factor Xa, beta-Xa, by the loss of a 17-residue glycopeptide from the COOH terminus of the heavy chain, in a lipid-dependent reaction. The alternative pathway, favored at lower activator concentrations, is initiated by the action of Factor Xa on Factor X, in the presence of lipid, to release the same COOH-terminal peptide as is produced in the conversion of alpha-Xa to beta-Xa. The intermediate produced by the loss of this peptide from Factor X,I1, can be activated directly to beta-Xa by the tissue factor-Factor VII complex, with the loss of the same NH2-terminal peptide as is produced in the conversion of Factor X to alpha-Xa. The autocatalytic activation of Factor X by Factor Xa described previously occurs to a marked extent only at very low activator concentrations, and has been shown to proceed largely by the loss of the normal NH2-terminal peptide from the heavy chain of I1-Initial experiments show that neither peptide affects the rate of coagulation by either the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. The amino acid sequences have been determined on both sides of the peptide cleavages, and it has been shown that the cleavage sites are the same, regardless of the pathway of activation. The amino acid sequence and carbohydrate composition of the COOH-terminal peptide have been determined. The carbohydrate moiety is attached via an O-glycosidic linkage at a threonine residue, and contains galactosamine but no glucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1566757049,"Thermal denaturation profiles were used to quantitate the destabilizing activity of five classes of polyanions in an effort to explain previously reported differences in activity among apparently similar polymers. This physical assay for polyanion action on chromatin is free of the biochemical complications associated with template assay systems. Most polyanions tested caused a thermal destabilization of the normal nucleohistone complexes of rat thymus chromatin and exposed free or weakly complexed DNA. Polyphosphates dissociated chromatin even when their net charge was as low as 6, and activity per unit of weight increased with chain length only for polymers containing less than about 20 phosphate units; pyrophosphate was inactive. Two polymers which had no influence on chromatin had a low negative charge density. Some, such as polycytidlate and denatured DNA, possessed a high charge but caused only minor changes in the shape of denaturation profiles and exposed little or no free DNA. The highly active nucleic acids, ribosomal RNA and polyguanylate, were distinguishable from inactive nucleic acids by having more secondary structure and potentially less steric hindrance for anionic interaction with chromatin. There was evidence that some polyanions dissociate certain histones before others. Although data obtained show that some histones may be redistributed from chromatin onto added double-stranded DNA in a medium containing urea, this does not appear to interfere significantly with the interpretation of typical thermal denaturation profiles of chromatin."

These two forms are designated I for the more anionic form and II for the less anionic form. Form I, 80 to 90% of the total activity, has been purified to a specific activity of 120 mumol/min/mg of protein (1100-fold) and is estimated to be 90 to 95% homogeneous, as judged by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Form II, 10 to 20% of the total activity, has been purified to a specific activity of approximately 6 mumol/min/mg of protein (300-fold). Both forms exhibit optimal activity at pH 7.5. Michaelis constants do not differ greatly between forms I and II and are similar to those reported for the pig heart cytosolic enzyme as well as aspartate aminotransferase from other plant sources. A molecular weight of 130,000 for the purified aspartate aminotransferase I was estimated by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation; molecular weights of the two forms are similar as estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation.

In the bulk concentration range of 0.23 to 3.7 muM, the surface concentration of palmitoyl-CoA ranges from 0.7 to 1.4 times 10- minus 10 mol/cm-2. The molecules of palmitoyl-CoA in the surface layer behave as if they were in a monolayer with each molecule occupying a limiting molecular area of 79 A-2. The distribution of palmitoyl-CoA between bulk and surface phases can be described by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm with an equilibrium constant of 0.33 muM. This constant is identical to the apparent Km for palmitoyl-CoA in the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase reaction catalyzed by microsomes. The results of this study, together with those from earlier work, suggest that the observed saturation behavior of the enzymatic reaction reflects the formation of a positive surface excess of palmitoyl-CoA in the vicinity of the catalytic site."
