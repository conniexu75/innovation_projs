https://openalex.org/W4210704633,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the waning of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies suggests that additional coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine doses may be needed for individuals who initially received CoronaVac. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus type 5 (AD5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine Convidecia as a heterologous booster versus those of CoronaVac as homologous booster in adults previously vaccinated with CoronaVac in an ongoing, randomized, observer-blinded, parallel-controlled phase 4 trial ( NCT04892459 ). Adults who had received two doses of CoronaVac in the past 3-6 months were vaccinated with Convidecia (n = 96) or CoronaVac (n = 102). Adults who had received one dose of CoronaVac in the past 1-3 months were also vaccinated with Convidecia (n = 51) or CoronaVac (n = 50). The co-primary endpoints were the occurrence of adverse reactions within 28 d after vaccination and geometric mean titers (GMTs) of neutralizing antibodies against live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus at 14 d after booster vaccination. Adverse reactions after vaccination were significantly more frequent in Convidecia recipients but were generally mild to moderate in all treatment groups. Heterologous boosting with Convidecia elicited significantly increased GMTs of neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 than homologous boosting with CoronaVac in participants who had previously received one or two doses of CoronaVac. These data suggest that heterologous boosting with Convidecia following initial vaccination with CoronaVac is safe and more immunogenic than homologous boosting."
https://openalex.org/W4210510200,"How do neural populations code for multiple, potentially conflicting tasks? Here we used computational simulations involving neural networks to define “lazy” and “rich” coding solutions to this context-dependent decision-making problem, which trade off learning speed for robustness. During lazy learning the input dimensionality is expanded by random projections to the network hidden layer, whereas in rich learning hidden units acquire structured representations that privilege relevant over irrelevant features. For context-dependent decision-making, one rich solution is to project task representations onto low-dimensional and orthogonal manifolds. Using behavioral testing and neuroimaging in humans and analysis of neural signals from macaque prefrontal cortex, we report evidence for neural coding patterns in biological brains whose dimensionality and neural geometry are consistent with the rich learning regime."
https://openalex.org/W4225854602,"The metabolic activities of microbial communities play a defining role in the evolution and persistence of life on Earth, driving redox reactions that give rise to global biogeochemical cycles. Community metabolism emerges from a hierarchy of processes, including gene expression, ecological interactions, and environmental factors. In wild communities, gene content is correlated with environmental context, but predicting metabolite dynamics from genomes remains elusive. Here, we show, for the process of denitrification, that metabolite dynamics of a community are predictable from the genes each member of the community possesses. A simple linear regression reveals a sparse and generalizable mapping from gene content to metabolite dynamics for genomically diverse bacteria. A consumer-resource model correctly predicts community metabolite dynamics from single-strain phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that the conserved impacts of metabolic genes can predict community metabolite dynamics, enabling the prediction of metabolite dynamics from metagenomes, designing denitrifying communities, and discovering how genome evolution impacts metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4210314236,"Recent studies have reported dysbiotic oral microbiota and tumor-resident bacteria in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to identify and validate oral microbial signatures in treatment-naïve HNSCC patients compared with healthy control subjects. We confirm earlier reports that the relative abundances of Lactobacillus spp. and Neisseria spp. are elevated and diminished, respectively, in human HNSCC. In parallel, we examined the disease-modifying effects of microbiota in HNSCC, through both antibiotic depletion of microbiota in an induced HNSCC mouse model (4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide, 4NQO) and reconstitution of tumor-associated microbiota in a germ-free orthotopic mouse model. We demonstrate that depletion of microbiota delays oral tumorigenesis, while microbiota transfer from mice with oral cancer accelerates tumorigenesis. Enrichment of Lactobacillus spp. was also observed in murine HNSCC, and activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor was documented in both murine and human tumors. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that dysbiosis promotes HNSCC development."
https://openalex.org/W4210602078,"The education sector experienced substantial impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from worldwide restrictions.To examine differences in the sleep patterns, sexual activity, screen use, and food intake of students and non-students during the COVID-19 pandemic.This was a global cross-sectional study conducted in the second half of 2020 using multiple social media platforms to recruit study participants globally. A close-ended questionnaire was administered anonymously in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Arabic to adults ages 18 and older. The outcome variables considered in analyses were changes in sleep pattern, sexual activity, screen use, and food intake. The explanatory variable was student status categorized as students vs. non-student. T-test, chi-square, and Mann Whitney U tests were used to assess differences between student and non-student populations. One logistic regression model was built for each outcome variable. Country of residence and country income level were included in the adjusted models.There were 17,008 participants of which 3,793 (22.3%) were students. Of the total sample, 4,889 (28.7%) reported changes in sleep, 4,642 (31.8%) reported increases in sexual activity, 10,278 (70.7%) reported increases in screen use, and 5,662 (40.2%) reported increases in food intake during the pandemic. Compared to non-students, students had significantly higher odds of reporting changes in sleep (AOR = 1.52), increases in sexual activity (AOR = 1.79), and increases in screen use (AOR = 1.36) but lower odds of reporting increase in food intake (AOR = 0.87).Students displayed higher risk of experiencing changes in sleep, sexual behavior, and screen use during the COVID-19 pandemic. This has the potential to lead to broader adverse effects on students' overall wellbeing. The findings and implications raise further obligations on the education sector to put extra-curricular support systems in place that address COVID-19 related behavior changes that have the potential to adversely impact students' wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W4210277522,"Multiple studies indicate that adult male rodents perform better than females on spatial problems and have a lower threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses. We report here that, in rodents, prepubescent females rapidly encode spatial information and express low-threshold LTP, whereas age-matched males do not. The loss of low-threshold LTP across female puberty was associated with three inter-related changes: increased densities of α5 subunit-containing GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, greater shunting of burst responses used to induce LTP and a reduction of NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses. A negative allosteric modulator of α5-GABAARs increased burst responses to a greater degree in adult than in juvenile females and markedly enhanced both LTP and spatial memory in adults. The reasons for the gain of functions with male puberty do not involve these mechanisms. In all, puberty has opposite consequences for plasticity in the two sexes, albeit through different routes. Le et al. show that, in rodents, females have lower spatial learning threshold before puberty and that sex differences in synaptic plasticity and learning thresholds reverse in the transition to adult life."
https://openalex.org/W4210598133,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced frequent testing of populations. It is necessary to identify the most cost-effective strategies for the detection of COVID-19 outbreaks. Nasopharyngeal samples have been used for SARS-CoV-2 detection but require a healthcare professional to collect the sample and cause discomfort and pain to the individual. Saliva has been suggested as an appropriate fluid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We have investigated the possibility of using pools of saliva samples to detect SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Two hundred and seventy-nine saliva samples were analyzed through RT-PCR of Envelope, Nucleocapsid and Open Reading Frame 1ab genes. Reproducibility assays showed an almost perfect agreement as well as high sensitivity (96.6%), specificity (96.8%), positive predicted value (96.6%), and negative predicted value (96.8%). The average Cycle Threshold of the genes detected was 29.7. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were detected when comparing the cycle threshold average of two consecutive reactions on the same positive saliva samples. Saliva samples have a higher median viral load (32.6) than in nasopharyngeal samples (28.9), although no significant differences were detected (p > 0.05). Saliva-pool samples allowed effective SARS-CoV-2 screening, with a higher sensibility (96.9%) on 10-sample pools than in 20-sample pools (87.5%). Regardless of pools size specificity was high (99.9%) and an almost perfect agreement was observed. Our strategy was successfully applied in population wide testing of more than 2000 individuals, showing that it is possible to use pooled saliva as diagnostic fluid for SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4210574656,"Conventional water quality monitoring has been done for decades in Lake Tanganyika, under different national and international programs. However, these projects utilized monitoring approaches, which were temporally limited, labour intensive and costly. This study examines the use of citizen science to monitor the dynamics of coliform concentrations in Lake Tanganyika as a complementary method to statutory and project-focused measurements. Persons in five coastal communities (Kibirizi, Ilagala, Karago, Ujiji and Gombe) were trained and monitored total coliforms, faecal coliforms and turbidity for one year on a monthly basis, in parallel with professional scientists. A standardized and calibrated Secchi tube was used at the same time to determine turbidity. Results indicate that total and faecal coliform concentrations determined by citizen scientists correlated well to those determined by professional scientists. Furthermore, citizen scientist-based turbidity values were shown to provide a potential indicator for high FC and TC concentrations. As a simple tiered approach to identify increased coliform loads, trained local citizen scientists could use low-cost turbidity measurements with follow up sampling and analysis for coliforms, to inform their communities and regulatory bodies of high risk conditions, as well as to validate local mitigation actions. By comparing the spatial and temporal dynamics of coliform concentrations to local conditions of infrastructure, population, precipitation and hydrology in the 15 sites (3 sites per community) over 12 months, potential drivers of coliform pollution in these communities were identified, largely related to precipitation dynamics and the land use."
https://openalex.org/W4210594018,"Background Worldwide tuberculosis (TB) takes more lives than any other infectious diseases. WHO estimates around 68,000 incident TB cases in Nepal. However, in 2018 only around 27,232 new TB cases were reported in the national system, resulting around 40,768 incident TB cases missing every year in Nepal. National Tuberculosis Control Center carried out this study in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) sites to estimate the prevalence of TB and identify the associated risk factors for TB among the people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIVs) in Nepal. Methods It was a cross-sectional institution-based study conducted between March and August 2018. Six ART sites with high caseloads of PLHIVs were selected. PLHIVs who were equal or above 18 years of age and were in ART program at the selected study sites were considered eligible for the study. Diagnosis of tuberculosis among PLHIVs who agreed to participate in the study was carried out as per the National Tuberculosis Management Guideline of National Tuberculosis Program of Nepal. Results Among 403 PLHIVs, tuberculosis was diagnosed in 40 (9.9%) individuals. Median age of the participants was 36 (30–43) years. Prevalence of TB was significantly higher among male PLHIVs than female PLHIVs (13.6% Vs 5.8%; P = 0 . 02 ) and Dalit ethnic group compared to Brahmin/Chettri (22.0%Vs5.9%, P = 0 . 01 ). The risk of developing TB was found significant among those with HIV stage progressed to WHO stage 3 and 4 (OR = 4.85, P&lt;0 . 001 ) and with the family history of TB (OR = 4.50, P = 0 . 002 ). Conclusions Prevalence of TB among PLHIVs in Nepal was found 9.9%. Risk of developing TB was higher among PLHIVs who were male, Dalit, with HIV stage progressed to WHO stage 3 and 4 and with family history of TB. Hence, targeted interventions are needed to prevent the risk of developing TB among PLHIVs. Similarly, integrated, and comprehensive TB and HIV diagnosis and treatment services are needed for the management of TB/HIV co-infection in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W4226158743,"The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern for wildlife and ecosystem health globally. Genetic determinants of AMR have become indicators of anthropogenic pollution due to their greater association with humans and rarer presence in environments less affected by humans. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution and frequency of the class 1 integron, a genetic determinant of AMR, in both the faecal microbiome and in Escherichia coli isolated from neonates of three pinniped species. Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea), Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) and long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) pups from eight breeding colonies along the Southern Australian coast were sampled between 2016-2019. DNA from faecal samples (n = 309) and from E. coli (n = 795) isolated from 884 faecal samples were analysed for class 1 integrons using PCRs targeting the conserved integrase gene (intI) and the gene cassette array. Class 1 integrons were detected in A. p. doriferus and N. cinerea pups sampled at seven of the eight breeding colonies investigated in 4.85% of faecal samples (n = 15) and 4.52% of E. coli isolates (n = 36). Integrons were not detected in any A. forsteri samples. DNA sequencing of the class 1 integron gene cassette array identified diverse genes conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes. The relationship between class 1 integron carriage and the concentration of five trace elements and heavy metals was also investigated, finding no significant association. The results of this study add to the growing evidence of the extent to which antimicrobial resistant bacteria are polluting the marine environment. As AMR determinants are frequently associated with bacterial pathogens, their occurrence suggests that these pinniped species are vulnerable to potential health risks. The implications for individual and population health as a consequence of AMR carriage is a critical component of ongoing health investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4210651770,"A previous study has documented that stressful life events is positively related to Internet gaming disorder (IGD) among adolescents. However, the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. The current study examined whether the link between stressful life events and adolescent IGD was moderated by neuroticism and whether the interaction of stressful life events and neuroticism supported the diathesis stress model or differential susceptibility model. To this end, self-report questionnaires were distributed. Participants were 927 Chinese adolescents (meanage = 14.53 years, 51.02% male). After controlling for adolescent gender, age, family economic situation, and family socioeconomic status, the results revealed that stressful life events could be positively associated with adolescent IGD and that this link is moderated by neuroticism. Moreover, the results of interaction effects supported the ""diathesis stress"" model. The above findings contributed to a better understanding of how and when stressful life events increase the risk of IGD and provided new evidence for the diathesis stress hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W4226339013,"Cytotoxic effects of radiation play an important role in the treatment of head and neck cancer. However, irradiation is known to lead to the migration of various cancer cells, including those of head and neck cancer. Recently, fibroblasts in the cancer microenvironment have been reported to be involved in this mechanism. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying migration of head and neck cancer cells remains unclear. Herein, we aimed to elucidate this migration mechanism induced by irradiation in terms of the interaction of head and neck cancer cells with fibroblasts.We used the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines SAS and FaDu as well as fibroblast cell lines. These cells were irradiated and their viability was compared. In fibroblasts, changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion caused by irradiation were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cell migration ability of cancer cells was evaluated via a migration assay using a semipermeable membrane. HNSCC cells were cocultured with irradiated and nonirradiated fibroblasts, and their migration ability under each condition was compared. We also examined the effect of IL-6 on the migration of HNSCC cells. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of fibroblast-derived IL-6 on the migration ability of HNSCC cells, we conducted a coculture study using IL-6 neutralizing antibody.Irradiation reduced the survival of HNSCC cells, whereas fibroblasts were resistant to irradiation. Irradiation also increased IL-6 secretion by fibroblasts. Migration of HNSCC cells was enhanced by coculture with fibroblasts and further enhanced by coculture with irradiated fibroblasts. We also confirmed that the migration of HNSCC cells was induced by IL-6. The enhanced migration of cancer cells caused by coculturing with fibroblasts was canceled by the IL-6 neutralizing antibody.These results show that fibroblasts survive irradiation and induce the migration ability of HNSCC cells through increased secretion of IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W4207024689,"The lack of antiviral innate immune responses during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections is characterized by limited production of interferons (IFNs). One protein associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, SAMHD1, has been shown to negatively regulate the IFN-1 signaling pathway. However, it is unclear whether elevated IFN signaling associated with genetic loss of SAMHD1 would affect SARS-CoV-2 replication. In this study, we established in vitro tissue culture model systems for SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 infections in which SAMHD1 protein expression was absent as a result of CRISPR-Cas9 gene KO or lentiviral viral protein X-mediated proteosomal degradation. We show that both SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus OC43 replications were suppressed in SAMHD1 KO 293T and differentiated THP-1 macrophage cell lines. Similarly, when SAMHD1 was degraded by virus-like particles in primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we observed lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The loss of SAMHD1 in 293T and differentiated THP-1 cells resulted in upregulated gene expression of IFNs and innate immunity signaling proteins from several pathways, with STAT1 mRNA being the most prominently elevated ones. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was significantly increased in both SAMHD1 WT and KO cells when expression and phosphorylation of STAT1 were downregulated by JAK inhibitor baricitinib, which over-rode the activated antiviral innate immunity in the KO cells. This further validates baricitinib as a treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients primarily at the postviral clearance stage. Overall, our tissue culture model systems demonstrated that the elevated innate immune response and IFN activation upon genetic loss of SAMHD1 effectively suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication."
https://openalex.org/W4210513622,"Objectives This study is designed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of food poisoning and its factors among postgraduate students in Universiti Putra Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 212 respondents who were selected through simple random sampling. Data was generated using a validated and reliable self-administered questionnaire. Results The majority of the respondents are male, aged less than 35 years old, non-Malaysian, single, first-degree holders, not working, received a monthly income of less than 3264 Malaysian Ringgit, aware of food poisoning outbreak and the sources of their information of the food poisoning outbreak were television, the internet, newspaper, Online journals, friends, Facebook, community, nurse, drinking raw milk for the second time, information from their parents, relatives, restaurant, and radio. Majority had previous history of food poisoning illness but didn’t correctly confirm the causes of their food poisoning illness. Majority had poor knowledge, acceptable attitude, and good practice of food poisoning. A significant association was observed for citizen, marital status, awareness of food poisoning outbreak, and previous history of food poisoning illness with knowledge. Gender and awareness of food poisoning outbreak were significantly associated with attitude. Attitude and practice were significantly associated. Logistic regression revealed that being married, awareness of food poisoning outbreak, and previous history of food poisoning illness are predictors for good knowledge. Female respondents and awareness of food poisoning outbreak are predictors for acceptable attitude. Conclusion Documentation of the identified poor knowledge and factors affecting knowledge, attitude, and practice provides essential information on the baseline indicators towards the risk of food poisoning among the respondents. A relevant interventional program is highly recommended to prevent the potential risks of food poisoning outbreak among them."

Methods We used a unique statewide dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases across Missouri, linked with historical statewide hospital data. We examined differences by race and ethnicity in raw population-based case and mortality rates. We used patient-level regression analyses to calculate the odds of mortality based on race and ethnicity, controlling for comorbidities and other risk factors. Results As of September 10, 2020 there were 73,635 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of Missouri. Among the 64,526 case records (87.7% of all cases) that merged with prior demographic and health care utilization data, 12,946 (20.1%) were Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, 44,550 (69.0%) were NH White, 3,822 (5.9%) were NH Other/Unknown race, and 3,208 (5.0%) were Hispanic. Raw cumulative case rates for NH Black individuals were 1,713 per 100,000 population, compared with 2,095 for NH Other/Unknown, 903 for NH White, and 1,218 for Hispanic. Cumulative COVID-19-related death rates for NH Black individuals were 58.3 per 100,000 population, compared with 38.9 for NH Other/Unknown, 19.4 for NH White, and 14.8 for Hispanic. In a model that included insurance source, history of a social determinant billing code in the patient’s claims, census block travel change, population density, Area Deprivation Index, and clinical comorbidities, NH Black race (OR 1.75, 1.51–2.04, p&lt;0.001) and NH Other/Unknown race (OR 1.83, 1.36–2.46, p&lt;0.001) remained strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions In Missouri, COVID-19 case rates and mortality rates were markedly higher among NH Black and NH Other/Unknown race than among NH White residents, even after accounting for social and clinical risk, population density, and travel patterns during COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4210364698,"The purpose is to strengthen Human Resources Management (HRM) through information management using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. First, the selection criteria of the applicant’s resume during recruitment and the formulation standards of the contract salary are analyzed. Then, the resume information is extracted and converted into the data-type format. Besides, the salary forecast model in the HRM system (HRMS) is designed based on the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), and network structure, parameter initialization, and activation function of the BPNN are selected and optimized. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm optimized by the Nadm has shown improved convergence speed and forecast effect, with 187 iterations. Moreover, compared with other regression algorithms, the designed algorithm achieves the best test scores. The above results can provide references for designing the AI-based HRMS."
https://openalex.org/W4210531447,"The aim of the study was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the Republic of Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to analyse the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the population toward COVID-19. This population-based study was conducted in a group of 1,855 randomly selected individuals from all municipalities from 1 December 2020 to 15 January 2021. All individuals were asked to sign a consent form and to fill in a questionnaire, following which a blood samples were collected. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in serum specimens using the total Ab ELISA assay. The overall seroprevalence rate was 40.3%. Subjects aged <65 years were 2.06 times more likely to be seropositive than those aged ≥65, and 30% of seropositive individuals presented no COVID-19 symptoms. The household members of seropositive individuals were 2.24 times more likely to develop COVID-19 symptoms than the household members of seronegative individuals. More than 95% of respondents believe that preventive measures are very important to control the infection transmission. Majority of respondents wear the masks properly, maintain the required physical distance whenever possible and wash hands with soap. Nearly 50% of individuals were of the opinion that the vaccine could prevent the infection. This study showed that an overall SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate by the middle of January 2021 was very high. Attitudes and practices regarding the COVID-19 indicate that additional efforts should be taken in order to improve the health education with a focus on preventive measures and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4210539036,"To assess the incidence of COVID-19 infection in the absence of a confirmatory test in persons suspecting they contracted COVID-19 and elucidate reasons for their belief.We recruited persons with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and persons who believed they may have contracted COVID-19 between December, 2019 and April, 2021 into a study of immunity against SARS-CoV-2. An intake questionnaire captured their perceived risk factors for exposure and symptoms experienced, including symptom duration and severity. ELISA testing against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens was done to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. No participant had received COVID-19 vaccination prior to the time of testing.The vast majority of study subjects without Public Health confirmation of infection had no detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2 generally involved experiencing symptoms common to many other respiratory infections. Unusually severe or persistent symptoms often supported suspicion of infection with SARS-CoV-2 as did travel or contact with travelers from outside Newfoundland and Labrador. Rare cases in which antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected despite negative results of Public Health testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA involved persons in close contact with confirmed cases.Broad public awareness and declaration of pandemic status in March, 2020 contributed to the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador from late 2019 to April 2021 and raised expectation of its severity. Serological testing is useful to diagnose past infection with SARS-CoV-2 to accurately estimate population exposure rates."
https://openalex.org/W4210539321,"Every person diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is at risk of developing Diabetic retinopathy (DR). Thus, DR is one of the major chronic microvascular complications of T2DM. However, in Malaysia, research about DR is still scarce. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of DR among diabetic patients across 46 primary healthcare clinics in Sabah, Malaysia. Secondly, it purported to identify the factors influencing the development of DR. This cross-sectional study involved a total of 22,345 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in the Sabah Diabetic Registry from 2008 to 2015. Of the 22,345 T2DM patients, 13.5% (n = 3,029) of them were diagnosed with DR. Multiple logistic regression revealed seven major risk factors of DR, i.e. patients with diabetic foot ulcer [aOR: 95% CI 3.08 (1.96-4.85)], patients with diabetic nephropathy [aOR: 95% CI 2.47 (2.13-2.86)], hypertension [aOR: 95% CI 1.63 (1.43-1.87)], dyslipidaemia [aOR: 95% CI 1.30 (1.17-1.44)], glycated haemoglobin [(HbA1c) > 6.5 (aOR: 95% CI 1.25 (1.14-1.38)], duration of diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [aOR: 95% CI 1.06 (1.05-1.07)] and age of patient [aOR: 95% CI 1.01 (1.00-1.02)] respectively. DR is a preventable complication. The effective glycaemic control is crucial in preventing DR. In minimizing the prevalence of DR, the healthcare authorities should institute programmes to induce awareness on the management of DR's risk factors among patient and practitioner."
https://openalex.org/W4206992393,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide prokaryotes with nucleic acid-based adaptive immunity against infections of mobile genetic elements, including phages. To counteract this immune process, phages have evolved various anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins which deactivate CRISPR-Cas-based immunity. However, the mechanisms of many of these Acr-mediated inhibitions are not clear. Here, we report the crystal structure of AcrIF13 and explore its inhibition mechanism. The structure of AcrIF13 is unique and displays a negatively charged surface. Additionally, biochemical studies identified that AcrIF13 interacts with the type I-F CRISPR-Cas surveillance complex (Csy complex) to block target DNA recognition and that the Cas5f-8f tail and Cas7.6f subunit of the Csy complex are specific binding targets of AcrIF13. Further mutational studies demonstrated that several negatively charged residues of AcrIF13 and positively charged residues of Cas8f and Cas7f of the Csy complex are involved in AcrIF13-Csy binding. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the inhibition mechanism of AcrIF13 and further suggest the prevalence of the function of Acr proteins as DNA mimics."
https://openalex.org/W4210422891,"N-acetylcysteine has a demonstrated role as an adjunctive therapy in psychotic and affective disorders as a treatment to reduce symptoms of Bipolar Affective Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Schizophrenia. However, its potential as a rapidly acting anti-suicidal agent has not yet been assessed. This naturalistic study evaluates its effect in thirty patients presenting following intentional medication overdose.Eighteen patients who ingested toxic doses of paracetamol received NAC whilst twelve other patients with other overdoses received standard supportive treatment in the emergency department setting. Symptoms were measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scale at time of presentation, 24 hours, and seven days.Baseline characteristics between groups were similar. Both groups showed a significant reduction in suicidality, as measured by the suicide item of the MADRS, over time (p < 0.001). However, there was a greater reduction in suicidality in the 'NAC group' compared to the 'no-NAC group' one-week post presentation (p = 0.014). A greater proportion of the 'no-NAC group' still exhibited severe depressive symptoms (MADRS >32) compared to the 'NAC group' (p = 0.044).This naturalistic study suggests NAC may have potential use as a rapidly acting treatment adjunct in major depressive disorder, warranting further investigation of its effects."
https://openalex.org/W4210466964,"Instance segmentation is more challenging and difficult than object detection and semantic segmentation. It paves the way for the realization of a complete scene understanding, and has been widely used in robotics, automatic driving, medical care, and other aspects. However, there are some problems in instance segmentation methods, such as the low detection efficiency for low-resolution objects and the slow detection speed of images with complex backgrounds. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an instance segmentation method with multi-scale attention, which is called a Hybrid Kernel Mask R-CNN. Firstly, the hybrid convolution kernel is constructed by combining different kernels and groups, which can complement each other to extract rich information. Secondly, a multi-scale attention mechanism is designed by assign weights to different convolution kernels, which can retain more important information. After the introduction of our strategy, the network is more inclined to focus on the low-resolution objects in the image. The proposed method achieves the best accuracy over the anchor-based method. To verify the universality of the model, we test Hybrid Kernel Mask R-CNN on Balloon, xBD and COCO datasets. The test results exceed the state of art methods. And the visualization results show our method can extract low-resolution objects effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4210490075,"Social media represent an important source of news for many users. They are, however, affected by misinformation and they might be playing a role in the growth of political polarization. In this paper, we create an agent based model to investigate how policing content and backlash on social media (i.e. conflict) can lead to an increase in polarization for both users and news sources. Our model is an advancement over previously proposed models because it allows us to study the polarization of both users and news sources, the evolution of the audience connections between users and sources, and it makes more realistic assumptions about the starting conditions of the system. We find that the tendency of users and sources to avoid policing, backlash and conflict in general can increase polarization online. Specifically polarization comes from the ease of sharing political posts, intolerance for opposing points of view causing backlash and policing, and volatility in changing one's opinion when faced with new information. On the other hand, it seems that the integrity of a news source in trying to resist the backlash and policing has little effect."
https://openalex.org/W4210499556,"Smoking self-efficacy, described as confidence in one's ability to abstain from smoking in high-risk situations is a key predictor in cessation outcomes; however, there is a dearth of research on factors that influence self-efficacy surrounding smoking behavior. This study examines factors associated with baseline self-efficacy among treatment seeking participants enrolled in a pilot feasibility smoking cessation study. Participants (n = 247) were daily male smokers, residents of Doha in Qatar (18-60 years) who were enrolled in a telephone-based smoking cessation study. Baseline assessments included self-efficacy, home smoking rules, socio-demographic variables, smoking history, and psychosocial characteristics. Factors associated with self-efficacy were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results showed that after controlling for relevant variables, number of cigarettes smoked ([Formula: see text] = -0.22; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.06), having at least one quit attempt in the past year ([Formula: see text] = 2.30; 95% CI: 0.27, 4.35), and reporting a complete home smoking ban ([Formula: see text] = 3.13; 95% CI: 0.56, 5.70) were significantly associated with higher self-efficacy to quit smoking. These results provide data-driven indication of several key variables that can be targeted to increase smoking self-efficacy in this understudied population."
https://openalex.org/W4210617782,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical parasitic and chronic disease affecting hundreds of millions of people. Adult schistosomes reside in the blood stream of the definitive mammalian host. These helminth parasites possess two epithelial surfaces, the tegument and the gastrodermis, both of which interact with the host during immune evasion and in nutrient uptake.Female ARC Swiss mice (4-6 weeks old) were infected percutaneously with Schistosoma japonicum cercariae freshly shed from Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi snails (Philippines strain). Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed by using fresh adult S. japonicum perfused from those infected mice. Adult S. japonicum worms were processed to isolate the tegument from the carcass containing the gastrodermis; blood and bile were collected individually from infected and uninfected mice. Total DNA extracted from all those samples were used for microbiome profiling.FISH and microbiome profiling showed the presence of bacterial populations on two epithelial surfaces of adult worms, suggesting they were distinct not only from the host blood but also from each other. Whereas microbial diversity was reduced overall in the parasite epithelial tissues when compared with that of host blood, specific bacterial taxa, including Anoxybacillus and Escherichia, were elevated on the tegument. Minimal differences were evident in the microbiome of host blood during an active infection, compared with that of control uninfected blood. However, sampling of bile from infected animals identified some differences compared with controls, including elevated levels of Limnohabitans, Clostridium and Curvibacter.Using FISH and microbial profiling, we were able to demonstrate, for the first time, that bacteria are presented on the epithelial surfaces of adult schistosomes. These schistosome surface-associated bacteria, which are distinct from the host blood microenvironment, should be considered as a new and important component of the host-schistosome interaction. The importance of individual bacterial species in relation to schistosome parasitism needs further elucidation."
https://openalex.org/W4210798238,"Prenatal DNA tests, such as chromosomal microarray analysis or exome sequencing, increase the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis when fetal structural anomalies are identified. However, some parents will receive uncertain results such as variants of uncertain significance and secondary findings. We aimed to develop a set of attributes and associated levels for a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) that will examine parents' preferences for tests that may reveal uncertain test results. A two phase mixed-methods approach was used to develop attributes for the DCE. In Phase 1, a ""long list"" of candidate attributes were identified via two approaches: 1) a systematic review of the literature around parental experiences of uncertainty following prenatal testing; 2) 16 semi-structured interviews with parents who had experienced uncertainty during pregnancy and 25 health professionals who return uncertain prenatal results. In Phase 2, a quantitative scoring exercise with parents prioritised the candidate attributes. Clinically appropriate levels for each attribute were then developed. A final set of five attributes and levels were identified: likelihood of getting a result, reporting of variants of uncertain significance, reporting of secondary findings, time taken to receive results, and who tells you about your result. These attributes will be used in an international DCE study to investigate preferences and differences across countries. This research will inform best practice for professionals supporting parents to manage uncertainty in the prenatal setting."
https://openalex.org/W4206952112,"Both the DNA damage response (DDR) and the mitotic checkpoint are critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. Among proteins involved in these processes, the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is required for both activation of the DDR and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). In mitosis without DNA damage, the enzymatic activity of ATM is enhanced; however, substrates of ATM in mitosis are unknown. Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a number of proteins that can potentially be phosphorylated by ATM during mitosis. This list is highly enriched in proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and the DDR. Among them, we further validated that ATM phosphorylated budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 3 (Bub3), a major component of the SAC, on serine 135 (Ser135) both in vitro and in vivo. During mitosis, this phosphorylation promoted activation of another SAC component, benzimidazoles 1. Mutation of Bub3 Ser135 to alanine led to a defect in SAC activation. Furthermore, we found that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Bub3 on Ser135 was also induced by ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. However, this event resulted in independent signaling involving interaction with the Ku70-Ku80-DNA-PKcs sensor/kinase complex, leading to efficient nonhomologous end-joining repair. Taken together, we highlight the functional significance of the crosstalk between the kinetochore-oriented signal and double-strand break repair pathways via ATM phosphorylation of Bub3 on Ser135."
https://openalex.org/W4206989963,"Adaptation to nutrient deprivation depends on the activation of metabolic programs to use reserves of energy. When outside a host plant, second-stage juveniles (J2) of the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne spp.), an important group of pests responsible for severe losses in the production of crops (e.g., rice, wheat, and tomato), are unable to acquire food. Although lipid hydrolysis has been observed in J2 nematodes, its role in fitness and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using RNA-seq analysis, here, we demonstrated that in the absence of host plants, the pathway for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids was upregulated, thereby increasing the production of arachidonic acid in middle-stage J2 Meloidogyne incognita worms. We also found that arachidonic acid upregulated the expression of the transcription factor hlh-30b, which in turn induced lysosomal biogenesis. Lysosomes promoted lipid hydrolysis via a lysosomal lipase, LIPL-1. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that blockage of lysosomal lipolysis reduced both lifespan and locomotion of J2 worms. Strikingly, disturbance of lysosomal lipolysis resulted in a decline in infectivity of these juveniles on tomato roots. Our findings not only reveal the molecular mechanism of lipolysis in J2 worms but also suggest potential novel strategies for the management of root-knot nematode pests."
https://openalex.org/W4207041875,"The hydrolytic deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine drives many of the transition mutations observed in human cancer. The deamination-induced mutagenic intermediates include either uracil or thymine adducts mispaired with guanine. While a substantial array of methods exist to measure other types of DNA adducts, the cytosine deamination adducts pose unusual analytical problems, and adequate methods to measure them have not yet been developed. We describe here a novel hybrid thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) that is comprised of a 29-amino acid sequence from human TDG linked to the catalytic domain of a thymine glycosylase found in an archaeal thermophilic bacterium. Using defined-sequence oligonucleotides, we show that hybrid TDG has robust mispair-selective activity against deaminated U:G and T:G mispairs. We have further developed a method for separating glycosylase-released free bases from oligonucleotides and DNA followed by GC–MS/MS quantification.

This reaction results in a mispaired intermediate with guanine (Fig. 1). The deaminated bases comprise an important class of DNA adducts; however, they cannot be measured by current approaches. Methods are therefore needed to measure the formation and persistence of the deaminated mispairs. Several laboratories have developed sensitive and specific methods for measuring a wide array of DNA base adducts; however, such methods would require either enzymatic or acid hydrolysis prior to analysis (11Cadet J.

The mutagenic significance of the deaminated cytosine adducts is a consequence of residing in a base mispair with guanine. Methods that use DNA hydrolysis eliminate this base-pairing context. Furthermore, PCR-based analytical methods would convert the mispaired intermediate to a G:C base pair and an A:T mutation, erasing the initial mispair context as well. Other laboratories have used DNA repair glycosylases to selectively remove damaged bases from DNA for analysis by mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods (17Blount B.C. Ames B.N.

Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG or UNG) has been used to measure total uracil in DNA; however, UDG removes uracil from single-stranded DNA as well as U:A and U:G base pairs and therefore cannot distinguish a deaminated base pair (U:G) from a dUTP misincorporation event (U:A). On the other hand, thymine DNA glycosylases (TDGs) can remove uracil and thymine selectively from mispairs (U:G and T:G). However, the activity of the human TDG (hTDG) is very weak against T:G (22Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Kinetics of the action of thymine DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Google Scholar, 23Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. Specificity of human thymine DNA glycosylase depends on N-glycosidic bond stability.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggested that a thermophile TDG glycosylase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MIG) might have the requisite selectivity for U and T mispaired with guanine (24Liu P.

We therefore generated a hybrid TDG (hyTDG) by joining a 29 amino acid sequence shown to substantially increase the activity of hTDG (25Coey C.T. Malik S.S. Pidugu L.S. Varney K.M. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Structural basis of damage recognition by thymine DNA glycosylase: Key roles for N-terminal residues.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 10248-10258Google Scholar) to the catalytic core of MIG. In this article, we describe the cloning and purification of hyTDG. We demonstrate that hyTDG has the requisite selectivity for mispaired intermediates and sufficient activity to release deaminated cytosine analogs from DNA for subsequent analysis using MS-based methods. A DNA sequence was constructed containing a His-tag, a sequence encoding a 29 amino acid sequence derived from the amino terminus of the hTDG (25Coey C.T. Malik S.S. Pidugu L.S. Varney K.M. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Structural basis of damage recognition by thymine DNA glycosylase: Key roles for N-terminal residues.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 10248-10258Google Scholar), and the catalytic core of a thermophile TDG, MIG (26Horst J.P.

Biol. 2002; 315: 373-384Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence is shown in Figure 2, and the DNA sequence is shown in Figure S1. The plasmid encoding this sequence was cloned into BL3 competent cells and induced. Proteins isolated from the cell extract were fractionated, and the His-tagged protein was isolated using a Ni2+ column. Isolated protein was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The predominant band had an apparent molecular weight of 26.5 kDa (Fig. S2). The purified protein was characterized by LC–MS/MS proteomic methods. A list of observed peptide fragments is provided in Table S1. Protein characterization by MS analysis of tryptic fragments does not always provide 100% coverage. In the case of hyTDG, 98% coverage was obtained. It is valuable to determine which peptides are observed and to map these peptides to regions of the protein critical for enzymatic activity. When hybrid proteins are constructed, analysis of tryptic fragments can be used to confirm the amino acid sequence of the construct. In the case of hyTDG prepared here, the peptide KVDR/LDDATNK (amino acids 34–44) was observed (Fig. 3). This peptide is the junction between the human sequence and the MIG enzyme. The peptide SKEKQEKITDTFK (amino acids 18–30) is derived from the human 29 amino acid sequence (Fig. S3). The observation of these peptides confirms correct construction of the hybrid protein. Previous studies have established functionally important motifs within MIG (26Horst J.P. Fritz H.J. Counteracting the mutagenic effect of hydrolytic deamination of DNA 5-methylcytosine residues at high temperature: DNA mismatch N-glycosylase Mig.Mth of the thermophilic archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum THF.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5459-5469Google Scholar, 27Begley T.J.

Biol. 2002; 315: 373-384Google Scholar), and several peptides mapping to these regions were observed. Single amino acid substitutions within key protein regions can place a glycosylase into a different family, and other changes can dramatically alter substrate selection and enzymatic activity. The glycosylases that function in base excision repair generally flip a target base from the duplex into an active site pocket. We observed the peptide DPYVILITEILLRR (amino acids 71–84), which contains the “R” base flipper for this class of glycosylase (Fig. S4). Among the DNA repair enzymes, the catalytic core of MIG is within a group defined by an integral helix–hairpin–helix (HhH) motif. We observed the peptide KAILDLPGVGK (amino acids 152–162; Fig. S5), which contains the LPGVGKY HhH motif. The HhH motif consists of two α-helices flanking a β-hairpin with the conserved sequence LPGVGX(K/S), which binds the DNA backbone nonspecifically (28Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Begley T.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Structure and activity of a thermostable thymine-DNA glycosylase: Evidence for base twisting to remove mismatched normal DNA bases.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 373-384Google Scholar). The HhH motif places the thermophile TDG (MIG) in the same class with the Mut Y and Endo III glycosylases. A catalytically important conserved aspartic acid residue is common to MIG, Mut Y, Endo III, and glycosylases, which interacts with the C1′ position of the target 2′-deoxyribose. Peptide KAAMVDANFVR (amino acids 176–186; Fig. S6) was observed, and this peptide contains the conserved aspartic acid residue (bold). Also common to MIG, Mut Y and Endo III are an iron–sulfur cluster. We observed the peptide DFNLGLMDFSAIICAPR (amino acids 221–237; Fig. S7), which contains the first cysteine residue of the iron–sulfur cluster. We first examined the activity of hyTDG on a series of 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM)-labeled oligonucleotides (2.5 pmol) containing single-stranded U or U paired with A or G (Fig. S8). As shown in Figure 4, UDG (2.5 units; 1.6 pmol) cleaves completely single-stranded oligonucleotides containing U as well as duplexes containing U:A base pairs or U:G mispairs in 1 h at 37 °C. In contrast, UDG does not cleave T when paired with A or mispaired with G. Our hyTDG (16.8 pmol) cleaves oligonucleotides containing U:G (95%) or T:G (86%) mispairs but not those containing U:A or T:A base pairs or single-stranded oligonucleotides containing U, in 1 h at 65 °C. The hTDG (29Yoon J.H. Iwai S. O'Connor T.R. Pfeifer G.P. Human thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and methyl-CpG-binding protein 4 (MBD4) excise thymine glycol (Tg) from a Tg:G mispair.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5399-5404Google Scholar, 30Hardeland U.

These data confirm that hyTDG is specific for mispaired pyrimidines and in contrast to hTDG, has substantial activity against T:G mispairs. The results shown in Figure 4 were obtained with a molar excess of hyTDG. We also conducted a gel assay where 0.5 equivalents of hyTDG were incubated with 25 pmol of the U:G duplex (Fig. S9). Approximately 50% of the duplex was cleaved at 1 h, and further cleavage was not observed at 4 h. These data suggest that hyTDG excises a target base, remains bound to the abasic site, and does not turn over under the conditions described here. We next analyzed hyTDG cleavage using a real-time fluorescence assay (32Kladova O.A. Iakovlev D.A. Groisman R. Ishchenko A.A. Saparbaev M.K. Fedorova O.S. Kuznetsov N.A.

Sci. 2020; 21: 1-30Google Scholar) with 5′-6FAM oligos duplexed with a complementary strand containing a 3′-black hole fluorescence quencher 1 (BHQ1) quencher (Fig. S8). In this assay, glycosylase cleavage generates an abasic site, which is then cleaved chemically using N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (DMDA) (34Mchugh P.J. Knowland J. Novel reagents for chemical cleavage at abasic sites and UV photoproducts in DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1664-1670Google Scholar), separating the 5′-6FAM from the quencher and allowing continuous monitoring of the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 5). The real-time assay contained 25 pmol of labeled oligonucleotide duplexes containing either a U:G or a T:G mispair and 25 pmol hyTDG. Reactions were conducted at 65 °C in a 96-well plate in a Roche 480 quantitative PCR instrument. Fluorescence was measured every 20 s. Three independent assays were conducted simultaneously. Fluorescence data were normalized to the total percentage of cleaved oligonucleotide. This was measured by gel electrophoresis after the last fluorescence time point was acquired. Example data are shown in Figure S10. In panel A, the raw cleavage data from three independent experiments are shown. In panel B, the average of the three runs is shown as a solid line, and the standard deviation is represented by vertical lines. Finally, a single exponential was fit to the experimental data as shown in Figure S10C. The equation describing the theoretical line isYt = A(1 − e−kt)(1) where Yt is percent cleavage at time t (min), A is the percent cleavage at 60 min, and k is a rate constant (min−1). Data for the cleavage of U:G-containing and T:G-containing duplexes are shown in Figure 5A, and values for A and k (Equation 1) are presented in the figure legend. The initial cleavage velocity, vo, was calculated from the fitted rate constant and Equation 1 at 5% cleavage. The initial velocity for hyTDG cleavage of the U:G oligonucleotide was measured to be 2.62 ± 0.3 pmol/min and for the T:G oligonucleotide, 1.69 ± 0.20 pmol/min. No cleavage was observed for U:A-containing or T:A-containing oligonucleotides. In a second experiment, hyTDG cleavage was measured in the presence of 20 μg calf thymus DNA (Fig. 5B). The initial cleavage velocities under these conditions were measured to be 2.77 ± 0.40 pmol/min for U:G and 1.49 ± 0.30 pmol/min for T:G. hyTDG cleaves U:G faster than T:G under both conditions. Surprisingly, vo did not decrease significantly in the presence of excess calf thymus DNA for either U:G or T:G mispairs. We also examined the activity of MIG on the U:G substrate in this assay (Fig. S11). The vo for MIG in the absence of calf thymus DNA was measured to be 2.23 ± 0.3 pmol/min. In the presence of calf thymus DNA, it was 1.15 ± 0.2 pmol/min. Our hyTDG is slightly faster than MIG in the absence of excess calf thymus DNA. Furthermore, the rate of hyTDG does not diminish in the presence of excess calf thymus DNA, unlike MIG. These data suggest that the major advantage of the appended 29 amino acid sequence from hTDG is to facilitate scanning of the DNA for a target base. The aforementioned assays allow the examination of hyTDG activity against defined substrates. However, a more robust assay would involve hyTDG activity against multiple substrates simultaneously. We therefore developed an approach that separates free bases and isotope-enriched internal standards from oligonucleotides or DNA and protein using a spin filter. Isolated free bases can be chemically derivatized with t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) groups and analyzed by GC–MS/MS. This workflow is shown schematically in Figure 6. We first applied this approach to a mixture of duplex oligonucleotides containing T:G and U:G mispairs in a two to one ratio. A mixture of 8.3 pmol U:G duplex, 16.7 pmol T:G duplex, and 250 pmol hyTDG with U + 3 and T + 4 standards in a volume of 25 μl was incubated at 65 °C for up to 120 min. The progress of the hyTDG reaction was followed simultaneously using both gel and GC–MS/MS methods (Fig. 7). A volume of 5 μl was used for the gel assay and 20 μl for the GC–MS/MS assay. Each time point was analyzed three times by GC–MS/MS. As shown in Figure 7A, approximately 91% of the mispaired duplexes were cleaved in 120 min as measured by the gel assay. Base release was also monitored by GC–MS/MS analysis (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the gel assay, cleavage of both U and T appeared to plateau after 60 min. At 120 min, 6.42 ± 0.49 pmol of U was released and 13.33 ± 0.34 pmol of T was released. The amount of U and T released is consistent with the amount of U and T oligonucleotides in the reaction. As a control, the oligonucleotide mixture was also incubated with UDG at 37 °C for 120 min. Gel analysis indicated 43% cleavage, slightly higher than the 33% expected based upon the composition of the mixture. The amount of U released by UDG as measured by GC–MS/MS was 7.58 ± 0.20 pmol, also slightly higher than expected. In a final series of experiments, the content of mispairs in calf thymus DNA was examined. First, calf thymus DNA was digested with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease to reduce its viscosity. Next, a portion of the calf thymus DNA was hydrolyzed in formic acid and the base composition examined by GC–MS using stable isotope–enriched standards of C, T, and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). The base composition was observed to be 0.52 ± 0.04 nmol C, 0.78 ± 0.02 nmol T, and 0.03 ± 0.0002 nmol 5-mC per microgram of calf thymus DNA, consistent with prior reports (35Kirk J.T. Determination of the base composition of deoxyribonucleic acid by measurement of the adenine-granine ratio.Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 673-677Google Scholar, 36Sturm K.S. Taylor J.H. Distribution of 5-methylcytosine in the DNA of somatic and germline cells from bovine tissues.Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4537-4546Google Scholar). To measure the content of U:G and T:G mispairs, a solution of EcoR1-digested calf thymus DNA (400 μg) containing isotope-enriched T + 4 (14.5 pg T + 4/μg DNA) and U + 3 (5 pg/μg DNA) was incubated with either UDG (37 °C) or hyTDG (65 °C) for 90 min. Released free bases were separated from DNA and enzymes by spin filtration. Filtrates were dried, and the pyrimidine composition was measured by two analytical approaches. In the first approach, pyrimidines released by the glycosylases were converted to the TBDMS derivatives and analyzed by GC–MS/MS. In the second approach, pyrimidines were converted to the 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide derivatives and analyzed by GC–MS using negative chemical ionization (GC–NCI–MS). All measurements for each approach represent three independent experiments. Incubation with UDG releases uracil in U:A and U:G base pairs as well as in single-stranded DNA. Total uracil in the calf thymus DNA released by UDG was 9.39 ± 0.29 pg/μg DNA by GC–MS/MS (Fig. 8A). The amount of U released from U:G mispairs by hyTDG was 1.30 ± 0.29, and the amount of T:G released from T:G mispairs was 5.58 ± 0.42 pg/μg DNA. Chromatograms from the GC–electron ionization–MS/MS analyses are shown in Figure S12. The amount of U and T released was also measured using GC–NCI–MS (Fig. 8, panel B). The amount of U released by UDG was measured to be 8.46 ± 0.63 pg/μg DNA. The amount of U released by hyTDG was measured to be 0.54 ± 0.13 pg/μg DNA, and the amount of T released was measured to be 4.14 ± 0.21 pg/μg DNA. Chromatograms for the GC–NCI–MS analyses are shown in Figure S13. The experiments depicted in Figures 7 and 8 were conducted in the presence of U + 3 and T + 4 internal standards for GC–MS analysis. To ensure that the internal standards did not inhibit base excision by hyTDG, we conducted a gel-based assay under similar conditions except that up to 50 pmol of U free base was added. The additional U free base had no observable effect upon glycosylase cleavage under the conditions of this experiment (Fig. S14). Cytosine to thymine transition mutations are abundant in human cancers and believed to result from the deamination of cytosine and its analogs (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B.

The rate of hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine in double-stranded DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 972-976Google Scholar). These mutations proceed through an intermediate mispair where the deaminated cytosine adduct or uracil analog is paired with guanine (Fig. 1). The deaminated mispair can either be repaired by excision repair pathways or converted to a mutation following DNA replication or repair synthesis. The relative rates of mispair formation, repair, and replication therefore determine the frequency with which the deamination of cytosine or its analogs results in mutation. Currently, adequate methods are lacking for measuring the deaminated intermediates. To address this gap, we have constructed a hybrid glycosylase (hyTDG), which cleaves uracil and thymine, key deamination products, selectively from mispairs. The hybrid enzyme contains a 29 amino acid peptide from the hTDG linked to the catalytic domain of a thermophile TDG, MIG. The 29 amino acid N-terminal peptide of hTDG (residues 82–110) is unstructured and positively charged, which may promote nonspecific interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone to promote lesion searching (25Coey C.T. Malik S.S. Pidugu L.S. Varney K.M. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Structural basis of damage recognition by thymine DNA glycosylase: Key roles for N-terminal residues.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 10248-10258Google Scholar). Coey et al. (25Coey C.T. Malik S.S. Pidugu L.S. Varney K.M. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Structural basis of damage recognition by thymine DNA glycosylase: Key roles for N-terminal residues.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 10248-10258Google Scholar) demonstrated that the addition of these residues to TDG111–308, forming TDG82–308, substantially increased the affinity and glycosylase activity to levels observed for the full-length hTDG. Thus, our rationale for linking the human peptide with a more active T:G glycosylase, MIG, was to enhance lesion scanning and facilitate overall glycosylase activity in the hybrid enzyme. In contrast to hTDG, which cleaves U:G >> T:G, our hybrid enzyme has strong activity against both U:G and T:G mispairs, fulfilling the needed activity for our assay. Our hyTDG retains the mispair specificity previously reported for MIG (24Liu P. Burdzy A. Sowers L.C. Substrate recognition by a family of uracil-DNA glycosylases: UNG, MUG, and TDG.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1001-1009Google Scholar). On oligonucleotide substrates, the hyTDG, which contains 29 amino acids from hTDG, is about 20% faster than MIG in the absence of calf thymus DNA. In the presence of excess calf thymus DNA, the vo for our hyTDG is approximately 2.3-fold higher than MIG. The primary advantage of the 29 amino acid peptide from hTDG appears to be in scanning genomic DNA to find its target. The mispair selectivity of hyTDG, coupled with its high activity on T:G mispairs and ability to rapidly scan DNA, makes it a highly valuable tool for measuring mispaired U:G and T:G in genomic DNA. Using hyTDG and GC–MS quantitation methods, we have probed calf thymus DNA for the presence of U:G and T:G mismatches and UDG to measure total U. Uracil can occur in DNA by two distinct mechanisms (37Richards R.G. Sowers L.C. Laszlo J. Sedwick W.D. The occ"

Various growth factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), are known to promote cancer invasion and metastasis, but the regulatory mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Here, we show that HGF-promoted migration and invasion of breast cancer cells are regulated by CUB domain–containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a transmembrane activator of SRC kinase. In metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which highly expresses the HGF receptor MET and CDCP1, we show that CDCP1 knockdown attenuated HGF-induced MET activation, followed by suppression of lamellipodia formation and cell migration/invasion. In contrast, in the low invasive/nonmetastatic breast cancer cell line T47D, which had no detectable MET and CDCP1 expression, ectopic MET expression stimulated the HGF-dependent activation of invasive activity, and concomitant CDCP1 expression activated SRC and further promoted invasive activity. In these cells, CDCP1 expression dramatically activated HGF-induced membrane remodeling, which was accompanied by activation of the small GTPase Rac1. Analysis of guanine nucleotide exchange factors revealed that ARHGEF7 was specifically required for CDCP1-dependent induction of HGF-induced invasive ability. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that CDCP1 coaccumulated with ARHGEF7. Finally, we confirmed that the CDCP1-SRC axis was also crucial for HGF and ARHGEF7-RAC1 signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the CDCP1-SRC-ARHGEF7-RAC1 pathway plays an important role in the HGF-induced invasion of a subset of breast cancer cells.

Cancer invasion and metastasis are considered major causes of cancer-related mortality. As cancer progresses, malignant cancer cells break the basal membrane, invade the stroma, and enter the circulatory system to metastasize distantly. During these processes, various growth factors released from the tumor microenvironment contribute to promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a growth factor that promotes cancer malignancy. HGF was originally identified as a mitogenic factor for hepatocytes (1Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Molecular cloning and expression of human hepatocyte growth factor.Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar) and scatter factor (2Gherardi E. Gray J. Stoker M. Perryman M. Furlong R. Purification of scatter factor, a fibroblast-derived basic protein that modulates epithelial interactions and movement.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional attributes discriminating mechano-insensitive and mechano-responsive C nociceptors in human skin.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10184-10190Google Scholar). In addition, MET has been identified as a receptor tyrosine kinase for HGF (4Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.M. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Identification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor as the c-met proto-oncogene product.Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Google Scholar). HGF binding promotes MET dimerization to activate autophosphorylation, resulting in the recruitment of various adaptor proteins and signal transducers, such as STAT3, Akt, MAPK, and Src (5Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. MET signalling: Principles and functions in development, organ regeneration and cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 834-848Google Scholar). Through activation of these multiple pathways, HGF–MET controls diverse physiological responses, including developmental morphogenesis, tissue regeneration, and organ homeostasis (6Borowiak M. Garratt A.N. Wustefeld T. Strehle M. Trautwein C. Birchmeier C. Met provides essential signals for liver regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10608-10613Google Scholar, 7Nakamura T. Sakai K. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Hepatocyte growth factor twenty years on: Much more than a growth factor.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 26: 188-202Google Scholar). In particular, HGF plays a crucial role in dynamic cell migration and survival (8Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Essential role for the c-met receptor in the migration of myogenic precursor cells into the limb bud.Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Google Scholar). HGF and MET are aberrantly upregulated in various cancers, such as breast and esophageal cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non–small cell lung cancer (9Matsumoto K. Umitsu M. De Silva D.M. Roy A. Bottaro D.P. Hepatocyte growth factor/MET in cancer progression and biomarker discovery.Cancer Sci. 2017; 108: 296-307Google Scholar). Persistent activation of HGF-induced phenotypes contributes to the progression of invasion and metastasis, as well as the growth and survival of cancer cells. Thus, HGF–MET signaling has been considered a promising therapeutic target for a subset of cancers (10Sierra J.R. Tsao M.S. c-MET as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in cancer.Ther. Adv. Med. Oncol. 2011; 3: S21-S35Google Scholar, 11Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. Boccaccio C. Known and novel roles of the MET oncogene in cancer: A coherent approach to targeted therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 341-358Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of continuous activation of the HGF–MET pathway in invasive and metastatic cancer cells remains unclear. In a previous study, we showed that CUB domain–containing protein 1 (CDCP1) is crucial for regulating HGF-MET signaling in normal epithelial Madin–Darby canine kidney cells (12Kajiwara K. Yamano S. Aoki K. Okuzaki D. Matsumoto K. Okada M. CDCP1 promotes compensatory renal growth by integrating Src and Met signaling.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000832Google Scholar). CDCP1 is a transmembrane scaffold of Src tyrosine kinase, and its upregulation has been implicated in tumor progression (13Ikeda J. Oda T. Inoue M. Uekita T. Sakai R. Okumura M. Aozasa K. Morii E.

Flanagan L.A. Razorenova O.V. CDCP1 cleavage is necessary for homodimerization-induced migration of triple-negative breast cancer.Oncogene. 2016; 35: 4762-4772Google Scholar). Our analysis using Madin–Darby canine kidney cells has revealed that CDCP1 functionally interacts with MET in membrane microdomains and promotes the activation of the MET-STAT3 pathway that transcriptionally induces invasive properties, such as the production of matrix metalloproteases (12Kajiwara K. Yamano S. Aoki K. Okuzaki D. Matsumoto K. Okada M. CDCP1 promotes compensatory renal growth by integrating Src and Met signaling.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000832Google Scholar). However, CDCP1’s requirement for HGF-induced invasion and metastasis of human cancer cells was undetermined. Furthermore, the contribution of pathways other than the MET-STAT3 axis needs to be investigated. To address the above issues, we used the metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which has abundant MET and CDCP1 expression, and a low invasive/nonmetastatic breast cancer cell line T47D, which has no detectable expression of both mentioned proteins, as model systems. We demonstrated that CDCP1 promoted HGF-induced migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. A mechanistic analysis further revealed that CDCP1 activated the ARHGEF7-RAC1 axis to promote HGF-induced cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling, a prerequisite for cell migration and invasion. These findings shed light on the function of CDCP1 in regulating HGF-MET signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis. To verify the importance of CDCP1 in HGF-induced invasion of human cancer cells (Fig. 1A), we used human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, which highly expressed CDCP1 (19Wright H.J. Arulmoli J. Motazedi M. Nelson L.J. Heinemann F.S. Flanagan L.A. Razorenova O.V. CDCP1 cleavage is necessary for homodimerization-induced migration of triple-negative breast cancer.Oncogene. 2016; 35: 4762-4772Google Scholar, 20Leroy C. Shen Q. Strande V. Meyer R. McLaughlin M.E. Lezan E. Bentires-Alj M. Voshol H. Bonenfant D. Alex Gaither L. CUB-domain-containing protein 1 overexpression in solid cancers promotes cancer cell growth by activating Src family kinases.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 5593-5598Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Among these, we focused our analysis on the cells with the most abundant expression of MET, the metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell line. We first knocked down CDCP1 using siRNA and examined its effects on HGF signaling (Fig. 1C). Immunoblot analysis showed that CDCP1 knockdown significantly decreased MET protein levels even before HGF stimulation (Fig. 1, C and E). Consequently, MET activation was significantly attenuated in the initial phase of HGF signaling (Fig. 1, D and F). Since CDCP1 knockdown did not affect MET mRNA expression (Fig. S1A), it is suggested that CDCP1 functionally interacts with MET and may contribute to the regulation of stability and/or turnover rate of MET protein in these cancer cells. We then investigated the role of CDCP1 in HGF-induced cell migration and invasion by observing the HGF-induced formation of the lamellipodium, an actin-enriched membrane structure at the leading edge of cells that functions to pull cells forward during migration (21Trusolino L. Cavassa S. Angelini P. Ando M. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M. Boccaccio C. HGF/scatter factor selectively promotes cell invasion by increasing integrin avidity.FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1629-1640Google Scholar). The HGF-induced formation of lamellipodia was inhibited by CDCP1 knockdown and rescued by CDCP1 re-expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Of note, some CDCP1 coaccumulated with F-actin along the edge of lamellipodia in HGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Boyden chamber assays revealed that CDCP1 knockdown significantly inhibited HGF-induced cell migration (Fig. 2C) and invasion (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the inhibition of invasive activity was also rescued by CDCP1 re-expression (Fig. 2D). These observations suggest that CDCP1 is required for HGF-induced dynamic cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells. To further confirm the role of CDCP1 in HGF signaling, we subsequently employed a low invasive/nonmetastatic breast cancer cell line T47D, which had no significant expression of either protein (Fig. 1B) and no invasive activity (Fig. S1, B and C). We thus introduced MET into these cells using a Tet-On system and then established cell lines with or without stable CDCP1 overexpression. Effects of CDCP1 expression on HGF signaling were examined using immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). MET expression enabled these cells to respond to HGF stimulation, as indicated by the phosphorylation of MET, AKT, and ERK. Since MET was forcedly and continuously overexpressed in the distinct cell lines, the effects of CDCP1 expression on MET protein levels and cell signaling could not be accurately compared. Consequently, MET signaling (e.g., p-ERK1/2) appeared unchanged or rather decreased by CDCP1 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). Nonetheless, CDCP1 expression induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in SRC-pY416 signals, indicating that SRC was selectively activated by CDCP1 expression (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the invasion assay using the Boyden chamber showed that HGF-induced invasive activity was enhanced by CDCP1 expression, but the expression of a mutant CDCP1 that lacks SRC activation site (CDCP1-Y734F) (12Kajiwara K. Yamano S. Aoki K. Okuzaki D. Matsumoto K. Okada M. CDCP1 promotes compensatory renal growth by integrating Src and Met signaling.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000832Google Scholar) failed to promote HGF-induced invasion (Fig. 3, C–E). These results suggest that the CDCP1-SRC axis is involved in the promotion of HGF-induced cell invasion. Since T47D cells retained epithelial features, even though they overexpressed both MET and CDCP1, HGF stimulation was unable to promote lamellipodia formation. Thus, we observed effects of HGF stimulation on membrane dynamics in these cells. Time-lapse microscopy analysis revealed that CDCP1 expression dramatically enhanced the formation of membrane ruffles, which were enriched with the actin cytoskeleton (Movie S1–S4 and Fig. 4, A and B). Membrane ruffles and lamellipodia are known to be formed via RAC1-GTPase-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (22Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. A role for Rac in Tiam1-induced membrane ruffling and invasion.Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Google Scholar). Inhibitor analysis in MET-expressing T47D cells indicated that CDCP1-dependent promotion of invasion activity was markedly suppressed by an inhibitor of RAC1 (Fig. S2A). The treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or a Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor Dasatinib significantly inhibited the basal invasion activity, indicating the requirement of PI3K and SFK activities for promotion of cell invasion (Fig. S2, A and B). Furthermore, a pull-down assay for RAC1 activity showed that CDCP1 expression significantly enhanced HGF-dependent RAC1 activation (Fig. 4, C and D). The roles of RAC1 and SRC in CDCP1-dependent promotion of HGF-induced cell invasion was further confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells. HGF-induced lamellipodia formation was inhibited by RAC1 inhibitor but not by ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Fig. S2C). The treatment with Dasatinib strongly suppressed cell invasion, and RAC1 inhibitor treatment suppressed HGF-dependent promotion of cell invasion (Fig. S2). Re-expression of wild-type CDCP1 significantly restored HGF-dependent invasive activity in CDCP1 knockdown cells, whereas that of CDCP1-Y734F only partially rescued the phenotype (Fig. S2D). Furthermore, Dasatinib treatment significantly suppressed HGF-induced RAC1 activation (Fig. S2, E and F). Although the sensitivity to inhibitors was somehow different between the two cell lines, these data underscore the role of RAC1 and the CDCP1-SRC axis in HGF-induced invasion activity and raise a question of how the CDCP1-SRC axis activates RAC1. Since CDCP1 does not contain a structure that has the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), we hypothesized that some RAC1 GEFs mediate the functional interplay between CDCP1 and RAC1. To explore this possibility, we knocked down several RAC1 GEFs, including ARHGEF7, VAV2, TIAM1, and DOCK1, which have been implicated in membrane ruffling (22Michiels F. Habets G.G.

Among the GEFs tested, only ARHGEF7 knockdown suppressed CDCP1-dependent activation of invasive activity. Knockdown of other GEFs suppressed the invasive activity independent of CDCP1. The rescue experiment using the shRNA-resistant ARHGEF7-mCherry construct (res-ARHGEF7) in MET-expressing T47D cells clearly revealed that ARHGEF7 re-expression restored CDCP1-dependent promotion of HGF-induced invasive activity (Fig. 5, A–C). Furthermore, ARHGEF7 knockdown completely suppressed CDCP1-dependent RAC1 activation (Fig. 5, D and E), which was restored by res-ARHGEF7 expression (Fig. 5, F and G). To validate the role of ARHGEF7, we knocked down ARHGEF7 and/or CDCP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells and examined their effects on HGF-induced invasive activity (Fig. 6). The results showed that ARHGEF7 was required for CDCP1-dependent promotion of HGF-induced invasive activity (Fig. 6, A and B) and other GEFs functioned independently of HGF signaling in these cells as well (Fig. S4, A and B). Furthermore, knockdown of ARHGEF7 and/or CDCP1 significantly suppressed HGF-induced RAC1 activation (Fig. 6, C and D) and lamellipodia formation (Fig. 6, E and F). Taking these findings together with the fact that SRC activity was required for HGF-induced RAC1 activation (Fig. S2, E and F), it is likely that HGF-induced RAC1 activation by CDCP1-SRC is preferentially dependent on ARHGEF7, raising the next question of how the CDCP1-SRC axis activates ARHGEF7. To elucidate the functional link between the CDCP1-SRC axis and ARHGEF7, we first examined the physical interactions between CDCP1 and ARHGEF7. However, a coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that there was no stable interaction between these molecules. Furthermore, SRC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ARHGEF7 (27Feng Q. Baird D. Peng X. Wang J. Ly T. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. Cool-1 functions as an essential regulatory node for EGF receptor- and Src-mediated cell growth.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 945-956Google Scholar) was undetectable under our conditions. Thus, we investigated the subcellular localization of these molecules. Considering that ARHGEF7 has a PH domain (Fig. 7A), we hypothesized that ARHGEF7 can accumulate in the membrane region where PIP3 is enriched. Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that, upon HGF stimulation, ARHGEF7 accumulated in the membrane region where PH-Btk-EGFP, a PIP3 reporter (28Kojima T. Fukuda M. Watanabe Y. Hamazato F.

Furthermore, HGF stimulation induced coaccumulation of ARHGEF7 with CDCP1 at the edge of cells where membrane ruffling occurred in T47D cells expressing MET and CDCP1 (Fig. 7C). The HGF-dependent coaccumulation of ARHGEF7 with CDCP1 was also observed at the edge of lamellipodia in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, HGF-induced coaccumulation of ARHGEF7 with CDCP1 was prevented by inhibiting MET (Fig. S5, A and B). Taking these observations together with the contribution of PI3K to HGF signaling (Fig. S2A), it is suggested that the CDCP1-SRC axis potentiates HGF-induced formation of the PIP3-enriched membrane domain, where CDCP1 and ARHGEF7 coaccumulate to activate RAC1-mediated membrane ruffling. Finally, we addressed how CDCP1 translocates to PIP3-enriched regions. To this end, we examined changes in the subcellular localization of CDCP1 and MET after HGF stimulation using immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 8). Upon HGF stimulation, both proteins were rapidly endocytosed and colocalized on endosomes within 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 8, A and B). Pretreatment with Dynasore suppressed the endocytosis of both proteins, indicating that the process was clathrin dependent (Fig. 8, C and D). These observations suggest that CDCP1 interacts with MET during endocytosis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis using endosome markers revealed that CDCP1 accumulated in Rab7-positive late endosomes, and a substantial part of CDCP1 was detected on Rab11a-positive slow recycling endosomes (Fig. 9, A and B). We also observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 gradually (∼60 min) increased concurrently with HGF-induced RAC1 activation and membrane ruffling (Fig. S6). These results suggest that activated CDCP1-SRC can be recycled back to the plasma membrane after HGF stimulation. Indeed, immunoblot analysis showed that CDCP1 protein levels were unchanged during HGF stimulation, while activated MET was rapidly degraded via lysosome or proteasome digestion (31Clague M.J. Met receptor: A moving target.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4pe40Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). These findings raise the possibility that activated CDCP1-SRC, which is selectively recycled back to the plasma membrane, contributes to forming the PIP3-enriched region where the ARHGEF7-RAC1 axis is activated.Figure 9CDCP1 is recycled via the endosome system. A, T47D cells expressing MET and CDCP1-myc were stimulated with HGF for 30 min and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis for CDCP1-myc and the indicated endosome markers.

C, schematic model of our working hypothesis derived from this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the role of CDCP1 in human breast cancer cells and found that the CDCP1-SRC axis enhanced the HGF-induced formation of lamellipodia or membrane ruffles, leading to the promotion of cell migration and invasion. A mechanistic analysis revealed the ARHGEF7-RAC1 axis as a novel mediator of CDCP1-dependent promotion of cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, we showed that CDCP1 and ARHGEF7 coaccumulate via the endosome system on the HGF-induced PIP3-enriched membrane domain. These results led us to propose the following working hypothesis (Fig. 9C): HGF stimulation activates PI3K to induce a PIP3-enriched membrane domain, known as lipid rafts. Lipid raft-localized CDCP1 activates SRC, which can directly/indirectly promote the PI3K activation (32Arcaro A. Aubert M. Espinosa del Hierro M.E. Khanzada U.K. Angelidou S. Tetley T.D. Bittermann A.G. Frame M.C. Seckl M.J. Critical role for lipid raft-associated Src kinases in activation of PI3K-Akt signalling.Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 1081-1092Google Scholar). CDCP1-SRC can also activate MET to potentiate HGF signaling (12Kajiwara K. Yamano S. Aoki K. Okuzaki D. Matsumoto K. Okada M. CDCP1 promotes compensatory renal growth by integrating Src and Met signaling.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000832Google Scholar). By linking these signaling circuits, CDCP1 may accelerate the local formation of PIP3-enriched signaling platform, where ARHGEF7 accumulates to activate RAC1-mediated membrane ruffling/lamellipodia formation. As reported previously (12Kajiwara K. Yamano S. Aoki K. Okuzaki D. Matsumoto K. Okada M. CDCP1 promotes compensatory renal growth by integrating Src and Met signaling.Life Sci. Alliance. 2021; 4e202000832Google Scholar), CDCP1 also contributes to the upregulation of gene expression required for invasive properties, such as matrix metalloprotease production, by activating the Src-STAT3 axis. Activating these multiple pathways promoted cell migration and invasion synergistically. This model sheds new light on the regulatory mechanism of HGF-MET signaling, which promotes cancer invasion and metastasis. ARHGEF7, also known as Cool-1 and βPix, is an essential Dbl family of Rac GTPase GEF implicated in cytoskeleton remodeling, which is important in cell migration (33Campa F. Machuy N. Klein A.

Although several randomized controlled trials (RCT) have tested the effect of non-pharmacological standard GDM care adjuncts on these outcomes, there is no agglomerated statistical evidence on how their occurrence risk varies across interventions and with placebo. Therefore, a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) protocol is proposed here to address this evidence gap. Materials and methods A search for above RCTs published in the English language will transpire in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases irrespective of date and geographic boundary. The RCTs must test nutritional supplementation, digital intervention, structured exercise program, educational program, counseling service, or a combination of these prenatally in GDM patients. These should report ≥1 of the following outcomes- cesarean section, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, preterm birth, macrosomia, prolonged labor, gestational hypertension, premature rupture of membranes, congenital anomaly, Apgar scores, birth weight, birth length, gestational age at birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal Corpulence Index. The risk of bias assessment of the recruited trials will transpire using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Determination of the comparative effectiveness between interventions will occur by the frequentist method NMA for respective outcomes. The categorical and continuous outcomes effect size will get calculated in risk ratio and weighted or standardized mean difference, respectively. For each NMA model, network maps and league tables will show the connections between interventions and effect sizes with their 95% confidence intervals for each intervention pair compared, respectively. The publication bias assessment will occur using comparison-adjusted funnel plots. Best intervention prediction for NMA models with statistically significant intervention effect will happen by determining the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values.

Our findings are consistent with the view that the disciplinary mechanism associated with the takeover market mitigates agency problems and ultimately raises firm value.

https://openalex.org/W4210466589,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a central driver of aggressive prostate cancer. After initial treatment with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi), reactivation of AR signaling leads to resistance. Alternative splicing of AR mRNA yields the AR-V7 splice variant, which is currently an undruggable mechanism of ARSi resistance: AR-V7 lacks a ligand binding domain, where hormones and anti-androgen antagonists act, but still activates AR signaling. We reveal PKCβ as a druggable regulator of transcription and splicing at the AR genomic locus. We identify a clinical PKCβ inhibitor in combination with an FDA-approved anti-androgen as an approach for repressing AR genomic locus expression, including expression of AR-V7, while antagonizing full-length AR. PKCβ inhibition reduces total AR gene expression, thus reducing AR-V7 protein levels and sensitizing prostate cancer cells to current anti-androgen therapies. We demonstrate that this combination may be a viable therapeutic strategy for AR-V7-positive prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W4225524214,"The current study aimed to further address important questions regarding the therapeutic efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids for various behavioral and neuroimmune aspects of the Fmr1 phenotype. To address these questions, our experimental design utilized two different omega-3 fatty acid administration timepoints, compared to both standard laboratory chow controls (""Standard"") and a diet controlling for the increase in fat content (""Control Fat""). In the first paradigm, post-weaning supplementation (after postnatal day 21) with the omega-3 fatty acid diet (""Omega-3"") reversed deficits in startle threshold, but not deficits in prepulse inhibition, and the effect on startle threshold was not specific to the Omega-3 diet. However, post-weaning supplementation with both experimental diets also impaired acquisition of a fear response, recall of the fear memory and contextual fear conditioning compared to the Standard diet. The post-weaning Omega-3 diet reduced hippocampal expression of IL-6 and this reduction of IL-6 was significantly associated with diminished performance in the fear conditioning task. In the perinatal experimental paradigm, the Omega-3 diet attenuated hyperactivity and acquisition of a fear response. Additionally, perinatal exposure to the Control Fat diet (similar to a ""Western"" diet) further diminished nonsocial anxiety in the Fmr1 knockout. This study provides significant evidence that dietary fatty acids throughout the lifespan can significantly impact the behavioral and neuroimmune phenotype of the Fmr1 knockout model."
https://openalex.org/W4207008495,"While miRs have been extensively studied in the context of malignancy and tumor progression, their functions in regulating T-cell activation are less clear. In initial studies, we found reduced levels of miR-15a/16 at 3 to 18 h post-T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, suggesting a role for decreased levels of this miR pair in shaping T-cell activation. To further explore this, we developed an inducible miR15a/16 transgenic mouse model to determine how elevating miR-15a/16 levels during early stages of activation would affect T-cell proliferation and to identify TCR signaling pathways regulated by this miR pair. Doxycycline (DOX)-induced expression of miR-15a/16 from 0 to 18 h post-TCR stimulation decreased ex vivo T-cell proliferation as well as in vivo antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. We also combined bioinformatics and proteomics approaches to identify the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) (Map2k1) as a target of miR-15a/16. MEK1 targeting by miR-15a/16 was confirmed using miR mimics that decreased Map2k1 mRNA containing the 3'-UTR target nucleotide sequence (UGCUGCUA) but did not decrease Map2k1 containing a mutated control sequence (AAAAAAAA). Phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Elk1, was also decreased by DOX-induced miR-15a/16 expression. In addition to MEK1, ERK1 was subsequently found to be targeted by miR-15a/16, with DOX-induced miR-15a/16 reducing total ERK1 levels in T cells. These findings show that TCR stimulation reduces miR-15a/16 levels at early stages of T-cell activation to facilitate increased MEK1 and ERK1, which promotes the sustained MEK1-ERK1/2-Elk1 signaling required for optimal proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W4210451222,"Blood-borne fatty acids ( Fa ) are important substrates for energy conversion in the mammalian heart. After release from plasma albumin, Fa traverse the endothelium and the interstitial compartment to cross the sarcolemma prior to oxidation in the cardiomyocytal mitochondria. The aims of the present study were to elucidate the site with lowest Fa permeability ( i . e ., highest Fa resistance) in the overall Fa trajectory from capillary to cardiomyocyte and the relative contribution of unbound Fa (detach pathway, characterized by the dissociation time constant τ AlbFa ) and albumin-bound Fa (contact pathway, characterized by the membrane reaction rate parameter d Alb ) in delivering Fa to the cellular membranes. In this study, an extensive set of 34 multiple indicator dilution experiments with radiolabeled albumin and palmitate on isolated rabbit hearts was analysed by means of a previously developed mathematical model of Fa transfer dynamics. In these experiments, the ratio of the concentration of palmitate to albumin was set at 0.91. The analysis shows that total cardiac Fa permeability, P tot , is indeed related to the albumin concentration in the extracellular compartment as predicted by the mathematical model. The analysis also reveals that the lowest permeability may reside in the boundary zones containing albumin in the microvascular and interstitial compartment. However, the permeability of the endothelial cytoplasm, P ec , may influence overall Fa permeability, P tot , as well. The model analysis predicts that the most likely value of τ AlbFa ranges from about 200 to 400 ms. In case τ AlbFa is fast, i . e ., about 200 ms, the extracellular contact pathway appears to be of minor importance in delivering Fa to the cell membrane. If Fa dissociation from albumin is slower, e . g . τ AlbFa equals 400 ms, the contribution of the contact pathway may vary from minimal ( d Alb ≤5 nm) to substantial ( d Alb about 100 nm). In the latter case, the permeability of the endothelial cytoplasm varies from infinite (no hindrance) to low (substantial hindrance) to keep the overall Fa flux at a fixed level. Definitive estimation of the impact of endothelial permeability on P tot and the precise contribution of the contact pathway to overall transfer of Fa in boundary zones containing albumin requires adequate physicochemical experimentation to delineate the true value of, among others, τ AlbFa , under physiologically relevant circumstances. Our analysis also implies that concentration differences of unbound Fa are the driving force of intra-cardiac Fa transfer; an active, energy requiring transport mechanism is not necessarily involved. Membrane-associated proteins may facilitate Fa transfer in the boundary zones containing albumin by modulating the membrane reaction rate parameter, d Alb , and, hence, the contribution of the contact pathway to intra-cardiac Fa transfer."

Then, a quasi-experimental study was performed in which the virtual learning environment was implemented on dentists from seven Colombian cities. The median of correct answers and the levels of awareness, attitudes, and intention to practice were compared before, immediately after, and 6-months post-intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank and McNemar's tests were used to determine the differences. A total of 206 participants who finished the virtual learning environment activities exhibited a favorable and statistically significant impact on the median of correct answers of awareness (p < 0.001), attitudes (p < 0.001), and intention to practice (p = 0.042). A significant increase occurred in the number of participants with a high level of awareness (p < 0.001) and a non-significant increase in participants with high levels of attitudes (p = 0.230) and intention to practice (p = 0.286). At 6 months, the positive effect on the median of correct answers on awareness and intention to practice persisted (p < 0.001); however, this was not evident for attitudes (p = 0.105). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the number of participants who showed low levels of awareness (p = 0.019) and a slight increase in those with high levels of the same component (p = 0.161).

Environmental factors such as maternal smoking during pregnancy, socio-economic status, trauma, or early life stress are associated with CD. Although the number of females with CD is rising in Western societies, CD is under-researched in female cohorts. We aimed at exploring the epigenetic signature of females with CD and its relation to psychosocial and environmental risk factors. We performed HpaII sensitive genome-wide methylation sequencing of 49 CD girls and 50 matched typically developing controls and linear regression models to identify differentially methylated CpG loci (tags) and regions. Significant tags and regions were mapped to the respective genes and tested for enrichment in pathways and brain developmental processes. Finally, epigenetic signatures were tested as mediators for CD-associated risk factors. We identified a 12% increased methylation 5' of the neurite modulator SLITRK5 (FDR = 0.0046) in cases within a glucocorticoid receptor binding site. Functionally, methylation positively correlated with gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines. At systems-level, genes (uncorr. P < 0.01) were associated with development of neurons, neurite outgrowth or neuronal developmental processes. At gene expression level, the associated gene-networks are activated perinatally and during early childhood in neocortical regions, thalamus and striatum, and expressed in amygdala and hippocampus. Specifically, the epigenetic signatures of the gene network activated in the thalamus during early childhood correlated with the effect of parental education on CD status possibly mediating its protective effect. The differential methylation patterns identified in females with CD are likely to affect genes that are expressed in brain regions previously indicated in CD. We provide suggestive evidence that protective effects are likely mediated by epigenetic mechanisms impairing specific brain developmental networks and therefore exerting a long-term effect on neural functions in CD. Our results are exploratory and thus, further replication is needed."

The objectives of this study were to provide the locations and numbers of PWID in eight cities in Afghanistan and extrapolate estimates for the country as a whole. Methods Multiple population size estimation methods were used, including key informant interviews for mapping and enumeration with reverse tracking, unique object and service multipliers, capture-recapture, and wisdom of the crowds. The results of the several methods were synthesized using the Anchored Multiplier–a Bayesian approach to produce point estimates and 95% credible intervals (CI). Using the prevalence of PWID in the eight cities and their correlation with proxy indicators, we extrapolated the PWID population size for all of Afghanistan. Results Key informants and field mapping identified 374 hotspots across the eight cities from December 29, 2018 to March 20, 2019. Synthesizing results of the multiple methods, the number of male PWID in the eight study cities was estimated to be 11,506 (95% CI 8,449–15,093), corresponding to 0.69% (95% CI 0.50–0.90) of the adult male population age 15–64 years. The total number of women who injected drugs was estimated at 484 (95% CI 356–633), corresponding to 0.03% (95% CI 0.02–0.04) of the adult female population. Extrapolating by proxy indicators, the total number of PWID in Afghanistan was estimated to be 54,782 (95% CI 40,250–71,837), men and 2,457 (95% CI 1,823–3,210) women. The total number of PWID in Afghanistan was estimated to be 57,207 (95% CI 42,049–75,005), which corresponds to 0.37% (95% CI 0.27–0.48) of the adult population age 15 to 64 years. Discussion This study provided estimates for the number of PWID in Afghanistan. These estimates can be used for advocating and planning services for this vulnerable at-risk population."

A major problem in treating CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa is the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel P. aeruginosa antibiotic drug targets is of the utmost urgency. The genome of P. aeruginosa contains four putative cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) of unknown function that have never before been characterized. Analogous to some of the CYPs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, these P. aeruginosa CYPs may be important for growth and colonization of CF patients' lungs. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized CYP168A1 from P. aeruginosa and identified it as a subterminal fatty acid hydroxylase. Spectral binding data and computational modeling of substrates and inhibitors suggest that CYP168A1 has a large, expansive active site and preferentially binds long chain fatty acids and large hydrophobic inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolic experiments confirm that the enzyme is capable of hydroxylating arachidonic acid, an important inflammatory signaling molecule present in abundance in the CF lung, to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE; Km = 41 μM, Vmax = 220 pmol/min/nmol P450), a potent vasodilator, which may play a role in the pathogen's ability to colonize the lung. Additionally, we found that the in vitro metabolism of arachidonic acid is subject to substrate inhibition and is also inhibited by the presence of the antifungal agent ketoconazole. This study identifies a new metabolic pathway in this important human pathogen that may be of utility in treating P. aeruginosa infections."

In this study, we demonstrated that JAK2 localization to the centrosome depends on the SH2 domain and intact kinase activity. We created JAK2 mutants deficient in centrosomal localization ΔSH2, K882E and (ΔSH2, K882E). We showed that JAK2 WT clone strongly enhances cell proliferation as compared to control cells while JAK2 clones ΔSH2, K882E and (ΔSH2, K882E) proliferate slower than JAK2 WT cells. These mutant clones also progress much slower through the cell cycle as compared to JAK2 WT clone and the enhanced proliferation of JAK2 WT cells is accompanied by increased S -> G2 progression. Both the SH2 domain and the kinase activity of JAK2 play a role in prolactin-dependent activation of JAK2 substrate STAT5. We showed that JAK2 is an important regulator of centrosome function as the SH2 domain of JAK2 regulates centrosome amplification. The cells overexpressing ΔSH2 and (ΔSH2, K-E) JAK2 have almost three-fold the amplified centrosomes of WT cells. In contrast, the kinase activity of JAK2 is dispensable for centrosome amplification. Our observations provide novel insight into the role of SH2 domain and kinase activity of JAK2 in centrosome localization of JAK2 and in the regulation of cell growth and centrosome biogenesis."

Symptoms were self-reported at time of requesting a test. Multivariable logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to identify predictors of a positive test. Included symptoms were: cough, fever, loss of smell or taste, muscle ache, runny nose, shortness of breath, and throat ache; adjustments were made for age and gender, and stratification by month.Overall, 12.0% of 773,680 tests in 432,213 unique individuals were positive. All symptoms were significantly associated with a positive test result, the strongest positive associations were: cough (aOR = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.75-1.80), fever (aOR = 2.11, 95%CI = 2.07-2.14), loss of smell or taste (aOR = 2.55, 95%CI = 2.50-2.61), and muscle ache (aOR = 2.38, 95%CI = 2.34-2.43). The adjusted odds ratios for loss of smell or taste slightly declined over time, while that for cough increased.Cough, fever, loss of smell or taste, and muscle ache appear to be most strongly associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in symptomatic people of the general population who were tested."
https://openalex.org/W4210614078,"Focus of this study is to design an automated image processing pipeline for handling uncontrolled acquisition conditions of images acquired in the field. The pipeline has been tested on the automated identification and count of uncapped brood cells in honeybee (Apis Mellifera) comb images to reduce the workload of beekeepers during the study of the hygienic behavior of honeybee colonies. The images used to develop and test the model were acquired by beekeepers on different days and hours in summer 2020 and under uncontrolled conditions. This resulted in images differing for background noise, illumination, color, comb tilts, scaling, and comb sizes. All the available 127 images were manually cropped to approximately include the comb area. To obtain an unbiased evaluation, the cropped images were randomly split into a training image set (50 images), which was used to develop and tune the proposed model, and a test image set (77 images), which was solely used to test the model. To reduce the effects of varied illuminations or exposures, three image enhancement algorithms were tested and compared followed by the Hough Transform, which allowed identifying individual cells to be automatically counted. All the algorithm parameters were automatically chosen on the training set by grid search. When applied to the 77 test images the model obtained a correlation of 0.819 between the automated counts and the experts' counts. To provide an assessment of our model with publicly available images acquired by a different equipment and under different acquisition conditions, we randomly extracted 100 images from a comb image dataset made available by a recent literature work. Though it has been acquired under controlled exposure, the images in this new set have varied illuminations; anyhow, our pipeline obtains a correlation between automatic and manual counts equal to 0.997. In conclusion, our tests on the automatic count of uncapped honey bee comb cells acquired in the field and on images extracted from a publicly available dataset suggest that the hereby generated pipeline successfully handles varied noise artifacts, illumination, and exposure conditions, therefore allowing to generalize our method to different acquisition settings. Results further improve when the acquisition conditions are controlled."
https://openalex.org/W4210667094,"The Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) has gained validity evidence from several studies. However, various modifications have been applied to the original version, which have never been compared systematically. In Study 1, we tested 120 healthy participants to directly compare two versions of the EEfRT. In Study 2, we tested a larger sample of 394 healthy participants to further examine the original EEfRT. We replicated the split-half reliability of both task versions. However, self-reported personality traits (e.g., trait BAS) correlated with only some task performance parameters in Study 1, which did not replicate for the original EEfRT in Study 2. Our results indicate complex and sometimes inconsistent relations between different personality traits, task properties, and reward attributes."
https://openalex.org/W4210716306,"The present study investigated resilience profiles (based on levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression and five dimensions of protective factors) of 1,160 students from Germany (n = 346, 46.0% females, Mage = 12.77, SDage = 0.78), Greece (n = 439, 54.5% females, Mage = 12.68, SDage = 0.69), and Switzerland (n = 375, 44.5% females, Mage = 12.29, SDage = 0.88) using latent profile analyses. We also checked for measurement invariance and investigated the influence of gender and migration on class membership. A three-profile-solution was found for Switzerland (nonresilient 22.1%, moderately resilient 42.9%, untroubled 34.9%), and a four-profile-solution was the best fitting model for Germany (nonresilient 15.7%, moderately resilient 44.2%, untroubled 27.3%, resilient 12.7%) and Greece (nonresilient 21.0%, moderately resilient 30.8%, untroubled 24.9%, resilient 23.3%). Measurement invariance did not hold across the three countries. Profile differences regarding class membership predictions were detected for Germany and Greece, but none for Switzerland. Results implicate that resilience profiles are highly contextually sensitive, and resilience research findings should not be generalized considering the particularity of contexts, people, and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4210718695,"Introduction People who inject drugs (PWID) in Sub-Saharan Africa have limited access to comprehensive HIV services. While it is important to inform programming, knowledge about factors influencing access to comprehensive HIV services is scarce. We assessed the proportions of PWID with access to HIV prevention services and associated socio-cognitive factors in Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among PWID between October and December 2017 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Data on access to HIV prevention services, demographics and selected socio-cognitive factors were collected through structured face-to-face interviews. Weighted descriptive and forward selection multivariable logistics regression analyses were done to assess independent associations between HIV prevention services and predictors of interest. The results were two tailed and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The study included 611 PWID (males: 94.4%) with a median age of 34 years (Interquartile Range (IQR), 29–38). A large majority of participants reported to have access to condoms (87.8%), sterile needles/syringes (72.8%) and ever tested for HIV (66.0%). About half (52.0%) reported to have used condoms in the past one month and about a third (28.5%) accessed a peer educator. The odds of testing for HIV decreased among participants who perceived their HIV risk to be high (aOR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.17–0.49) and those experienced sexual violence (aOR = 0.60; 95%CI 0.37–0.98). However, the odds of testing for HIV increased among participants with secondary level of education (aOR = 2.16; 95%CI: 1.06–5.55), and those who reported having correct comprehensive HIV knowledge (CCHK) (aOR = 1.63; 95%CI 1.12–2.41). The odds of access to condoms increased among females (aOR = 2.23; 95%CI: 1.04–5.02) but decreased among participants with secondary level of education (aOR = 0.41; 95%CI: 0.19–0.84), an income of &gt;TZS 200,000 (aOR = 0.39; 95%CI: 0.23–0.66) and those who perceived their HIV risk to be high (aOR = 0.13; 95%CI: 0.03–0.36). The odds of access to peer educators was higher among participants with primary (aOR = 1.61; 95%CI: 1.01–2.26), and secondary (aOR = 2.71; 95%CI: 1.39–5.33) levels of education. The odds of access to sterile needle and syringe decreased among participants who perceived their HIV risk to be high (aOR = 0.11;95%CI 0.05–0.22), and low-medium (aOR = 0.25;95%CI 0.11–0.52) but increased among those with primary level of education (aOR = 1.72;95%CI 1.06–2.78). Conclusion Access to condom, HIV testing, sterile needles and syringes were relatively high among PWID. However, condom use and access to peer educators was relatively low. HIV knowledge and risk perception, gender, education, and sexual violence influenced access to HIV prevention services. There is an urgent need to address the identified socio-cognitive factors and scale up all aspects of HIV prevention services to fast-track attainment of the 2025 UNAIDS goals and ending the HIV epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210753353,"The uropathogens is the main cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of the study was to isolate bacteria from urine samples of UTI patients and find out the susceptibility of isolated bacteria. Bacteria were identified using both conventional and molecular methods. Sanger sequence procedure used for 16S ribosomal RNA and phylogenetic analysis was performed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-7) software. In this study, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus were reported as 58, 28 and 14.0% respectively. Phylogenetic tree revealed that 99% of sample No. Ai (05) is closely related to E. coli to (NR 114042.1 E. coli strain NBRC 102203). Aii (23) is 99% similar to K. pneumoniae to (NR 117686.1 K. pneumonia strain DSM 30104) and 90% Bi (48) is closely linked to S. aureus to (NR 113956.1 S. aureus strain NBRC 100910). The antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli recorded highest resistance towards ampicillin (90%) and least resistant to ofloxacin (14%). Some of the other antibiotics such amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and nitrofurantoin resistance were observed 86, 62, 24, 55, 48 and 35% respectively. The cefuroxime showed the highest antibiotic resistance against K. pneumoniae with 85% followed by amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin resulted in 60, 45, 67, 70, 75 and 30% respectively. The resistance of S. aureus against erythromycin, cefuroxime and ampicillin were found with 72%. The resistance against amoxicillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone found 57, 43, 43 and 15% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis shows that sequences are closely related with the reference sequences and E. coli is the dominant bacteria among UTI patients and is resistant to the commercially available antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4210530515,"Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Cardiac Care Bridge (CCB) nurse-led transitional care program in older (≥70 years) cardiac patients compared to usual care. Methods The intervention group (n = 153) received the CCB program consisting of case management, disease management and home-based cardiac rehabilitation in the transition from hospital to home on top of usual care and was compared with the usual care group (n = 153). Outcomes included a composite measure of first all-cause unplanned hospital readmission or mortality, Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and societal costs within six months follow-up. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Statistical uncertainty surrounding Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) was estimated by using bootstrapped seemingly unrelated regression. Results No significant between group differences in the composite outcome of readmission or mortality nor in societal costs were observed. QALYs were statistically significantly lower in the intervention group, mean difference -0.03 (95% CI: -0.07; -0.02). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the maximum probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.31 at a Willingness To Pay (WTP) of €0,00 and 0.14 at a WTP of €50,000 per composite outcome prevented and 0.32 and 0.21, respectively per QALY gained. Conclusion The CCB program was on average more expensive and less effective compared to usual care, indicating that the CCB program is dominated by usual care. Therefore, the CCB program cannot be considered cost-effective compared to usual care."
