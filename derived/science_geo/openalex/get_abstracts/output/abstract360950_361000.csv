https://openalex.org/W2132341951,"We present single-molecule, real-time sequencing data obtained from a DNA polymerase performing uninterrupted template-directed synthesis using four distinguishable fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates."

Would this reality cause you to litter more, trespass, or even steal? A thesis known as the broken windows theory suggests that signs of disorderly and petty criminal behavior trigger more disorderly and petty criminal behavior, thus causing the behavior to spread. This may cause neighborhoods to decay and the quality of life of its inhabitants to deteriorate. For a city government, this may be a vital policy issue. But does disorder really spread in neighborhoods? So far there has not been strong empirical support, and it is not clear what constitutes disorder and what may make it spread. We generated hypotheses about the spread of disorder and tested them in six field experiments. We found that, when people observe that others violated a certain social norm or legitimate rule, they are more likely to violate other norms or rules, which causes disorder to spread."
https://openalex.org/W2129297473,"Why do seemingly identical cells respond differently to a drug? To address this, we studied the dynamics and variability of the protein response of human cancer cells to a chemotherapy drug, camptothecin. We present a dynamic-proteomics approach that measures the levels and locations of nearly 1000 different endogenously tagged proteins in individual living cells at high temporal resolution. All cells show rapid translocation of proteins specific to the drug mechanism, including the drug target (topoisomerase-1), and slower, wide-ranging temporal waves of protein degradation and accumulation. However, the cells differ in the behavior of a subset of proteins. We identify proteins whose dynamics differ widely between cells, in a way that corresponds to the outcomes—cell death or survival. This opens the way to understanding molecular responses to drugs in individual cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968431963,"More than 99% of the mass of the visible universe is made up of protons and neutrons. Both particles are much heavier than their quark and gluon constituents, and the Standard Model of particle physics should explain this difference. We present a full ab initio calculation of the masses of protons, neutrons, and other light hadrons, using lattice quantum chromodynamics. Pion masses down to 190 mega-electron volts are used to extrapolate to the physical point, with lattice sizes of approximately four times the inverse pion mass. Three lattice spacings are used for a continuum extrapolation. Our results completely agree with experimental observations and represent a quantitative confirmation of this aspect of the Standard Model with fully controlled uncertainties."
https://openalex.org/W2032112615,"Every organ depends on blood vessels for oxygen and nutrients, but the vasculature associated with individual organs can be structurally and molecularly diverse. The central nervous system (CNS) vasculature consists of a tightly sealed endothelium that forms the blood-brain barrier, whereas blood vessels of other organs are more porous. Wnt7a and Wnt7b encode two Wnt ligands produced by the neuroepithelium of the developing CNS coincident with vascular invasion. Using genetic mouse models, we found that these ligands directly target the vascular endothelium and that the CNS uses the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to promote formation and CNS-specific differentiation of the organ's vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1972265157,"Invisibility and negative refraction are both applications of transformation optics where the material of a device performs a coordinate transformation for electromagnetic fields. The device creates the illusion that light propagates through empty flat space, whereas in physical space, light is bent around a hidden interior or seems to run backward in space or time. All of the previous proposals for invisibility require materials with extreme properties. Here we show that transformation optics of a curved, non-Euclidean space (such as the surface of a virtual sphere) relax these requirements and can lead to invisibility in a broad band of the spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1985355495,"During 400 million years of existence, insects have rarely succumbed to the evolution of microbial resistance against their potent antimicrobial immune defenses. We found that microbial clearance after infection is extremely fast and that induced antimicrobial activity starts to increase only when most of the bacteria (99.5%) have been removed. Our experiments showed that those bacteria that survived exposure to the insect's constitutive immune response were subsequently more resistant to it. These results imply that induced antimicrobial compounds function primarily to protect the insect against the bacteria that persist within their body, rather than to clear microbial infections. These findings suggest that understanding of the management of antimicrobial peptides in natural systems might inform medical treatment strategies that avoid the risk of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2081314200,"Disruption of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes unfolded proteins to accumulate, triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR outputs in turn decrease ER unfolded proteins to close a negative feedback loop. However, because it is infeasible to directly measure the concentration of unfolded proteins in vivo, cells are generically described as experiencing ""ER stress"" whenever the UPR is active. Because ER redox potential is optimized for oxidative protein folding, we reasoned that measureable redox changes should accompany unfolded protein accumulation. To test this concept, we employed fluorescent protein reporters to dynamically measure ER redox status and UPR activity in single cells. Using these tools, we show that diverse stressors, both experimental and physiological, compromise ER protein oxidation when UPR-imposed homeostatic control is lost. Using genetic analysis we uncovered redox heterogeneities in isogenic cell populations, and revealed functional interlinks between ER protein folding, modification, and quality control systems."
https://openalex.org/W2065770878,"The marine dinoflagellates commonly responsible for toxic red tides are parasitized by other dinoflagellate species. Using culture-independent environmental ribosomal RNA sequences and fluorescence markers, we identified host-specific infections among several species. Each parasitoid produces 60 to 400 offspring, leading to extraordinarily rapid control of the host's population. During 3 consecutive years of observation in a natural estuary, all dinoflagellates observed were chronically infected, and a given host species was infected by a single genetically distinct parasite year after year. Our observations in natural ecosystems suggest that although bloom-forming dinoflagellates may escape control by grazing organisms, they eventually succumb to parasite attack."
https://openalex.org/W2032212746,"With advances in spatial resolution reaching the atomic scale, two-dimensional (2D) and 3D imaging in electron microscopy has become an essential methodology in various fields of study. Here, we report 4D imaging, with in situ spatiotemporal resolutions, in ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM). The ability to capture selected-area-image dynamics with pixel resolution and to control the time separation between pulses for temporal cooling of the specimen made possible studies of fleeting structures and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications with two examples, gold and graphite. For gold, after thermally induced stress, we determined the atomic structural expansion, the nonthermal lattice temperature, and the ultrafast transients of warping/bulging. In contrast, in graphite, striking coherent transients of the structure were observed in both image and diffraction, directly measuring, on the nanoscale, the longitudinal resonance period governed by Young's elastic modulus. The success of these studies demonstrates the promise of UEM in real-space imaging of dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2042559401,"Metabolic regulation in mammals requires communication between multiple organs and tissues. The rise in the incidence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes, has renewed interest in interorgan communication. We used mouse models to explore the mechanism whereby obesity enhances pancreatic β cell mass, pathophysiological compensation for insulin resistance. We found that hepatic activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling induced pancreatic β cell proliferation through a neuronal-mediated relay of metabolic signals. This metabolic relay from the liver to the pancreas is involved in obesity-induced islet expansion. In mouse models of insulin-deficient diabetes, liver-selective activation of ERK signaling increased β cell mass and normalized serum glucose levels. Thus, interorgan metabolic relay systems may serve as valuable targets in regenerative treatments for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2020087564,"Cathepsin K is responsible for the degradation of type I collagen in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Collagen fragments are known to be biologically active in a number of cell types. Here, we investigate their potential to regulate osteoclast activity. Mature murine osteoclasts were seeded on type I collagen for actin ring assays or dentine discs for resorption assays. Cells were treated with cathepsins K-, L-, or MMP-1-predigested type I collagen or soluble bone fragments for 24 h. The presence of actin rings was determined fluorescently by staining for actin. We found that the percentage of osteoclasts displaying actin rings and the area of resorbed dentine decreased significantly on addition of cathepsin K-digested type I collagen or bone fragments, but not with cathepsin L or MMP-1 digests. Counterintuitively, actin ring formation was found to decrease in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor LHVS and in cathepsin K-deficient osteoclasts. However, cathepsin L deficiency or the general MMP inhibitor GM6001 had no effect on the presence of actin rings. Predigestion of the collagen matrix with cathepsin K, but not by cathepsin L or MMP-1 resulted in an increased actin ring presence in cathepsin K-deficient osteoclasts. These studies suggest that cathepsin K interaction with type I collagen is required for 1) the release of cryptic Arg-Gly-Asp motifs during the initial attachment of osteoclasts and 2) termination of resorption via the creation of autocrine signals originating from type I collagen degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1986377088,"Oxidative stress and inflammation are two critical factors that drive the formation of plaques in atherosclerosis. Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that upregulates a battery of antioxidative genes and cytoprotective enzymes that constitute the cellular response to oxidative stress. Our previous studies have shown that disruption of Nrf2 in mice (Nrf2(-/-)) causes increased susceptibility to pulmonary emphysema, asthma and sepsis due to increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Here we have tested the hypothesis that disruption of Nrf2 in mice causes increased atherosclerosis.To investigate the role of Nrf2 in the development of atherosclerosis, we crossed Nrf2(-/-) mice with apoliporotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice. ApoE(-/-) and ApoE(-/-)Nrf2(-/-) mice were fed an atherogenic diet for 20 weeks, and plaque area was assessed in the aortas. Surprisingly, ApoE(-/-)Nrf2(-/-) mice exhibited significantly smaller plaque area than ApoE(-/-) controls (11.5% vs 29.5%). This decrease in plaque area observed in ApoE(-/-)Nrf2(-/-) mice was associated with a significant decrease in uptake of modified low density lipoproteins (AcLDL) by isolated macrophages from ApoE(-/-)Nrf2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, atherosclerotic plaques and isolated macrophages from ApoE(-/-)Nrf2(-/-) mice exhibited decreased expression of the scavenger receptor CD36.Nrf2 is pro-atherogenic in mice, despite its antioxidative function. The net pro-atherogenic effect of Nrf2 may be mediated via positive regulation of CD36. Our data demonstrates that the potential effects of Nrf2-targeted therapies on cardiovascular disease need to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1991703470,"Background This trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of 6% cellulose sulfate vaginal gel in preventing male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydial infection. Methods This Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between November 2004 and March 2007 in Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria. We enrolled 1644 HIV-antibody negative women at high risk of HIV acquisition. Study participants were randomized 1∶1 to cellulose sulfate or placebo and asked to use gel plus a condom for each act of vaginal intercourse over one year of follow-up. The participants were evaluated monthly for HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, and for adverse events. Results The trial was stopped prematurely after the data safety monitoring board of a parallel trial concluded that cellulose sulfate might be increasing the risk of HIV. In contrast, we observed fewer infections in the active arm (10) than on placebo (13), a difference that was nonetheless not statistically significant (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.3–1.8; p = 0.56). Rates of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection were lower in the CS group but the difference was likewise not statistically significant (HR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.5–1.1; p = 0.19 for the combined STI outcome). Rates of adverse events were similar across study arms. No serious adverse events related to cellulose sulfate use were reported. Conclusions Cellulose sulfate gel appeared to be safe in the evaluated study population but we found insufficient evidence that it prevented male-to-female vaginal transmission of HIV, gonorrhea or chlamydial infection. The early closure of the trial compromised the ability to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of cellulose sulfate against HIV. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00120770"
https://openalex.org/W1994526268,"The striking identification of an apparent proteasome core in Mycobacteria and allied actinomycetes suggested that additional elements of this otherwise strictly eukaryotic system for regulated protein degradation might be conserved. The genes encoding this prokaryotic proteasome are clustered in an operon with a short open reading frame that encodes a small protein of 64 amino acids resembling ubiquitin with a carboxyl-terminal di-glycine-glutamine motif (herein called Pup for prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein). Expression of a polyhistidine-tagged Pup followed by pulldown revealed that a broad spectrum of proteins were post-translationally modified by Pup. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis allowed us to conclusively identify two targets of this modification as myoinositol-1-phosphate synthase and superoxide dismutase. Deletion of the penultimate di-glycine motif or the terminal glutamine completely abrogated modification of cellular proteins with Pup. Further mass spectral analysis demonstrated that Pup was attached to a lysine residue on its target protein via the carboxyl-terminal glutamine with deamidation of this residue. Finally, we showed that cell lysates of wild type (but not a proteasome mutant) efficiently degraded Pup-modified proteins. These data therefore establish that, despite differences in both sequence and target linkage, Pup plays an analogous role to ubiquitin in targeting proteins to the proteasome for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1987559164,"Two members of the angiopoietin-like family of proteins, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, have been shown to play important roles in modulating lipoprotein metabolism in the body. Both proteins were found to suppress lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i>. However, their mechanisms of inhibition remained poorly understood. Using enzyme kinetic analysis with purified recombinant proteins, we have found key mechanistic differences between ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4. ANGPTL3 reduced LPL catalytic activity but did not significantly alter its self-inactivation rate. In contrast, ANGPTL4 suppressed LPL by accelerating the irreversible inactivation of LPL. Furthermore, heparin was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3 on LPL but not that of ANGPTL4. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated the critical function of Glu<sup>40</sup> in ANGPTL4. In contrast, when cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation were mutated to serines, ANGPTL4 retained its activity. Taken together, our data provide a more detailed view of the structure and mechanisms of these proteins. The finding that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 inhibit LPL activity through distinct mechanisms indicates that the two proteins play unique roles in modulation of lipid metabolism <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W1967351308,"Autophagy has been shown to contribute to defense against intracellular bacteria and parasites. In comparison, the ability of such pathogens to manipulate host cell autophagy to their advantage has not been examined. Here we present evidence that infection by Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular protozoan parasite, induces host cell autophagy in both HeLa cells and primary fibroblasts, via a mechanism dependent on host Atg5 but independent of host mammalian target of rapamycin suppression. Infection led to the conversion of LC3 to the autophagosome-associated form LC3-II, to the accumulation of LC3-containing vesicles near the parasitophorous vacuole, and to the relocalization toward the vacuole of structures labeled by the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate indicator YFP-2xFYVE. The autophagy regulator beclin 1 was concentrated in the vicinity of the parasitophorous vacuole in infected cells. Inhibitor studies indicated that parasite-induced autophagy is dependent on calcium signaling and on abscisic acid. At physiologically relevant amino acid levels, parasite growth became defective in Atg5-deficient cells, indicating a role for host cell autophagy in parasite recovery of host cell nutrients. A flow cytometric analysis of cell size as a function of parasite content revealed that autophagy-dependent parasite growth correlates with autophagy-dependent consumption of host cell mass that is dependent on parasite progression. These findings indicate a new role for autophagy as a pathway by which parasites may effectively compete with the host cell for limiting anabolic resources."
https://openalex.org/W2072685613,"It is unknown why females mate with multiple males when mating is frequently costly and a single copulation often provides enough sperm to fertilize all a female's eggs. One possibility is that remating increases the fitness of offspring, because fertilization success is biased toward the sperm of high-fitness males. We show that female Drosophila pseudoobscura evolved increased remating rates when exposed to the risk of mating with males carrying a deleterious sex ratio–distorting gene that also reduces sperm competitive ability. Because selfish genetic elements that reduce sperm competitive ability are generally associated with low genetic fitness, they may represent a common driver of the evolution of polyandry."
https://openalex.org/W1976117598,"Detection of foreign RNA by the innate immune system can trigger the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and apoptosis. Important antiviral defense pathways that result in type I IFN production following the recognition of foreign double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) include the RIG-I family helicases and IPS-1 adaptor cytosolic pathway and the Toll-like receptor 3 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF) adaptor membrane-associated pathway, both of which activate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). In addition to triggering an innate immune response, dsRNAs are widely used to mediate gene-selective silencing in mammalian cells by the RNA interference pathway. We investigated the ability of short interfering RNAs, including T7 phage polymerase-synthesized RNA (PRNA), which like some viral RNAs contains a 5′-triphosphate, to selectively silence gene expression and to cause induction of IFN-β and apoptosis. We found that PRNA-mediated gene silencing and associated nonspecific pro-apoptotic and IFN-inducing effects were dependent on the cell line and RNA length. Double-stranded PRNAs 50 nucleotides long as well as polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid activated the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and induced significant levels of IFN-β and apoptosis, whereas shorter PRNAs and chemically synthesized dsRNAs did not. Effector caspase activation and apoptosis following RNA transfection was enhanced by pretreatment with IFN, and removal of the 5′-phosphate from PRNAs decreased induction of both IFN-β and apoptosis. PKR, in addition to IPS-1 and IRF3 but not TRIF, was required for maximal type I IFN-β induction and the induction of apoptosis by both transfected PRNAs and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid.

Both RIG-I and MDA5 possess caspase activation and recruitment domains.

Either short dsRNA molecules or plasmids that express short dsRNAs as hairpins with homology to a target messenger RNA can selectively silence expression of a targeted gene when introduced into mammalian cells by lipid-based transfection (32Fire A.

Although RNAi represents a powerful functional genomics tool and potential therapeutic strategy including for viral infections, nonspecific effects have been described even when short dsRNAs were used to achieve RNAi (13Samuel C.E. Nat. Biotech. 2004; 22: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Robbins M.A. Rossi J.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 250-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Marques J.T. Devosse T.

Such nonspecific responses have the potential to cause misinterpretation of silencing data (13Samuel C.E. Nat. Biotech. 2004; 22: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An important reason that short (∼20 bp) dsRNAs are used to mediate RNAi in mammalian cells is to minimize the activation of the IFN system (3Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar, 33Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, experimental evidence directly linking IFN system components to the nonspecific effects sometimes observed with RNAi technology is limited. Our initial observation of significant nonspecific gene silencing caused by T7 phage polymerase-synthesized siRNAs (PRNAs) in both human (HeLa) and mouse (MEF) cells led us to investigate the potential causes of this effect. We examined PRNA-mediated induction of type I IFN-β and apoptotic responses and the relationship between these processes, together with the specific PRNA characteristics required to induce these effects. We found that PRNAs with sufficient structure to activate PKR, including 50-bp and 50-nucleotide (nt) PRNAs, induced IFN-β and triggered apoptosis, whereas shorter PRNAs and chemically synthesized RNAs did not. The 5′-triphosphate of PRNAs, although required for maximal induction of IFN-β and apoptosis, was not required for PKR activation. Using transient and stable knockdown strategies, we established that in addition to IPS-1 and IRF3, PKR is a key mediator of both type I IFN induction and the induction of apoptosis by both polymerase-synthesized RNAs and pIpC. These results implicate PKR as an important component of the cytosolic sensor-mediated response to dsRNA. Cell Maintenance, Transfection, and Dual Luciferase Assay— HeLa (PKR+), HeLa stably knocked down for PKR expression (PKRkd), MEF, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured as previously described (30Zhang P.

For luciferase construct transfection, cells were seeded into 24-well plates and transfected with 190 ng of pGL3 firefly (Promega) and 10 ng of phRL Renilla (Promega) luciferase plasmid complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) per well. Following transfection with the reporter constructs, transfection complexes with 100 ng of RNA (CsiLUC, PLUC, or pIpC) and Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I were added as indicated. The cells were harvested after 24 h for dual luciferase assay as described by the manufacturer (Promega) using a Victor3 V plate reader model 1420 with injectors (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The values were normalized to four vector control wells (no silencing RNA) distributed throughout each plate (38Bouxsein N.F. McAllister C.S. Ewert K.K. Samuel C.E. Safinya C.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Transfection—The chemically synthesized siRNA targeting firefly luciferase (35Elbashir S.M. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar), CsiLUC20 with the sequence ACUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA and a UU 3′ overhang, was purchased from Dharmacon. The negative control siRNA, CsiNEG1, was purchased from Ambion. T7 RNA polymerase synthesized siRNAs were prepared using the Silencer® siRNA construction kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Single-stranded RNAs and dsRNA were not treated with RNase T1 unless otherwise noted as treated (+T1). For phosphatase treatment, 2 units CIP (New England Biolabs) was used per μg RNA; incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. Gel purification of siRNAs synthesized with T7 polymerase was as described by Ambion. The sequence of the PsiLUC20 was the same as the chemically synthesized CsiLUC20 20-bp siRNA; the sense sequence of the T7 transcribed 50-bp PsiLUC50 was UUACAGAUGCACAUAUCGAGGUGGACAUCACUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGAA. IFN-β Expression—Expression of IFN-β was measured by real time PCR. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with 280 ng (560 ng for stable or transient knockdown experiments) of RNA complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I. RNA was purified at 5 h using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Random-primed reverse transcription was carried out using 500 ng of RNA and SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following primer pairs were used: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward primer GCCTTCCGTGTCCCCACTG and reverse primer CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC; IFN-β, forward primer ACGCCGCATTGACCATCTATG and reverse primer CGGAGGTAACCTGTAAGTCTGT. Real time PCR analyses were performed in duplicate or triplicate with each reverse transcription product, using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and a Bio-Rad MyIQ real time real time PCR machine (3-min hot start followed by 30 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 58 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C, repeated 40 times). IFN-β values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase values. Caspase 3/7 Activation Assays—Effector caspase activation was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells in 96-well plates were analyzed 8 h following RNA transfection as described above using a Victor3 V plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to measure luciferase reporter activity as described (30Zhang P. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8192-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IPS-1, TRIF, IRF3, and PKR Knockdown—The target sequences of the CsiRNAs prepared by Dharmacon with dTdT overhangs for human cell studies were: IPS-1, UAGUUGAUCUCGCGGACGA; TRIF, GACCAGACGCCACUCCAAC; IRF3, CCGCAAAGAAGGGUUGCGU; and PKR, GCAGGGAGUAGUACUUAAAUA. For transient knockdown experiments, HeLa cells in 60-mm dishes at ∼60% confluency were transfected with 50 nm of siRNA with Lipofectamine 2000 on days 1 and 3. On day 2 the cells were reseeded in 60-mm dishes for the second siRNA transfection, and on day 4 the cells were seeded in 24-well plates for RNA transfection on day 5. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared with extract buffer containing protease inhibitors (37Das S. Ward S.V. Tacke R.S. Suske G. Samuel C.E. J. Biol.

The blots were visualized using a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imager system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips in 12-well plates were transfected with 560 ng of RNA complexed with Lipofectamine 2000, fixed at the indicated time following transfection with Accustain 10% formalin solution (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Following PBS washes, the cells were blocked and permeabilized with 3% bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with IRF3 primary antibody (generously provided by M. David, University of California, San Diego) at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then washed and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). The images were captured using an Olympus IX71 microscope with Q-Capture PRO software (QImaging). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HeLa cells, PKR+ or PKRkd, were transfected as indicated and then harvested after 4 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (39Matsukura S. Stellato C. Plitt J.R. Bickel C. Miura K. Georas S.N. Casolaro V. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6876-6883PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in 20 μl of total reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm KCl for 5 min. The 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe with the sense strand sequence AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC was added to the reaction mixture and then incubated for 20 min. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Polymerase-synthesized siRNAs Induce Nonspecific Gene Silencing—Because long dsRNAs are known to induce IFN signaling and activate PKR (1Lampson G.P. Tytell A.A. Field A.K. Nemes M.M. Hilleman M.R.

Biotech. 2004; 22: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we tested the effect on gene silencing selectivity of increasing the length of an siRNA from the commonly utilized 20 bp to 50 bp. A T7 RNA polymerase-based strategy was used to synthesize RNAs including a 20-bp siRNA (PsiLUC20) possessing the same nucleotide sequence as a chemically synthesized 20-bp siRNA (CsiLUC20) and also a 50-bp siRNA (PsiLUC50) that included the 20-bp siRNA sequence along with additional target sequence. The siRNAs targeted the message of a firefly luciferase reporter, whereas Renilla luciferase was used as an internal measure of nonspecific gene silencing. The CsiLUC20 targeting firefly luciferase showed high selectivity and no significant nonspecific gene silencing when tested at 36 nm (100 ng) of siRNA in human HeLa cells (Fig. 1A), hamster CHO cells (Fig. 1B), and mouse (MEF) cells (data not shown). A negative control siRNA, CsiNEG1, did not display any detectable gene-specific silencing and like CsiLUC20 only showed nonspecific gene silencing at very high concentrations, 180 nm (data not shown). In contrast to the selectivity seen with 100 ng of CsiLUC20, surprisingly high nonspecific gene silencing was caused by the same amount (100 ng) of PsiRNA when tested in either HeLa cells (Fig. 1A) or MEFs (data not shown). Furthermore, the 50-bp PsiLUC50 siRNA caused even greater nonspecific gene silencing in these cells than the 20-bp PsiLUC20 siRNA, comparable with pIpC. CHO cells, a rodent cell line where selective RNAi can be mediated by long dsRNA (40Ui-Tei K. Zenno S. Miyata Y. Saigo K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), showed sequence specific silencing for all of the siRNAs tested including PsiLUC50 (Fig. 1B). Polymerase-synthesized Single and Double-stranded RNAs Induce IFN-β—To further explore the cause of nonspecific gene silencing by T7 RNA polymerase-synthesized RNAs (PRNAs), ssRNAs in addition to the PsiLUC dsRNAs were synthesized. The structural integrity of the PRNAs was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. For the dsRNAs that were not treated with T1 RNase prior to gel analysis to remove the 5′-terminal single-stranded sequence and triphosphate moiety, one major RNA population was observed.

We tested BCG (SSI1331) (in 6 animals, delivered intradermally) and a recombinant (rBCG) AFRO-1 expressing perfringolysin (in 6 animals) followed by two boosts (delivered intramuscullary) with non-replicating adenovirus 35 (rAd35) expressing a fusion protein composed of Ag85A, Ag85B and TB10.4, for the capacity to induce antigen-specific cellular immune responses in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Control animals received diluent (3 animals). Methods and Findings Cellular immune responses were analyzed longitudinally (12 blood draws for each animal) using intracellular cytokine staining (TNF-alpha, IL-2 and IFN-gamma), T cell proliferation was measured in CD4+, CD8alpha/beta+, and CD8alpha/alpha+ T cell subsets and IFN-gamma production was tested in 7 day PBMC cultures (whole blood cell assay, WBA) using Ag85A, Ag85B, TB10.4 recombinant proteins, PPD or BCG as stimuli. Animals primed with AFRO-1 showed i) increased Ag85B-specific IFN-gamma production in the WBA assay (median >400 pg/ml for 6 animals) one week after the first boost with adenoviral-delivered TB-antigens as compared to animals primed with BCG (<200 pg/ml), ii) stronger T cell proliferation in the CD8alpha/alpha+ T cell subset (proliferative index 17%) as compared to BCG-primed animals (proliferative index 5% in CD8alpha/alpha+ T cells). Polyfunctional T cells, defined by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2 production were detected in 2/6 animals primed with AFRO-1 directed against Ag85A/b and TB10.4; 4/6 animals primed with BCG showed a Ag85A/b responses, yet only a single animal exhibited Ag85A/b and TB10.4 reactivity. Conclusion AFRO-1 induces qualitatively and quantitatively different cellular immune responses as compared with BCG in rhesus macaques. Increased IFN-gamma-responses and antigen-specific T cell proliferation in the CD8alpha/alpha+ T cell subset represents a valuable marker for vaccine-take in BCG-based TB vaccine trials"

https://openalex.org/W2017481734,"Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent signaling molecule that is essential for many biological processes, and its levels are tightly regulated by mechanisms that are only partially understood. The synthesis of RA from its precursor retinol (vitamin A) is an important regulatory mechanism. Therefore, the esterification of retinol with fatty acyl moieties to generate retinyl esters, the main storage form of retinol, may also regulate RA levels. Here we show that the neutral lipid synthesis enzyme acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) functions as the major acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) in murine skin. When dietary retinol is abundant, DGAT1 deficiency results in elevated levels of RA in skin and cyclical hair loss; both are prevented by dietary retinol deprivation. Further, DGAT1-deficient skin exhibits enhanced sensitivity to topically administered retinol. Deletion of the enzyme specifically in the epidermis causes alopecia, indicating that the regulation of RA homeostasis by DGAT1 is autonomous in the epidermis. These findings show that DGAT1 functions as an ARAT in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity.

Regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation of epithelial tissues is crucial in embryonic development and in adult homeostasis.

Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 451-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Since RA is such a potent signaling molecule, its levels must be tightly controlled. Indeed, excess RA is highly teratogenic during embryonic development and may be toxic to adult tissues (3Azais-Braesco V. Pascal G. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1325S-1333SCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Further, RA is used therapeutically for skin disorders, such as acne and psoriasis, and certain cancers (4Hansen L.A. Sigman C.C. Andreola F. Ross S.A. Kelloff G.J. De Luca L.M. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its uses are often limited by local and systemic toxicity. Thus, understanding how RA levels are regulated has important biological and clinical relevance. The synthesis of RA from its precursor retinol, or vitamin A, is a major node in the regulation of RA levels (5Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To generate RA, retinol is oxidized in two sequential reactions, catalyzed by retinol and retinal dehydrogenases (5Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), whose activities regulate RA homeostasis. We hypothesized that the availability of retinol for these reactions may also be regulated by the balance between retinol and retinyl esters. Indeed, the majority of retinol in the body is stored as retinyl esters, which are concentrated in cytosolic lipid droplets of cells and serve as a local source of retinol. Retinyl esters are also stored in major organs, such as liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), from which retinol can be mobilized to supply other tissues during increased demand. Thus, retinol esterification may participate in regulating the retinol pool available for RA synthesis. Retinol esterification is carried out by two distinct enzymatic activities. One is mediated by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), which catalyzes the covalent joining of a fatty acyl moiety from lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) to retinol that is bound to cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) (6Ong D.E.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12478-12482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LRAT activity is crucial for maintaining tissue retinol stores. LRAT-null (Lrat-/-) mice have severe reductions in hepatic and lung retinyl ester levels (8Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W.

Retinyl ester levels are normal in WAT and several other tissues, indicating alternative mechanisms for retinol esterification (9Liu L. Gudas L.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This esterification is probably mediated in part by acyl CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) enzymes, which use fatty acyl-CoA and unbound retinol as substrates (11Ross A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 133-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although many tissues exhibit ARAT activity (12Torma H. Vahlquist A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 88: 398-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), attempts to purify and clone an ARAT gene were unsuccessful, and thus molecular tools to study ARAT activity have been lacking. However, the enzyme encoded by Dgat1, an acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), was recently reported to catalyze the ARAT reaction in vitro (13Orland M.D. Anwar K. Cromley D. Chu C.H. Chen L. Billheimer J.T. Hussain M.M. Cheng D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Yen C.L. Monetti M. Burri B.J. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1502-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Moreover, several tissues of Dgat1-/- mice had reduced ARAT activity, and retinol esterification was reduced in cultured murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking DGAT1 (14Yen C.L. Monetti M. Burri B.J. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1502-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Most recently, a study of Dgat1-/- mice demonstrated a role for the enzyme in retinol absorption in the small intestine (15Wongsiriroj N. Piantedosi R. Palczewski K. Goldberg I.J. Johnston T.P. Li E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13510-13519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that the retinol esterification activity of DGAT1 is of biological, and possibly clinical, importance. In the current study, we investigated whether retinol esterification by DGAT1 is important in murine skin. Dgat1-/- mice exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype, which includes resistance to diet-induced obesity and altered energy metabolism but also includes prominent phenotypic findings in the skin (16Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 17Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Ladha Z.

Lehmann B. Carlberg C. Varani J. Zouboulis C.C. Horm. Metab. Res. 2007; 39: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and excess retinoids induce epidermal hyperplasia, inhibit sebocyte proliferation and differentiation, and alter hair growth (21Zouboulis C.C. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 2001; 14: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Notably, the skin manifestations of Dgat1-/- mice, which include alopecia and sebaceous gland atrophy (18Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Tow B. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), resemble those of retinoid toxicity (22Berth-Jones J. Hutchinson P.E. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 132: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Clarke S.B. Nelson A.M. George R.E. Thiboutot D.M. Dermatol. Clin. 2007; 25: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that DGAT1 functions as an ARAT in murine skin and that the absence of DGAT1 alters retinoid homeostasis. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining retinoid metabolism in the skin of DGAT1-deficient mice. Mice and Diets—Male Dgat1-/- and wild-type mice (C57BL/6J genetic background) were genotyped as described (16Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility (12-h light/12-h dark cycle) and fed a retinoid-abundant chow diet (5053 Pico-Lab Diet; Purina, St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise specified. For studies in which dietary retinol content was controlled, Dgat1+/- dams were fed a retinoid-deficient diet containing 10 kcal% fat and <0.04 IU retinol/g (D03102201; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) throughout gestation and suckling. The first litters of Dgat1-/- and wild-type offspring were weaned and maintained on the retinoid-deficient diet until 3 weeks before sacrifice, when they were switched to a retinoid-sufficient diet containing 10 kcal% fat and 4 IU retinyl palmitate/g (D12450B; Research Diets). To generate retinoid-deficient mice, the second litters of Dgat1+/- dams fed a retinoid-deficient diet were weaned and maintained on the retinoid-deficient diet until sacrifice. Dgat1flox/flox mice (mixed C57BL/6J and 129/SvJae), generated as described in the supplemental material, were crossed with keratin 14-Cre mice (K14-Cre; mixed Swiss Webster; C57BL/6J; CBA/J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (24Dassule H.R. Lewis P. Bei M. Maas R. McMahon A.P. Development (Cambr.). 2000; 127: 4775-4785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). K14-Cre+DGAT1flox/+ mice were crossed with Dgat1flox/flox mice to generate male K14-Cre+DGAT1flox/+, K14-Cre+DGAT1flox/flox, and Dgat1flox/flox littermates (mixed Swiss Webster; 129/SvJae; C57BL/6J; CBA/J) for studies. All experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Research of the University of California, San Francisco. Genotyping of Cre and Floxed Dgat1 Alleles—Genomic DNA was extracted from tail epidermis (mechanically separated from the dermis after incubation of skin at 37 °C for 45 min) and dermis, WAT, liver, and testes. Cre was detected with sense primer 5′-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3′ (100-bp product); interleukin-2 was detected by sense primer 5′-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC-3′ (324-bp product) and served as an internal PCR control. To identify various alleles of Dgat1, genomic PCR was performed with forward primer 5′-CAGACATGGCAGCAGCAAATG-3′ (in exon 15) and reverse primer 5′-TGCAAGTTGCTGCTGCCACCTG-3′ (in the 3′-untranscribed region). The wild-type Dgat1 allele yields an 895 bp band. The floxed Dgat1 allele yields a 1002 bp band whose absence indicates Cre-mediated recombination of the floxed Dgat1 allele and deletion of exons 14–17. Retinol Esterification Assays—Mouse skin was homogenized with a Tissue Tearor (model 398, probe 9853G-04; Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose) containing proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). ARAT assays were performed with total protein homogenates (100 μg) in an assay mix containing Buffer A, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μm all-trans-retinol (Sigma) in acetone, and 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA (55.0 mCi/mmol). After 10 min at 37 °C, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by silica gel G-60 TLC plates with hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1). Retinyl ester, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol ester bands were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Retinoid Analyses—Retinol, retinyl ester, and all-trans-RA were quantified as described (25Kane M.A. Chen N. Sparks S. Napoli J.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with modifications. Mouse tissue samples were harvested under yellow light and immediately frozen in liquid N2. Tissues were homogenized on ice with ice-cold 0.9% saline to make a ∼25% homogenate. Tissues were homogenized in ground glass vessels (Kontes; size 21) either manually or with a Heidolph motorized homogenizer (at 280 rpm). For skin samples (200–400 mg), a portion (50–100 mg) would not homogenize and was subtracted to obtain tissue mass. Serum was obtained by centrifuging blood at 7000 × g for ∼7 min at 4 °C. Tissue homogenate or serum was added to a disposable glass culture tube (16 × 150 mm), and an internal standard (50–100 nm 4,4-dimethyl-RA in 10 ml of acetonitrile) was added, followed by the addition of 25 mm KOH in ethanol (1 ml for serum, 3 ml for tissue homogenates) and extraction with 10 ml of hexane. The organic phase containing nonpolar retinoids (retinol and retinyl ester) was removed. HCl (4 m, 60–180 ml) was added to the aqueous phase, and polar substances (RA) were removed by extraction with 10 ml of hexane. Organic phases were dried under nitrogen with gentle heating at ∼25–30 °C in a water bath (N-EVAP 112; Organomation Associates, Berlin, MA). Extracts were resuspended in acetonitrile according to analyte (RA in 60 ml, retinol/retinyl ester from liver in 1000 ml; retinol/retinyl ester from all other tissues in 150 ml). Only glass containers, pipettes, and calibrated syringes were used to handle retinoid samples. Real Time PCR—Whole skin was homogenized, and total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy fibrous tissue minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with the Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix kit (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed and analyzed with the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each 20-μl PCR contained 2 μl of cDNA, 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primer. Relative expression levels were calculated by the comparative CT (cycle of threshold detection) method, as outlined in the manufacturer's technical bulletin. Cyclophilin expression served as control. The primers used for reverse transcription-PCR are listed in supplemental Table 1. Topical Retinol Treatments—All-trans-retinol (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol (0.5 nmol/μl, 1 nmol/μl, and 2 nmol/μl), and 50, 100, or 200 nmol was applied topically to the dorsal cephalad skin of shaved mice (n = 3/group). As control, ethanol alone was applied to dorsal caudal skin of the same mice. Four days after treatment, three skin regions from each retinol- and vehicle-treated area were harvested from each mouse. One skin section per region was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed. Epidermal thickness was measured with SPOT advanced imaging software in three areas per skin section (nine measurements/mouse). To assess susceptibility to retinol toxicity, all-trans-retinol was dissolved in ethanol (1 nmol/ml), and 100 nmol was applied topically to dorsal cephalad skin of shaved mice (n = 5/group) daily for 3 consecutive days. As a control, ethanol was applied to dorsal caudal skin of the same mice. Histological Analyses—Whole middorsal skin was removed from wild-type and Dgat1-/- mice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight, and washed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (6 μm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Adhesive Tape Test—A 1 × 1.5-inch piece of adhesive tape (VWR, Batavia, IL) was pressed gently on the nape of the neck of mice and pulled off in the direction of hair growth (toward the tail). The tape was photographed and weighed (before and after stripping). Statistical Analyses—Values are reported as mean ± S.E. Means were compared by t test or analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni or Tukey test. Altered Retinoid Metabolism in Dgat1-/- Skin—To determine if DGAT1 contributes to retinol esterification in skin, we measured ARAT activity in whole skin homogenates of 7-week-old wild-type and Dgat1-/- mice fed a chow diet. ARAT activity was reduced by ∼90% in Dgat1-/- skin (Fig. 1a). DGAT activity was reduced by more than 95%. The activity of a control enzyme, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, which catalyzes cholesterol ester synthesis, was slightly lower in Dgat1-/- skin (Fig. 1a), possibly because of atrophy of sebaceous glands, where acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases are highly expressed (26Meiner V. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Dong L.M. Weisgraber K.H. Novak S. Myers H.M. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the reduced ARAT activity in Dgat1-/- skin altered retinoid homeostasis, we measured retinoid levels in whole skin of wild-type and Dgat1-/- mice fed a formulated, purified diet containing the amount of retinol recommended by the American Institute of Nutrition (i.e. a retinol-sufficient diet). Unesterified retinol was increased by ∼22%, and all-trans-RA was increased by 40% in Dgat1-/- skin (Fig. 1b). Retinyl ester levels were similar, probably reflecting contributions from LRAT activity. Serum retinol (Fig. 1c) and liver retinoid (Fig. 1d) levels were similar in both genotypes of mice, suggesting that the increased all-trans-RA levels in Dgat1-/- skin resulted from local changes in retinoid metabolism. All-trans-RA mediates many biological activities of retinol through transcriptional mechanisms (27Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We therefore examined mRNA levels of two all-trans-RA target genes, CrbpI and cellular RA-binding protein II (CrabpII) (1Balmer J.E. Blomhoff R. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1773-1808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 27Fisher G.J. Voorhees J.J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1002-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), in the synchronized telogen skin of 7-week-old chow-fed Dgat1-/- and wild-type mice. CrbpI mRNA was increased 7-fold and CrabpII mRNA 2-fold in Dgat1-/- skin (Fig. 1e). The mRNA levels of the β-catenin and Vegf (vascular endothelial growth factor) genes, which are hair cycle-regulated genes but not targets of all-trans-RA, were similar in Dgat1-/- and wild-type skin (Fig. 1e). Enhanced Epidermal Hyperplasia in Response to Topical Retinol in Dgat1-/- Mice—To determine whether the biological activity of retinol is enhanced in Dgat1-/- skin, we applied retinol once to dorsal skin of shaved mice and examined the extent of retinoid-induced epidermal hyperplasia 4 days later. Retinol did not exert effects on wild-type skin but induced significant epidermal hyperplasia and increased epidermal thickness in Dgat1-/- skin (Fig. 2, a and b). To determine if Dgat1-/- skin exhibits increased susceptibility to more chronic retinoid toxicity, we applied retinol topically for 3 consecutive days. Dgat1-/- skin exhibited severe irritation characteristic of retinoid toxicity, including erythema, severe skin scaling and cracking, and crusty lesions (28Elias P.M. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1986; 15: 797-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Look J. Landwehr J. Bauer F. Hoffmann A.S. Bluethmann H. LeMotte P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E91-E98PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, retinol caused only mild irritation (erythema and some flaking) in wild-type skin (Fig. 2c). Retinoid Deprivation Prevents Alopecia of Dgat1-/- Mice—Because excess retinoid activity in the skin causes alopecia (29Look J. Landwehr J. Bauer F. Hoffmann A.S. Bluethmann H. LeMotte P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E91-E98PubMed Google Scholar, 30Foitzik K. Spexard T. Nakamura M. Halsner U. Paus R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 1119-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the adult onset alopecia in Dgat1-/- mice (18Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Tow B. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) may be related to increased retinoid activity. To study this, we first examined Dgat1 expression during a depilation-induced, synchronized hair cycle and found that Dgat1 mRNA was detectable in skin and that its levels varied according to cycle stage (supplemental Fig. 1). We next characterized in detail the alopecia phenotype of Dgat1-/- mice. Alopecia appeared first as a prominent bald patch in the dorsal caudal region around 9 weeks of age. The skin within the patch was gray; new hairs emerged a few days later, and the hair regrew by 11 weeks of age (Fig. 3a). However, patchy alopecia in a different location always ensued and persisted in 5–7-month-old mice, which also exhibited generalized hair thinning (Fig. 3b). The cyclic nature of alopecia suggested that excessive hair shedding, not hair cycle arrest, was the primary cause of alopecia in Dgat1-/- mice. To test for excessive hair shedding, an adhesive tape hair removal test (31Hanakawa Y. Matsuyoshi N. Stanley J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 27-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was performed. Before 9 weeks of age, similar amounts of hair were removed by tape in wild-type and Dgat1-/- mice; thereafter, more hairs were removed from Dgat1-/- mice than wild type (Fig. 3, c and d). Microscopy revealed that the hair club ends were intact (not shown), consistent with shedding rather than breakage as the cause of hair loss. We hypothesized that reducing retinoid levels in the skin would prevent excessive hair shedding and alopecia in Dgat1-/- mice. To test this hypothesis, we depleted skin retinoids by inducing postnatal retinoid deficiency, which was achieved by feeding dams a retinoid-deficient diet during gestation to limit prenatal retinol stores in their offspring, followed by postnatal depletion of retinol stores by maintaining the offspring on a retinoid-deficient diet. The retinoid-deficient diet markedly decreased levels of serum retinol and hepatic retinoids in adult wild-type and Dgat1-/- mice (Fig. 1, c and d). In both genotypes, skin retinyl esters were not significantly reduced, but skin retinol content was reduced >50%. With retinol deprivation, skin levels of all-trans-RA were no longer elevated in Dgat1-/- mice (Fig. 1b). Dgat1-/- mice fed the retinoid-deficient diet until 15 weeks of age did not develop alopecia, whereas chow-fed Dgat1-/- controls did after 9 weeks of age (Fig. 4a). When retinoid-depleted Dgat1-/- mice resumed the retinoid-sufficient diet, alopecia developed within a week, and adhesive tape tests revealed excessive hair shedding (Fig. 4b). This was not seen in Dgat1-/- mice maintained on the retinoid-deficient diet. The lack of alopecia in retinoid-depleted mice was accompanied by reduced levels of CrbpI and CrabpII mRNAs (44 and 52%, respectively) in Dgat1-/- skin, indicating reduced retinoid activity (Fig. 4c). Retinoid Deprivation Partially Corrects Altered Hair Cycling in Dgat1-/- Mice—During the first two postnatal (P) murine hair cycles that occur over several months, dorsal skin follicles cycle synchronously (32Muller-Rover S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmuller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5a). Based on the cyclic nature of alopecia in Dgat1-/- mice, we hypothesized that DGAT1 deficiency altered hair cycling. Histological analyses revealed that hair cycling progressed similarly in wild-type and Dgat1-/- follicles from morphogenesis to the first telogen-to-anagen transition (not shown). The appearance of follicles at postnatal days 39 and 41 (P39 and P41) (late first anagen) was also similar (supplemental Fig. 2a). However, at P44, Dgat1-/- follicles were in anagen rather than telogen, suggesting that the first anagen was prolonged (supplemental Fig. 2a). This was confirmed by increased bromodeoxyuridine staining in the bulbs of P44 Dgat1-/- follicles (supplemental Fig. 2b), indicating active proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes (32Muller-Rover S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmuller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Stenn K.S. Paus R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By P50, Dgat1-/- follicles, like those of wild-type mice, had entered telogen (supplemental Fig. 2a). However, Dgat1-/- follicles precociously entered the second anagen. Wild-type mice remained in telogen from P51 to P76, as evidenced by lack of hair growth after shaving, but Dgat1-/- mice exhibited hair growth by P63 (Fig. 5b). Retinoid depletion induced by the retinoid-deficient diet delayed the early onset of the second anagen in Dgat1-/- mice by 5–12 days (Fig. 5c). DGAT1 Deficiency in Epidermal Compartment Causes Alopecia and Alters Retinoid Activity in Skin—The effects of DGAT1 deficiency on retinoid homeostasis in the skin may be due to systemic changes in metabolism or to the loss of the enzyme in the epidermal compartment. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated mice lacking Dgat1 specifically in the epidermis and epidermal appendages, including hair follicles (EP-D1KO mice), by crossing Dgat1flox/flox mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the human keratin 14 promoter (33Gritli-Linde A. Hallberg K. Harfe B.D. Reyahi A. Kannius-Janson M. Nilsson J. Cobourne M.T. Sharpe P.T. McMahon A.P. Linde A. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PCR of DNA from wild-type and EP-D1KO mice demonstrated specific deletion of the floxed Dgat1 allele in the epidermis (Fig. 6a). Dgat1 mRNA levels were undetectable in epidermis of EP-D1KO mice but were not reduced in a control tissue (WAT) (Fig. 6b). EP-D1KO mice developed prominent alopecia as early as 7 weeks (Fig. 6c), whereas control mice did not develop alopecia (Fig. 6c). The earlier development of alopecia in EP-D1KO compared with Dgat1-/- mice may be due to differences in their genetic background. CrbpI and CrabpII mRNA levels in whole skin were ∼4.5- and ∼3-fold higher, respectively, in EP-D1KO mice (Fig. 6d). Thus, deletion of the enzyme in skin was sufficient to cause altered retinoid metabolism and the alopecia phenotype. We show here that DGAT1 functions as an ARAT in murine skin. In mice lacking DGAT1 activity that were fed a retinol-sufficient diet, RA levels were elevated in the skin, as were RAR target genes, consistent with retinoid toxicity. These mice exhibit alopecia that is probably from increased shedding, which in turn may relate to sebaceous gland dysfunction (18Chen H.C. Smith S.J. Tow B. Elias P.M. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lowering retinol level"
https://openalex.org/W2082211743,"The ""Just-in-time Information"" (JIT) librarian consultation service was designed to provide rapid information to answer primary care clinical questions during patient hours. This study evaluated whether information provided by librarians to answer clinical questions positively impacted time, decision-making, cost savings and satisfaction.A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between October 2005 and April 2006. A total of 1,889 questions were sent to the service by 88 participants. The object of the randomization was a clinical question. Each participant had clinical questions randomly allocated to both intervention (librarian information) and control (no librarian information) groups. Participants were trained to send clinical questions via a hand-held device. The impact of the information provided by the service (or not provided by the service), additional resources and time required for both groups was assessed using a survey sent 24 hours after a question was submitted. The average time for JIT librarians to respond to all questions was 13.68 minutes/question (95% CI, 13.38 to 13.98). The average time for participants to respond their control questions was 20.29 minutes/question (95% CI, 18.72 to 21.86). Using an impact assessment scale rating cognitive impact, participants rated 62.9% of information provided to intervention group questions as having a highly positive cognitive impact. They rated 14.8% of their own answers to control question as having a highly positive cognitive impact, 44.9% has having a negative cognitive impact, and 24.8% with no cognitive impact at all. In an exit survey measuring satisfaction, 86% (62/72 responses) of participants scored the service as having a positive impact on care and 72% (52/72) indicated that they would use the service frequently if it were continued.In this study, providing timely information to clinical questions had a highly positive impact on decision-making and a high approval rating from participants. Using a librarian to respond to clinical questions may allow primary care professionals to have more time in their day, thus potentially increasing patient access to care.

https://openalex.org/W2065368077,"In Sri Lanka, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is typically acquired during adulthood with significant associated disease morbidity and mortality. T cells are believed to be important in the control of VZV replication and in the prevention of reactivation. The relationship between viral load, disease severity and cellular immune responses in primary VZV infection has not been well studied.We used IFNgamma ELISpot assays and MHC class II tetramers based on VZV gE and IE63 epitopes, together with quantitative real time PCR assays to compare the frequency and phenotype of specific T cells with virological and clinical outcomes in 34 adult Sri Lankan individuals with primary VZV infection.Viral loads were found to be significantly higher in patients with moderate to severe infection compared to those with mild infection (p<0.001) and were significantly higher in those over 25 years of age (P<0.01). A significant inverse correlation was seen between the viral loads and the ex vivo IFNgamma ELISpot responses of patients (P<0.001, r = -0.85). VZV-specific CD4+ T cells expressed markers of intermediate differentiation and activation.Overall, these data show that increased clinical severity in Sri Lankan adults with primary VZV infection associates with higher viral load and reduced viral specific T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2085076671,"Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases generates beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which accumulate in the brains of individuals affected by Alzheimer disease. Detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRM) rich in cholesterol and sphingolipid, termed lipid rafts, have been implicated in Abeta production. Previously, we and others reported that the four integral subunits of the gamma-secretase associate with DRM. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying DRM association of gamma-secretase subunits. We report that in cultured cells and in brain the gamma-secretase subunits nicastrin and APH-1 undergo S-palmitoylation, the post-translational covalent attachment of the long chain fatty acid palmitate common in lipid raft-associated proteins. By mutagenesis we show that nicastrin is S-palmitoylated at Cys(689), and APH-1 is S-palmitoylated at Cys(182) and Cys(245). S-Palmitoylation-defective nicastrin and APH-1 form stable gamma-secretase complexes when expressed in knock-out fibroblasts lacking wild type subunits, suggesting that S-palmitoylation is not essential for gamma-secretase assembly. Nevertheless, fractionation studies show that S-palmitoylation contributes to DRM association of nicastrin and APH-1. Moreover, pulse-chase analyses reveal that S-palmitoylation is important for nascent polypeptide stability of both proteins. Co-expression of S-palmitoylation-deficient nicastrin and APH-1 in cultured cells neither affects Abeta40, Abeta42, and AICD production, nor intramembrane processing of Notch and N-cadherin. Our findings suggest that S-palmitoylation plays a role in stability and raft localization of nicastrin and APH-1, but does not directly modulate gamma-secretase processing of APP and other substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2142469205,"During its intraerythrocytic asexual reproduction cycle Plasmodium falciparum consumes up to 80% of the host cell hemoglobin, in large excess over its metabolic needs. A model of the homeostasis of falciparum-infected red blood cells suggested an explanation based on the need to reduce the colloid-osmotic pressure within the host cell to prevent its premature lysis. Critical for this hypothesis was that the hemoglobin concentration within the host cell be progressively reduced from the trophozoite stage onwards.The experiments reported here were designed to test this hypothesis by direct measurements of the hemoglobin concentration in live, infected red cells. We developed a novel, non-invasive method to quantify the hemoglobin concentration in single cells, based on Förster resonance energy transfer between hemoglobin molecules and the fluorophore calcein. Fluorescence lifetime imaging allowed the quantitative mapping of the hemoglobin concentration within the cells. The average fluorescence lifetimes of uninfected cohorts was 270+/-30 ps (mean+/-SD; N = 45). In the cytoplasm of infected cells the fluorescence lifetime of calcein ranged from 290+/-20 ps for cells with ring stage parasites to 590+/-13 ps and 1050+/-60 ps for cells with young trophozoites and late stage trophozoite/early schizonts, respectively. This was equivalent to reductions in hemoglobin concentration spanning the range from 7.3 to 2.3 mM, in line with the model predictions. An unexpected ancillary finding was the existence of a microdomain under the host cell membrane with reduced calcein quenching by hemoglobin in cells with mature trophozoite stage parasites.The results support the predictions of the colloid-osmotic hypothesis and provide a better understanding of the homeostasis of malaria-infected red cells. In addition, they revealed the existence of a distinct peripheral microdomain in the host cell with limited access to hemoglobin molecules indicating the concentration of substantial amounts of parasite-exported material."
https://openalex.org/W2158100814,"Object recognition is achieved through neural mechanisms reliant on the activity of distributed coordinated neural assemblies. In the initial steps of this process, an object's features are thought to be coded very rapidly in distinct neural assemblies. These features play different functional roles in the recognition process - while colour facilitates recognition, additional contours and edges delay it. Here, we selectively varied the amount and role of object features in an entry-level categorization paradigm and related them to the electrical activity of the human brain. We found that early synchronizations (approx. 100 ms) increased quantitatively when more image features had to be coded, without reflecting their qualitative contribution to the recognition process. Later activity (approx. 200–400 ms) was modulated by the representational role of object features. These findings demonstrate that although early synchronizations may be sufficient for relatively crude discrimination of objects in visual scenes, they cannot support entry-level categorization. This was subserved by later processes of object model selection, which utilized the representational value of object features such as colour or edges to select the appropriate model and achieve identification."
https://openalex.org/W2162702728,"The ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway is a proteolytic system conserved in yeast and mammals in which an uncleavable ubiquitin moiety linked to the N terminus of a protein functions as a degradation signal of the fusion protein.

Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays an important role in various cellular events, such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to a target protein involves an enzyme cascade.

The ubiquitin is then transferred to a specific sulfhydryl group on a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). A ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) transfers the activated ubiquitin from E2 to a lysine residue of a bound substrate, forming an isopeptide bond. Substrate specificity is determined primarily by E3, which binds both the protein substrate and the cognate E2. Once the multiubiquitin chain is assembled on a protein substrate, the target protein is recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). E3 enzymes are classified into two main families: HECT (homologous to E6AP C terminus) domain E3s and RING (really interesting new gene) domain E3s (2Pickart C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Members of the HECT family contain a diverse N-terminal region and a conserved C-terminal HECT domain, which has a reactive Cys residue. HECT E3s form a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin at the conserved Cys residue before transfer of ubiquitin to substrates (4Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), whereas RING E3s do not form a covalent bond with ubiquitin. Recent studies have shown that different HECT E3s utilize distinct mechanisms for the synthesis of the polyubiquitin chain (5Wang M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, E6AP assembles a ubiquitin chain on the Cys residue of the HECT domain, whereas KIAA10 builds a ubiquitin chain as a free entity. The ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway is a proteolytic system in which an uncleavable ubiquitin moiety linked to the N terminus of a protein functions as a degradation signal for the fusion protein (6Johnson E.S.

Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of UFD substrates is initiated by the HECT domain E3 UFD4 in conjunction with E1 and E2. Polyubiquitin chain formation additionally requires UFD2, which extends ubiquitin chains on UFD substrates. Although the UFD pathway is conserved in yeast and mammalian cells (8Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), the human E3 has not been characterized. Sequence similarity search with yeast UFD4 against a protein sequence data base picks up TRIP12 (thyroid hormone-interacting protein 12) as a probable human homologue of yeast UFD4, with the highest similarity occurring in the HECT domain. In this study, we showed that TRIP12 is the E3 enzyme responsible for the UFD pathway in human cells. We also demonstrated that the HECT domain of TRIP12 ubiquitinates UFD substrates by recognizing the ubiquitin moiety of the substrates and that the C-terminal extension fused to the uncleavable ubiquitin is not required for recognition. Our data indicate that the TRIP12 HECT domain is unique in that the HECT domain can conjugate ubiquitin to noncovalently bound ubiquitin. Plasmids—Full-length human TRIP12 cDNA (accession number D28476) and UFD2a cDNA (NM_006048) were obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pYR vectors (9Min K.W.

Full-length human E6AP cDNA (BC002582) was obtained from Incyte Genomics Inc. DNA fragments corresponding to the TRIP12 HECT domain (residues 1602–2003) and the E6AP HECT domain (residues 495–852) were amplified by PCR with appropriate primers and subcloned into expression vectors. The TRIP12 HECT C1972S mutant with a cysteine to serine substitution at the conserved cysteine was generated by introducing point mutations using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UbG76V-GFP and Ub-R-GFP expression constructs were previously described (8Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The UBB+1 expression construct was kindly provided by Y. G. Chung (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea). Transfection and Western Blotting—Transfection was performed using the polyethyleneimine methodology (10Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). After 36 h, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40. Proteins in cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman), and visualized by Western blotting with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blotting, we purchased commercial antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), GAPDH (Chemicon), and GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). RNA Interference—The TRIP12-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (TRIP12-1 for the target sequence 5′-GCA CUU CAG CAU ACU GAA U-3′ and TRIP12-2 for the sequence 5′-AGU ACU CAC CUC CAA GAG A-3′) and control scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (5′-CCU ACG CCA CCA AUU UGG U-3′) were chemically synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen and knockdown). After 72 h, the cells were harvested and knockdown of target genes was assessed by Western blotting. Lentivirus-mediated TRIP12 RNA Interference—To establish HeLa cell lines with stable knockdown of TRIP12, a set of pLKO.1 vectors containing stem-loop cassettes encoding shRNAs targeted to human TRIP12 (TRCN 22374, TRCN 22375, TRCN 22376, TRCN 22377, and TRCN 22378) and pKLO.1-puro control vector, which does not contain an shRNA insert, were purchased from Sigma (MISSION TRC-Hs 1.0 shRNA library). Vectors were expanded in competent Escherichia coli (TOP10 cells; Invitrogen) and purified using the Maxiprep kit (Qiagen). To generate lentiviral particles, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cotransfected with the lentiviral vector along with a compatible packaging plasmid mixture (Virapower lentiviral packaging system; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa cells were exposed to lentivirus-containing supernatant for 16 h in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After infection, cells were selected in the presence of puromycin (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Stable transfectants were tested for suppression of TRIP12 expression. The two cell lines with the most efficient knockdown were chosen for subsequent experiments. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—His6-tagged yeast Uba1, human UbcH5a, human ubiquitin, and UbG76V-GFP were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-agarose beads (Qiagen). They were further purified by Mono Q column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). GST-tagged UbΔGG was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-tagged human TRIP12, TRIP12 HECT, TRIP12 HECT (C1972S), E6AP HECT, and human UFD2a were subcloned into a baculovirus expression vector, pFastBac (Invitrogen), and expressed in Sf21 cells. Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in TNM-FH (Sigma) with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Sixty hours after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by applying the supernatant onto a FLAG-M2-agarose column (Sigma) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After extensive washing of the column with the lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with the lysis buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—The ubiquitination assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 800 ng of ubiquitin, 100 ng of Uba1, 250 ng of UbcH5a, 300 ng of UbG76V-GFP, and the indicated amounts of TRIP12 or E6AP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. In Vivo Cross-linking with Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP)—Transfected cells were washed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 0.67 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) three times, and DSP (Pierce) dissolved in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were gently swirled for 30 min at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were adjusted to 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody resin (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation, and the resin was washed extensively with the binding buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Viability Assay and Hoechst Staining for Apoptosis Quantification—Cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric procedure with Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Equal numbers of SH-SY5Y cells (104 cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 72 h, 10 μl of Cell Counting Kit-8 solution was added to each well, and the plates were further incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined by scanning with a microplate reader at 450 nm. For Hoechst staining, cells were fixed with 3.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, cells were stained for 2 min with Hoechst 33258 (20 ng/ml in PBS). After rinsing three times with PBS, apoptotic cells were detected with a fluorescence microscope from Zeiss (Jena, Germany). The results were subjected to statistical analysis. Knockdown of TRIP12 Stabilizes UFD Substrates—To investigate the role of TRIP12 in the UFD pathway in human cells, expression of TRIP12 was transiently blocked by transfection of TRIP12-specific siRNAs into HeLa cells, and the stability of the UFD substrate was evaluated. The efficacy of siRNA-mediated TRIP12 knockdown was determined by Western blot analysis following sequential transfection of TRIP12 siRNAs and the TRIP12 expression construct. As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of FLAG-TRIP12 was greatly reduced by TRIP12-specific siRNAs but not by scrambled siRNA, indicating that depletion of TRIP12 by siRNA was efficient and specific. We then examined whether the expression of UbG76V-GFP and Ub-P-GFP, model substrates of the UFD pathway (8Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), was affected when TRIP12 expression was knocked down. The expression levels of UbG76V-GFP and Ub-P-GFP were much higher in TRIP12 knockdown cells than in control knockdown cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the expression of GFP or Ub-R-GFP, a well defined N-end rule substrate (8Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), was not affected by knockdown of TRIP12 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that TRIP12 was specifically involved in the UFD pathway. To examine whether the protein stability of the UFD substrate was affected by TRIP12 knockdown, we generated HeLa cell lines with stable knockdown of TRIP12. UbG76V-GFP was expressed in control and TRIP12 knockdown cells, and its levels were monitored after inhibiting new protein synthesis with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 1C, UbG76V-GFP was significantly stabilized in TRIP12 knockdown cells compared with control knockdown cells, whereas the stability of Ub-R-GFP was not affected by TRIP12 knockdown. Taken together with the sequence homology of TRIP12 to UFD4, these data suggest that TRIP12 is the human E3 ubiquitin ligase of the UFD pathway. The human genome contains two genes, UFD2a and UFD2b, homologous to yeast UFD2, the E4 enzyme in yeast UFD pathway. To examine whether human UFD2a and human UFD2b are involved in the UFD pathway in human cells, their expression was knocked down by siRNA treatment, and the protein stability of the UFD substrate was analyzed. Quantitative real time PCR analysis of human UFD2a and human UFD2b expression following siRNA treatments revealed that human UFD2a and human UFD2b mRNA levels were greatly reduced by human UFD2-specific siRNAs (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1E, knockdown of human UFD2a and human UFD2b significantly stabilized UbG76V-GFP, suggesting that E4 activity is also required in human UFD pathway. The TRIP12 HECT Domain Can Reverse Suppression of the UFD Pathway in TRIP12 Knockdown Cells—In one of the stable knockdown cell lines (named shTRIP12-1), short hairpin RNA was targeted against the 3′-untranslated region of TRIP12 mRNA. In shTRIP12-1 cells, endogenous TRIP12 expression was suppressed, but TRIP12 expression derived from transfected plasmids was not affected, since the expression plasmids did not contain the untranslated region. To confirm that the increase in UbG76V-GFP expression in TRIP12 knockdown cells was due to the suppression of TRIP12 expression, we transfected shTRIP12-1 cells with a TRIP12 expression construct. Expression of TRIP12 efficiently lowered UbG76V-GFP expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A), indicating that knockdown of TRIP12 expression was responsible for the increased UbG76V-GFP level. To show that TRIP12-mediated degradation of UbG76V-GFP was dependent on the proteasome activity, TRIP12 complementation experiments with shTRIP12-1 cells were performed in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. The inhibition of proteasome by MG132 greatly enhanced the UbG76V-GFP level not only in control cells but in shTRIP12-1 cells complemented with TRIP12 (Fig. 2A), indicating that TRIP12-dependent UbG76V-GFP degradation requires the proteasome activity. In HECT domain E3s, the C-terminal HECT domain interacts with charged E2, whereas the N-terminal portion recognizes the substrate. To address the function of the N-terminal part of TRIP12 in UFD substrate recognition, we transfected TRIP12 knockdown cells with a construct designed to express the TRIP12 HECT domain only. Remarkably, the level of UbG76V-GFP was decreased by the TRIP12 HECT domain in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the E6AP HECT domain or TRIP12 HECT domain with a cysteine to serine mutation at the conserved cysteine did not alter UbG76V-GFP expression (Fig. 2B), indicating that the catalytically active HECT domain of TRIP12 was specifically required for reduction of UbG76V-GFP expression. We then examined whether the TRIP12 HECT domain affected UbG76V-GFP at the level of protein stability. As shown in Fig. 2C, UbG76V-GFP was destabilized by the wild-type TRIP12 HECT domain but not by the catalytically inactive mutant form. Taken together, these results suggest that the TRIP12 HECT domain recognizes the UFD substrate and that the N-terminal domain is largely dispensable for chain assembly. UBB+1 Is a Substrate for TRIP12—UBB+1 is a mutant ubiquitin derived from a dinucleotide deletion in the mRNA of the ubiquitin B gene (11van Leeuwen F.W. de Kleijn D.P. van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A. Sluijs J.A. Koycu S. Ramdjielal R.D. Salehi A. Martens G.J. Grosveld F.G. Peter J. Burbach H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). UBB+1 accumulates in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease. Although high level expression of UBB+1 inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome system, UBB+1 at low expression levels is efficiently degraded by the proteasome (12van Tijn P. de Vrij F.M. Schuurman K.G. Dantuma N.P. Fischer D.F. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 120: 1615-1623Google Scholar). UBB+1 bears an N-terminal uncleavable ubiquitin moiety linked to a C-terminal extension, and the ubiquitination pattern of UBB+1 is similar to that of UFD substrates. Thus, UBB+1 has been considered a UFD substrate despite a lack of information on its E3 ligase (13Lindsten K. de Vrij F.M. Verhoef L.G. Fischer D.F. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To examine whether TRIP12 is the ubiquitin ligase for UBB+1, we transfected TRIP12 knockdown cells with the expression construct for FLAG-UBB+1 and analyzed the stability of FLAG-UBB+1 after cycloheximide blockade of protein synthesis. Stability of the UBB+1 protein was significantly increased in TRIP12 knockdown cells compared with control knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TRIP12 knockdown did not affect the stability of UBB+1/K29R/K48R, a mutant form of UBB+1 on which ubiquitination was virtually blocked. These data indicate that UBB+1 is indeed a UFD substrate ubiquitinated by TRIP12. To test whether the TRIP12 HECT domain alone could affect stability of UBB+1, we transfected TRIP12 knockdown cells with the expression constructs for the TRIP12 HECT domain and FLAG-UBB+1. As shown in Fig. 3B, FLAG-UBB+1 was destabilized by the TRIP12 HECT domain. These results demonstrate that the HECT domain of TRIP12 recognizes and ubiquitinates UBB+1. Knockdown of TRIP12 Reduces UBB+1-induced Cell Death in Human Neuroblastoma Cells—Previous studies have shown that high level expression of UBB+1 impairs the proteasome and causes apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (14de Vrij F.M. Sluijs J.A. Gregori L. Fischer D.F. Hermens W.T. Goldgaber D. Verhaagen J. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2680-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the proteasome has been found to be dependent on ubiquitination of UBB+1 on Lys29 and Lys48 (13Lindsten K. de Vrij F.M. Verhoef L.G. Fischer D.F. van Leeuwen F.W. Hol E.M. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of TRIP12 in UBB+1-induced cell death in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we analyzed the extent of cell viability and apoptosis by UBB+1 overexpression following TRIP12 knockdown. The reduction in TRIP12 expression by siRNA was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, expression of UBB+1 reduced the viability of scrambled siRNA-treated cells to 50% compared with control transfection with empty vector. However, the UBB+1 mutant lacking both Lys29 and Lys48 did not significantly decrease cell viability, suggesting that ubiquitination of UBB+1 is required for cytotoxicity. In contrast to control knockdown cells, UBB+1 expression caused only a minor reduction (10%) in the viability of TRIP12 knockdown cells. UBB+1-induced apoptosis was also assessed by Hoechst staining. The number of apoptotic cells following UBB expression was dramatically reduced in TRIP12 knockdown cells compared with control knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that TRIP12 functions in ubiquitination of UBB+1, which is a prerequisite for UBB+1-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. TRIP12 Is an E3 Ligase for UbΔGG—It is well established that an uncleavable ubiquitin moiety at the N terminus destabilizes the fusion protein. However, it is unclear if the nonconjugatable form of ubiquitin serves as a degradation signal independently of a C-terminal extension fused to the uncleavable ubiquitin. UbΔGG, a mutant ubiquitin lacking the two C-terminal glycine residues, cannot be conjugated to other proteins but can be ubiquitinated to generate an unanchored ubiquitin chain in the cell (15Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several E2 and E3 enzymes are capable of synthesizing unanchored polyubiquitin from free ubiquitin in vitro (5Wang M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the enzymes responsible for producing UbΔGG-terminated polyubiquitin chains in the cell have not been identified. To investigate whether UbΔGG could serve as a substrate for TRIP12, we analyzed the protein stability of UbΔGG following TRIP12 knockdown. As shown in Fig. 5A, knockdown of TRIP12 greatly stabilized FLAG-UbΔGG, suggesting that TRIP12 was the major ubiquitin ligase for FLAG-UbΔGG. We then examined whether the TRIP12 HECT domain alone could destabilize FLAG-UbΔGG by transfecting TRIP12 knockdown cells with the expression constructs for the TRIP12 HECT domain and FLAG-UbΔGG. Expression of FLAG-UbΔGG was lowered by the TRIP12 HECT domain but not by the catalytically inactive mutant form (Fig. 5B). The reduction of FLAG-UbΔGG by the TRIP12 HECT domain was due to the decreased protein stability of FLAG-UbΔGG (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results indicate that the TRIP12 HECT domain recognizes the nonconjugatable ubiquitin moiety of UFD substrates and that the C-terminal extension fused to the uncleavable ubiquitin is not required for degradation of the fusion protein. In Vitro Ubiquitination of UFD Substrates by TRIP12—To analyze TRIP12-catalyzed ubiquitination of UFD substrates directly, we set up an in vitro ubiquitination assay with recombinant proteins, which were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6A shows staining patterns of the SDS-PAGE-resolved purified components used in ubiquitination of UbG76V-GFP. The E1 enzyme Uba1, the E2 enzyme UbcH5a, and the E3 enzyme TRIP12 were incubated with UbG76V-GFP in the presence of ATP and ubiquitin. Ubiquitinated UbG76V-GFP was then monitored by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 6B, ubiquitination of UbG76V-GFP required all three enzymes, confirming that TRIP12 is the human E3 ubiquitin ligase of the UFD pathway. However, the major products of the ubiquitination reaction contained only one or two ubiquitin moieties. In the yeast UFD pathway, the E3 enzyme UFD4 is capable of ligating only a few ubiquitin molecules to the substrate, and polyubiquitination of the substrate additionally requires the E4 enzyme UFD2 (7Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether E4 activity similarly affects ubiquitination initiated by TRIP12. Although human UFD2a could not ligate ubiquitin to the substrate in the absence of TRIP12, it directed synthesis of long polyubiquitin chains together with E1, E2, and TRIP12 (Fig. 6C). TRIP12-catalyzed ubiquitination appeared to be stimulated by human UFD2a, since the level of unreacted UbG76V-GFP was dramatically decreased by increasing amounts of human UFD2a. We next asked whether the TRIP12 HECT domain could ligate ubiquitin to the UFD substrate. As shown in Fig. 6D, UbG76V-GFP was modified with one or two ubiquitin molecules by the TRIP12 HECT domain in the presence of E1 and E2 and polyubiquitinated by the addition of human UFD2a to the reaction. In contrast, the E6AP HECT domain or the TRIP12 HECT domain with a cysteine to serine mutation at the conserved cysteine did not modify UbG76V-GFP (Fig. 6D, lanes 9–12). These results demonstrate that the HECT domain of TRIP12 can recognize and ubiquitinate UbG76V-GFP and that polyubiquitination of the UFD substrate requires E4 activity. To test whether UbΔGG can be ubiquitinated in vitro by the TRIP12 HECT domain, GST-UbΔGG was used as a substrate for the ubiquitination reaction. As shown in Fig. 6E, GST-UbΔGG was ubiquitinated by the TRIP12 HECT domain, and polyubiquitinated products were formed by the addition of human UFD2a to the reaction. These results confirm that the degradation signal is the nonconjugatable ubiquitin moiety of the UFD substrate, which is recognized by the HECT domain of the human UFD E3 ligase, TRIP12. In Vivo Cross-linking of the TRIP12 HECT Domain to UFD Substrates—The direct interaction between TRIP12 and UFD substrates was tested in HeLa cells by co-immunoprecipitation methods. However, we did not observe coprecipitation of TRIP12 with the substrate, probably because the enzyme-substrate interaction was transient. To detect TRIP12 binding to the substrate in cells, we performed chemical cross-linking using DSP, a thiol-cleavable and membrane-permeable cross-linker. HeLa cells were transfected with the expression constructs for UbG76V-GFP and FLAG-tagged HECT domain of TRIP12 or E6AP. Transfected cells were incubated with DSP in phosphate-buffered saline. The cross-linked enzyme-substrate complex was purified by immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, treatment with DSP yielded a major cross-linked product with an apparent molecular mass of 85 kDa from cells transfected with both UbG76V-GFP and TRIP12 HECT (lanes 6 and 12) but not from cells transfected with UbG76V-GFP (lanes 4 and 10) or TRIP12 HECT (lanes 5 and 11) alone. The cross-linked product was not observed without DSP treatment (lane 3) or after cleavage of the cross-linker with β-mercaptoethanol (lanes 9 and 15). In contrast to the TRIP12 HECT domain, the E6AP HECT domain did not produce cross-linked species with UbG76V-GFP (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the TRIP12 HECT domain specifically interacts with the UFD substrate. To investigate whether the ubiquitin moiety is involved in cross-linking with the TRIP12 HECT domain, we performed cross-linking experiments with cells transfected with HA-UbΔGG and FLAG-tagged HECT domain of TRIP12 or E6AP. The TRIP12 HECT domain, but not the E6AP HECT, was cross-linked to HA-UbΔGG (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these data suggest that the ubiquitin moiety of UFD substrates is directly cross-linked to the TRIP12 HECT domain. Substrate binding to HECT E3s involves a complementary interaction between binding motifs in the cognate substrate and the N-terminal region of the E3. For instance, the WW domain in the N-terminal region of Nedd4 interacts with PPXY motifs in substrates (18Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In this study, we have provided an exception to the requirement of the N-terminal portion of E3 for substrate recognition. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that the HECT domain of TRIP12 noncovalently binds the ubiquitin moiety of UFD substrates. We found that the TRIP12 HECT domain alone can catalyze in vitro ubiquitination of UFD substrates, such as UbG76V-GFP, UBB+1, and UbΔGG (Fig. 6) (data not shown). Complementation of TRIP12 knockdown cells with the TRIP12 HECT domain mostly restores efficient degradation of these UFD substrates (Figs. 2, 3, and 5), showing that the TRIP12 HECT domain can act as the E3 enzyme for UFD substrates in human cells. Moreover, we have shown that the ubiquitin moiety of UFD substrates is specifically cross-linked to the TRIP12 HECT domain (Fig. 7). The N-terminal region of TRIP12 contains armadillo repeats and a WWE domain, both of which are presumed to mediate protein-protein interactions (20Coates J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 463-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 26: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the armadillo repeats of yeast UFD4 recognize the N-terminal ubiquitin of UFD substrates and are essential for ubiquitination (22Ju D. Wang X. Xu H. Xie Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the armadillo repeats of TRIP12 are involved in ubiquitination of UFD substrates, our data clearly show that the TRIP12 HECT domain plays the major role in ubiquitin conjugation to UFD substrates, including recognition of those substrates. Additionally, while the armadillo repeats of yeast UFD4 are found to distinguish ubiquitin fusion proteins from free ubiquitin (22Ju D. Wang X. Xu H. Xie Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the HECT domain of TRIP12 binds UbΔGG as a substrate (Figs. 5, 6, 7), indicating that the degradation signal recognized by TRIP12 is the nonconjugatable ubiquitin itself, not the ubiquitin fusion with a C-terminal tail. It has been shown that the N-terminal region of yeast UFD4 interacts with RPT4 and RPT6 subunits of the proteasome and that a deletion mutant UFD4 lacking the proteasome interacting region can still support ubiquitination of substrates but not their degradation by the proteasome (23Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that UFD substrates are ubiquitinated and destabilized by human TRIP12 HECT domain alone. Furthermore, we have not been able to detect clear interaction of TRIP12 with proteasomal ATPase subunits (data not shown). Thus, human TRIP12 and yeast UFD4 appear to employ different mechanisms for ubiquitination and degradation of their UFD substrates. The UFD pathway is conserved from yeast to mammals (8Dantuma N.P. Lindsten K. Glas R. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the pathway would play an important role in eukaryotic cells. Since the pathway was first defined using artificial substrates, considerable work on the UFD pathway has been done with artificial substrates. Remarkably, UBB+1 is the one and only physiological substrate of the UFD pathway known to date. We have found that TRIP12 is the E3 for UBB+1. Although N-terminally tagged UBB+1 was used for the ubiquitination and degradation experiments shown in Fig. 3, we have observed similar results with C-terminally tagged UBB+1, excluding the trivial possibility that the N-terminal FLAG tag gets cleaved off by TRIP12, mimicking degradation of UBB+1. In addition, we have shown that knockdown of TRIP12 reduces UBB+1-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 4). Hence, one biological function of TRIP12 appears to remove the mutant ubiquitin, which could be made toxic to cells by TRIP12 itself. Although TRIP12 acts as the E3 for the UFD pathway, it is unlikely that its function is restricted to that pathway alone. Preliminary data suggest that TRIP12 ubiquitinates cellular proteins. 3Y. Park, S. K. Yoon, and J.-B. Yoon, unpublished data. Although the N-terminal region of TRIP12 plays a minor role, if any, in ubiquitination of UFD substrates, we expect that interaction motifs in the N-terminal region recognize the degradation signals in physiological substrates other than UFD substrates. Studies are in progress to test these hypothesized interactions. Several E2 and E3 enzymes can catalyze the assembly of unanchored polyubiquitin chains in vitro. In addition to the activated ubiquitin molecule linked to the active site cysteine, these enzymes noncovalently bind a second ubiquitin molecule at a separate binding site. These enzymes might ubiquitinate UFD substrates, at least in vitro, provided that the C-terminal region of the substrate does not sterically hinder the interaction with the noncovalent ubiquitin binding site of the enzyme. E2 enzymes E2-25K and the Ubc13-UEV heterodimer catalyze the synthesis of Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in vitro, respectively (16Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the Ubc13-UEV heterodimer, the UEV protein binds an acceptor ubiquitin noncovalently, Lys63 of which then attacks a donor ubiquitin covalently linked to Ubc13 through a thioester bond (24VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N.M. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Recent studies using an in vitro ubiquitination system have shown that ubiquitin chain synthesis by Ubc13-UEV is greatly enhanced by the E3 TRAF6 (26Petroski M.D. Zhou X. Dong G. Daniel-Issakani S. Payan D.G. Huang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29936-279945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the synthesis of free polyubiquitin chains by Ubc13-UEV in vivo is normally held in check unless stimulated by cognate E3s, to avoid unnecessary wasting of energy in the cell. KIAA10 is a recently characterized HECT E3 that directs in vitro synthesis of unanchored polyubiquitin chains linked through Lys29 or Lys48 (27You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). KIAA10 possesses a noncovalent ubiquitin-binding site in its C-terminal domain composed of the HECT domain plus a 60-residue N-terminal extension. Because the KIAA10 C-terminal domain noncovalently binds ubiquitin as an acceptor for ubiquitin transfer, it can build up ubiquitin chains as free entities (5Wang M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although KIAA10 catalyzes ubiquitination of UbΔGG, it is unknown whether KIAA10 can recognize and ubiquitinate other UFD substrates. Even if KIAA10 (or any other E3 with a noncovalent ubiquitin binding site) ubiquitinates UFD substrates in vitro, its contribution to the UFD pathway in the cell is likely to be minor compared with that of TRIP12, since suppression of TRIP12 expression greatly reduced degradation of the UFD substrates. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the TRIP12 HECT domain can recognize UFD substrates and catalyze their ubiquitination. We also showed that the degradation signal recognized by TRIP12 is the nonconjugatable ubiquitin itself. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of the mammalian UFD pathway and the functional nonequivalence of different HECT domains."

The small protein profilin not only helps to maintain a cytoplasmic pool of actin monomers ready to elongate actin filament barbed ends (2Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct.. 2000; 29: 545-576Google Scholar), but it also binds to type II poly-l-proline helices (3Tuderman L. Kuutti E.-R. Kivirkko K. Eur. J.

Formins are multidomain proteins that nucleate and assemble unbranched actin filaments (12Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2007; 76: 593-627Google Scholar). Formin FH2 domains form homodimers that can associate processively with the barbed ends of growing actin filaments (13Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C.

Most formin proteins have an FH1 domain linked to the FH2 domain. Binding profilin-actin to multiple polyproline sites in an FH1 domain concentrates actin near the barbed end of an actin filament associated with a formin FH2 homodimer. Actin transfers very rapidly from the FH1 domains onto the filament end (16Vavylonis D. Kovar D.R. O'Shaughnessy B. Pollard T.D. Mol.

The failure of expression of Hs profilin-I to complement the cdc3-124 mutation prompted us to compare human and fission yeast profilins more carefully. We report here a surprising incompatibility of Hs profilin-I with fission yeast formin Cdc12p, a crystal structure of fission yeast profilin, which allowed a detailed comparison with Hs profilin, and mutations that revealed how overexpression of Hs profilin-I compromises the viability of wild-type fission yeast. Strains, Media, and Chemicals—Kathleen Gould of Vanderbilt University provided strains of S. pombe: KYG491, a haploid temperature-sensitive strain with a point mutation in the S. pombe profilin gene (cdc3-124 ade6-216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 h+) and KGY247, a matching wild-type haploid strain (cdc3+ ade6-216 ura4-D18 leu1-32 h+). We purchased Edinburgh minimal medium and malt extract media from Bio-101 (Carlsbad, CA), etheno-ATP from Invitrogen, Latrunculin B from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), poly-l-proline (Mr 5,000), phloxin-B, thiamine, and nucleotides were from Sigma. We made the poly-l-proline affinity column (18Kaiser D.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Levine B.A. Pollard T.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 1989; 14: 251-262Google Scholar). Human Profilin Expression in Wild-type and Profilin Temperature-sensitive Strains of S. pombe—We transformed wild-type and profilin temperature-sensitive cdc3-124 strains of S. pombe by electroporation with pREP plasmids carrying Hs profilin-I cDNAs under the control of thiamine-repressible nmt1+ promoters. We grew transformed cells at 25 or 36 °C on plates with selective media with 5 mm thiamine to suppress expression or without thiamine to allow expression. Cells were stained with Hoechst dye for fluorescence microscopy. Protein Purification—We mutated residues of Hs profilin-I on a modified pMW plasmid (19Almo S.C. Pollard T.D. Way M. Lattman E.E. J.

After refolding profilin during dialysis against 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm DTT, pH 8.0, produced purified profilin. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed versus the same buffer in 5–7,000 Mr cut-off tubing and flash frozen. Calcium-ATP actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Google Scholar) and purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in G buffer (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0). Polymerized actin was labeled on Cys374 with pyrenyl iodoacetamide and monomers were purified by gel filtration (21Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol.. 1984; 99: 769-777Google Scholar). Cdc12p FH1 peptides were synthesized by the Keck Center at Yale. We purified from E. coli (15Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell.. 2006; 124: 423-435Google Scholar) recombinant domains of fission yeast formin Cdc12p consisting of the FH1 domain (Cdc12p(FH1)) or both the FH1 and FH2 domains (Cdc12p(FH1FH2)). Crystallization and Data Collection—We grew crystals of S. pombe profilin using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique under two different conditions at 4 °C. Approach A used 1 μl of 20 mg/ml of S. pombe profilin mixed with 3 μl of crystallization precipitant solution A (1.3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.5% Jeffamine ED2001 (O,O′-bis-(2-aminopropyl)polyethylene glycol 1900) from Hampton Research (Aliso Viejo, CA). Crystals grew in 5–12 days. Crystals were soaked for 1 min in a cryoprotectant of solution A with 30% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Approach B used 1 μl of 13.4 mg/ml S. pombe profilin with 3 mm IP3 mixed with 1 μl of 4 m sodium formate, pH 8.8. Crystals were soaked for 15 s in a cryoprotectant of 4 m sodium formate and 30% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure Solution and Refinement—We collected diffraction data (Table 1) from approach A crystals with a diffractometer at the Yale Center for Structural Biology, using a rotating anode x-ray generator at a wavelength of 1.54 Å and 0.1° oscillations. Data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar) and yielded a 96.7% complete data set extending to 2.2 Å (Table 1). The program MolRep in the CCP4 suite (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) was used for the molecular replacement using Acanthamoeba castellanii profilin-II as the initial model (Protein Data Bank 2ACG). The unit cell contained two monomers. A single round of rigid body refinement was performed in REFMAC (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) followed numerous rounds of positional and isotropic B-factor refinement using REFMAC and manual modeling using COOT (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar). This resulted in an Rwork ∼ 27.8% (Rfree = 34.1%). Group B factors were refined with TLS (26Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2001; 57: 122-133Google Scholar). The TLS domains were defined using the TLSMD web server for the generation of multi-group TLS models (27Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2006; 62: 439-450Google Scholar). This reduced Rwork to 24.5% and Rfree to ∼29.4%. ARP/wARP software program in the CCP4 suite (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) identified waters. Subroutines in COOT were used to identify and correct structural problems. A second data set extending to 1.65 Å was collected at beam line X29A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the National Brookhaven Laboratory using 0.1 oscillations and wavelength of 1.08. These data were used during final rounds of model building and refinement. The final model includes 220 solvent molecules and has an Rwork of 17.5% and Rfree of 20.6%. Ramachandran plots indicated that 99% of residues were either in the allowed, favorably allowed, or generously allowed regions (Table 1). The structure validation tool PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol.. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Google Scholar) evaluated the geometric quality of the model. We collected data from approach B crystals at Yale and used initial phases from the approach A structure to begin refinement. The final model contained 144 solvent molecules and had an Rwork of 17.6% and Rfree of 26.0%. Group B factors were refined with the TLS domains defined using the TLSMD web server (27Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2006; 62: 439-450Google Scholar). Significant drops in Rwork and Rfree occurred with TLS refinement. Protein structures were illustrated using the program PYMOL (29Delano W.L. PYMOL. Delano Scientific, LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar) and structural alignments were done with the O program (30Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab We made a homology model (see supplemental materials) of the complex of S. pombe profilin (PDB 3D9Y) with actin using the structure of bovine profilin-β-actin (PDB 1HLU) as the model. We subjected the initial model to multiple rounds of restrained refinement and structure idealization with standard geometric constraints of bond lengths and angles using the program REFMAC5 in the CCP4 suite. Residues from both chains were refined simultaneously taking into account optimal geometrical orientations of main chain and side chain atoms. We removed steric clashes during structure idealization. Supplemental materials include a PDB file of the homology model. Biochemical Characterization—Lu and Pollard (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar) described the use of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to evaluate the stability of profilin in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at 22 °C and a range of urea concentrations, and also to quantitate binding of profilin to poly-l-proline and the FH1 domain of Cdc12p. The dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated using Kaleidagraph software to fit Equation 1 to the data. F=((Kd+[L]+[P])−(Kd+[L]+[P])×2−(4[L][P]))×0.5)/2[P](Eq. 1) F is the relative fluorescence; [L] and [P] are the total concentrations of proline and profilin, respectively. Lu and Pollard (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar) also described the fluorescence assay to measure dissociation of nucleotide from magnesium-etheno-ATP actin with 0 to 100 μm profilin and spontaneous polymerization of magnesium-ATP-actin monomers (5% pyrene-labeled) in KMEI buffer (10 mm imidazole, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). Kovar et al. (15Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell.. 2006; 124: 423-435Google Scholar) described the use of pyrenyl-actin fluorescence to measure the elongation of actin filaments in the presence of a recombinant S. pombe formin Cdc12p(FH1FH2). We used an MCS ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) to measure heat changes by interactions of wild-type and mutant profilins with actin monomers at 26 °C. Profilin was concentrated using a Centriprep YM3 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Stocks of 20 mm Latrunculin B in ethanol and 10× KMEI were added to both ∼25 μm calcium-actin monomers and ∼500 μm profilin in buffer G to give concentrations of 50 μm Latrunculin B and 1× KMEI. A 2.0-ml sample of 25 μm actin was in the sample cell and 2.0 ml of buffer was in the reference cell of the ITC unit. With constant mixing by rotation of the injection syringe at 400 rpm, the heat of binding was measured for each addition of 5 or 10 μl of profilin until the actin was saturated with profilin. The small, constant heat of mixing produced at each titration after saturation was subtracted from each of the titration heats and the data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin software to give the stoichiometry (N), the dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd), and the enthalpy (ΔH) for the binding reactions. Human Profilin-I Does Not Complement the Fission Yeast Profilin cdc3-124 Temperature-sensitive Mutation—We attempted to complement the cytokinesis defect of the temperature-sensitive E42K mutation cdc3-124 of S. pombe profilin by expressing Hs profilin-I from a plasmid under the control of thiamine-repressed, weak Rep81 nmt1 promoter. In the absence of thiamine, this promoter produces profilin concentrations similar to those of the native promoter (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar). However, no nmt promoter or thiamine concentration tested allowed the cdc3-124 strain to grow at 36 °C. High level expression of Hs profilin-I from the medium strength Rep3X nmt promoter not only failed to complement the cdc3-124 mutation, but also killed wild-type fission yeast expressing endogenous levels of wild-type S. pombe profilin (Fig. 1). Liquid cultures of cells overexpressing wild-type Hs profilin-I accumulated a proportion of cells with mis-formed septa that eventually lysed starting after 1 day. The failure of Hs profilin-I to complement the temperature-sensitive mutation and the ability of Hs profilin overexpression to kill wild-type cells were surprising, for many reasons. First, expression of Hs profilin complements deletion of the single profilin gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31Ostrander D.B. Ernst E.G. Lavoie T.B. Gorman J.A. Eur. J. Biochem.. 1999; 262: 26-35Google Scholar). Second, expression of fission yeast profilins from this plasmid complements the cdc3-124 mutation, even expression of the E42K mutant profilin itself or profilin mutants with >90% loss of actin or poly-l-proline binding activity (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar). Third, expression of Arabidopsis profilin complements the S. pombe cdc3-124 mutation (32Christensen H.E.M. Ramachandran S. Tan C.T. Surana U. Dong C.H. Chua N.H. Plant J.. 1996; 10: 269-279Google Scholar) despite the fact that it lacks nucleotide exchange activity toward actin (33Perelroizen I. Didry D. Christensen H. Chua N.H. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 12302-12309Google Scholar) and thus is less similar to fission yeast profilin (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar) than Hs profilin-I (34Wen K.-K. McKane M. Houtman J.C.D. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 9444-9453Google Scholar). Fourth, fission yeast tolerate high level expression of S. pombe profilin from the strong Rep3 promoter (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar). Elongation of Actin Filaments with S. pombe Formin Cdc12p—Given these facts and knowledge that fission yeast depend on both profilin and formin Cdc12p to assemble actin filaments for the cytokinetic contractile ring (9Chang F. Drubin D. Nurse P. J. Cell Biol.. 1997; 137: 169-182Google Scholar, 10Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol.. 2003; 161: 875-887Google Scholar, 11Balasubramanian M.K. Hirani B.R. Burke J.D. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol.. 1994; 125: 1289-1301Google Scholar), we tested the ability of Hs profilin to stimulate the elongation of actin filament barbed ends associated with S. pombe formin Cdc12p. The FH2 domain of this formin strongly inhibits elongation of actin filament barbed ends, but S. pombe profilin stimulates elongation of Cdc12p constructs having both a profilin-binding FH1 domain and an FH2 domain (15Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell.. 2006; 124: 423-435Google Scholar). Remarkably, Hs profilin does not stimulate elongation of barbed ends associated with Cdc12p(FH1FH2) (Fig. 2), despite interacting with both actin monomers and poly-l-proline, the two fundamental ligands thought to be required for this reaction (15Kovar D.R. Harris E.S. Mahaffy R. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Cell.. 2006; 124: 423-435Google Scholar, 16Vavylonis D. Kovar D.R. O'Shaughnessy B. Pollard T.D. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 455-466Google Scholar). This failure of actin filament elongation likely explains the cytokinesis defects in fission yeast cells dependent on Hs profilin-I. Hs profilin inhibits polymerization in the presence of Cdc12p(FH1FH2) by binding actin monomers and preventing their incorporation at pointed ends and by inhibiting spontaneous nucleation, which contributes a small fraction of the bulk polymerization rates in these experiments. Crystal Structure of S. pombe Profilin—Seeking an explanation for these unexpected results, we determined two different crystal structures of S. pombe profilin (Table 1). One is a 1.65-Å resolution structure (PDB 3D9Y) from crystals formed in 1.3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 0.2 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% Jeffamine ED2001 (O,O′-bis(2-aminopropyl)polyethylene glycol 1900). The other is a 2.2-Å resolution structure (PDB 3DAV) from crystals grown in 4 m sodium formate in the presence of IP3. No density for IP3 appeared in the electron density map and the two structures are identical. The asymmetric units in both structures contained a dimer of profilin. The dimeric interfaces were different with a contact surface of 310 Å2 for the A structure and 470 Å2 for the B structure. On gel filtration 230 μm S. pombe profilin eluted with a Stokes radius of 12.0 Å, similar to the radius of gyration of 13.1 Å calculated from the structure of the monomer using VMD. Thus it is unlikely that the dimer is physiologically relevant. Despite low sequence identity (Fig. 3B) the fold of S. pombe profilin (Fig. 3A) is remarkably similar to profilins from S. cerevisiae (35Eads J.C. Mahoney N.M. Vorobiev S. Bresnick A.R. Wen K.K. Rubenstein P.A. Haarer B.K. Almo S.C. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 11171-11181Google Scholar), mammals (5Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature.. 1993; 365: 810-816Google Scholar), and Acanthamoeba (36Liu S. Fedorov A.A. Pollard T.D. Lattman E.E. Almo S.C. Magnus K.A. Struct. Biol.. 1998; 123: 22-29Google Scholar). All of these profilins consist of an anti-parallel β-sheet of six strands flanked by α-helices. The r.m.s. deviation between 125 Cα atoms of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae profilins is only 1.23 Å, although only 49% of the residues are identical. Residues Gln4– Thr12 of S. cerevisiae profilin form a continuous α-helix, whereas an extra residue (Thr8) in S. pombe and Acanthamoeba profilins results in residues Gln4–Ser9 forming an α-helix followed by residues Leu10 to Gly13 in a 310-helix (Fig. 3). A second small difference in architecture is that the loop connecting strand β2 and helix α2 extends further from the core of the protein in S. pombe profilin than S. cerevisiae profilin. The r.m.s. deviation between corresponding Cα atoms of S. pombe profilin and Hs profilin-I is 2.12 Å despite only 33% sequence identity. Human profilins have two small and two large inserts compared with the fungal profilins (Figs. 3B and 4). The large insertions extend strands β4, β5 and β6, forming “wings” that flank each side of the actin-binding interface (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Stereo diagrams of the homology model of S. pombe profilin bound to actin based on the bovine profilin-β actin crystal structure (PDB 1HLU). Color code for C-α traces: actin, dark blue; bovine profilin, cyan; S. pombe profilin, tan. ATP is yellow. Some residues discussed in the text are shown in stick representation. Subdomains 1–4 of actin are labeled in panel A. Important secondary structural elements are also labeled. The figure in panel B is oriented to highlight the β4/β5 and β5/β6 wings in bovine profilin.

Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar). Table 2 lists the structural consequences of the mutations having less than 5% wild-type affinity for actin. Steric clashes, loss of intermolecular bonds, or electrostatic repulsion account for most cases of compromised affinity, although the strong effect of the P107Y mutation is not obvious.TABLE 2Analysis of S. pombe profilin mutations that failed to complement profilin temperature-sensitive and/or profilin null strainsResidueNative interaction with actinMutationAffinity for actinaData from Lu and Pollard (1).Consequence of mutationLys67Side chain salt bridges to actin Asp287 and Asp285K67A<0.01Loss of salt bridgeK67E<0.01Loss of salt bridge and electrostatic repulsionIle71Hydrophobic interaction of side chain with actinI71E<0.01Intramolecular salt bridge with profilin Lys81 precludes interaction with actinI71R<0.01Steric hindrance and charged side chain in hydrophobic cavityI71W<0.01Steric clashArg72Side chain salt bridge to actin Phe374 C-terminal carboxylR72ENot testedDisrupts network of salt bridges including actin C terminusTyr79Tyr79 OH makes potential H bond to actin Glu115 side chainY79R0.053Arg79 side chain forms salt bridge to actin Phe374 C terminus; may compromise network of native electrostatic bondsLys81Side chain H bonds to carbonyl O's of actin Glu166 and Tyr165K81E<0.01Loss of 2 H bondsPro107Side chain between side chains of actin Tyr168 and profilin Tyr101P107W0.04Steric clash of large side chain with actin side chains; displaces side chains and backbone in refinementP107Y0.055Small steric clashes; mechanism not clearAla111Small side chain in water-filled cavity near actin C terminusA111E0.023Electrostatic repulsion between Glu111 side chain and actin Phe374 C-terminal carboxyla Data from Lu and Pollard (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab Since the divergence of fungi and animals from their common ancestor over 800 million years ago, the actin side and the profilin side of the actin-profilin interface diverged at radically different rates. Today the sequences of S. pombe actin and human β-actin are 89% identical and 95% similar. Every residue of bovine β-actin that contacts profilin in the 1HLU crystal structure is identical to the corresponding residue of S. pombe actin. On the profilin side of the interface, only 25% of the residues of bovine profilin that contact actin in the 1HLU structure are identical to the corresponding residues of S. pombe profilin (Fig. 3B). Remarkably, despite extensive differences (Table 3), fission yeast and bovine profilins have the same affinity for rabbit muscle actin (Kd = 0.1–0.2 μm) in fluorescence quenching and nucleotide exchange assays (1Lu J. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 1161-1175Google Scholar, 37Perelroizen I. Carlier M. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem.. 1995; 270: 1501-1508Google Scholar, 38Perelroizen I. Marchand J.B. Blanchoin L. Didry D. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 8472-8478Google Scholar). The seven identical residues that interact with actin in human and S. pombe profilins have similar conformations in the two profilin structures. Fo"
https://openalex.org/W2150669385,"Organic anion transporters (OATs) play a pivotal role in the clearance of small organic anions by the kidney, yet little is known about how their activity is regulated. A yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify putative OAT3-associated proteins in the kidney. Atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) was shown to bind to OAT3. Binding was confirmed in immunoprecipitation assays. The OAT3/PKCζ interaction was investigated in rodent renal cortical slices from fasted animals. Insulin, an upstream activator of PKCζ, increased both OAT3-mediated uptake of estrone sulfate (ES) and PKCζ activity. Both effects were abolished by a PKCζ-specific pseudosubstrate inhibitor. Increased ES transport was not observed in renal slices from OAT3-null mice. Transport of the shared OAT1/OAT3 substrate, ρ-aminohippurate, behaved similarly, except that stimulation was reduced, not abolished, in the OAT3-null mice. This suggested that OAT1 activity was also modified by PKCζ, subsequently confirmed using an OAT1-specific substrate, adefovir. Inhibition of PKCζ also blocked the increase in ES uptake seen in response to epidermal growth factor and to activation of protein kinase A. Thus, PKCζ acted downstream of the epidermal growth factor to protein kinase A signaling pathway. Activation of transport was accompanied by an increase in Vmax and was blocked by microtubule disruption, indicating that activation may result from trafficking of OAT3 into the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that PKCζ activation up-regulates OAT1 and OAT3 function, and that protein-protein interactions play a central role controlling these two important renal drug transporters.

OAT substrates include a variety of drugs such as β-lactam antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and chemotherapeutics (1Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Physiol. Rev... 2004; 84: 987-1049Google Scholar). OATs are predominantly expressed in renal proximal tubule, with OATs 1–3 localized to the basolateral membrane and OAT4 and URAT1 on the apical membrane. OATs 1 and 3 are dicarboxylate exchangers, and are indirectly coupled to the sodium gradient maintained by Na,K-ATPase through sodium/dicarboxylate co-transport to drive the uphill basolateral step in renal organic anion secretion (2Sweet D.H. Chan L.M. Walden R. Yang X.-P. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2003; 284: F763-F769Google Scholar). Although the ionic gradients, electrophysiology, and underlying kinetics that drive transport by OATs 1 and 3 are well characterized, physiologically important interactions of these basolateral OATs with membrane or cytosolic proteins have yet to be identified (1Wright S.H.

Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that other plasma membrane transporters do interact with protein partners, influencing a diverse array of functions including transport itself, cytoskeletal structure, vesicle formation, and trafficking, as well as signaling (3Brone B. Eggermont J. Am. J. Physiol... 2005; 288: C20-C29Google Scholar). Among the transporters with activity modulated by protein-protein interactions, particularly by the PDZ proteins, PDZK1 and NHERFs 1 and 2, are apical drug transporters of the SLC22A family, including OCTN1, OCTN2, OAT4, and URAT1 (4Anzai N.

In the present study, we have used a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify putative protein partners that interact directly with OAT3. The C-terminal 81 amino acids of OAT3 were used as bait to screen a human cDNA kidney library. Among the 23 positive clones (putative binding partners) was a clone encoding the C-terminal 141 amino acids of atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). Functional consequences of the putative OAT3/PKCζ interaction were investigated in rodent renal slices. The resulting data indicate that activation of PKCζ by insulin or epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased OAT3- and OAT1-mediated transport. Thus, PKCζ controls function of both major secretory organic anion transporters expressed at the basolateral face of the renal proximal tubule, positioning it to regulate the efficacy of renal drug elimination. Materials—Rabbit anti-PKCζ and monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin and anti-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal anti-myc antibody was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Human recombinant insulin, glutarate, and EGF were obtained from Sigma. PKCζ-pseudosubstrate (PKCζ-PS) inhibitor was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). PKCη and PKCθ pseudosubstrate inhibitors and dibutryl-cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Tritiated estrone sulfate ([3H]ES; specific activity 50 Ci/mmol) and para-aminohippuric acid ([3H]PAH; specific activity 4.18 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) and radiolabeled adefovir ([3H]ADF; specific activity 25 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). All other chemicals were purchased from commercial sources at the highest purity available. Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—The Matchmaker two-hybrid system from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The C terminus of hOAT3 (243 bp, GenBank™ accession number NM_004254) was cloned into the pGBKT7 “bait” vector (myc-tagged), transformed into AH109 yeast (Alkali Cation Yeast Kit, Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA), and the bait protein was confirmed by Western blot. The Bait/AH109 yeast were mated with Y187 yeast pre-transformed with a human kidney cDNA library. The mating mixture was plated on quadruple dropout YPDA medium (QDO, -Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp) for most stringent selection and incubated 21 days at 30 °C. 23 robust colonies were selected for two additional rounds of replicate plating on QDO medium. Positive diploid clones were grown overnight in QDO YPDA broth and plasmid DNA was isolated using the RPM Yeast Plasmid Isolation Kit (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA from diploid clones was transformed into One Shot Top10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The bait and prey pDNA constructs were segregated by antibiotic resistance on LB medium plates (kanamycin/ampicillin). Clones were grown overnight in antibiotic LB broth and pDNA was isolated for sequencing and identification by BLASTn analysis in the NCBI data base. The functions of the putative binding proteins were elucidated from the GeneCards data base. The interaction between the OAT3 bait and PKCζ prey peptides was further validated in yeast through additional matings and co-transformation according to the kit instructions. The presence of bait in isolated PKCζ prey/AH109-Y187 diploid yeast was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1c). Animals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley CD rats and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratories (Germantown, NY) and housed in secure facilities at the NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, according to the standards of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. OAT3-null mice were raised in the Medical University of South Carolina animal facilities and shipped to NIEHS 1 week prior to experimental use. Animals were given standard NIH 31 pelleted rodent chow and water ad libitum and maintained at 70 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals were fasted overnight prior to euthanasia by CO2 narcosis followed by cervical dislocation (mice) or decapitation (rats). The NIEHS Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures. Transport in Rodent Renal Cortical Slices—Following sacrifice, kidneys were removed and the cortex was sectioned into 0.5-mm slices using a Stadie-Riggs microtome. Tissue slices were maintained in freshly oxygenated ice-cold modified Cross and Taggart saline buffer (95 mm NaCl, 80 mm mannitol, 5 mm KCl, 0.74 mm CaCl2, and 9.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). Slices were preincubated at room temperature for 30 min with 15–30 μg/ml insulin, 2 μm PKCζ-PS inhibitor, 75 μm Bt2cAMP, 50 ng/ml EGF, alone or in combination (see figure legends for details). After preincubation, 30 min uptake of 100 nm [3H]ES, 100 nm [3H]ADF, or 10 μm [3H]PAH was measured at room temperature in the presence of 20 μm glutarate. Slices were rinsed, blotted on Whatman No. 1 paper, weighed, and dissolved in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH overnight on an orbital shaker. Samples were then neutralized with 1 ml of 1 n HCl and assayed for 3H by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Transport was calculated as tissue to medium ratios (dpm/mg of tissue ÷ dpm/μl of medium) (2Sweet D.H. Chan L.M. Walden R. Yang X.-P. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2003; 284: F763-F769Google Scholar). PKCζ Activity—Kidney slices were homogenized in a buffer (300 mm mannitol, 12 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.5) containing a complete protease inhibitor panel from Roche Applied Science. The homogenate was centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min, yielding a supernatant that was 2–4-fold enriched in plasma membranes. Further enrichment (4–6-fold) was achieved by pelleting the plasma membranes at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in assay buffer containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 25 mm MgCl2, 250 mm Tris/HEPES, pH 7.2, with 5 mm dithiothreitol added immediately prior to use. PKCζ activities in kidney membranes were measured using the PKCζ KinEASE™ FP Fluorescein Green Assay (Upstate Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY) and a fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) preprogrammed to measure fluorescein green (excitation 485 and emission at 530 nm). Aliquots of kidney membrane protein, usually 100 μg, were incubated with a phosphorylated tracer in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and a phospho-specific antibody. Reduced binding of the tracer to the antibody reflected competition between tracer and sample PKCζ product. PKCζ activity was calculated from a standard curve for recombinant human PKCζ. Preparation of Rat Kidney Basolateral Membrane Vesicles—Basolateral membrane vesicles were isolated from renal cortex of male Sprague-Dawley CD rats (∼250 g) as previously described (7Pritchard J.B. Renfro J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1983; 80: 2603-2607Google Scholar), using differential centrifugation followed by gradient density centrifugation on an 11% Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradient. The basolateral membrane marker, Na+,K+-ATPase, was enriched 10–20-fold. The brush-border membrane marker, alkaline phosphatase showed enrichments of only 2–3-fold. The final membrane pellet was suspended in vesicle buffer (100 mm mannitol, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES/Tris, 1 mm MgSO4) at pH 7.4 and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. For kinetic experiments, basolateral membrane vesicles were thawed, centrifuged, resuspended, and allowed to equilibrate in fresh vesicle buffer for 60 min at room temperature, then placed on ice. Ten microliters of vesicles were incubated for 30 s in 90 μl of media (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HEPES, and 1 mm MgSO4) containing 10 μm glutaric acid and varying concentrations of [3H]adefovir or [3H]estrone sulfate in the presence or absence of 1 mm probenecid. This suspension was transferred to Millipore glass fiber filters (0.7 μm), pre-soaked in distilled water, washed three times with buffer and allowed to dry. Filters were counted in a Packard 2900TR Tricarb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer with external standard quench correction. All transport experiments were carried out at room temperature. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism® software. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum transport rate (Vmax) were estimated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Values represent average probenecid-sensitive adefovir or estrone sulfate transport from three to four independent experiments. Immunoprecipitation—Rat renal cortex from adult male Sprague-Dawley CD rats was isolated and suspended in CelLytic™ MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis/Extraction reagent (Sigma) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tissues were then homogenized and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. To eliminate nonspecific binding, 1 ml of rat kidney lysate (3 mg of protein) was pre-cleared by incubation with 50 μl of TrueBlot™ anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with either 7 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-PKCζ (mid) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) or 1 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-rOAT3 (Cosmobio, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP beads (30 μl) was added and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed 7 times with increasing washing stringency IP buffers (Sigma) and eluted from beads by heating in 4× NuPAGE® LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min. The Invitrogen NuPAGE Novex Tris acetate electrophoresis system was utilized for Western blotting. Eluted immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 7% NuPAGE Novex Tris acetate gels and transferred to Invitrolon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS buffer (Pierce) for 1 h and incubated overnight with either a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-PKCζ or a 1:300 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-rOAT3. Membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS buffer and incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ImmunoPure secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) for 1 h. SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was utilized to detect antibodies, and a Gel Doc™ XR system (Bio-Rad) was utilized to detect proteins. Statistics—All experiments were repeated at least three times using preparations from separate animals. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Means were compared using the unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. In kinetic experiments, differences were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance with randomized-block design. p values ≤0.05 were deemed to be significant. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Using the 81 C-terminal amino acids of OAT3 as bait and a GAL4-based reporter system, a human cDNA kidney library was screened to identify putative binding partners. Following an initial 21-day incubation and two replicate rounds of plating on quadruple dropout YPDA medium (-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp, most stringent selection conditions), 23 robust diploid colonies were selected for identification. A subset of the putative OAT3 binding partners is shown in Table 1 and includes proteins relevant to vesicle formation, protein trafficking, transport, metabolism, and signaling. Of particular interest was PKCζ, because it is a signaling protein affecting many cellular functions (8Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2003; 133: 1-7Google Scholar). The interaction of the OAT3 C terminus with the C-terminal 141 amino acids of PKCζ was further validated in yeast by co-transformation and additional matings using the individual OAT3 bait and isolated PKCζ prey constructs. The presence of OAT3 bait in AH109 haploid and PKCζ prey/AH109-Y187 diploid yeast was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1c).TABLE 1Subset of putative OAT3 binding partnersCategoryIdentitiesProtein domains/ontologiesVesicle formation, protein traffickingPantophysin, synaptophysin-like protein (H-SP1)MARVEL, transport vesicle biogenesisGTPase Rab14Ras superfamily, small GTPase, vesicular trafficking, signal transductionGTPase Rab1BRas superfamily, small GTPase, vesicular trafficking, signal transductionSNARE associated protein snapin (SNAPAP)SNARE binding, synaptic vesicle docking and fusionTransport and metabolismDnaJ (Hsp40)DnaJ superfamily, chaperone associated with Hsp70 systemAspartoacylase 2, aminoacylase 2 (ASPA)Succinylglutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase, amino acid transport and metabolismAUP1 homologPhospholipid/glycerol acyltransferase, CUE, lipid transport and metabolismSignalingPKCζSerine/threonine protein kinase, phosphotransferase Open table in a new tab Association of OAT3 and PKCζ—Direct physical association between rPKCζ and rOat3 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation from rat kidney lysates. As shown in Fig. 2a, precipitation with anti-PKCζ pulled down both rPKCζ itself and rOat3. Similar results were obtained upon initial precipitation with anti-rOat3 antibody (Fig. 2b). Effect of PKCζ Activity on OAT3-mediated Transport—The putative OAT3/PKCζ interaction was investigated in isolated rodent renal cortical slices, using insulin as an upstream activator of PKCζ (9Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 1-7Google Scholar). To maximize sensitivity to insulin treatment, animals were fasted overnight prior to sacrifice. Uptake of 100 nm [3H]ES, a prototypical organic anion that is preferentially transported by OAT3 (10Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 26934-26943Google Scholar, 11Aslamkhan A.G. Thompson D.M. Perry J.L. Bleasby K. Wolff N.A. Barros S. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2006; 291: R1773-R1780Google Scholar), was measured in rat and mouse renal cortical slices. As shown in Fig. 3a, treatment with human recombinant insulin (30 μg/ml for rat; 15 μg/ml for mouse) significantly increased uptake of [3H]ES in slices from both species. This increase was prevented by exposure to 2 μm PKCζ-PS inhibitor during preincubation, suggesting that specific activation of PKCζ was responsible for the increased ES uptake, presumably mediated by OAT3 (see below). Activation of PKCζ requires the phosphorylation of two key threonine residues, Thr410 and Thr560 (9Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 1-7Google Scholar). An assay based on this observation showed that the activity of PKCζ paralleled the observed changes in transport activity, increasing markedly upon insulin treatment and returning to control levels in the presence of the PKCζ-PS inhibitor (Fig. 3b). The insulin effect on ES uptake was not altered by pseudosubstrate inhibitors for other PKC isozymes (η and θ, of the “novel” subclass, requiring diacylglycerol but not Ca2+ for activation) (Fig. 3c). OAT Transporters Affected by PKCζ—Although estrone sulfate is primarily transported by OAT3 in the kidney (10Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 26934-26943Google Scholar), a number of other basolateral transporters could contribute to its uptake in the rodent kidney (1Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Physiol. Rev... 2004; 84: 987-1049Google Scholar, 12Dantzler W.H. Wright S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2003; 1618: 185-193Google Scholar, 13Mikkaichi T. Suzuki T. Onogawa T. Tanemoto M. Mizutamari H. Okada M.

To confirm that the increase in ES transport was mediated by OAT3, transport experiments were repeated using renal cortical slices from the OAT3-null mouse, previously described by Sweet et al. (10Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 26934-26943Google Scholar). In contrast to the increase in ES uptake observed in wild-type mice and rats, insulin did not stimulate ES uptake in renal slices from OAT3-null mice (Fig. 4a), demonstrating that OAT3 was responsible for the observed stimulation of ES transport in the wild-type animals. However, uptake of PAH, a substrate for both OAT1 and OAT3, was stimulated by insulin in renal slices from wild-type and slightly in OAT3-null mice (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that OAT1 might also be regulated by PKCζ. To address this possibility, transport of [3H]ADF was evaluated in rat renal slices. Adefovir, an antiviral, acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, has previously been shown to be effectively transported by OAT1, but not by OAT3 (11Aslamkhan A.G. Thompson D.M. Perry J.L. Bleasby K. Wolff N.A. Barros S. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2006; 291: R1773-R1780Google Scholar, 14Cihlar T. Lin D. Pritchard J.B. Fuller M. Mendel D. Sweet D.H. Mol.

As shown in Fig. 4c, transport of [3H]ADF by rat renal slices was once again stimulated by insulin, and this effect was blocked by the PKCζ-PS inhibitor. Interestingly, mOat1 does not transport adefovir, unlike hOAT1 and rOat1 (11Aslamkhan A.G. Thompson D.M. Perry J.L. Bleasby K. Wolff N.A. Barros S. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2006; 291: R1773-R1780Google Scholar). Thus, in mouse renal slices, adefovir uptake was not stimulated (Fig. 4c), indicating that insulin stimulation of adefovir uptake in rat kidney depends specifically on the ability of rOat1 to transport this substrate. Effect of EGF on OAT3 Transport—Soodvilai et al. (16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar) found that treatment of isolated rabbit renal proximal tubules with EGF increased OAT3-mediated uptake of estrone sulfate. EGF was shown to stimulate OAT3 transport via a mitogen-activated protein kinase to phospholipase A2 to prostaglandin E2 to protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, although the mechanism of stimulation was not determined. As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation of mouse renal slices with EGF (50 ng/ml) significantly increased ES uptake in wild-type mice. No stimulation was observed in OAT3-null animals. In wild-type animals, EGF stimulation was blocked by the PKCζ-PS inhibitor, indicating that PKCζ also contributes to OAT3 activation via the EGF to PKA signaling pathway. To assess where PKCζ acted in this pathway, we confirmed that dibutryl-cAMP-mediated activation of PKA led to the expected increase in ES transport by rat slices and that stimulation was prevented by the PKA inhibitor, H89 (16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar, 17Honegger K.J. Capuano P. Winter C. Bacic D. Stange G. Wagner C.A. Biber J. Murer H. Hernando N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 803-808Google Scholar). In our slice system, 30 min preincubation with 75 μm Bt2cAMP doubled ES uptake and this effect was abolished by 100 μm H89 (data not shown). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 6a, both H89 and PKCζ-PS blocked EGF stimulation and simultaneous exposure to both inhibitors yielded no increase in inhibition over that seen with either inhibitor alone. Finally, as shown in Fig. 6b, these inhibitors produced an identical inhibitory profile when used to block insulin-stimulated ES uptake. Together these data indicate that PKCζ is situated between PKA and OAT1/OAT3 in activation of transport via either insulin or EGF signaling. Apparent Role of Trafficking in Transport Activation—As shown in Table 2, insulin activation of OAT3-mediated ES transport was characterized by a 2–3-fold increase in Vmax for both the OAT3 substrate, ES, and the OAT1 substrate, adefovir. This suggested that additional transporters may have been trafficked to the membrane. Therefore, nocodazole, brefeldin A, and cytochalasin D were used to disrupt microtubules/microfilaments and reduce trafficking. All three inhibitors abolished insulin-induced stimulation of ES transport (Fig. 7). These agents had no effect on baseline transport in the absence of insulin.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of insulin stimulated estrone sulfate and adefovir transport in rat kidney basolateral membrane vesiclesEstrone sulfateAdefovirKmVmaxKmVmaxμmpmol/30 s/mg proteinμmpmol/30 s/mg proteinControl6.4 ± 3.290.8 ± 29.327.7 ± 6.455.5 ± 11.2Insulin4.7 ± 1.9217.6 ± 58.3aThe data are mean ± S.E. for three replicate experiments in kidneys from different animals.33.2 ± 8.2140.3 ± 20.8aThe data are mean ± S.E. for three replicate experiments in kidneys from different animals.a The data are mean ± S.E. for three replicate experiments in kidneys from different animals. Open table in a new tab Characterization of membrane transporters has traditionally focused on functional and physiological studies in vivo or in heterologous in vitro expression models. More recently, the emergence of new molecular technologies has prompted investigations into the molecular biology and interactions of transporters with regulatory molecules, notably via distinct protein-protein interactions that modulate transporter structure, activity, trafficking, or signaling. Biber and Murer and co-workers (18Deliot N. Hernando N. Horst-Liu Z. Gisler S.M. Capuano P. Wagner C.A. Bacic D. O'Brien S. Biber J. Murer H. Am. J.

Biol... 2005; 203: 111-118Google Scholar) have shown that interactions with PDZ domain proteins were important for both apical expression and regulation of renal phosphate transporters. Similar regulatory effects of protein-protein interactions have also been observed for apically expressed members of the OAT family. Most notably, interactions of URAT1 with PDZK1 altered the efficacy of urate transport across the apical membrane of renal cells in culture (4Anzai N. Miyazaki H. Noshiro R. Khamdang S. Chairoungdua A. Shin H.J. Enomoto A. Sakamoto S. Hirata T. Tomita K. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 45942-45950Google Scholar, 20Anzai N. Miyazaki H. Hirata T. He X. Toki A. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Pharmacol. Sci... 2005; 97: 120PGoogle Scholar). Finally, signaling through activation of conventional PKC isoforms has been shown to decrease the activity of human, rat, and rabbit OATs 1 and 3 in several in vitro expression systems (16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar, 21Lu R. Chan B.S. Schuster V.L. Am. J.

To assess potential protein-protein interactions for the basolateral OATs that mediate the initial, energy-dependent step in secretion of drugs and toxins, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify putative OAT3-associated proteins in the kidney. We found interactions between the 81 C-terminal amino acids of OAT3 and 23 peptide fragments from a human cDNA kidney library (Table 1). A number of these putative hOAT3-binding proteins appeared relevant to transport and metabolism (heat shock protein; aspartoacylase 2) or to vesicle formation and trafficking (H-SP1, pantophysin; RAB14, small GTPase; RAB1B, small GTPase; SNAPAP, SNARE-associated protein snapin). Others were associated with signal transduction (RAB14, RAB1B, and PKCζ). As discussed below, we have focused on PKCζ in the current experiments and detailed assessment of the importance of other candidate proteins in hOAT3 function and/or subcellular localization must await additional study. Unlike both conventional and novel PKCs, PKCζ is an atypical isoform, i.e. it is insensitive to Ca2+ and unresponsive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. Instead, PKCζ is activated by phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate, phosphatidylserine, arachidonic acid, ceramide, and insulin (8Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2003; 133: 1-7Google Scholar, 9Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 1-7Google Scholar, 26Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 13-16Google Scholar). Activity of PKCζ is inhibited by pseudo-substrate peptides, staurosporine, wortmannin, and LY294009 (8Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2003; 133: 1-7Google Scholar, 9Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Biochemistry.. 2001; 40: 1-7Google Scholar). Importantly, PKCζ is known to be involved in a variety of signaling pathways including mitogen-stimulated cell growth (mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, p70 S6 kinase); in cell growth and survival (NFκB activation); and in generation of cell polarity (8Hirai T. Chida K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2003; 133: 1-7Google Scholar). We chose to investigate the putative OAT3/PKCζ interaction in a fresh renal tissue preparation, the renal cortical slice, rather than in a culture system, ensuring the presence of all normal regulatory pathways. Our working hypothesis was that manipulation of PKCζ activity would modulate normal OAT3-mediated transport. As shown in Fig. 3a, rat and mouse renal slices preincubated with insulin showed a significant increase in uptake of estrone sulfate, and co-administration of a PKCζ-specific pseudo-substrate inhibitor completely blocked the effect of insulin, strongly supporting a specific role for PKCζ. The induction and inhibition of PKCζ activity was confirmed by enzyme activity assays in renal tissue lysates (Fig. 3b). In addition, pseudosubstrate inhibitors of PKCη and PKCθ, both of the novel subclass of PKC isozymes, did not affect the insulin effect on ES uptake, further demonstrating the unique role of PKCζ in this physiological response (Fig. 3c). When uptake experiments were repeated in renal slices from OAT3-null mice, no effects on ES transport were observed (Fig. 4a), clearly documenting the involvement of the OAT3 isoform. Additional experiments with the OAT1-specific substrate, adefovir (11Aslamkhan A.G. Thompson D.M. Perry J.L. Bleasby K. Wolff N.A. Barros S. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol... 2006; 291: R1773-R1780Google Scholar, 14Cihlar T. Lin D. Pritchard J.B. Fuller M. Mendel D. Sweet D.H. Mol. Pharmacol... 1999; 56: 570-580Google Scholar, 15Mulato A.S. Ho E.S. Cihlar T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2000; 295: 10-15Google Scholar), indicated that this basolateral transporter was controlled by PKCζ, just like OAT3 (Fig. 4c). Although we have not directly addressed interactions of renal organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs of the SLO or SLC21A families) that might transport ES (27Spears K.J. Ross J. Stenhouse A. Ward C.J. Goh L.B. Wolf C.R. Morgan P. Ayrton A. Friedberg T.H. Biochem. Pharmacol... 2005; 69: 415-423Google Scholar, 28Nozawa T. Suzuki M. Yabuuchi H. Irokawa M. Tsuji A. Tamai I. Pharm. Res. (N.Y.).. 2005; 22: 1634-1641Google Scholar), the loss of response to insulin or EGF (Figs. 4 and 5) in the OAT3-null mice and the lack of stimulation of adefovir uptake by mouse slices (because mOat1 does not transport adefovir) argues that any OATP contribution in these studies must be minimal. As shown in Fig. 5, EGF treatment of renal slices from wild-type mice also increased ES uptake. These results were entirely comparable with the findings of Soodvilai et al. (16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar) in isolated rabbit renal proximal tubules. Because activation of PKCζ by EGF treatment has been seen in human breast cancer cells (29Sun R. Gao P. Chen L. Ma D. Wang J. Oppenheim J.J. Zhang N. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 1433-1441Google Scholar) and Caco-2 cells (30Banan A. Fields J.Z. Zhang L.J. Shaikh M. Farhadi A. Keshavarzian A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2003; 307: 53-66Google Scholar), it seemed probable that, like the insulin effect discussed above, EGF stimulation was mediated through PKCζ. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5, EGF-stimulated ES transport by the mouse kidney slices was (a) completely blocked by PKCζ-PS inhibitor and (b) not found in slices from OAT3-null mice. Furthermore, consistent with results in the rabbit (15Mulato A.S. Ho E.S. Cihlar T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2000; 295: 10-15Google Scholar), we also demonstrated that Oat3 activity could be manipulated by PKA activation/inhibition, and that the upstream stimulation by either EGF or insulin was blocked by both H89 (PKA inhibitor) and PKCζ-PS (Fig. 6); strongly implicating PKCζ as the end-mediator in this signaling pathway. Overall, the data presented here indicate that PKCζ plays a central role in up-regulation of both OAT1 and OAT3 transport, thus, increasing net secretory transport of drugs and xenobiotics from the body. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence that activation of the conventional PKCs leads to a down-regulation in the activities of these transporters (15Mulato A.S. Ho E.S. Cihlar T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2000; 295: 10-15Google Scholar, 16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar, 22Miller D.S. Am.

Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 2003; 14: 1959-1968Google Scholar). For example, activation of conventional PKCs by phorbol ester treatment led to reduced transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing hOAT1 (24Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 2003; 14: 1959-1968Google Scholar). This effect appeared to be mediated by trafficking of the transporter out of the plasma membrane, and did not depend on phosphorylation of the transporter. Phenylepherine also produced a comparable decrease in transport in the intact tubules of the rabbit (15Mulato A.S. Ho E.S. Cihlar T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther... 2000; 295: 10-15Google Scholar), demonstrating that down-regulation is not limited to transport in expression systems. Our data also indicates that increased OAT transport may be mediated by changes in trafficking to the plasma membrane (Table 2 and Fig. 7), paralleling the findings of Wolfe et al. (24Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol... 2003; 14: 1959-1968Google Scholar) for down-regulation of OAT activity following activation of conventional PKCs. Together, these two lines of evidence outline an overall regulatory system in which activation of the conventional PKC isozymes leads to reduced basolateral OAT transport and activation of PKCζ leads to their up-regulation. In summary, an interaction between PKCζ and OAT3 was identified through yeast two-hybrid analysis. PKCζ activity and OAT3-mediated transport of ES were shown to be increased following insulin or EGF treatment and both were completely inhibited by PKCζ-PS. Together these data provide clear evidence that protein-protein interaction via this protein kinase may up-regulate organic anion transport. Thus, it appears that the insulin (or EGF) to PKCζ signaling pathway described here is one arm of an overall regulatory system in which activation of PKCζ leads to up-regulation of OAT1 and OAT3 transport; whereas, activation of the conventional PKC isoforms leads to their down-regulation (16Soodvilai S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol... 2004; 287: F1021-F1029Google Scholar, 23Takano M. Nagai J. Yasuhara M. Inui K. Am. J.

Indeed, given the complexity of membrane transporter architecture and function, it is likely that PKCζ is but one of many regulatory proteins capable of altering OAT function, suggesting that characterization of additional OAT protein-protein interactions will prove important for better understanding of both transporter function and drug pharmacology in the kidney."

However, knowledge of the proteins that interact with ASIC1a and influence its function is limited. Here, we show that α-actinin, which links membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, associates with ASIC1a in brain and in cultured cells. The interaction depended on an α-actinin-binding site in the ASIC1a C terminus that was specific for ASIC1a versus other ASICs and for α-actinin-1 and -4. Co-expressing α-actinin-4 altered ASIC1a current density, pH sensitivity, desensitization rate, and recovery from desensitization. Moreover, reducing α-actinin expression altered acid-activated currents in hippocampal neurons.

Members of this family contain cytosolic N and C termini, two transmembrane domains, and a large cysteine-rich extracellular domain. ASIC subunits combine as homo- or heterotrimers to form cation channels that are widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R.

In mammals, four genes encode ASICs, and two subunits, ASIC1 and ASIC2, have two splice forms, a and b. Central nervous system neurons express ASIC1a, ASIC2a, and ASIC2b (5Wemmie J.A. Chen J.

Homomeric ASIC1a channels are activated when extracellular pH drops below 7.2, and half-maximal activation occurs at pH 6.5–6.8 (8Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J.

Previous studies found ASIC1a enriched in synaptosomal membrane fractions and present in dendritic spines, the site of excitatory synapses (5Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M.

Consistent with this localization, ASIC1a null mice manifested deficits in hippocampal long term potentiation, learning, and memory, which suggested that ASIC1a is required for normal synaptic plasticity (5Wemmie J.A.

ASICs might be activated during neurotransmission when synaptic vesicles empty their acidic contents into the synaptic cleft or when neuronal activity lowers extracellular pH (17Miesenbock G.

Ion channels, including those at the synapse often interact with multiple proteins in a macromolecular complex that incorporates regulators of their function (20Levitan I.B. Nat. Neurosci... 2006; 9: 305-310Google Scholar, 21Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci... 2004; 5: 771-781Google Scholar). For ASIC1a, only a few interacting proteins have been identified. Earlier work indicated that ASIC1a interacts with another postsynaptic scaffolding protein, PICK1 (15Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Biochem.

ASIC1a also has been reported to interact with annexin II light chain p11 through its cytosolic N terminus to increase cell surface expression (24Donier E. Rugiero F. Okuse K. Wood J.N. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 38666-38672Google Scholar) and with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II to phosphorylate the channel (25Gao J. Duan B. Wang D.G. Deng X.H. Zhang G.Y. Xu L. Xu T.L. Neuron.. 2005; 48: 635-646Google Scholar). However, whether ASIC1a interacts with additional proteins and with the cytoskeleton remain unknown. Moreover, it is not known whether such interactions alter ASIC1a function. In analyzing the ASIC1a amino acid sequence, we identified cytosolic residues that might bind α-actinins. α-Actinins cluster membrane proteins and signaling molecules into macromolecular complexes and link membrane proteins to the actincytoskeleton (for review, Ref. 26Otey C.A. Carpen O. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 2004; 58: 104-111Google Scholar). Four genes encode α-actinin-1, -2, -3, and -4 isoforms. α-Actinins contain an N-terminal head domain that binds F-actin, a C-terminal region containing two EF-hand motifs, and a central rod domain containing four spectrin-like motifs (26Otey C.A. Carpen O. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 2004; 58: 104-111Google Scholar, 27Flood G. Kahana E. Gilmore A.P. Rowe A.J. Gratzer W.B. Critchley D.R. J. Mol.

The C-terminal portion of the rod segment appears to be crucial for binding to membrane proteins. The α-actinins assemble into antiparallel homodimers through interactions in their rod domain. α-Actinins-1, -2, and -4 are enriched in dendritic spines, concentrating at the postsynaptic membrane (29Wyszynski M.

Neuropharmacology.. 2004; 47: 734-745Google Scholar). In the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses, α-actinin connects the NMDA receptor to the actin cytoskeleton, and this interaction is key for Ca2+-dependent inhibition of NMDA receptors (36Rosenmund C.

Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J.

To better understand the function of ASIC1a channels in macromolecular complexes, we asked if ASIC1a associates with α-actinins. We were interested in the α-actinins because they and ASIC1a, both, are present in dendritic spines, ASIC1a contains a potential α-actinin binding sequence, and the related epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) interacts with the cytoskeleton (42Mazzochi C. Benos D.J. Smith P.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol... 2006; 291: 1113-1122Google Scholar, 43Zuckerman J.B. Chen X. Jacobs J.D. Hu B. Kleyman T.R. Smith P.R. J. Biol.

Expression Constructs—Mouse ASIC1a was cloned into pMT3 (44Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sheng, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Full-length human α-actinin-1–4 were cloned into pEGFP vectors (Clontech Laboratories) to generate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-α-actinin fusion proteins; previous studies showed that the localization and function of α-actinins were unaffected by GFP tags (45Fraley T.S.

Rod-actinin contains the central α-actinin spectrin domain including the C terminus but lacks the N-terminal head domain. Dimers containing rodactinin can bind other proteins, but the absence of the head domain interrupts cross-linking to the filamentous actin cytoskeleton (48Bhatt A. Kaverina I. Otey C. Huttenlocher A.

Rod-actinin would be expected to interfere with all α-actinins, and consistent with that conclusion, it disrupted the effect of α-actinins in human embryonic kidney cells, which express both α-actinin-1 and -4. 3J. W. Hell, unpublished observation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells also express α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 (50Celli L. Ryckewaert J.J. Delachanal E. Duperray A. J.

Cell Culture and Transfection—For patch clamp studies CHO cells were transfected with 1–6 μg of DNA using the TransFast Lipid™ reagent (Promega Madison, WI) and cultured on glass coverslips in 35-mm Petri dishes. To identify transfected cells using epifluorescence, we used EGFP at an ASIC1a:EGFP ratio of 6:1. Channel and α-actinin constructs were transfected at 1:1 ratio. Empty vector DNA was used to maintain a constant final DNA concentration for all transfections. Experiments were performed at room temperature 2–3 days after transfection. Hippocampal Neuronal Culture and Transfection—Rat E18 hippocampal neurons (Brain Bits, Springfield, IL) were transfected after 7–8 days in culture using calcium phosphate transfection. Conditioned medium was collected and replaced by freshly prepared neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) 30 min before transfection. A total of 5 μg of vector DNA was added in a transfection mix consisting of 50 ml of water, 5 ml of CaCl2 (2.5 m), and 60 ml of 2× PBS per dish. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C and after an 8-min Hanks' balanced salt solution washing step, conditioned media was reapplied to cultures. At day 10, neurons were used for whole-cell, patch clamp experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Whole mouse brains from adult animals were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (5 ml/brain) containing 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl plus protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) using a glass Teflon homogenizer. Samples were spun for 2 min in a tabletop centrifuge at 2000 × g to remove large debris. Supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 135,000 × g in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was washed once on ice and then solubilized in 6 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors (Complete Mini) with 1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation, samples were centrifuged (10 min, 700 × g) to remove particulate debris and precleared by the addition of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science, 50 μl, 15 mg/ml). Either undiluted affinity-purified ASIC1 antibody (raised in rabbits against the 22-amino acid peptide from the C terminus of ASIC1 and purified as described previously (16Wemmie J.A. Askwith C.C.

For precipitation, protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science, 50 μl 15 mg/ml) were added, and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 3 wash steps were performed to clear samples (buffer 1: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, protease inhibitors (Complete Mini); buffer 2: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycolate; buffer 3: 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycolate). Bound proteins were extracted at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer (0.125 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3.4% SDS, 17% glycerol, 67 mm dithiothreitol, 0.008% bromphenol blue) for 10 min and were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation from COS-7 cells was performed 48 h after electroporation (106 cells, 10 or 15 μg of DNA at 1:1 ASIC1a:α-actinin ratio per sample). Electroporation was performed with 400 μl of prechilled cell suspension (120 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.15 mm NaCl, 10 mm KPO4, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2 with 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione using a single 25-s pulse of 0.320 V and 975 microfarads. Cells in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini). Supernatants from cell extracts were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pierce) gently agitated for 1 h at 4 °C. Either ASIC1 antibody (16Wemmie J.A. Askwith C.C. Lamani E.

Neurosci... 2003; 23: 5496-5502Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech, Living Colors® Full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody) were added to 250–500 μl of protein extract after 1 h of rotation at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added followed by incubation overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates absorbed to protein A-Sepharose were washed three times as described above. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed. For immunoblotting, primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti rabbit or anti-mouse IgG from ECL (GE Healthcare). SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was used for detection. CHO cells were transfected with HA-ASIC1a:α-actinin:GFP at 1:1:1 ratio. For control, α-actinin was replaced with GFP so the ratio was 1:2 for HA-ASIC1a:GFP. Biotinylation of CHO cells was performed 2 days after Lipofectamine-mediated transfection. Cells were washed 3× with ice-cold PBS+/+, and 3 ml of 0.5 mg/ml NHS-biotin in PBS+/+ was added to each 10-cm dish followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle rocking. Cells were washed once with PBS+/+, and 0.1 m glycine in PBS+/+ was added to quench the reaction followed by 2 washes with PBS+/+. Cells were lysed in PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, and freshly added proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysate was sonicated briefly and cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was quantified using a modified Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). For Neutravidin pulldown, 60 μl of a 50% slurry of Neutravidin beads were added to 200 μl of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Beads were washed 3× with wash buffer (Tris 50 mm (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100). Beads were then boiled in 80 μl of SDS sample buffer with or without reducing agent. RT-PCR—Rat hippocampal neurons and rat muscle tissue were lysed in cell lysis buffer, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Cells-to-cDNA II Kit (Ambion). For PCR, the primer pairs for detection of α-actinin-1 were 5′-gatgcagacaaggagcgcct-3′ (bp 1887–1906) and 5′-gggacccaacgtgccggag-3′ (bp 2495–2513); for α-actinin-2 they were 5′-agaatgaggtggagaaggtga-3′ (bp 1787–1807) and 5′-tggaaggtgaccgtgccttg-3′ (bp 2467–2486); for α-actinin-3 they were 5′-ctgcagctggagtttgctcg-3′ (bp 1607–1625) and 5′-tgtgctccatgctgtagacc-3′ (bp 2196–2215), and for α-actinin-4 they were 5′-agcaatcacatcaagctgtcg-3′ (bp 1906–1927) and 5′-ccacactcatgatccggttg-3′ (bp 2542–2561). RT-PCR products were sequenced to confirm identity. RNA Interference—We generated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against each of the four rat α-actinin isoforms using OligoEngine™ to locate 19 nucleotides within exons of the target and immediately downstream of AA dinucleotides and to exclude identity to other sequences in the NCBI data base. Sequences with potential polymerase III termination sites and mRNA splice sites were avoided. The 19-nucleotide sense sequence and the inverted antisense sequence were connected by a 9-nucleotide spacer to allow stem-loop formation. At the 3′ end, a penta-thymidine motif provided a polymerase III termination site. siRNAs were cloned into pSilencer™ vector (Ambion) for expression of the respective sequences under the U6 promotor. DsRed and its cytomegalovirus promoter from pDsRed2-N1 were cloned into the Kpn site upstream of the U6 promoter within the pSilencer™ vector; this vector was used for identification of transfected neurons. To test for efficacy and specificity of siRNA, CHO cells were co-transfected with either one of the siRNAs and EGFP-tagged α-actinin at a 10:1 cDNA ratio (total 11 μg DNA) using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I media according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). RNAi1 targeted at 476–494 from the start sequence of rat α-actinin-1 (the sense chain was 5′-gatctccaacgtcaacaagttcaagagacttgttgacgttggagatctttttt-3′. RNAi2 targeted at 224–242 from the start sequence of rat α-actinin-2; the sense chain was 5′-tggcctgatggatcatgagttcaagagactcatgatccatcaggccatttttt-3′. RNAi3 targeted at 455–473 from the start sequence of rat α-actinin-3; the sense chain was 5′-aacgagaagctgatggaggttcaagagacctccatcagcttctcgtttttttt-3′. RNAi4 targeted at 493–511 from the start sequence of rat α-actinin-4; the sense chain was 5′-gactatccaggagatgcagttcaagagactgcatctcctggatagtctttttt-3′. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell, patch clamp recordings were performed on CHO cells on 10-mm glass coverslips continuously superfused with a bath solution containing: 128 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, 5.55 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with TMAOH. The standard pipette solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 121 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.25 with TMAOH. For whole-cell, patch clamp experiments with hippocampal neurons the bath solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, 10 mm glucose adjusted to pH 7.4 with TMAOH. The pipette solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 70 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, 25 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.25 with TMAOH. Bath solutions with different pH values were adjusted with TMAOH and applied with a rapid solution exchanger (RSC-200 & EVH-9, Biologic Science Instruments). Recording pipettes were pulled from capillary glass with a micropipette puller (Sutter instruments) and polished (MF830, Narishige, Japan). Pipette resistances ranged from 2 to 5.5 megaohms. Recordings were made at room temperature using an AXO-PATCH 200B amplifier with pCLAMPex 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Amplitude was determined by subtracting the base-line current at pH 7.4 from the peak current amplitude. The τ of desensitization (τdes) was calculated by fitting the data to a single exponential equation with Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Membrane potential was held at –70 mV. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by two-tailed Student's t test. ASIC1a Contains a Putative Binding Site for α-Actinin—In the C terminus of ASIC1a, we identified an amino acid motif that resembled sequences in the cytosolic portions of the NMDA receptor subunit 1 and the P2X7 purinoceptor, two ion channels known to physically interact with α-actinin (Fig. 1) (38Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci... 1999; 19: 1165-1178Google Scholar, 51Leonard A.S. Bayer K.U. Merrill M.A. Lim I.A. Shea M.A. Schulman H. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

The potential α-actinin-binding site in ASIC1a lies in the cytosolic portion of the subunit and would, therefore, be accessible for interaction with other cytoskeletal proteins. The sequence was not present in ASIC2 or ASIC3, suggesting that α-actinin might specifically interact with ASIC1. Because ASIC1a and -1b splice variants share the same C terminus, interactions would be predicted to occur with both subunits. ASIC1a Associates with α-Actinin-1 and α-Actinin-4—To test the hypothesis that ASIC1a and α-actinin interact, we expressed ASIC1a with each of the four α-actinin isoforms in COS-7 cells. Immunoprecipitating ASIC1a co-precipitated α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 (Fig. 2). Conversely, precipitating α-actinin-1 or α-actinin-4 co-precipitated ASIC1a. ASIC1a weakly co-precipitated α-actinin-3, but not the converse, and we did not detect an interaction with α-actinin-2. These data suggest that ASIC1a resides in close proximity with at least two of the actinins, α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4. To learn whether the potential α-actinin binding motif in the C terminus of ASIC1a was involved in the interaction between ASIC1a and α-actinin, we expressed α-actinin-4 with an ASIC1a variant that contained mutations in the potential α-actinin binding motif (ASIC1amut residues 484LSLDDVK490 mutated to 484LSADAVA490). Mutating the C-terminal motif prevented ASIC1a from co-precipitating α-actinin-4 (Fig. 3). Likewise, α-actinin-4 failed to co-precipitate ASIC1amut. These results suggest a direct association between α-actinin-4 and ASIC1a that depends on the α-actinin binding motif. For most of the remainder of the studies, we focused on α-actinin-4. α-Actinin Did Not Affect Cell Surface Expression of ASIC1a—To determine whether α-actinin might regulate surface expression of ASIC1a, we biotinylated cell surface proteins in CHO cells transfected with ASIC1a. Co-expressing ASIC1a with α-actinin-4, α-actinin-1, or rod-actinin did not alter the fraction of ASIC1a on the cell surface (Fig. 4, A and B). α-Actinin Influences ASIC1a Current Density—To learn whether α-actinin also regulates the function of ASIC1a, we co-expressed them and measured currents. α-Actinin-4 reduced ASIC1a current density, whereas α-actinin-1 had no effect (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that even though both α-actinins interact with ASIC1a, they have selective functional effects. As an additional test of the effect of α-actinin, we co-expressed ASIC1a with rod-actinin, a dominant-negative construct (48Bhatt A. Kaverina I. Otey C. Huttenlocher A. J. Cell Sci... 2002; 115: 3415-3425Google Scholar, 49Wang J. Shaner N. Mittal B. Zhou Q. Chen J. Sanger J.M. Sanger J.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton.. 2005; 61: 34-48Google Scholar). We found that the dominant-negative rod-actinin fragment had the opposite effect of α-actinin-4 and increased current density (Fig. 5, A and B). Finding that rod-actinin increased current amplitude suggested that it disrupted an interaction between ASIC1a and an endogenous α-actinin. Such an interaction predicts that ASIC1amut, which did not interact with α-actinin, would have a greater current density than ASIC1a. Consistent with this idea, ASIC1amut generated more current than ASIC1a (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, α-actinin-1 and α-actinin-4 failed to alter current produced by ASIC1amut. These data also suggest that the effect of α-actinin-4 on current results from a direct interaction with ASIC1a. α-Actinin Alters the Properties of ASIC1a Currents—The findings that α-actinin-4 did not change the amount of ASIC1a on the cell surface whereas it decreased current density suggested that α-actinin-4 must have also altered the properties of the current generated by ASIC1a or increased the proportion of silent channels. To test this possibility, we examined several characteristics of ASIC1a current, including the pH sensitivity, the rate of desensitization, and the time course of recovery from desensitization. Co-expressing α-actinin-4 increased the pH sensitivity of ASIC1a (Fig. 6A, Table 1). Conversely, the dominant-negative rod-actinin had the opposite effect, reducing pH sensitivity. Consistent with these data, when we disrupted the ASIC1a α-actinin-binding site (ASIC1amut), pH sensitivity fell, and α-actinin-4 and rod-actinin failed to alter the pH sensitivity of this variant (Fig. 6B, Table 1). These results indicate that the interaction with α-actinin influenced the sensitivity of ASIC1a to extracellular protons.TABLE 1α-Actinin and pH sensitivity of ASIC1a in CHO c"
https://openalex.org/W2084640131,"Background Mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) cause Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing White Matter disease (VWM). The disease is manifested by loss of brain myelin upon physiological stress. In a previous study, we showed that fibroblasts isolated from CACH/VWM patients are hypersensitive to pharmacologically-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Since brain cells from affected individuals are not available for research, we wished to assess the effect of eIF2B mutation on oligodendroglial-derived cells. Methodology/Principal Findings A rat oligodendroglial-derived cell line was used for a stable knock-down of eIF2B5 followed by stable expression of mutated eIF2B5(R195H) cDNA. In response to a pharmacological ER-stress agent, eIF2B5(R195H) expressing cells exhibited heightened ER-stress response demonstrated by hyper induction of ATF4, GADD34, Bip, PDIA1, PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA6 proteins. Moreover, even in the absence of a pharmacological stress agent, eIF2B5(R195H)-expressing cells exhibited high basal levels of ATF4, GADD34 and ER-associated Bip, PDIA1 and PDIA3. Significance The data provide evidence that oligodendroglial-derived cells expressing a mutated eIF2B constantly use their stress response mechanism as an adaptation mean in order to survive. The current study is the first to demonstrate the effects of eIF2B5 mutation on ER homeostasis in oligodendroglial-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2057870050,"The protein kinase D (PKD) family of serine/threonine kinases, which can be activated by gastrointestinal hormones, consists of three distinct isoforms that modulate a variety of cellular processes including intracellular protein transport as well as constitutive and regulated secretion. Although isoform-specific functions have been identified in a variety of cell lines, the expression and function of PKD isoforms in normal, differentiated secretory tissues is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PKD isoforms are differentially expressed in the exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas. Specifically, PKD3 is the predominant isoform expressed in exocrine cells of the mouse and human pancreas, whereas PKD1 and PKD2 are more abundantly expressed in the pancreatic islets. Within isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells, PKD3 undergoes rapid membrane translocation, trans-activating phosphorylation, and kinase activation after gastrointestinal hormone or cholinergic stimulation. PKD phosphorylation in pancreatic acinar cells occurs viaaCa2+-independent, diacylglycerol- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. PKD phosphorylation can also be induced by physiologic concentrations of secretagogues and by in vivo stimulation of the pancreas. Furthermore, activation of PKD3 potentiates MEK/ERK/RSK (RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase) signaling and significantly enhances cholecystokinin-mediated pancreatic amylase secretion. These findings reveal a novel distinction between the exocrine and endocrine cells of the pancreas and further identify PKD3 as a signaling molecule that promotes hormone-stimulated amylase secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2081333447,"During apoptosis the Golgi apparatus undergoes irreversible fragmentation. In part, this results from caspase-mediated cleavage of several high molecular weight coiled-coil proteins, termed golgins. These include GM130, golgin 160, and the Golgi vesicle tethering protein p115, whose caspase cleavage generates a C-terminal fragment (CTF) of 205 residues. Here we demonstrate that early during apoptosis, following the rapid cleavage of p115, endogenous CTF translocated to the cell nucleus and its nuclear import was required to enhance the apoptotic response. Expression of a series of deletion constructs identified a putative α-helical region of 26 amino acids, whose expression alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis; deletion of these 26 residues from the CTF diminished its proapoptotic activity. This region contains several potential SUMOylation sites and co-expression of SUMO together with the SUMO ligase, UBC9, resulted in SUMOylation of the p115 CTF. Significantly, when cells were treated with drugs that induce apoptosis, SUMOylation enhanced the efficiency of p115 cleavage and the kinetics of apoptosis. A construct in which a nuclear export signal was fused to the N terminus of p115 CTF accumulated in the cytoplasm and surprisingly, its expression did not induce apoptosis. In contrast, treatment of cells expressing this chimera with the antibiotic leptomycin induced its translocation into the nucleus and resulted in the concomitant induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that nuclear import of the p115 CTF is required for it to stimulate the apoptotic response and suggest that its mode of action is confined to the nucleus.

In mammalian cells the Golgi apparatus is a highly polarized organelle comprising a series of stacked cisternae, which form a lace-like network in the perinuclear region of the cell. It receives de novo synthesized secretory and membrane proteins, as well as lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; NES, nuclear export signal; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CTF, C-terminal fragment; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier.; these cargo molecules are then modified, sorted, and transported to lysosomes, endosomes, secretory granules, and the plasma membrane.

During apoptosis, the Golgi apparatus undergoes extensive and irreversible fragmentation (4Maag R.S. Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. Curr. Opin.

Proteolysis of golgin 160 by caspase-2, as well as GRASP65, GM130, p115, syntaxin5, and giantin by caspases-3 and -7 contributes significantly to Golgi fragmentation (6Lowe M. Lane J.D. Woodman P.G.

Consistent with this idea, overexpression of caspase-resistant forms of golgin 160, GRASP65, or p115 has been shown to delay the kinetics of Golgi fragmentation during apoptosis (8Lane J.D. Lucocq J.

Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and caspase-2-mediated cleavage of golgin 160 also appears to be an early event during apoptosis. Depending on the apoptotic stimulus, expression of a golgin 160 triple mutant resistant to caspase cleavage delays the onset of apoptosis (12Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that Golgi fragmentation is an early apoptotic event that occurs close to or soon after release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, an early indicator of apoptosis (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Together these observations demonstrate that specific Golgi proteins may function early during apoptosis, although their role in this process and the detailed molecular mechanism by which Golgi fragmentation occurs is not well understood. A key molecule in mediating Golgi fragmentation during apoptosis is the vesicle tethering protein p115 (10Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), a 962-residue peripheral membrane protein. p115 is an elongated homodimer consisting of two globular “head” domains, an extended “tail” region reminiscent of the myosin-II structure (14Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and 4 sequential coil-coil domains distal to the globular head region, the first of which, CC1, has been implicated in soluble NSF attachment protein receptors (SNARE) binding (15Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Earlier in vitro studies on mitotic Golgi reassembly demonstrated that p115 interacts with GM130 and giantin and implicated it in Golgi cisternal stacking (16Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, microinjection of anti-p115 antibodies caused Golgi fragmentation (17Alvarez C. Fujita H. Hubbard A. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1205-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Based on data demonstrating p115 binding to GM130, giantin, GOS28, and syntaxin-5, Shorter et al. (15Shorter J. Beard M.B. Seemann J. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) suggested that p115 promotes formation of a GOS28-syntaxin-5 (v-/t-SNARE) complex and hypothesized that it coordinates the sequential tethering and docking of COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes. Interestingly, p115 has also been shown to be a Rab-1 effector that binds Rab-1-GTP directly and cross-linking experiments showed that it interacts with Syntaxin5, sly1, membrin, and rbet1 on microsomal membranes and COPII vesicles suggesting that p115-SNARE interactions may facilitate membrane “docking” (18Allan B.B. Moyer B.D. Balch W.E. Science. 2000; 289: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). More recent in vivo studies showed that inhibition of GM130 or giantin binding to p115 had little effect on Golgi morphology or reassembly following mitosis, suggesting its role in maintaining Golgi structure might be independent of GM130 binding (19Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D.

Thus post-mitotic Golgi reassembly could be rescued by p115 lacking the C-terminal GM130 binding motif (residues 935–962) but not by a mutant lacking the SNARE interacting CC1 domain (20Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, other studies have implicated GM130 and GRASP65 in Golgi ribbon formation and suggested that this may occur independently of interactions with p115 (21Puthenveedu M.A. Bachert C. Puri S. Lanni F. Linstedt A.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Most significantly, knockdown of p115 using siRNA demonstrated that it is essential for maintaining Golgi structure, compartmentalization, and cargo traffic to the plasma membrane (20Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yoshimura S. Nakamura N. Fusano T. Sakisaka S. Ogata S. Fujimoto J. Kiyokawa N. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1268-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Earlier work from our laboratory demonstrated that p115 is cleaved in vitro by caspase-8, an initiator caspase, as well as by the executioner caspase-3 (10Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In response to apoptosis inducing drugs, p115 is cleaved in vivo at Asp757 to generate a 205-residue C-terminal fragment and an N-terminal polypeptide of 757 amino acids. Most significantly, expression of the p115 C-terminal fragment in otherwise healthy cells results in its translocation to the nucleus and the induction of apoptosis suggesting that this polypeptide plays a role in potentiating the apoptotic response. To further dissect p115 function during cell death, we have now determined the minimal domain in its C terminus that mediates apoptosis efficiently and analyzed the requirement of nuclear translocation in triggering the apoptotic response. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to p115 (7D1) were a gift from Dr. Gerry Waters (Merck, Rahway, NJ). Dr. Adam Linstedt (Carnegie Melon University, Pittsburgh, PA) provided a polyclonal antibody specific for the C terminus of p115. Rabbit anti-PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) serum, specific for the cleaved p85 form of PARP was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). The following mouse monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-GM130 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA); anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase and anti-cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); anti-HA-peroxidase (Roche Applied Science); and anti-Fas clone CH-11 (MBL International Corporation). Anti-active caspase-3 was purchased from Promega (San Luis Obispo, CA). EZview™ Red Anti-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel was purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). A human p115 fragment (amino acids 645–962) was fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase in expression vector pGEX2T. The recombinant protein was expressed in and purified from bacteria. The glutathione S-transferase motif was cleaved using thrombin, and the p115 fragment was injected into rabbits to raise the anti-p115 antibody, AE800. This antibody recognized full-length human p115 as well as the N-terminal (1–636) and C-terminal (758–962) polypeptides by both Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy; it did not recognize rat p115 by immunofluorescence microscopy. Plasmid Constructs—The pSG5-FLAG-human p115 construct was provided by Dr. Yukio Ikehara (Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan) and was used as a template to generate p115 constructs. For RNA interference, p115 was targeted by siRNA oligos as described (20Puthenveedu M.A. Linstedt A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). pEGFPC1 plasmid was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). p3XFLAG-CMV™-7.1 expression vector was purchased from Sigma. pGEX2T vector was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. A GFP-NES-CTF (GFP-nuclear export signal tagged CTF) plasmid was generated in the laboratory using the nuclear export signal LQLPPLERLTL from the Rev protein of HIV-1. Cell Culture and Induction of Apoptosis—HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Apoptosis was induced by treating cells with Anti-Fas clone CH-11 antibody (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), etoposide (100 μm), or anisomycin (5 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in medium containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% aprotinin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche). Thirty μg of each sample was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h. Subsequently, they were probed with appropriate antibodies in PBST, washed extensively, and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated, after which they were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Confocal images were acquired by capturing Z-series images with a 0.25-μm step size on a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica, Dearfield, IL) using a ×63 oil immersion objective (1.4 N.A.). Laser lines at 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm were provided by 20 milliwatt Diode, 100 milliwatt Ar, 1.5 milliwatt HeNe, and 10 milliwatt HeNe lasers; sequential excitation by line and detection range settings were used to eliminate cross-talk between fluorophores. The images (1024 × 1024 pixel, 8 bit) were saved as TIFF files. The entire Z-series was projected using the maximum intensity method. Background was removed and contrast adjusted using Image J and Adobe Photoshop. Threshold background level for each antibody was selected, saved, and loaded in all experiments. SUMOylation Experiments—HeLa cells were grown on 10-cm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of plasmids encoding (FLAG)3-CTF, (HA)3-SUMO, and UBC9. At 18 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (above) containing 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide to prevent de-SUMOylation and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. The postnuclear supernatant was pre-cleared three times for 1 h each at 4 °C with 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads in a total volume of 500 μl of RIPA buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor mixture. Precleared lysates were incubated with 20 μl of EZview Red Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel overnight at 4 °C. Following incubations, the beads were washed extensively in wash buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Intracellular Localization of Endogenous p115 CTF—Previous data from our laboratory showed that in cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged p115 CTF, the polypeptide accumulated almost exclusively in nuclei and its expression was sufficient to induce Golgi fragmentation and apoptosis (10Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, it was unknown whether nuclear accumulation of CTF was a consequence of overexpression, if the endogenous polypeptide were present in cell nuclei early during apoptosis, and if its nuclear translocation was a requirement for apoptosis. To address these questions, HeLa cells were treated with Fas antibody that cross-links the Fas receptor, after which they were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a polyclonal antibody specific for the C terminus of p115 (residues 758–962) and a monoclonal antibody to GM130 (Fig. 1). As expected, p115 and GM130 exhibited significant Golgi co-localization in control cells (Fig. 1, panels A–D). Upon Fas activation by the CH-11 antibody, a high level of immunoreactive p115 CTF was present in nuclei prior to significant fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1A). To confirm the nuclear localization of p115 during the induction of apoptosis, at different times after Fas antibody treatment HeLa cells were co-stained for mitochondrial cytochrome c release, a characteristic marker of early apoptosis (23Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar), as well as for immunoreactive-p115 (Fig. 1B). Control cells stained with anti-cytochrome c antibodies exhibited the typical reticular staining of mitochondria and no nuclear localization of p115 was observed (Fig. 1, B, panels A–D, and C). In contrast, following 2 or 4 h of Fas activation, cytochrome c staining became quite diffuse consistent with its release from mitochondria, and nuclear p115 staining was evident (Fig. 1B, panels E–L). Most significantly, quantitation of the immunofluorescence microscopy data (Fig. 1C) showed that at 2 h following Fas activation, the cells showed little evidence of mitochondrial cytochrome c release or Golgi fragmentation, whereas ∼50% of treated cells exhibited immunoreactive-p115 in their nuclei, suggesting that the nuclear localization of p115 preceded the onset of apoptosis. As expected, at 4 h following treatment with Fas activating antibody, ∼80 to 90% of cells had characteristics of apoptosis, namely highly diffuse cytochrome c staining, condensed nuclei, and a disrupted Golgi apparatus (Fig. 1B); our previous data showed that PARP is also cleaved at this time (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the early nuclear localization of p115 was not confined only to Fas-activated HeLa cells, COS-7 cells were treated with two well characterized activators of apoptosis, etoposide or anisomycin (supplement Fig. S1). In response to etoposide treatment, p115 had a diffuse, punctate appearance, whereas GM130 maintained its normal juxtanuclear localization; notably, p115 staining was evident in nuclei although the cells were not significantly apoptotic at this time. In cells treated with anisomycin the Golgi apparatus had a loose appearance; furthermore, p115 staining was evident in nuclei. Together, these results demonstrated that the endogenous p115 CTF translocated to the cell nucleus and in response to Fas or etoposide treatment, this preceded Golgi fragmentation. Because immunoreactive-GM130 was not observed in nuclei at this time (supplement Fig. S1), we concluded that the appearance of CTF in nuclei was a specific transport event and not a consequence of nuclear envelope breakdown. Together with our previous observations (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), these data are consistent with the hypothesis that p115 cleavage and CTF nuclear translocation are early apoptotic events. Having demonstrated that the endogenous p115 CTF accumulated in cell nuclei during activation of apoptosis, our goal was to determine whether nuclear translocation was required for CTF-induced apoptosis. Consequently, it was important to determine whether CTF expression induced cytochrome c release or if it functioned independently of the mitochondrial pathway. To address these questions, COS-7 cells were transfected with either GFP alone or GFP-CTF and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody to GM130 or cytochrome c (Fig. 2). Cells transfected with GFP alone showed normal Golgi and cytochrome c staining, whereas ∼60% of those expressing GFP-CTF had a disrupted Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2, panels D–F; see also Fig. 7). Significantly, in these cells cytochrome c staining was quite diffuse consistent with its release into the cytoplasm and the mitochondria aggregated significantly (Fig. 2, panels J–L), indicating that the cells were in an early phase of apoptosis. This result was consistent with observations that mitochondrial aggregation precedes release of cytochrome c and is an upstream apoptotic event (13Mukherjee S. Chiu R. Leung S.M. Shields D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Haga N. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5579-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Quantitation of Golgi fragmentation and apoptosis in response to expression of various p115 CTF truncation mutants. COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated GFP-tagged CTF constructs and stained with GM130 and Hoechst to identify the Golgi apparatus and nuclei, respectively. Golgi fragmentation and apoptosis were quantified by counting ∼300 cells expressing each construct; each set of cells was counted by two individuals. Data are the average of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on these observations we speculated that the CTF might act on mitochondria directly to release cytochrome c thereby activating the apoptosome. However, because the data of Fig. 1 and our previous studies (10Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showed that CTF was present in the nuclei of apoptotic cells, it was likely that the effect on mitochondria occurred as a consequence of nuclear translocation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressed a chimera comprising GFP-CTF fused to the HIV-1 Rev protein nuclear export signal (GFP-NES-CTF; Fig. 3). This construct, which was excluded from nuclei, accumulated in the perinuclear region of the cell and had a diffuse reticular appearance characteristic of the ER. Despite its abundant expression this chimera had no effect on the morphology of either the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria and we observed few apoptotic cells (Fig. 3, panels A–D and E--H). If CTF nuclear translocation were required to induce apoptosis, abrogation of the NES by treating these cells with the antibiotic leptomycin would lead to nuclear accumulation of CTF, induction of apoptosis, and Golgi fragmentation. Consistent with this idea, in cells treated with leptomycin (Fig. 3, panels I–L and M--P) the CTF accumulated in the nucleus, and within 4 h the Golgi apparatus was fragmented, cytochrome c staining became quite diffuse and mitochondrial aggregation was evident. Quantitative analysis (Fig. 3B) showed that less than 20% of GFP-NES-CTF expressing cells were apoptotic in the absence of leptomycin, whereas following drug treatment ∼55 to 60% became apoptotic within 4 h. Importantly, these results suggested that CTF did not interact with mitochondria directly to induce cytochrome c release, but were in agreement with our observation that CTF nuclear translocation was required to induce apoptosis. p115 Knockdown Delays Apoptosis—Our previous data are consistent with a model whereby caspase cleavage of p115 generates the CTF fragment that functions in enhancing or potentiating the apoptotic response. Consequently, depletion of p115 might transiently delay the onset of drug-induced apoptosis. To test this idea, cells depleted of p115 by using siRNA were incubated in the absence or presence of agonistic Fas antibody to induce apoptosis and the level of PARP, a marker of apoptosis was determined (Fig. 4). Fas treatment of cells transfected with mock siRNA led to efficient cleavage of full-length (∼110 kDa) PARP (∼66% of FL PARP was cleaved after 4 h) to release the p85 fragment (Fig. 4, panels A and B). In contrast, in cells with diminished p115 levels, ∼19% of full-length PARP was cleaved after 4 h compared with untreated cells (compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 4, A and B) suggesting that the presence of p115 CTF enhanced apoptosis. Surprisingly, the apparent level of the p85 fragment did not appear significantly different in mock and p115 siRNA cells. This was likely due to differential recognition of FL PARP and the p85 fragment by the PARP antibody and to the possibility that the fragment was further cleaved at later stages of apoptosis, which would be delayed by the absence of p115 CTF. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with anisomycin and apoptosis was induced via the intrinsic pathway (data not shown). Identification of the p115 CTF Minimal Apoptotic Domain— The preceding data demonstrated that generation of the CTF and its nuclear import stimulated the apoptotic response. To identify the minimal domain within the CTF that could induce apoptosis, a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 5, panel A). Representative micrographs of three such GFP-tagged constructs (residues 758–859, 884–962, and 859–962) are shown (Fig. 5B); FLAG-tagged CTF constructs gave similar results (data not shown). All three chimeras translocated to the nucleus; however, neither GFP-CTF-(758–859) nor GFP-CTF-(884–962) caused significant apoptosis. Most importantly, expression of the CTF-(859–962) truncation mutant induced apoptosis. These experiments suggested that amino acids 859–884 were required to generate the apoptotic phenotype. Indeed, inclusion of amino acids 859–884 in any of the GFP-CTF constructs resulted in both Golgi fragmentation and cell death, whereby cells became rounded, shrunken and in many cases the Golgi apparatus was not evident (supplement Fig. S2). Confirmation that residues 859–884 were key in effecting apoptosis came from expression of a GFP construct comprising 859–884 alone (Fig. 6A, panels A–D). In cells expressing this construct, GM130 staining was diffuse and the normal tight Golgi morphology of COS-7 cells was absent. Additionally, cells expressing a construct encoding amino acids 859–962 fused to GFP were positive for staining with an antibody that recognizes only active caspase-3 and not the precursor"
https://openalex.org/W1987789215,"A key set of reactions for the initiation of new DNA strands during herpes simplex virus-1 replication consists of the primase-catalyzed synthesis of short RNA primers followed by polymerase-catalyzed DNA synthesis (i.e. primase-coupled polymerase activity). Herpes primase (UL5-UL52-UL8) synthesizes products from 2 to approximately 13 nucleotides long. However, the herpes polymerase (UL30 or UL30-UL42) only elongates those at least 8 nucleotides long. Surprisingly, coupled activity was remarkably inefficient, even considering only those primers at least 8 nucleotides long, and herpes polymerase typically elongated <2% of the primase-synthesized primers. Of those primers elongated, only 4-26% of the primers were passed directly from the primase to the polymerase (UL30-UL42) without dissociating into solution. Comparing RNA primer-templates and DNA primer-templates of identical sequence showed that herpes polymerase greatly preferred to elongate the DNA primer by 650-26,000-fold, thus accounting for the extremely low efficiency with which herpes polymerase elongated primase-synthesized primers. Curiously, one of the DNA polymerases of the host cell, polymerase alpha (p70-p180 or p49-p58-p70-p180 complex), extended herpes primase-synthesized RNA primers much more efficiently than the viral polymerase, raising the possibility that the viral polymerase may not be the only one involved in herpes DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2030641212,"Streptococcal pullulanases have been recently proposed as key components of the metabolic machinery involved in bacterial adaptation to host niches. By sequence analysis of the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) genome we found a novel putative surface exposed protein with pullulanase activity. We named such a protein SAP. The sap gene is highly conserved among GBS strains and homologous genes, such as PulA and SpuA, have been described in other pathogenic streptococci. The SAP protein contains two N-terminal carbohydrate-binding motifs, followed by a catalytic domain and a C-terminal LPXTG cell wall-anchoring domain. In vitro analysis revealed that the recombinant form of SAP is able to degrade α-glucan polysaccharides, such as pullulan, glycogen and starch. Moreover, NMR analysis showed that SAP acts as a type I pullulanase. Studies performed on whole bacteria indicated that the presence of α-glucan polysaccharides in culture medium up-regulated the expression of SAP on bacterial surface as confirmed by FACS analysis and confocal imaging. Deletion of the sap gene resulted in a reduced capacity of bacteria to grow in medium containing pullulan or glycogen, but not glucose or maltose, confirming the pivotal role of SAP in GBS metabolism of α-glucans. As reported for other streptococcal pullulanases, we found specific anti-SAP antibodies in human sera from healthy volunteers. Investigation of the functional role of anti-SAP antibodies revealed that incubation of GBS in the presence of sera from animals immunized with SAP reduced the capacity of the bacterium to degrade pullulan. Of interest, anti-SAP sera, although to a lower extent, also inhibited Group A Streptococcus pullulanase activity. These data open new perspectives on the possibility to use SAP as a potential vaccine component inducing functional cross-reacting antibodies interfering with streptococcal infections."

F1 is its aqueous portion, composed of α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ subunits. The α and β subunits form an α3β3 ring, into which the γ subunit penetrates (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The conformation of the catalytic site with the nucleotide is more closed than that of the empty one. Thus, they are designated as the closed and open forms, respectively (5Abrahams J.P.

On the other hand, the 120° step rotation of the γ subunit in the fixed α3β3 complex on hydrolysis of ATP has been demonstrated for the α3β3γ complex from thermophilic Bacillus PS-3 (TF1) (8Duncan T.M.

Later, these subsets were modified to 80 and 40° ones (13Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinoshita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Google Scholar). Previously, we analyzed the chemical shift perturbation induced by ADP binding and determined the relative orientation between the N- and C-terminal domains of a monomeric β subunit using NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) in combination with segmental isotope labeling (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the conformational change of the β subunit from the open to the closed form (bending motion) upon nucleotide binding was similar to that found in MF1 crystal structures and was an intrinsic property of the β subunit. This could be a driving force for the rotational catalysis. Recently, ATP binding to the β subunit was also taken as the driving force generating the torque for the rotation of the γ subunit in the single-molecule analysis (15Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinoshita Jr., K. Cell.. 2007; 130: 309-321Google Scholar). Since the properties of the β monomer were found to be closely correlated with those of F1, the molecular mechanism of the bending motion of the isolated TF1 β subunit induced by the ATP binding was investigated in this work. It should be noted that the conformation of the ATP-bound β subunit can be investigated only for the monomer because of the lack of ATPase activity. For analysis of TF1, the crystal structure of MF1 was used as a structural model, because the crystal structure of TF1β in the α3β3 hexamer is very similar to the open form of MF1β (16Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure.. 1997; 5: 825-836Google Scholar). To make the notation simple, the sequential numbering of TF1 is used throughout this paper, even for the crystal structure of MF1, unless otherwise mentioned. The MF1 numbering of the major amino acid residues is given in the legend to Fig. 1. In the crystal structure of MF1 (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature.. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar, 6Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 14238-14242Google Scholar), the phosphate groups of a nucleotide are tightly bound by the P-loop (GXXXGKT), which is a conserved Walker motif for the phosphate binding (17Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J.. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar, 18Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1990; 265: 21279-21284Google Scholar). In the presence of a bound nucleotide, the β sheet composed of the β3 and β7 strands becomes longer than that in its absence through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds Leu-156/Ile-306, Gly-158/Ile-306, and Gly-158/Val-308 in the P-loop region (Fig. 1A). With the conformational change induced by the nucleotide binding, three new hydrogen bonds involving the P-loop residues are generated besides those between the nucleotide and the P-loop backbone. First, the side chain of Lys-164 forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl group of Gly-158 along with the phosphate group of the nucleotide (Fig. 1A). The second is that between the hydroxyl group of Thr-165 and the side chain carboxyl group of Asp-252 in Walker's motif B (17Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J.. 1982; 1: 945-951Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The third is that between the carbonyl group of Ala-160 and Nη-H of Arg-333, and the latter further forms a hydrogen bond with Oδ of Asp-311 (Fig. 1B). These hydrogen bonds should play important roles in inducing a global change from the open to the closed form, because the interaction between the phosphates and the P-loop backbone is too local to induce a global change. In addition, Arg-191 was indicated to be important for catalysis along with the involvement of Arg-365 (Arg-373 for MF1) of the α subunit (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature.. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar, 6Bowler M.W. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 14238-14242Google Scholar, 7Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell.. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of the hydrogen bond networks in the nucleotide-induced conformational change, a series of mutant TF1 β subunits were constructed. Using specific deuteration (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar) and segmental isotope labeling (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar, 20Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Oda N. Kyogoku Y. Uegaki K. Ito N. Ishino Y. Nakamura H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1998; 120: 5591-5592Google Scholar), the conformational properties of the mutant proteins were investigated by means of NMR. On the basis of the results and ATPase activities of the reconstituted α3β(mutant)3γ complexes, we propose stepwise propagation of the conformational change of the monomeric β subunit from the open to the closed form in solution. It was also found that the closed form in solution has a feature similar to the catalytically activated conformation. Construction of Mutated β Subunit Genes and Preparation of Mutant Proteins—The expression plasmids of β(K164A), β(T165A), β(D311A), β(R333A), β(R191A), β(R191Q), β(R191E), and β(Y307P) were obtained from pUC118β by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (21Yohda M. Ohta S. Hisabori T. Kagawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1988; 933: 156-164Google Scholar). For preparation of the specifically deuterated [2H-H, F, Y] proteins, cells were grown on a minimal medium with a mixture of amino acids. l-Phenylalanine, l-histidine, and l-tyrosine were replaced by l-[2,3,4,5,6-2H]phenylalanine, dl-[α-2,4-2H]histidine, and l-[2,6-2H]tyrosine, respectively. [2H-H, F, Y] represents the deuteration of a protein by these amino acids. Glyphosate was added to the culture medium to inhibit aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. The details are given elsewhere (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar). All mutant proteins were purified according to previous reports (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar, 22Tozawa K. Yagi H. Hisamatsu K. Ozawa K. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2001; 130: 527-533Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Plasmids for Segmentally Labeled Proteins—For the preparation of segmentally labeled β(K164A), β(T165A), and β(D252A), the genes of 1) the N-terminal fragment of the β subunit (1-271 residues) plus that of PI-pfuI intein (1-160) and 2) the C-terminal fragment of the PI-pfuI intein (161-454 residues) plus that of the β subunit (272-473) were constructed by PCR, respectively. Each gene was cloned into pET32a (Novagen) at the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The procedure for construction of expression plasmids was described in detail previously (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). The gene encoding the N-terminal fragment mutated at Lys-164, Thr-165, or Asp-252 was amplified by PCR, using a pUC118 (K164A, T165A, or D252A) β plasmid as a template. Preparation of Segmentally Labeled β Subunits—Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3) was transformed with each plasmid and then grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium (in the case of the unlabeled segment) or 80% 2H2O M9 minimal medium (in the case of the labeled segment) containing 0.5 g of 15NH4Cl and 2 g of 13C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The intein splicing reaction and purification of segmentally labeled proteins were carried out according to the reported procedures (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). NMR Measurements—Specifically deuterated mutant β subunits were dissolved at 0.5 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate 2H2O buffer, p2H 7.8. The exchangeable protons of the protein were replaced with deuterons by repeated cycles of lyophilization and dissolution in 2H2O. For MgAMPPNP titration, an aliquot of a 200 mm MgAMPPNP solution was directly added to 0.5 mm mutant β subunits. The MgAMPPNP solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of AMPPNP and MgCl2 in the same buffer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX400 NMR spectrometer at 313 K. Since the Tyr-341 signal shifts due to the stacking of the rings of Tyr-341 and adenine (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar), the Kd value of the nucleotide can be obtained by nonlinear least square fitting of its 1H chemical shift change to the equation, where δobs represents the chemical shift observed at [TF1βt] and [ATPt], which are the total concentration of TF1β and ATP, respectively. δE and δSAT stand for the chemical shifts of the ATP-free and bound forms, respectively. The segmentally labeled β subunits were dissolved at 0.4 mm in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaN3, and 10% 2H2O. To examine the effect of MgATP, an aliquot of a 200 mm MgATP solution was directly added to the wild and mutant protein solutions in a final molar ratio of MgATP/protein = 5 and 20, respectively. 15N-1H TROSY-HSQC spectra were recorded with a data size of 256 (15N) × 1024 (1H) points and spectral widths of 2912 Hz (F1) and 9615 Hz (F2) on a Bruker DRX800 NMR spectrometer at 313 K. For the measurement of RDCs, the β subunit monomer was partially aligned in a poly (ethylene glycol) (C12E5)/hexanol (molar ratio, 1/0.96) liquid crystal solution (23Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Google Scholar). The weight ratio of the β subunit to the surfactant was 0.05. Analysis of the MgATP-bound β subunit was carried out at a molar ratio of MgATP/protein = 5. The sample solution was completely homogeneous and pearly in appearance. 1H-15N dipolar couplings were recorded by means of a two-dimensional IPAP-type 15N-1H HSQC correlation experiment (24Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson.. 1998; 131: 373-378Google Scholar). All two-dimensional IPAP experiments were carried out with 512 (15N) × 1024 (1H) complex points. The final data sets comprised 3072 (15N) × 4096 (1H) real points with digital resolutions of 0.84 (15N) and 3.9 (1H) Hz/point. All NMR data were processed using NMRPipe and NMRDraw (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and analyzed with Sparky, a program developed by T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller (University of California, San Francisco). Determination of the Alignment Tensor—The alignment tensors of weakly oriented samples were determined with the program Module (26Dosset P. Hus J.-D. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2001; 20: 223-231Google Scholar). Residual dipolar couplings between spins i and j, Dij, can be described in terms of the orientation (θ, φ) of the internuclear vector relative to a common alignment tensor for the molecule, where Aa and Ar represent the axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor, rij is the internuclear distance, and S is the order parameter. Aa, Ar, and the Euler angles (α, β, and γ) describing the orientation of the tensor relative to the Protein Data Bank frame were obtained by least squares minimization of the target function, χ2, over all couplings associated with a given domain, where σij is the uncertainty for the experimentally measured couplings. The standard coordinate file of the β subunit obtained from the crystal structure of the α3β3 complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1SKY) (16Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Structure.. 1997; 5: 825-836Google Scholar) was converted to a new file that includes proton coordinates generated with Insight II. The experimental uncertainty, σij, was estimated to be 0.5 Hz for all signals. ATPase Assay—Reconstitution of the α3β3γ complex from α, β, and γ subunits and assaying of its ATPase activity were carried out as described previously (27Miwa K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1989; 86: 6484-6487Google Scholar, 28Tozawa K. Odaka M. Date T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1992; 267: 16484-16490Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The ATPase activity of the TF1βmonomer at 5 μm in the presence of 2 mm ATP was negligible during observation for 20 min. Roles of Lys-164, Thr-165, Asp-252, Asp-311, and Arg-333 in the Conformational Change—To identify the hydrogen bonds essential for the formation of the closed conformation of TF1β, we generated Ala-substituted proteins, β(K164A), β(T165A), β(D252A), β(D311A), and β(R333A). Every mutant protein was specifically deuterated for the aromatic protons of His, Phe, and Tyr (except for 3,5H). This allowed us to analyze the β subunit by 1H NMR despite its large molecular size of 52 kDa (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar). The MgAMPPNP titration of the 1H NMR spectrum of the wild-type TF1β is presented in Fig. 2A. Only Tyr-3,5H signals could be observed in the aromatic region because of the deuteration. Every signal was assigned by means of amino acid replacements in a previous report (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar). The signals of Tyr-148, Tyr-199, Tyr-307, and Tyr-341 shifted upon MgAMPPNP titration. Among the shifting signals in Fig. 2A, Tyr-341 can be used to monitor the nucleotide binding, because the aromatic ring of this residue is stacked on the adenine ring of the nucleotide. In contrast, the shifts of the Tyr-148, Tyr-199, and Tyr-307 signals are ascribed to the conformational change (19Yagi H. Tozawa K. Sekino N. Iwabuchi T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. Biophys. J.. 1999; 77: 2175-2183Google Scholar). Since the chemical shift change of the Tyr-341 signal was in the fast exchange regime only for MgAMPPNP among MgAMPPNP, MgATP, and MgADP, the dissociation constant (Kd) was determined only for MgAMPPNP. The MgAMPPNP titration curve of the Tyr-341 signal is presented in Fig. 2B for the wild-type and mutant β subunits. Kd was obtained from each curve, using Equation 1, as summarized in Table 1. Although the binding affinity is similar to that of the wild-type β for β(D311A) and β(D252A), it is reduced by 2-, 6-, and 20-fold for β(T165A), β(R333A), and β(K164A), respectively. This indicates that the side chain of Lys-164 is important for the nucleotide binding, in accordance with the previous report (30Löbau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between the nucleotide binding and the conformational change, the chemical shifts (δH) of the shifting signals (Tyr-148, Tyr-199, and Tyr-307) of the wild-type β were plotted as a function of the chemical shift change (ΔδH) of Tyr-341 for MgAMPPNP, MgATP, and MgADP. Since Tyr-148 and Tyr-199 behave in the same manner, the plots for Tyr-199 and Tyr-307 are presented in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. In the case of the former, the chemical shift change is a linear function of the amount of the bound nucleotide, showing that the conformational change represented by Tyr-199 ΔδH is induced through the nucleotide binding. Our previous RDC experiment on the MgADP-bound β subunit monomer revealed that this is the open/close conformational change (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). In contrast, the Tyr-307 signal started to change at ΔδH(Tyr-341) = about 0.25 ppm for MgAMPPNP and MgATP, suggesting that this is a second event following the major conformational change. In the case of MgADP, however, the change of the Tyr-307 signal is negligible, suggesting that the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide is involved in this conformational change.TABLE 1Kd values of the β(mutant) subunit monomers for MgAMPPNP binding and the ATPase activity of the reconstituted α3β3γ complexβ subunitsKdATPase activitya1 unit is the activity that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP/min at 298 K.AmountPercentagemmunits/mg%Wild type0.966.0100β(D311A)0.874.067β(R333A)6.17.7128β(K164A)20.6≤0.01β(T165A)2.40.061β(D252A)1.00.061β(R191A)0.820.081β(R191Q)0.780.081β(R191E)2.4≤0.01β(Y307P)1.3≤0.01a 1 unit is the activity that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP/min at 298 K. Open table in a new tab The plots for Tyr-199 and Tyr-307 of each mutant are also summarized in Fig. 3, C and D, respectively. In the cases of β(D311A) and β(R333A), the plots for the Tyr-199 and Tyr-307 signals are similar to those of the wild-type β, respectively. Although the MgAMPPNP-binding affinity of β(R333A) decreased, this mutation scarcely affected the conformational change induced by the nucleotide binding. This result indicates that the hydrogen bonds Ala-160/Arg-333 and Arg-333/Asp-311 depicted in Fig. 1B are not essential for the conformational change. In contrast to these mutations, β(K164A), β(T165A), and β(D252A) exhibited no chemical shift changes in the Tyr-199, Tyr-148, and Tyr-307 signals (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that these mutations completely suppress the conformational change induced by MgAMPPNP binding. This result indicates that the hydrogen bonds involving the amino group of Lys-164, the hydroxyl group of Thr-165, and the carboxyl group of Asp-252 play essential roles in the conformational change. A property of the β monomer is not necessarily that of the β subunit in F1 because of the involvement of the α and γ subunits. To examine the significance of the mutations mentioned above for TF1, the ATPase activity of TF1α3β3γ was analyzed for every mutant protein. The α3β(mutant)3γ complex with β(D311A) or β(R333A) maintained almost full ATPase activity, whereas that with β(K164A), β(T165A), or β(D252A) had lost it (Table 1). This reveals that the conformational change observed through the Tyr-148, Tyr-199, and Tyr-307 signals of the TF1βmonomer is actually associated with the ATPase activity, namely the rotational catalysis in TF1. The Effect of the Y307P Mutation on the Open/Close Conversion—It was indicated, on the basis of the crystal structure of MF1, that the extension of the β sheet structure composed of the β3 and β7 strands is a key conformational change for the open/close conversion (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature.. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar). To check this idea, Tyr-307 was replaced by proline. Tyr-307 is located in the stretch of Ile-306∼Val-308 that is converted to the β7 strand in the closed form (Fig. 1A), and proline is known as a secondary structure breaker. The Tyr-199 and Tyr-148 signals of β(Y307P) did not change at all on MgAMPPNP titration (Fig. 3C), showing that the conformational change to the closed form was completely suppressed by the mutation. In contrast, its Kd was not affected by this mutation (Table 1). The latter means that even the conformation of the P-loop located on the C-terminal side of β3 is not affected by this mutation. Nevertheless, the extension of the β3/β7 sheet was impeded because the protein remained in the open form even with a nucleotide bound. Also, there was no change in the 1H NMR spectrum of Tyr residues except for Tyr-307. Consequently, a local perturbation at Pro-307 should impede the open/close conversion through blocking of the β3/β7 extension. This was further confirmed by the ATPase activity of the α3β(Y307P)3γ complex. The activity was completely eliminated (Table 1), as expected. Since a mutation, Y307C, did not impair the ATPase activity of the TF1α3β3 complex (31Odaka M. Kiribuchi K. Allison W.S. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett.. 1993; 336: 231-235Google Scholar), a perturbation in the backbone structure should be the essential factor in this inhibition. Now, it can be concluded that the extension of the β sheet structure composed of the β3 and β7 strands is actually essential in the conformational change from the open to the closed form. Role of the Hydrogen Bond between Arg-191 and the γ-Phosphate—Arg-191 forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of AMPPNP in the closed form (Fig. 1A). To examine whether Arg-191 contributes to the conformational change on nucleotide binding, β(R191A), β(R191Q), and β(R191E) were produced. Their Kd values are shown in Table 1. The nucleotide-binding affinity is similar to that of the wild type for β(R191A) and β(R191Q) and one-half that for β(R191E). The chemical shifts of the Tyr-199 and Tyr-307 signals are plotted as a function of Tyr-341 ΔδH, respectively, in supplemental Fig. 1. They are similar to those of the wild type, showing that Arg-191 is not essential not only for the nucleotide binding but also for the global conformational change and a further change in the region around Tyr-307. However, the ATPase activity of the α3β(R191X)3γ complex (where X represents Ala, Gln, or Glu) was decreased to 1% of the original level (Table 1) in accordance with previous results (32Park M.Y. Omote H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 1994; 116: 1139-1145Google Scholar, 33Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 7670-7677Google Scholar). Therefore, Arg-191 should only contribute to the catalytic reaction. MgATP-induced Conformational Changes of β Subunits Monitored through the Backbone Amide Signals—So far, information was obtained only from the side-chain signals of Tyr residues of the β subunit because of its large molecular mass (52 kDa). We can also get information from the main-chain signals of most residues of the β subunit by use of segmental isotope labeling (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). To compare the results on the TF1β/MgADP interaction (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar), we have carried out MgATP titration of the TROSY-HSQC spectra for two kinds of segmentally 15N-labeled β subunits that are labeled in the regions of residues 1-271 (β(1-271)) and 272-473 (β(272-473)), respectively. The assignment of their signals has already been established (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar). The average chemical shift perturbation (Δδave) of each NH signal was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The value of Δδave observed at MgATP/β = 5 is presented as a function of the sequence in Fig. 4A (top). The perturbed residues with Δδave > 0.1 ppm are 136-138, 164-176, 181-184, 207-212, 247-250, 311-314, 329-345, and 408-428, which are mapped on the crystal structure of MF1βTP in Fig. 4B. There are distinct differences (e.g. residues 247-250 in Walker's motif B) in comparison with the reported results of MgADP titration (14Yagi H. Tsujimoto T. Yamazaki T. Yoshida M. Akutsu H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2004; 126: 16632-16638Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, bottom). However, the general pattern of the perturbation is s"

However for many downstream ES cell applications the feeder cells have to be considered contaminations that might interfere not just with the analysis of experimental data but also with clinical application and tissue engineering approaches. Here we introduce a novel technique that allows for the selection of pure feeder-freed stem cells, following stem cell proliferation on feeder cell layers. Complete and reproducible separation of feeder and embryonic stem cells was accomplished by adaptation of an automated cell selection system that resulted in the aspiration of distinct cell colonies or fraction of colonies according to predefined physical parameters. Analyzing neuronal differentiation we demonstrated feeder-freed stem cells to exhibit differentiation potentials comparable to embryonic stem cells differentiated under standard conditions. However, embryoid body growth as well as differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes was significantly enhanced in feeder-freed cells, indicating a feeder cell dependent modulation of lineage differentiation during early embryoid body development. These findings underline the necessity to separate stem and feeder cells before the initiation of in vitro differentiation. The complete separation of stem and feeder cells by this new technology results in pure stem cell populations for translational approaches. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the effect of feeder cells on stem cell differentiation is now possible, that might facilitate the identification and development of new optimized human or genetically modified feeder cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2002996251,"The Notch receptor is critical for proper development where it orchestrates numerous cell fate decisions. The Fringe family of beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases are regulators of this pathway. Fringe enzymes add N-acetylglucosamine to O-linked fucose on the epidermal growth factor repeats of Notch. Here we have analyzed the reaction catalyzed by Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) in detail. A mutagenesis strategy for Lfng was guided by a multiple sequence alignment of Fringe proteins and solutions from docking an epidermal growth factor-like O-fucose acceptor substrate onto a homology model of Lfng. We targeted three main areas as follows: residues that could help resolve where the fucose binds, residues in two conserved loops not observed in the published structure of Manic Fringe, and residues predicted to be involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) donor specificity. We utilized a kinetic analysis of mutant enzyme activity toward the small molecule acceptor substrate 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucopyranoside to judge their effect on Lfng activity. Our results support the positioning of O-fucose in a specific orientation to the catalytic residue. We also found evidence that one loop closes off the active site coincident with, or subsequent to, substrate binding. We propose a mechanism whereby the ordering of this short loop may alter the conformation of the catalytic aspartate. Finally, we identify several residues near the UDP-GlcNAc-binding site, which are specifically permissive toward UDP-GlcNAc utilization."

An l0050-deletion (ΔL50) mutation was found to impair type III secretion and bacterial adherence. These phenotypes and the localization of the gene product to the inner membrane support the hypothesis that L0050, renamed EscL, forms part of the secretion apparatus. Furthermore, in ΔL50, the amount of EspA present within the cell lysate was found to have diminished, whereas the EspA co-cistron-expressed partner protein EspB remained unaffected. The decreased EspA level appeared to result from instability of the newly synthesized EspA protein in ΔL50 rather than a decrease in EspA mRNA. Using both biochemical co-purification and a bacterial two-hybrid interaction system, we were able to conclude that EscL is a third protein that, in addition to CesAB and CesA2, interacts with EspA and enhances the stability of intracellular EspA.

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) 2The abbreviations used are: EHEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli; TTSS, type III secretion system; LEE, locus of enterocyte effacement.2The abbreviations used are: EHEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli; TTSS, type III secretion system; LEE, locus of enterocyte effacement. O157:H7 causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (1Nataro J.P. Kaper J.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 142-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once EHEC gains access to the gastrointestinal tract, the bacteria adhere to the epithelial cells of the intestine, where they secrete and translocate Tir into their host cells using a type III secretion system (TTSS) (2Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Tir then locates onto the host plasma membrane to serve as a receptor for the binding of the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin (2Kenny B. DeVinney R. Stein M. Reinscheid D.J. Frey E.A. Finlay B.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). This interaction allows a tight interaction between the bacterium and the host cell. The microvilli of the host cell are disrupted, and a pedestal-like, actin-rich structure forms beneath the bacterium (1Nataro J.P. Kaper J.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 142-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other effectors secreted by the bacterium further subvert the normal cellular processes including signal transduction, cytoskeleton patterning, and mitochondria membrane potential (3Clarke S.C. Haigh R.D. Freestone P.P. Williams P.H. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These pathological changes mark an infection presentation that is called the attaching and effacing lesion (A/E lesion) (1Nataro J.P. Kaper J.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 142-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TTSS is not limited to EHEC, and it is widely found in many other Gram-negative pathogens such as Yersinia, Shigella, Salmonella, Citrobacter rodentium, and enteropathogenic E. coli (4Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the TTSS evolved from a bacterial flagella secretion system, as several TTSS structural proteins share similarity with various proteins from this system (4Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In EHEC, the genes encoding the TTSS and their associated proteins are clustered in a 43-kilobase locus on the chromosome termed the LEE (the locus of enterocyte effacement) island (5Perna N.T. Mayhew G.F. Posfai G. Elliott S. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Blattner F.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3810-3817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar islands with a high degree of similarity also exist in C. rodentium and enteropathogenic E. coli (6Deng W. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6323-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Elliott S.J. Wainwright L.A. McDaniel T.K. Jarvis K.G. Deng Y.K. Lai L.C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In Yersinia the TTSS components have been studied in detail (8Cornelis G.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Based on a homology comparison, genes in the LEE found to be orthologues in Yersinia (4Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are named esc (E. coli secretion) series because these parallel the Yersinia TTSS component genes, which are named ysc (Yersinia secretion) (7Elliott S.J. Wainwright L.A. McDaniel T.K. Jarvis K.G. Deng Y.K. Lai L.C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, several secretion component genes are unique to the LEE, and these genes are called sep (secretion of E. coli protein) (7Elliott S.J. Wainwright L.A. McDaniel T.K. Jarvis K.G. Deng Y.K. Lai L.C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar).EspA, -B, and -D are translocaters of TTSS that are required for making a 120-Å-diameter needle structure enclosing a channel of 25-Å diameter (9Daniell S.J. Kocsis E. Morris E. Knutton S. Booy F.P. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for delivering the effector proteins EspF, EspG, EspH, and Map and the intimin receptor Tir into target cells (10Shaw R.K. Cleary J. Murphy M.S. Frankel G. Knutton S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). EspA polymerizes into the filamentous structure, and its polymerization is dependent on coiled-coil interactions between the C-terminal region of the molecule (11Delahay R.M. Knutton S. Shaw R.K. Hartland E.L. Pallen M.J. Frankel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35969-35974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in a way similar to flagella assembly (9Daniell S.J. Kocsis E. Morris E. Knutton S. Booy F.P. Frankel G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). EspB has been reported to interact with EspA (12Chiu H.J. Syu W.J. Microbiology. 2005; 151: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Hartland E.L. Daniell S.J. Delahay R.M. Neves B.C. Wallis T. Shaw R.K. Hale C. Knutton S. Frankel G. Mol.

Microbiol. 2001; 3: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the complexes that form at the distal portion of the needle structure may act as a pore at the contact site with the host cell membrane and participate in the initial step of bacterial adherence (15Nougayrede J.P. Fernandes P.J. Donnenberg M.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The function of l0050 of the EHEC LEE has remained poorly defined. This gene has been named orf5 in the LEE of both enteropathogenic E. coli and C. rodentium (6Deng W. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6323-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Elliott S.J. Wainwright L.A. McDaniel T.K. Jarvis K.G. Deng Y.K. Lai L.C. McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and no counterpart with a high degree of similarity has been described in Yersinia. Recently, the gene product has been implicated as being a component of the TTSS because, during a systematic deletion of individual LEE genes in C. rodentium, the corresponding mutant failed to deliver TTS proteins, but its absence did not affect the synthesis of Tir and EspB (16Deng W. Puente J.L. Gruenheid S. Li Y. Vallance B.A. Vazquez A. Barba J. Ibarra J.A. O'Donnell P. Metalnikov P. Ashman K. Lee S. Goode D. Pawson T. Finlay B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3597-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a low degree of similarity has been found to exist when it is compared with the YscL molecule of Yersinia (17Pallen M.J. Beatson S.A. Bailey C.M. BMC Microbiol. 2005; 5: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). No additional information about this gene has been reported. Based upon these facts, we have carried out more detailed studies. We report here that l0050 affects the stability of EspA and regulates the level of EspA. We also provide the evidence that the product of l0050 is inner membrane-associated and readily binds to EspA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Culture—The EHEC strain (ATCC 43888) and the cultivation conditions have been described previously (18Lio J.C. Syu W.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 855-863PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the TTS proteins, the bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2-equilibated M9 for 6 h.Plasmid Construction—l0050 was amplified from EHEC genomic DNA by PCR using primers L50F (ATGATTTATTTCTTAACAGACTTAA) and L50R (TCATTCCTGAATAATGCTAAG), and the fragment was cloned into pUC-T (MD Bio) to generate pUC-L0050. The DNA fragment containing l0050 was again amplified from pUC-L0050 using PUCT-FB2 (ATGGATCCGCCGCCACTCAT) and PUCT-RK2 (CTAGAACTAGTGGTACCAGAATT) as primers. The PUCT-FB2 and PUCT-RK2 primers anneal to the multiple cloning sites of pUC-T, and by doing so, BamHI and KpnI sites were introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The amplified DNA, thus, contained additional bases encoding six extra amino acid residues (GSAATH) at the N terminus of L0050. The fragment was then ligated to BamHI- and KpnI-digested pQE30 (Qiagen) generating the plasmid pHis-L50.To clone espA into pQE60, the primers ESPA-1 (CTAACCATGGATACATCAAATGCA) and ESPA-3R (CGCAGATCTTTTACCAAGGGATATTGC) were used to amplify espA using EHEC genomic DNA as the template. The PCR product was then treated with NcoI and BglII and cloned into pQE60 (Qiagen) digested with the same enzymes, creating pEspA. Plasmid pB312 expressing espB was also derived from pQE60 and has been described previously (19Chiu H.J. Lin W.S. Syu W.J. Arch. Microbiol. 2003; 180: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).An EspA-LacZ translational fusion construct pALE and a transcriptional fusion construct pALT were generated using pKM005 as the vector (20Su M.S. Kao H.C. Lin C.N. Syu W.J. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the first case, an espA fragment was PCR-amplified from pEspA using the primers XT5 (GCTCTAGACCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG) and ESPARB (TTGGATCCTTACCAAGGGATATTGC). The PCR product was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into pKM005 (20Su M.S. Kao H.C. Lin C.N. Syu W.J. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that was treated with the same enzymes to produce pALE. In the second case, an espA fragment was PCR-amplified using the primers XT5 and ESPARX (GCTCTAGATTATTTACCAAGGGATATTGC). The product was treated with XbaI and then ligated with XbaI-digested, calf intestinal phosphatase-treated pKM005 to generate pALT.The plasmid pEspA-HisL0050 was constructed by restricting pT5-EspA (20Su M.S. Kao H.C. Lin C.N. Syu W.J. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with BamHI and HindIII followed by ligating with an l0050 fragment obtained from BamHI/HindIII-digested pHis-L50. By so doing, a tag-free EspA and a His6-tagged L0050 could be co-expressed from the same plasmid, pEspA-HisL0050.Construction of the l0050 Deletion Mutant—A specific gene deletion of l0050 was created by homologous recombination as described previously (18Lio J.C. Syu W.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 855-863PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the 5′-flanking region of l0050 was PCR-amplified using the primers ESCS-R (CATTAGCCGTTCACCTTCGG) and L50XR (GCTCTAGAGACCCATTACAGCAAATAAG) with EHEC genomic DNA as the template. The 3′-flanking region was similarly amplified but using the primers L50XF (GCTCTAGATTCATAAAGTTCCATAAGGC) and L50Sal (GTCGACAACGATAACTGAGCTGGAAG). The PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) to generate pL50-R and pL50-L, respectively. Subsequently, these plasmids were separately digested with NotI/XbaI and XbaI/SalI, and the fragments containing the l0050-flanking sequences were three-way-ligated with a NotI/SalI-restricted suicide vector pKO3 (21Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pKO3-dL50, was then used to construct the l0050 deletion mutant, and the resulting ΔL50 was confirmed by PCR and sequencing (18Lio J.C. Syu W.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2004; 11: 855-863PubMed Google Scholar).Monolayer Infection Assay—The monolayer infection assay was carried out as described previously (22Knutton S. Baldwin T. Williams P.H. McNeish A.S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were stained by sequential reactions with rabbit anti-O157 anti-serum (Difco) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma). The cells were stained for filamentous actin with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). The samples were finally examined under a fluorescence microscope (Model BX51; Olympus).Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (23Hsu S.C. Syu W.J. Ting L.T. Wu J.C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All primary antibodies against the EHEC antigens were raised from mice except for anti-EspB (24Chuang C.H. Hsu S.C. Hsu C.L. Hsu T.C. Syu W.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2001; 8: 170-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-EspA (25Tsai N.P. Wu Y.C. Chen J.W. Wu C.F. Tzeng C.M. Syu W.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which were obtained by immunizing rabbits. The secondary goat antibodies (Sigma) were products conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The blots were finally developed using the chemiluminescence reagent, and the signals were detected by exposing them to x-ray film (23Hsu S.C. Syu W.J. Ting L.T. Wu J.C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Fractionation of Bacterial Components—The bacteria were fractionated into cytoplasmic, periplasmic, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions as described previously (26Gauthier A. Puente J.L. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3310-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The bacteria used were overnight-cultured in Luria broth and then 1:100-inoculated into M9 medium for further cultivation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h.RNA Extraction from EHEC—The EHEC cultures used for RNA extraction were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2-equlibrated M9 for 6 h. Total RNA was stabilized with RNAprotect™ Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) and extracted with a RNeasy™ Protect Bacteria Mini Kit (Qiagen), whereas contaminated DNA was eliminated by on-column DNase digestion. To ensure DNA was completely removed, the eluted RNA was re-treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs) (27Wang G. Barton C. Rodgers F.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2002; 51: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After digestion, DNase I was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction, and then RNA was precipitated by isopropanol precipitation. Total RNA (5 μg), quantified by NanoDrop™ (Thermo), was used to synthesize cDNA with a RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). The obtained cDNA was annealed with primers ESPAFXbaI (GCTCTAGAGGATACATCAAATGCAACATCCGTT) and ESPARSmaI (ATCCCGGGGTTTACCAAGGGATATTGCTGAAATA) to allow PCR detection of espA. The same batch and amount of cDNA was amplified using primers ESPBRTF (GGCGCAAAGCTATCAGATTCAG) and ESPBRTR (TTCCCCTGCTGGAAGTTTTCC) in a side-by-side reaction to detect espB. To ensure no DNA contamination, the same RNA prepared for cDNA synthesis was also incorporated in parallel when doing PCR amplifications.β-Galactosidase Assay—The plasmids pALE and pALT were separately transformed into the parental and the ΔL50 strains, and the bacteria were then cultured accordingly. Bacterial β-galactosidase activity was measured in these cultures using o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranose as the substrate as described previously (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (pp. , Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY): 352-355Google Scholar).Analysis of EspA Stability—The method of measuring EspA stability has previously been reported (29Creasey E.A. Friedberg D. Shaw R.K. Umanski T. Knutton S. Rosenshine I. Frankel G. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3639-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An EHEC strain harboring pEspA was cultured in M9 for 4.5 h, then 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce EspA production. After 30 min of induction, 250 μg/ml chloramphenicol was added to block protein synthesis. Bacteria at different time points were sampled, and the levels of EspA in the bacterial lysate were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-His6 antibody and anti-OmpC. The level of antigen signal on the immunoblot was scanned and quantified using Labwork 4.5 software (UVP, Inc.). A stability curve of EspA was then constructed after correcting the EspA signal against the sample loading control OmpC signal.Co-purification of L0050 and EspA—Pressure-pressed lysates derived from JM109 harboring pEspA-HisL0050 or pT5-EspA were prepared in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl (containing 10 mm imidazole), cleared by centrifugation, and loaded into ProBond™ nickel-chelating resin columns (Invitrogen) that had been pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Each column was then inverted gently at 4 °C for 1 h to allow thorough affinity binding. After a sequential washing with the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and 100 mm imidazole, respectively, the proteins retained on the individual columns were finally eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration up to 500 mm.Bacterial Two-hybrid Analysis—The two-hybrid system (25Tsai N.P. Wu Y.C. Chen J.W. Wu C.F. Tzeng C.M. Syu W.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was performed by following the procedures set out in the BacterioMatch™ Two-Hybrid System manual with the reporter strain hosting the reporter genes bla and lacZ (Stratagene). In brief, pBT was used to generate a bait protein fused with λcI at the N terminus, and a pTRG derivate was used to produce a target protein fused with an N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit. Interaction of the bait and the target proteins in the reporter strain yields a high level of β-galactosidase expression.RESULTSBacterial Attachment, the Secretion of TTSS, and the Synthesis of EspA Affected by Deletion of l0050—To characterize the possible role of l0050 in the LEE pathogenesis, homologous recombination was used to delete most of the l0050 gene from EHEC (Fig. 1A). The resulted mutant (ΔL50) was examined in terms of the bacterial attachment to the HeLa cells. The wild-type strain gave rise to numerous bacteria adhering to the HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Underneath the bacteria, actin filaments had condensed, as revealed by staining with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Fig. 1, C and D). ΔL50, however, gave an extremely low level of bacterial attachment to the cells (Fig. 1E) and had lost the ability to induce the host cell actin rearrangement (Fig. 1, F and G). When ΔL50 was transformed with pHis-L50 to complement the lost L0050, the bacteria showed a restoration of attachment activity (Fig. 1H) and actin condensed at the sites where the bacteria had adhered (Fig. 1, I and J).Examination of the LEE proteins synthesized in the bacterial lysates (Fig. 2A) indicated that EspA was hardly present in ΔL50, whereas Tir, EspD, EspB, and CesAB were detected in both the wild-type strain and ΔL50 (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). A successful complementation of L0050 with pHis-L50 (lane 4, stained with anti-His6-tag antibody) resulted in a recovered presence of EspA in ΔL50 (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). With respect to EspD and CesAB, the presence or absence of L0050 seemed to affect their levels to differing degrees; however, the effect was not as significant as the change in EspA, and the possible implications were not further explored. For the spent media, Fig. 2B clearly shows that secretions of the translocators (EspA, EspB, and EspD) and the effector (Tir) were totally lost in ΔL50 (compare lane 1 and lanes 2 and 3), and secretion was recovered by the L0050 complementation (lane 4).FIGURE 2Representative TTS proteins in ΔL50. A, Western blotting analysis of the proteins from bacterial lysates. ΔL50 was complemented by transforming with pHis-L50 that encodes L0050 tagged with His6 at the N terminus, and the proteins detected were compared with those in controls. B, analysis of the proteins from concentrated spent media. Note: Tir, EspD, EspB, and EspA are proteins secreted by TTSS, whereas CesAB is a cytoplasmic chaperone. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Biochemical Localization of L0050 to the Inner Membrane of EHEC—Because TTSS secretion was abolished by deletion of l0050, we speculated that L0050 could be functionally associated with the type III secretion machinery, and if we could detect the presence of L0050 on the membrane, this would support the hypothesis. To test this notion, the wild-type bacteria were disrupted after activating LEE expression by cultivation in M9 (30Kenny B. Abe A. Stein M. Finlay B.B. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disrupted bacteria were physically separated into cytoplasm, inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane fractions. Similar samples were also prepared from ΔL50. The proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. L0050 was detected in the inner membrane fraction of the wild-type strain but was not found in ΔL50. This fractionation was valid as three control proteins were detected as expected. Outer membrane protein OmpC was consistently found mainly in the outer membrane fraction. Maltose-binding protein is a periplasmic protein, and it was traced mainly to the periplasmic fraction. CesD2 is one of the chaperones for EspD and was seen in both cytoplasm and inner membrane (31Neves B.C. Mundy R. Petrovska L. Dougan G. Knutton S. Frankel G. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 2130-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All of the above proteins except for L0050 displayed similar distributions in both the wild-type and ΔL50 strains. Conclusively, L0050 exists only in the wild-type strain and is localized to the inner membrane fraction.FIGURE 3Localization of L0050 to the bacterial inner membrane. Fractionated bacterial contents were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Proteins that have previously been located in the different compartments of bacteria are OmpC (outer membrane porin C), maltose-binding protein (MBP), and a chaperone for EspD (CesD2). C, cytoplasm; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; P, periplasm; WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of EspA Enhanced by L0050—The results shown in Fig. 2A suggest that expression of authentic EspA is decreased when chromosomal l0050 is deleted. If so, it is possible that expression of EspA from an extra-chromosomal plasmid may also be affected by the presence or absence of L0050. To test this notion, plasmids expressing His6-tagged EspA and EspB molecules were separately transformed into ΔL50 and the wild-type strain, and the amounts of the His6-tagged proteins in the bacteria were then compared. Fig. 4A shows the results of Western blotting using anti-His6-tag monoclonal antibody. The fact that different samples were comparably loaded onto the gel is evidenced by the fact that similar amounts of OmpC were detected. The plasmid-encoded EspA showed at least a 10-fold difference in expression when we compared the wild-type strain to ΔL50 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). This observation is in a great contrast with His6-tagged EspB, which showed only a small amount of variation (lanes 5 and 6) between the two strains.FIGURE 4Enhancement of EspA expression from a plasmid in the presence of L0050. A, EspA, tagged at the C terminus with His6, was expressed from pEspA using various bacteria. A similar construct with EspB expressed from pB312 was used as a control. In both cases expression was under the control of the T5 promoter. Bacterial lysates were prepared in parallel and analyzed for the expression level of various Esp proteins using Western blotting with anti-His6. OmpC is present in the bacterial lysate and acted as a control for the protein loading. Note: the difference in the EspA levels between lanes 3 and 4 is far greater than that for EspB between lanes 5 and 6. Bands below the labeled EspB-His6 presumably are a result of degradation. B, the schematic illustration displays the positions of the primer pairs used for determining the expression of espA and espB in the lee4 operon. C, gel electrophoresis results of the PCR products of espA (upper) and espB (lower) from the same cDNA prepared using serial dilution (D.F.) (see text for the cDNA preparation from ΔL50) under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratios represent the relative amounts of espA to espB PCR products when semiquantified, a result supporting the hypothesis that the amount of the espA mRNA is comparable to that of espB mRNA in ΔL50. RNA labels the control experiments in which the extracted RNA was used in parallel for direct PCR to ensure that there was no chromosomal DNA contamination. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression level of EspA from the chromosome and that from the plasmid with a T5 promoter were equally affected in ΔL50, a fact suggesting that the decrease in EspA was not due to a direct influence from the promoters, and in such a case, the mRNA level of espA would not be affected by the deletion of l0050. To confirm this notion, total RNA was isolated from ΔL50 and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA prepared was then used to examine the level of espA mRNA present by PCR amplification (Fig. 4B). Because espA and espB are co-cistronically transcribed from the lee4 operon and because EspB, unlike EspA, is not affected by deletion of l0050 as seen above, espB should be able to serve as a reference control. Fig. 4C shows the side-by-side PCR results of espA and espB from the same cDNA preparation. It is obvious that, in ΔL50, the amount of espA mRNA did not significantly differ from that of espB. Therefore, the degradation of espA mRNA as a mechanism of EspA down-regulation in ΔL50 is unlikely.Reporter Assay to Explore the Effect of L0050 on EspA—To further inspect how L0050 regulates the expression of EspA, both a translational fusion and a transcriptional fusion were examined, with β-galactosidase as the reporter. To carry out the transcriptional fusion, lacZ with its own ribosome-binding site was inserted after the stop codon of espA (Fig. 5A). In pALT, β-galactosidase and EspA are translated from the same transcript, which is driven from the same T5 promoter. If a regulator has an effect on the stability or the structure of espA mRNA, it should impact the translation of lacZ. In fact, when this plasmid was transformed into the wild-type EHEC and ΔL50, no difference in β-galactosidase activity was observed (Fig. 5C). Therefore, it was concluded again that the presence of L0050 did not affect the mRNA level of espA per se. Conversely, there was about 2.5-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity with pALE (Fig. 5C), where the bacteria carrying an authentic L0050 (in the wild-type EHEC) was compared with the bacteria without such a protein (in ΔL50). Because in pALE lacZ is translated with its sequence directly fused to the C terminus of EspA (Fig. 5B), the differences in β-galactosidase activity sought to reflect the relative abundance of EspA."

https://openalex.org/W2022894345,"Previously we determined that inflammation responsive transcription factors AP-1 and SAF-1 synergistically regulate transcriptional induction of the MMP-1 gene. The present study investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of cooperativity between these two different groups of transcription factors. We present evidence that knockdown of SAF-1 by small interfering RNAs inhibits AP-1-mediated increase of human MMP-1 expression. The two key members of the AP-1 family of proteins, c-Fos and c-Jun, and SAF-1 form a ternary protein complex, which has markedly higher DNA binding activity than either a SAF-1 homodimer or a c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer. The increased DNA binding activity of the ternary complex is translated into a striking enhancement of their transcriptional activity by which synergistic transcriptional induction of MMP-1 expression is achieved. The SAF-1·c-Fos·c-Jun ternary complex efficiently promotes transcription from both SAF-1 and AP-1 sites of human MMP-1 promoter. The physical interaction between SAF-1 and AP-1 was demonstrated both in vitro by Far-Western and antibody pulldown assays with recombinant proteins and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), re-ChIP, and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Two distinct but adjacent domains in SAF-1 are involved in protein-protein contact with c-Fos and c-Jun; one domain resides within two N-terminal polyalanine tracts, and the other is present within the first two zinc finger motifs. Together these findings delineate the mechanism of synergy and the essential role of SAF-1 and AP-1 in up-regulating human MMP-1 expression under various inflammatory conditions.

A. 1995; 92: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). MMP-1 is a prominent member of more than 26 structurally related matrix MMP proteins that in concert are capable of degrading all components of the ECM at physiological pH (4Visse R. Nagase H. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (3592) Google Scholar, 5Birkedal-Hansen H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Although all MMPs possess some ECM-degrading capacity, the initial cleavage of triple helical collagen can be done only by a small subset of this family of which MMP-1 is one. Normal expression of MMP-1 is thus at a very low level and is highly regulated. Under many pathogenic conditions, MMP-1 protein concentration is markedly increased, primarily by transcriptional induction of the MMP-1 gene. Increase of MMP-1 mRNA by many inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoting agents is still a major challenge in successful inhibition of this molecule for the treatment of all MMP-1-related pathogenicities (6Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar).Several transcription factors have been implicated thus far for transcriptional induction from the MMP-1 gene; these include activator protein 1 (AP-1) (7Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and serum amyloid A-activating factor 1 (SAF-1) (8Ray A. Kuroki K. Cook J.L. Bal B.S. Kenter K. Aust G. Ray B.K. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). AP-1 comprises a group of proteins containing a basic leucine zipper DNA-binding domain. AP-1 family members consist of the Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, FosB) and Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) proteins (9Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 10Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Typically, AP-1 protein dimers bind to AP-1-binding elements, and two subunits are formed either by heterodimerization or homodimerization. In cells, the Fos/Jun heterodimer is the most predominant form of AP-1, which has a very high affinity for an AP-1 DNA-binding element, whereas the Jun/Jun homodimer exhibits a very low affinity for the same DNA. AP-1 proteins are transcriptionally induced by the action of various serum and growth factor regulated factors. For example, the c-fos gene is transcriptionally induced by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-activated Elk transcription factor, a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) family, (11Hipskind R.A.

Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Uberall F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SAF-1 transcription factor is a member of the multiple Cys2-His2-type zinc finger proteins, which also are activated in response to various inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, and oxidized low density lipoproteins (14Ray A.

Phosphorylation of SAF-1 via MAP kinase, protein kinase C, or protein kinase A markedly increases its DNA binding and transactivation potential (18Ray A. Yu G.Y. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Ray A. Fields A.P. Ray B.K. J. Biol.

A recent study from our laboratory indicates that concurrent participation of AP-1 and SAF-1 is necessary for full transcriptional induction of canine MMP-1 (21Ray A. Shakya A. Ray B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1732: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The SAF-1 and AP-1 DNA-binding elements are well conserved in the MMP-1 promoter among many species, which further underscore their importance. Functional cooperation between candidate proteins, in general, is mediated by protein-protein interaction, which is most effective when the DNA-binding elements of the involved transcription factors are proximally located. In correlation with this hypothesis, several studies are available that demonstrate the ability of nuclear proteins to bind each other and to mediate cooperative DNA binding and promoter activation when their respective binding elements are juxtaposed (22Gutman A. Wasylyk B. Trend. Genet. 1991; 7: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, in human or canine MMP-1, SAF-1 and AP-1 DNA-binding elements are not in close proximity but are more than 250 nucleotides apart. To understand the mechanism of cooperation between SAF-1 and AP-1, we have extended the study of human MMP-1, and in this report we present evidence for a physical interaction between these proteins, the formation of a ternary protein complex with markedly high DNA binding ability and a synergistic level of transactivation potential. Further, this study provides, for the first time, an identification of novel structural motifs in the SAF-1 transcription factor for protein-protein contact with AP-1 family members. These findings extend the paradigm that cellular machinery utilizes concurrent activation of a network of transcription factors and their cooperative interaction for efficient and optimal activation of genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—HTB-94 human chondrocyte cells derived from a primary grade II chondrosarcoma were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum. Transfection assays were performed as described previously (8Ray A. Kuroki K. Cook J.L. Bal B.S. Kenter K. Aust G. Ray B.K. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pSV-β galactosidase (Promega) plasmid DNA was used as an internal control and was assayed as described (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (Ed. 3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and CAT activity was measured as described previously (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (Ed. 3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). All transfection experiments were performed at least three times.Plasmids—MMP-1(-518/+63)-CAT reporter was constructed by ligating the human MMP-1 genomic DNA sequence from nucleotide position -518 to +63 into pBLCAT3 vector (25Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Mutant MMP-1-CAT reporters were constructed by ligating the respective mutant DNA fragments generated by megaprimer PCR into pBLCAT3 vector. Mutant SAF-1 and AP-1 oligonucleotide sequences used were 5′-CCTTGCTGACACTGCAGAATGTGGAATTACTAAC-3′ and 5′-GGATGTTATAAAGCAGATCTTAGACAGCC-3′, respectively. The underlined bases represent altered sequences. The SAF-1 CAT (26Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or AP-1 CAT reporter plasmids contained three tandem copies of SAF-1 or AP-1 DNA-binding elements into pBLCAT2 vector. Various SAF-1 fragments were constructed by PCR, and wherever it became necessary, initiator ATG and TGA stop codons were added to the coding sequences. The PCR-amplified DNAs were ligated to the appropriate expression vectors, including pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare), PRSET (Invitrogen), and pAR (27Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Primer sets used for synthesizing various SAF-1 derivatives, indicated by beginning and ending amino acids in parentheses, were as follows: SAF-1-(1-477), 5′-ATGTTCCCCGTGTTCCCTTGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCACCAAGGCTGGGAGGGAAGTGG-3′; SAF-1-(1-90), 5′-ATGTTCCCCGTGTTCCCTTGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGAGAACCGGGAGCAAGTCCAC-3′; SAF-1-(1-192), 5′-ATGTTCCCCGTGTTCCCTTGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGGCCCCTTGCTCTTTGTCTTCTTC-3′; SAF-1-(90-192), 5′-ATGCCGGTTCTCGCCGCCGCGCAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-TCAGGGCCCCTTGCTCTTTGTCTTCTTC-3′; SAF-1-(192-360), 5′-ATGAAGGGGCCCTACATTTGCGCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCACTCTGTTGAGTGCACTTGTCTGAC-3′; SAF-1-(192-413), 5′-ATGAAGGGGCCCTACATTTGCGCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCACTGGCTGTGCACCTTCATGTGG-3′; SAF-1-(90-301), 5′-ATGCCGGTTCTCGCCGCCGCGCAGGAATC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCCGAGTGGGAGAGCTTGTGTCG-3′; SAF-1-(192-301), 5′-ATGAAGGGGCCCTACATTTGCGCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTCCGAGTGGGAGAGCTTGTGTCG-3′; SAF-1-(413-477), 5′-ATGGCCAGGGTCCTCACCATGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′-AGCTCACCAAGGCTGGGAGGGAAGTGG-3′.Protein Preparation—Bacterially expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-agarose (Invitrogen) or glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography following the manufacturer's protocol. pET-cJun and pET-cFos plasmid DNAs were obtained from James A. Goodrich, and the c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer was prepared as described (28Ferguson H.A. Goodrich J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E98Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).GST Pulldown Assay—GST-tagged full-length SAF-1 or truncated SAF-1 proteins and control GST proteins (50 pmol each) were mixed individually with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and washed extensively (five times) with binding buffer. Next, GST-SAF-1, truncated GST-SAF-1, or control GST protein immobilized to Sepharose beads was mixed with bacterially expressed c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed extensively with binding buffer plus 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The proteins were eluted using elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm reduced glutathione) or boiled in protein sample loading buffer containing 1% SDS plus β-mercaptoethanol, analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 11% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.Far-Western Assay—Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 11% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in a modified HEPES binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 10 min at room temperature. Membrane-bound denatured proteins were renatured by sequential incubation of the membrane for five cycles (10 min each) in buffers that were diluted each time (1:1) with HEPES binding buffer without any guanidine hydrochloride. The membrane received a final rinse twice in HEPES binding buffer and then were incubated in a blocking solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5% bovine serum albumin) at 4 °C overnight, further incubated in overlay buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.25% gelatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing 32P-labeled pAR-SAF-1 at room temperature for 4 h, washed four times for 10 min each in a washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sarcosyl), dried, and autoradiographed. The pAR-SAF-1 protein was prepared by cloning a full-length SAF-1 cDNA in pAR vector (27Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) that contains a FLAG tag and a heart muscle kinase phosphorylation site, and purified protein was radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and heart muscle kinase (Sigma).siRNA Experiments—HTB-94 cells were transfected in duplicate with predesigned human MAZ/SAF-1-specific siRNAs (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As negative controls, mock transfection (no siRNA) and nonspecific scrambled siRNAs were used. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells in each treatment groups were harvested and divided into two parts. Also conditioned media were collected for measuring secreted MMP-1 and MMP-2 proteins. Total RNA was isolated from one portion of the cells using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar), and RT-PCR was performed using an RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen. The PCR primer sequences specific for the genes examined and the predicted product sizes, shown in parentheses, were: MAZ/SAF-1 (205 bp), 5′-GCCAGGGTCCTCACCATGTCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACTTGGAGCTCACCAGGG-3′ (antisense); MMP-1 (234 bp), 5′-ATGCTGAAACCCTGAAGGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGCTTGACCCTCAGAGACC-3′ (antisense); and GAPDH (178 bp) 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ (antisense). The second set of cells was used for Western blot analysis using either anti-SAF-1 (prepared as described previously (8Ray A. Kuroki K. Cook J.L. Bal B.S. Kenter K. Aust G. Ray B.K. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). The conditioned media were concentrated by freeze-drying in a lyophilizer, and the protein contents were measured. Fifty micrograms of proteins were subjected to Western blotting using anti-MMP-1 or anti-MMP-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).For cotransfection analysis, siRNAs were transfected into HTB-94 cells following the manufacturer's protocol, and 24 h after transfection the medium was replaced and further transfected with MMP-1-CAT reporter plasmid and pcDc-Fos plus pcDc-Jun plasmids. Cells were harvested 24 h later and used for the CAT assay.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Equal amounts (0.1 μg) of bacterially expressed proteins were used for an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which was performed as described previously (17Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes were prepared by labeling double-stranded oligonucleotides with [α-32P]dCTP. In some assays, anti-SAF-1 or anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were added during a 30-min preincubation on ice prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Anti-SAF-1 antibody was prepared as described (8Ray A. Kuroki K. Cook J.L. Bal B.S. Kenter K. Aust G. Ray B.K. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In some assays, 25 pmol of the following oligonucleotides were added in the preincubation mixtures as competitor oligonucleotides: SAF-1 oligo, 5′-CCCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCCCCATGG-3′; AP-1 oligo, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; and nonspecific oligo, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Re-ChIP Assays—ChIP was performed with a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HTB-94 cells (2 × 106 each) were stimulated with IL-1β (500 units/ml). Twenty-four hours later, formaldehyde (1% final concentration) was added directly to the culture medium and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min for cross-linking. Cells were lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) with a protease inhibitor mixture and sonicated to generate ∼500-bp long DNA fragments, and the supernatants were diluted with a dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, and protease inhibitors). The solutions were precleared with a salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose slurry and then incubated with anti-SAF-1 antibody or a mixture of anti-c-Fos and anti-c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 16 h with rotation. The immune complexes were precipitated with salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose. The agarose beads were washed sequentially in a low salt wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X-100, and 0.1% SDS), a high salt wash buffer (same as low salt wash buffer except containing 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors), and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA buffer. Immune complexes were extracted from the beads with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 50 mm NaHCO3) at 65 °C for 4 h.The Re-ChIP assays were performed as described (31Kouskouti A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, the eluant of the primary immunocomplex obtained with the first antibody was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and then further subjected to immunoprecipitation with the second antibody. Cross-linking was reversed, and nucleic acids were isolated from the eluates by proteinase K and RNase A treatments followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was subjected to PCR using primers covering the AP-1 or SAF-1 DNA-binding regions in the human MMP-1 promoter. PCR products were resolved in a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The primers used for amplification of the SAF-1 element in human MMP-1 (162 bp) were 5′-GAACTTCAGTCAGTACAGGTGCCGAACAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACGGTCAAAGAGTACTCCATGGTC-3′ (antisense), and those for amplification of the AP-1 element in human MMP-1 (132 bp) were 5′-TCTAATGATTGCCTAGTCTATTCATAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCAATATCCCAGCTAGGAAGCTCCCTC-3′ (antisense).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HTB94 cells, untreated or treated with IL-1β, were lysed using a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100). The proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-SAF-1 antibody, anti-c-Jun plus anti-c-Fos antibody, or control nonimmune IgG as indicated. Samples were fractionated in SDS-11% PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-c-Fos, anti-c-Jun, or anti-SAF-1 antibody as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody. Bands were detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSSAF-1 Knockdown Affects AP-1-mediated Transcriptional Increase from MMP-1 Gene—To determine the extent of functional cooperation between SAF-1 and AP-1, we used siRNAs directed against SAF-1 and examined the consequence of endogenous SAF-1 inhibition on AP-1-mediated up-regulation of the human MMP-1 promoter. Treatment of HTB-94 cells for 48 h with SAF-1 siRNAs successfully decreased the level of endogenous SAF-1 mRNA as well as protein, as compared with untreated or scrambled siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Having determined the specificity of SAF-1 siRNAs, we investigated whether knockdown of SAF-1 would show any effect on IL-1β-induced increase of MMP-1 expression. Both RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1C) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D) indicated that reduction of endogenous SAF-1 in response to SAF-1 siRNA treatment of cells substantially reduces the IL-1β-mediated increase of MMP-1 mRNA and protein levels. The specificity of SAF-1 siRNAs on MMP-1 expression was verified by examining MMP-2 protein levels in both untreated and IL-1β-treated cells. There was no detectable change in MMP-2 protein level between scrambled siRNA and SAF-1 siRNA-treated cells during IL-1β treatment or with no treatment (Fig. 1D). In the next experiment, we examined the effect of AP-1 overexpression on the MMP-1-CAT reporter gene in SAF-1-silenced cells. HTB-94 cells were cotransfected with MMP-1(-518/+63)-CAT reporter and an equimolar mixture of c-Fos and c-Jun expression plasmids. Intriguingly, the cells treated with SAF-1 siRNAs failed markedly, by more than 50%, to support c-Fos/c-Jun-mediated induction of MMP-1-CAT reporter expression, whereas cells treated with scrambled siRNAs showed no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 1E). These results suggested a requirement for SAF-1 protein to facilitate AP-1 action and optimal AP-1-mediated transcriptional induction of the MMP-1-CAT reporter.SAF-1 and AP-1 Synergistically Induce MMP-1 Gene Expression—For further assessment of a possible combined regulatory role of SAF-1 and AP-1 in promoting MMP-1 expression, HTB-94 cell were transfected with MMP-1-CAT reporter and expression plasmids of SAF-1 and AP-1. Clearly, simultaneous overexpression of both SAF-1 and AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) expression plasmids synergistically increased MMP-1-CAT reporter transcription (Fig. 2A). The synergy between SAF-1 and AP-1 was not due to any aberrant level of expression from transfected plasmids, as Western blot analysis revealed a dose-dependent increase of SAF-1, c-Fos, and c-Jun proteins in transfected cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that SAF-1 and AP-1 act in synergy to induce transcription of the MMP-1 promoter. To better understand how SAF-1 and AP-1 participate in the context of two respective promoter elements of the MMP-1 gene, single and double site mutant promoters were used (Fig. 2C). IL-1β-mediated induction of MMP-1-CAT reporter was partially inhibited when the individual SAF-1 or AP-1 site was mutated. Mutation of both sites resulted in a near complete loss of responsiveness to IL-1β. These results, showing that the participation of IL-1β activated transcription factors at both the SAF-1 and AP-1 sites to promote induction of the MMP-1 gene, were in accord with the previous observation indicating a requirement for both of these proteins.FIGURE 2Synergistic activation of MMP-1 promoter by SAF-1 and AP-1 proteins. A, HTB-94 cells were cotransfected with MMP-1CAT reporter plasmid, increasing concentrations of pcDSAF-1, and an equimolar mixture of pcDc-Fos and pcDc-Jun expression plasmid DNAs as indicated. CAT activity was determined from cells harvested 24 h after transfection. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments. B, detection of SAF-1, c-Jun, and c-Fos expression in transfected cells. Equal amount of cell extracts from HTB-94 cells transfected with increasing concentrations of pcDSAF-1 (lanes 1-3), pcDc-Jun (lanes 4-6), and pcDc-Fos (lanes 7-9) plasmids were immunoblotted with antibodies against SAF-1, c-Jun, and c-Fos as indicated. C, schematic showing physical maps of four reporter plasmids containing either wild-type or specific mutation at either AP-1 or SAF-1 or at both AP-1 and SAF-1 sites as indicated. HTB-94 cells were transfected in duplicate with these reporter plasmids. Following transfection, one set of cells was incubated with IL-1β (500 units/ml) for an additional 24 h. CAT activity was determined. These results represent an average of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Physical Interaction between SAF-1 and AP-1 in Vitro—We contemplated that the cooperativity between SAF-1 and AP-1 might result from a physical interaction between these proteins. To verify this idea, two sets of in vitro experiments, a Far-Western assay and a GST pulldown assay, were performed. The Far-Western assay showed a clear interaction between bacterially expressed His-c-Fos and His-c-Jun proteins with radiolabeled pAR-SAF-1 protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Radioactive SAF-1 did not interact with the control GST protein (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Input of each protein was examined by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). To gain more evidence, GST pulldown assays were performed (Fig. 3B). Both bacterially expressed His-c-Fos and His-c-Jun proteins interacted strongly with GST-SAF-1 protein immobilized to a glutathione-Sepharose column and were eluted by a molar excess of glutathione (Fig. 3B, lane 5). However when used alone, His-c-Fos or His-c-Jun protein showed no"
https://openalex.org/W2084137458,"The cloning and characterization of the gene for the fourth subunit of a glutamate-binding protein complex in rat brain synaptic membranes are described. The cloned rat brain cDNA contained two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 8.9- (PRO1) and 9.5-kDa (PRO2) proteins. The cDNA sequence matched contiguous genomic DNA sequences in rat chromosome 17. Both ORFs were expressed within the structure of a single brain mRNA and antibodies against unique sequences in PRO1- and PRO2-labeled brain neurons in situ, indicative of bicistronic gene expression. Dicistronic vectors in which ORF1 and ORF2 were substituted by either two different fluorescent proteins or two luciferases indicated concurrent, yet independent translation of the two ORFs. Transfection with noncapped mRNA led to cap-independent translation of only ORF2 through an internal ribosome entry sequence preceding ORF2. In vitro or cell expression of the cloned cDNA led to the formation of multimeric protein complexes containing both PRO1 and PRO2. These complexes had low affinity (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801)-sensitive phencyclidine-binding sites. Overexpression of PRO1 and PRO2 in CHO cells, but not neuroblastoma cells, caused cell death within 24–48 h. The cytotoxicity was blocked by concurrent treatment with MK-801 or by two tetrahydroisoquinolines that bind to phencyclidine sites in neuronal membranes. Co-expression of two of the other subunits of the protein complex together with PRO1/PRO2 abrogated the cytotoxic effect without altering PRO1/PRO2 protein levels. Thus, this rare mammalian bicistronic gene coded for two tightly interacting brain proteins forming a low affinity phencyclidine-binding entity in a synaptic membrane complex.

Thus, this rare mammalian bicistronic gene coded for two tightly interacting brain proteins forming a low affinity phencyclidine-binding entity in a synaptic membrane complex. A complex of four proteins purified from brain synaptic membranes was shown to have recognition sites for l-glutamate, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), 4The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; CPP, (+)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid; BP, binding protein; GBP, glutamate-binding protein; hp, hairpin mRNA structure; inter-ORF, sequence between two open reading frames; IP, immunoprecipitation; IRES, internal ribosome entry sequence; MK-801, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; TCP, thienylcyclohexylpiperidine; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RFP, red fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; (S)-4, (S)-1-methyl-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinium chloride. and other ligands characteristic of NMDA receptors in brain, including binding sites for the co-agonist glycine, the modulator spermine, the competitive antagonist (+)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), and the ion channel inhibitors thienylcyclohexylpiperidine (TCP) and (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) (1Ikin A.F.

Reconstitution of the purified complex into planar lipid bilayer membranes leads to the formation of channels with four ion conductance levels upon activation by glutamate or NMDA in the presence of glycine (3Aistrup G.L. Szentirmay M. Kumar K.N. Babcock K.K. Schowen R.L. Michaelis E.K. FEBS Lett.. 1996; 394: 141-148Google Scholar). These conductances differ from either the predominant NMDA-activated receptor-ion channels of brain neurons or those formed by reconstitution of the NMDA receptor subunits (4Stern P. Behe P. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci.. 1992; 250: 271-277Google Scholar), but are similar to those described for ion channels in rat spinal cord motor neurons (5Palecek J.I. Abdrachmanova G. Vlachova V. Vyklicky L. Eur. J. Neurosci.. 1999; 11: 827-836Google Scholar). The genes for three of the proteins in this complex have been cloned and expressed in heterologous cells (6Cunningham M.D. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol.

The gene GRINA for the glutamate-binding protein (GBP) subunit was identified as part of a “learning and memory” module of genes expressed in the entorhinal cortex of the mammalian brain (11Liang W.S. Dunckley T. Beach T.G. Grover A. Mastroeni D. Walker D.G. Caselli R.J. Kukull W.A. McKeel D. Morris J.C. Hulette C. Schmechel D. Alexander G.E. Reiman E.M. Rogers J. Stephan D.A. Physiol. Genomics.. 2007; 28: 311-322Google Scholar), and as the gene responsible for mental retardation and epilepsy in infants with a gene duplication in chromosome 8q24.3 (12Bonaglia M.C. Giorda R. Tenconi R. Pessina M. Pramparo T. Borgatti R. Zuffardi O. Eur. J. Hum. Genet.. 2005; 13: 586-591Google Scholar). Expression of GRINA in heterologous cells leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (13Matsuda A. Suzuki Y. Honda G. Muramatsu S. Matsuzaki O. Nagano Y. Doi T. Shimotohno K. Harada T. Nishida E. Hayashi H. Sugano S. Oncogene.. 2003; 22: 3307-3318Google Scholar), i.e. it may be involved in signal transduction in neurons. Because of the potential role of GBP and of the associated membrane complex in cell signaling, there is a need to fully characterize all components of the complex and reconstitute the intact complex in cells lacking in its expression. The genes for two other components of the complex have been cloned, those for the glycine-binding and CPP-binding proteins. But the gene for the fourth subunit has not yet been cloned. The fourth protein of the complex was identified on SDS-PAGE as an ∼40-kDa protein. To complete the characterization of this complex of proteins, the cDNA for the fourth subunit was cloned, and a corresponding genomic sequence in rat genome was identified. The presence of two open reading frames (ORFs) in the cloned cDNA, the expression of both ORFs in a single mRNA in brain, and the translation in brain of the two proteins coded by the cDNA, led to the investigation of the mechanism of translation of both ORFs. Translation of both ORFs through an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) was identified, as was the need for the co-expression of the two proteins to create a functional protein, a phencyclidine-binding protein. Purification of the ∼40-kDa Protein and Raising of Polyclonal Antibodies—Synaptic membranes were prepared from two rat brains (14Chen J.W. Cunningham M.D. Galton N. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol.

Chem.. 1990; 265: 16195-16204Google Scholar), and membrane proteins were solubilized in 25 ml of Buffer A (1% CHAPS, 0.5% n-octylglucopyranoside, 10% glycerol, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors) (7Babcock K.K. Chen X. Eggeman K.T. Kumar K.N. Decedue C.J. Michaelis E.K. Neurochem. Int.. 1996; 29: 507-519Google Scholar) and subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h). The supernatant was then loaded onto an l-glutamate ReactiGel (Pierce) column, and the protein complex was eluted with buffer containing 5 mm NMDA (16Wang H. Kumar K.N. Michaelis E.K. Neuroscience.. 1992; 46: 793-806Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE and silver staining of a single gel lane (6Cunningham M.D. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol.

Michaelis E.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1990; 265: 16195-16204Google Scholar), the ∼40-kDa band was identified, and the unstained portion of the gel in the location of that band was cut. The protein was then electro-eluted in 2 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.4, dialyzed against H2O, concentrated, and 100–200 μg mixed with either 0.5 ml of Freund's complete or 0.5 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits (17Eggeman K.T. Pal R. Walsh J. Kumar K.N. Michaelis E.K. Neurosci. Lett.. 1993; 158: 173-176Google Scholar). Serum was collected, and antibodies were characterized (15Eaton M.J. Chen J.W. Kumar K.N. Cong Y.

Screening of Brain cDNA Libraries with Anti-40-kDa Protein Antiserum—A cDNA expression library from brain hippocampus in λZap was plated on Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue and screened using the antiserum to the ∼40-kDa protein (1:1,000 dilution) as described (8Kumar K.N. Babcock K.K. Johnson P.S. Chen X. Ahmad M. Michaelis E.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1995; 216: 390-398Google Scholar, 9Kumar K.N. Johnson P.S. Chen X. Pal R. Ahmad M. Ragland T. Bigge C.

Approximately 106 plaques were screened, and phages from eight positive plaques were re-screened until a homogeneous population of immunopositive recombinant phages was obtained. Recombinant λ DNA was subcloned into pBS phagemid (Stratagene). cDNA Sequencing, PCR Amplification, and Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—cDNA inserts of phage and plasmid clones were sequenced on both strands (Thermo Sequenase, Amersham Biosciences; fmol Promega). DNAstar and Vector Suite software were used to analyze the sequences as follows: BLAST to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information, GenBank™, PSORT, TMbase, and SMART to determine various protein domains, organelle-targeting sequences, and protein family relationships. RNA structure 4.3 (18Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol.. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar) was used to determine the tertiary structure and thermodynamic stability of mRNA structures. PCR amplification of cDNA was performed (50 μl of 100 ng of DNA template, 250 μm of each dNTP, 0.2 μm of each primer described under “Results and Discussion,” 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 μl of DNA polymerase mixture, 2 μl of Taq, 5 units/μl, and 1 μl of Pfu DNA polymerase, 2.5 units/μl). PCRs were 30 cycles of 94 °C (45 s), 55 °C (90 s), and 72 °C (2 min). The DNA was purified from agarose gels and either labeled with [32P]CTP or ligated into pCR-Script (Stratagene) or pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Each PCR product was sequenced on both strands. Marathon-Ready cDNAs (Clontech) were used in 5′- and 3′-RACE of λ cDNA. Reactions were 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 94 °C (5 s), and 68 °C (4 min), and products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy and sequenced. Gel Electrophoresis, Northern Blot, and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Analyses of mRNA—Gel electrophoresis of RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription of the cloned cDNA was performed by denaturing the RNA in 50% formamide, 6% formaldehyde and subjecting it to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 6% formaldehyde and either 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA (TAE), or 0.1 m MOPS, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7. Northern blot analyses of total tissue RNA or poly(A+) RNA subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (2 μg RNA/lane) were performed (8Kumar K.N. Babcock K.K. Johnson P.S. Chen X. Ahmad M. Michaelis E.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1995; 216: 390-398Google Scholar, 9Kumar K.N. Johnson P.S. Chen X. Pal R. Ahmad M. Ragland T. Bigge C. Michaelis E.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Amplified DNA was labeled ([α-32P]dCTP, 3,000 Ci/mmol, random primer labeling, 5.6–6.1 × 109 dpm) and hybridized with RNA. For RT-PCR, brain mRNA was isolated by tissue homogenization in RNAzol, extracting with chloroform, precipitating by isopropyl alcohol, primer annealing to RNA (2.5–10 μg), and adding Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (50 units/μl) or Moloney murine leukemia virus RT and Taq Plus Precision DNA polymerase (Promega). PCRs were 40 cycles of 95 °C (1 min), 95 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s), and 68 °C (2 min); products were resolved on 0.7% agarose gels. In Situ Hybridizations—A 1.1-kb amplified fragment used for Northern blots was subcloned into PCR-script vector and used for in vitro transcription reactions to generate cRNA probes for in situ hybridization (19Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Bennett V.L. Zukin R.S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA).. 1991; 88: 4157-4161Google Scholar). The cRNA probes were synthesized in the presence of 35S-CTP and had a specific activity of 108 cpm/μg RNA. In situ hybridization was performed on cryostat sections of rat brain (19Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Bennett V.L. Zukin R.S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA).. 1991; 88: 4157-4161Google Scholar). Generation of Antibodies to Peptide Sequences and Immunocytochemistry—A peptide corresponding to amino acids 2–13 from the first putative ORF of the cloned cDNA (CEQSGGDALPTE) and one to amino acids 42–54 from the second (CRGYSIQHRRLVE) were synthesized, including a C-terminal cysteine (Quality Controlled Biochemicals). Purity was established by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (>95%). Immunization with each peptide, determination of antibody selectivity, and immunocytochemical studies on serial brain sections (20 μm) were performed (19Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Bennett V.L. Zukin R.S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA).. 1991; 88: 4157-4161Google Scholar, 20Pal R. Agbas A. Bao X. Hui D. Leary C. Hunt J. Naniwadekar A. Michaelis M.L. Kumar K.N. Michaelis E.K. Brain Res.. 2003; 994: 1-18Google Scholar). Alexa 458-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200 dilution) was used. Reporter Vector Construction—The following reporter vectors were constructed: (a) fusion proteins of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) with each of the two putative ORFs of the cloned cDNA; (b) dicistronic cDNA containing red fluorescence protein (RFP) in place of ORF1, the intervening sequence between ORF1 and ORF2 (inter-ORF), and EGFP in place of ORF2; (c) dicistronic cDNA containing firefly luciferase, inter-ORF, and Renilla luciferase; and (d) dicistronic cDNA containing firefly and Gaussia luciferase in place of ORF1 and ORF2, respectively. To construct the EGFP fusion proteins, ORF1 and ORF2 were amplified using reverse primers in which each stop codon was removed and the PCR products cloned at the BamHI site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The PCR primer pair F1 (5′-GGGTCGACGTTGGGCCATCACTGGA-3′, SalI) and R1 (5′-GGGGATCCTGTTCAAAAGGAAAAGGAGAG-3′, BamHI) was used to amplify ORF1; the pair F2 (5′-GGGAGCTCCTTTTCCTTTTGAACAATAG-3′, SacI) and R2 (5′-GGGAATTCATGATAAAACGACACACATG-3′, EcoRI) for the inter-ORF; the pair F3 (5′-GGGAGCTCATGAATTTCTACAGTGAACAT-3′, SacI) and R3 (5′-GGGGATCCTGCCCGGTGAATTGGCCAAG-3′, BamHI) for ORF2; and the pair F2 and R3 for the combined sequence of inter-ORF and ORF2. PCRs were 33 cycles of 95 °C (30 s), 60 °C (1 min), 73 °C (2 min), and 73 °C (10 min) in 50 μl containing 200 μm of each dNTP, 2 units of Turbo Pfu polymerase, 200 ng of each primer, and 1 ng of plasmid template. All primer combinations amplified the correct size of DNA products and were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes (underlined sequences in primers) and cloned into pEGFP-N1 pre-digested with the same enzymes. Dicistronic reporter vectors containing RFP and EGFP in place of ORF1 and ORF2, respectively, including the inter-ORF sequence between RFP and EGFP, were generated by digesting the ORF of RFP (BglII/NotI), cloning it into phrGFP (Stratagene), then excising the RFP insert (BamHI), and cloning it in B2 vector containing inter-ORF and EGFP. The dicistronic vector of firefly and Renilla luciferase separated by inter-ORF was constructed using pGL3-basic and pRL-null (Promega). The oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTTTCTTGGCATTCCGGTACTGTTGGTAAA-3′ and 5′-GATCTTTACCAACAGTACCGGAATGCCAAGAAA-3′ were annealed, and 10 ng of this double-stranded DNA was ligated to 400 ng of pGL3 pre-digested with BglI/HindIII (removal of SV40 promoter). To this vector, the sequence 5′-CTTTACCAACAGTACCGGAATGCCAAG-3′, predicted to form a thermodynamically stable stem-loop hairpin (hp) in mRNA when combined with the palindromic sequence 3′-GAAATGGTTGTCATGGCCTTACGGTTC-5′ in pGL3 vector, was introduced 5 bases upstream of the initiation codon of firefly luciferase. Subsequently, the luciferase and hp-Luc sequences were cut from the respective vectors and inserted in B2 (NheI site). The new vectors, pBLucMG and phpBLucMG, containing firefly luciferase, inter-ORF, and EGFP sequences, without or with the hp, were digested (EcoRI/NotI), and the EGFP ORF was excised and Renilla luciferase ORF (from pRL-null, Promega) inserted, thus forming the dicistronic vectors pBLucMRL and phpBLucMRL. A vector with firefly and Gaussia luciferase in place of ORF1 and ORF2, respectively, was constructed by cutting (HindIII/XbaI) the SP6 promoter sequence from pSinRep5 vector (Invitrogen) and ligating it to vector pBLucMRL that was digested with HindIII/XbaI. The resulting vector, SBMRL, contained the SP6 promoter/firefly luciferase/inter-ORF/Renilla luciferase. The inter-ORF and Renilla luciferase were removed from SBMRL (BglII/StuI) and replaced with Gaussia luciferase ORF (BamHI/XbaI of vector pNEBR-X1Glu (New England Biolabs)). The new vector, SBMRL-EBL, was digested (HindIII/AfeI) to remove firefly luciferase DNA and replace it with the combined firefly luciferase and inter-ORF sequence from SBMRL (HindIII/SmaI). The new vector, SMMRL, contained the SP6 promoter/firefly/inter-ORF/Gaussia luciferase. In Vitro Transcription and Translation of the Reporter Vectors and the Cloned cDNA—The cloned cDNA was transcribed using the T7 promoter (mMessage mMachine T7 kit, Ambion). For the in vitro transcription and translation of the cloned cDNA, T3 or SP6 RNA polymerase and reticulocyte lysate (TnT-coupled, Promega) plus phage cDNA or PCR-amplified fragments of phage cDNA were used. Reactions (reticulocyte lysate, 1 μg, and RNasin, 40 units/μl, final volume of 25 μl) were at 30 °C (90 min). Synthesized proteins were used in ligand binding assays or were labeled with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Noncapped mRNA containing firefly luciferase/inter-ORF/Gaussia luciferase was synthesized using vector SMMRL (20 μg) cut with SspI, purified, and introduced as template (5 μg) in RiboMAX™ large scale RNA production system, SP6 (Promega). Synthesis of mRNA proceeded for 2 h in the absence of 7-methylguanosine nucleotide (2 h). The DNA was digested with DNase and the RNA purified. Cell Transfection with Cloned cDNA, Reporter Vectors, and Noncapped mRNA and Measurement of Luciferase Activity—CHO and SK-N-SH cells were used for protein expression studies. CHO cells (2 ml, 1–2 × 105 cells/ml, Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum) were plated in either 35-mm dishes or 6-well plates, incubated for 18–36 h (50–80% confluence), washed (Opti-MEM reduced serum medium), and incubated for 5 h (37 °C) with 1 ml of Lipofectamine/plasmid DNA mixture (2.5–3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, 1 μg of DNA) in Opti-MEM. The transfection mixture was removed, and Ham's F-12 with serum was added, and the cells were harvested 43 h later in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. The suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer (in mm: 1 EDTA, 150 NaCl, 0.1 dithiothreitol, 0.1 benzamide, 0.1 benzamidine-HCl, 0.1 aminoethylbenzene sulfonate, 10 Tris-SO4, pH 7.4, plus MINI protease inhibitor mixture tablet, Roche Applied Science), incubated at 0 °C for 15 min, sonicated, and then centrifuged (16,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was concentrated by filtration (10-kDa cut-off, Amicon) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. For transfection of CHO cells with in vitro-synthesized RNA, the RNA (2 μg) was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (1 μg/2.5 μl) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml, 50 °C, 1 h), heated at 95 °C for 30 min, cooled to 37 °C, and added to cell cultures (24-well plates). Following a 4-h incubation, the medium was changed to serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated for 24 h before measuring luciferase activities. Luciferase activities in cell extracts were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Luminescence was measured three times for 0.5 s (LumiCount, Packard Instrument Co.). Enzyme activity was expressed as relative luminescence units. Promoterless SMMRL vector was used as a transfection control in the RNA transfection experiments. Each transfection experiment was performed at least twice using triplicate or quadruplicate transfections for each experiment. SK-N-SH cells were cultured in 24-well plates pre-coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin (0.5 ml/well, 0.5–1.0 × 105 cells/well), grown for 5 days in serum-containing Ham's F-12 (50–80% confluence), and then transfected as described above. The transfection mixture was removed and 0.5 ml of Ham's F-12 serum added to each well, and 24 h from the start of transfection, the culture medium was changed to serum-free Ham's F-12 (induction of differentiation). The cells were harvested 48 h later and lysed as above. Immunohistochemistry and Immunoprecipitation (IP) of Protein Complexes—Immune labeling of SK-N-SH cells was performed as described (20Pal R. Agbas A. Bao X. Hui D. Leary C. Hunt J. Naniwadekar A. Michaelis M.L. Kumar K.N. Michaelis E.K. Brain Res.. 2003; 994: 1-18Google Scholar). For double labeling with SYTOX Blue (Invitrogen) and antibody, SYTOX Blue was added after all antibody labeling reactions were completed. Excess SYTOX was removed by multiple washings with Tris borate-EDTA and PBS buffers, and the cells were examined by confocal microscopy (458 nm excitation for SYTOX; 568 nm for Alexa 568 dye-secondary antibody). For the IP of proteins expressed in CHO cells, 500 μl of protein A-Trisacryl beads pre-washed with H2O and antibody-binding buffer (50 mm sodium borate, pH 8.2) were incubated with antibodies in binding buffer (200 μg/ml, 30 min, 23 °C), and the bound antibody was cross-linked to protein A by disuccinimidyl suberate (21Agbas A. Chen X. Hong O. Kumar K.N. Michaelis E.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med.. 2002; 32: 512-524Google Scholar). Protein (500 μg) extracted from cells (in 1 ml buffer: 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) was applied to the beads and incubated for 3 h (23 °C), and bound proteins were eluted as described (20Pal R.

Ligand Binding and Cell Viability Assays—Binding of [3H]glycine (100 nm), [3H]TCP (50 nm), or l-[3H]glutamate (100 nm) to either 5 μl of in vitro expressed protein or 50 μg of the particulate fraction from CHO cells was measured (6Cunningham M.D. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1990; 265: 7768-7778Google Scholar, 14Chen J.W. Cunningham M.D. Galton N. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1988; 263: 417-426Google Scholar). The particulate fraction from CHO cells was obtained by centrifugation of cell lysates at 150,000 × g for 1 h and resuspension of the pellet in 10 mm Tris-SO4, pH 7.4. Nonspecific ligand binding was that measured in the presence of 100 μm d-serine (for [3H]glycine), 100 μm NMDA (for l-[3H]glutamate), and 100 μm or 1 mm MK-801 (for [3H]TCP); data were analyzed as described (2Kumar K.N. Babcock K.K. Johnson P.S. Chen X. Eggeman K.T. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 27384-27393Google Scholar, 6Cunningham M.D. Michaelis E.K. J. Biol.

When [3H]glycine was used, all samples were pretreated with 100 μm strychnine. Cell viability was determined at either 48 h (CHO cells) or 72 h (SK-N-SH cells) post-transfection by measuring (Celltiter 96 kit, Promega) the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (22Xia Y. Ragan R.E. Seah E.E. Michaelis M.L. Michaelis E.K. Neurochem. Res.. 1995; 20: 617-629Google Scholar). Screening of a Brain cDNA Library and Cloning of a Dicistronic cDNA—The antiserum raised against the ∼40-kDa protein subunit of the purified complex had a titer of 1:2,000, reacted with as low a concentration of synaptic membrane proteins as 10 ng (data not shown), and labeled a 52-kDa band in synaptic membrane proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). When the antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from synaptic membranes, it precipitated an ∼56-kDa protein (data not shown). Thus, the molecular size of the native protein was thought to be 52–56-kDa, with the ∼40-kDa protein possibly being a degradation product. Screening of a rat hippocampal cDNA expression library with the antiserum identified several λ phage clones. The largest insert was 1.3 kb, and this was subcloned into pBS phagemid. Further library screening using the 1.3-kb cDNA insert as probe did not lead to the identification of clones with larger inserts. In addition, performance of RACE, either in the 5′ or 3′ direction, did not yield DNA sequence extensions. Sequencing of the cDNA on both strands in λ phage and pBS yielded identical sequences (GenBank™ accession number EF495200). There were five potential initiation ATG codons in the 5′-terminal region, four of which were followed by in-frame termination codons leading to only short putative ORFs (Fig. 1A). The fifth initiation codon was associated with a putative ORF (ORF1) 246 bp long. Following the termination codon of ORF1, there were eight potential initiation codons, seven of which were followed by termination codons. The eighth initiation codon was associated with an ORF (ORF2) 267 bp long (Fig. 1A). ORF2 started 410 bp downstream from the termination codon of ORF1 and was offset by a -1 frameshift. Analysis of the structure of the 410-bp sequence between the two putative ORFs (18Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol.. 1999; 288: 911-940Google Scholar) predicted a structure with four Y-type stem-loops. The estimated Gibbs free energy of folding of the inter-ORF mRNA was -70 kcal mol-1, indicative of stable mRNA structures that would inhibit ribosome scanning through this region (23Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Google Scholar). Thus, it was not certain that translation of ORF2 could occur in vivo. ORF1 encoded a protein of 81 amino acids with a predicted nonglycosylated molecular size of 8.9 kDa (PRO1) and, if ORF2 were translated, it coded for a protein containing 88 amino acids with a size of 9.5 kDa (PRO2). BLAST analyses indicated that the sequences for PRO1 and PRO2 were unique. In PRO1, there was a region of eight consecutive Ser followed by three repeats of SIYL (Fig. 1A). BLAST analyses performed using only the sequences containing the eight Ser residues revealed several proteins in plants and animals that had long tracts of Ser residues. Included among them were a rat brain and immune system phosphatase, PHLPPL,"
https://openalex.org/W1965054918,"The mean input and variance of the total synaptic input to a neuron can vary independently, suggesting two distinct information channels. Here we examine the impact of rapidly varying signals, delivered via these two information conduits, on the temporal dynamics of neuronal firing rate responses. We examine the responses of model neurons to step functions in either the mean or the variance of the input current. Our results show that the temporal dynamics governing response onset depends on the choice of model. Specifically, the existence of a hard threshold introduces an instantaneous component into the response onset of a leaky-integrate-and-fire model that is not present in other models studied here. Other response features, for example a decaying oscillatory approach to a new steady-state firing rate, appear to be more universal among neuronal models. The decay time constant of this approach is a power-law function of noise magnitude over a wide range of input parameters. Understanding how specific model properties underlie these response features is important for understanding how neurons will respond to rapidly varying signals, as the temporal dynamics of the response onset and response decay to new steady-state determine what range of signal frequencies a population of neurons can respond to and faithfully encode."
https://openalex.org/W2043699654,"The manner by which axons distribute synaptic connections along dendrites remains a fundamental unresolved issue in neuronal development and physiology. We found in vitro and in vivo indications that dendrites determine the density, location and strength of their synaptic inputs by controlling the distance of their branches from those of their neighbors. Such control occurs through collective branch convergence, a behavior promoted by AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptor activity. At hubs of convergence sites, the incidence of axo-dendritic contacts as well as clustering levels, pre- and post-synaptic protein content and secretion capacity of synaptic connections are higher than found elsewhere. This coupling between synaptic distribution and the pattern of dendritic overlapping results in 'Economical Small World Network', a network configuration that enables single axons to innervate multiple and remote dendrites using short wiring lengths. Thus, activity-mediated regulation of the proximity among dendritic branches serves to pattern and strengthen neuronal connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2072635977,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway has been associated with a variety of cellular functions ranging from cell cycle regulation to tissue development. Although years of research have extensively characterized this signaling pathway, little is known as to how specific cellular events are coordinated by its activation. Here we demonstrate that Dapr (differentiation-associated protein), a novel protein, appears to focus one aspect of this pathway by acting as a putative scaffold protein during skeletal muscle differentiation. We present for the first time a description of this protein using in silico analysis. dapr was discovered through a previous study employing chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarray analysis experiments as being regulated by myocyte-enhancing factor 2, a key transcription factor involved in the differentiation of skeletal muscle tissue. In this study we show that during the course of differentiation, Dapr binds to the PI3K signaling pathway member protein kinase B (PKB). In C2C12 myoblast cells before differentiation Dapr is localized to the cytosol, migrating with PKB to the membrane after initiation of muscle differentiation. Knockdown of Dapr by RNAi resulted in inhibition of myotube formation. Our findings indicate that Dapr is a key component required by myoblasts for orchestrating their differentiation during myogenesis.

Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway typically begins with signaling through the activated surface receptor by insulin growth factor 1 (2Galvin C.D. Hardiman O. Nolan C.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 200: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Downstream, PI3K-targeted phosphorylation produces the lipid products phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. These phosphoinositides provide membrane anchoring points for pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins with binding motifs to them. Protein kinase B (PKB, also known as AKT) is one such protein (3Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The targeted localization of PKB and other kinases to the plasma membrane is an important part of their activation (4Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R.

Indeed, the compartmentalization of kinases within the cell has come to be known as a key regulatory mechanism of signaling cascades. A kinase-associated protein (6Smith F.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 316-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) is an example of one of the first proteins identified to function in this manner. Not only does A kinase-associated protein localize kinases to specific parts of the cell, it also brings proteins together within proximity of one another; in this case, protein phosphatase 2 and protein kinase A (7Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Among its many important roles as a signal transducer, including insulin-mediated signaling, PKB has also been shown to play a pivotal role in cellular differentiation(1Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D.

Physiol. 2008; 215: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Its role in the development of myotubes has been well established. Initial work demonstrated that PI3K inhibition causing disrupted myoblast differentiation could be countered by expression of constitutively active PKB (1Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Subsequent work revealed a positive feedback mechanism, with PKBβ transcription regulated by MYOD, a muscle-specific transcription factor, and a subsequent effect on MYOD and MEF2 transactivation (10Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A. Nicosia S.V. Nobori T. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the exact nature and coordination of the process of muscle cell differentiation. One of these is how a protein involved in so many different signaling pathways, such as PKB, is focused into a particular biological task like cellular differentiation. Here, we have identified a novel gene, Dapr (differentiation-associated protein), which we propose as a possible candidate fulfilling this role. We will provide evidence that Dapr is a previously unknown and uncharacterized protein that seems to be involved in the localization of a key component in the PI3K signaling pathway during skeletal muscle differentiation. We will demonstrate that the regulation of this physiological process occurs through a specific chain of events that involves Dapr and that its presence is essential for myoblast differentiation to occur. Cloning of dapr Gene and DNA Constructs—Myristoylated and HA-PKBpcDNA3 were generously provided by Dr. J. Woodgett (University of Toronto). Full-length dapr was originally cloned from a cDNA library using primers designed to include the full open reading frame (5′-ATGGAAGCTTTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTGATTGGTGCTTTGGTA-3′). Amino-terminal Myc-tagged Dapr was generated by incorporating the Myc epitope into the sense primer. For expression into mammalian cells, Dapr was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). This was then used as the template to generate all deletion mutants. GST fusion proteins were generated by subcloning directly into the pGEX4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) and expressed bacterially. Cell Culture—C2C12 murine skeletal muscle cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic (penicillin and streptomycin) in the presence of 5% CO2. Induction of differentiation involved growing cells to 80% confluence then replacing the growth media with differentiation media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% horse serum, 1% antibiotic and 10 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor 1). Transient transfection of the cell lines was accomplished by incubating cells (∼60% confluence) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the appropriate expression vector. Expression of the protein product was allowed to proceed for the next 48 h. At this time, the cells were rinsed twice with 1× PBS and then harvested for subsequent analysis. GST Fusion Protein Preparation and Association—GST fusion proteins were expressed using the GST Gene Fusion System (GE Healthcare). After overnight induction at 30 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) 1 liter of bacterial culture was pelleted and resuspended in 50 ml of PBS plus 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cells were sonicated using a Branson 450 Sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT), and the proteins were solubilized by the addition of 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was bound to 500 μl of glutathione-agarose beads prepared as per the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors, and resuspended to a 50% slurry. Aliquots of each were run on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm protein production (supplemental Fig. 4). C2C12 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS plus 1 mm EDTA and lysed by incubating on ice for 10 min in 1.5 ml of Gentle Soft Lysis Buffer (10 mm NaCl, 20 mm PIPES, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μm Na3VO4) and protease inhibitors. Harvested cell lysate was passaged through a 21-gauge needle, and debris was removed by pelleting at 16000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared using 50 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads alone for 15 min at 4 °C with rocking. Precleared lysate was transferred to a fresh 2-ml tube, and 100 μl of the 50% slurry of GST fusion protein bound to agarose beads was added. Samples were incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h and then washed with Gentle Soft Lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were boiled in 6× protein loading buffer for 5 min. Differential Centrifugation—All steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. At the appropriate time points, C2C12 cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm EDTA and harvested with PBS/EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 300 μl HES buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 6 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture) and passed through a 21-gauge needle. Next, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet (P1) was then resuspended in 300 μl of HES buffer for subsequent processing and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant from this spin was then transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 180,000 × g for 1.5 h resulting in a cytosolic fraction (supernatant). Cytosolic fractions were concentrated by spinning at 1.5 × g for 1 h to a final volume of 250 μl using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). To isolate plasma membrane, the P1 pellet was layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Material from the interphase containing the plasma membrane fraction was collected, and the final volume was adjusted to 2 ml in HES buffer. The membrane was pelleted by spinning the samples at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS plus EDTA with protease inhibitors and 10 μl of 6× protein loading buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation—Approximately 1 × 106 cells were lysed by rocking for 20 min at 4 °C with 400 μl of EBC lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL). Debris was removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated 1.5 h at 4 °C with a 50% protein A bead slurry pre-blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg of a monoclonal HA antibody (Upstate, Billerica, MA) or 50 μl of Myc hybridoma. After 5 washes with NETN (0.5% IGEPAL, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) buffer at room temperature, beads were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× protein loading buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred (semidry electroblotter, GE Healthcare) onto PVDF membranes (Hybond-C, GE Healthcare). Blots were probed with antibodies directed against PKB, PI3K, MKK6, β-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), sarcomeric actin (Sigma), HA (Upstate), and Myc (gift from J. Woodgett). The appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used against each respective primary antibody. Blots were incubated in ECL reagent (Western Lightning Chemiluminescence reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film for visualization. Real-time PCR—Triplicate reactions were carried out on each sample of cDNA generated from total RNA. Reactions were carried out as per manufacturer's instructions using the Full velocity SybrGreen qPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A final concentration of 0.1 μm for both the forward and reverse primers was found to provide the cleanest signal. PCR primer sequences used were as follows: dapr forward 5′-CACCGTTGTACGGCTTCGA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCAAGAATGGAGCCAGCTTTC-3′; cyclophilin A forward 5′-ATGCTGGACCAAACACAA-3′ and reverse 5′-CATGGCTTCCACAATGTT-3′. All reactions were run on a Stratagene MX3000P using the following program: 95 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 10 s, then 30 s at 55 °C for 40 cycles. Results were analyzed using the accompanying software. siRNA Knockdown—C2C12 cells were propagated into 6-well dishes (Nunc, Rochester, NY) in 3 ml of propagation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus antibiotics fortified with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)) and allowed to settle overnight. The cells were transfected at ∼20% confluence and then 24 h later at ∼50% confluence as follows; 40 nm siRNA oligo (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) were combined in 500 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). siRNA oligo was then incubated with cells at 37 °C for 4 h at which time the Opti-MEM was replaced with propagation medium, and cells were allowed to recover overnight. siRNA oligo sequence pairs were as follows: 5′-UAUAAUUGCACACCUUGGCCUUUCC-3′, 5′-GGAAAGGCCAAGGUGUGCAAUUAUA-3′. A medium GC content oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) was used as a control. Two other oligos were tested for their ability to knockdown Dapr protein expression (data not shown). All three oligos were found to be equally capable of reducing Dapr protein expression. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—C2C12 cells were propagated in 12-well Falcon dishes on washed, autoclaved 18-mm glass coverslips coated with 25 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma). After 2 washes in PBS, cells were fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.02% glutaraldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized by dipping coverslips in methanol stored at -20 °C for 15 s and then quenched for three 10-min incubations in 0.5 mg/ml NaBH4. Cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and then incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations for Dapr and α-sarcomeric actin (Sigma) were performed by inverting coverslips over a 30-μl droplet of antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed 3 times for 10 min each in PBS before incubation in Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed 3 times for 10 min each in PBS, rinsed in water, and mounted on microscope slides using Vectashield (Burlingame, MA) hardening mounting medium. Slides were allowed to dry overnight at 4 °C. C2C12 cells that were imaged for Golgi-expressing protein were first transfected using the Organelle Lights Golgi-GFP kit (Invitrogen). Cells were then incubated with anti-Dapr antibody and prepared as per above for imaging. Expression of the Golgi protein N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 was carried out as outlined by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). All fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus 1X81-DSU Spinning Disk Confocal microscope with a UPlanSApo 100×/1.4 oil immersion objective. dapr Antibody Production—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a synthesized peptide corresponding to a carboxyl-terminal epitope of Dapr (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). Specificity of the Dapr antibody was tested by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (data not shown). Identification and in Silico Analysis of dapr—In a previous study we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG microarray analysis to search for genes regulated by the muscle related transcription factor MEF2 during skeletal muscle differentiation (11Paris J. Virtanen C. Lu Z. Takahashi M. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR we confirmed MEF2 binding proximal to a number of genes, peaking 2 days after initiation of differentiation. From those positive targets, we chose to characterize and have named a novel gene based on bioinformatics analysis: differentiation-associated protein (dapr, also known as PLEKHM3 and previously known as 9430067K14Rik in mouse and LOC389072 in human). To our knowledge this is the first characterization of this protein. The full-length REFSEQ sequence for dapr (NM_001039493) is 8562-bp long. BLAT (12Kent W.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 656-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (6246) Google Scholar), searching the mouse genome, indicated that it spanned ∼167 kilobases on chromosome 1 (64723397–64891100, February 2006 assembly). The predicted protein coding region (NP_001034582) is 761 amino acids long (86 kDa) and occurs between base pairs 361 and 2646 (supplemental Fig. S1). There was a 49% similarity to PLEKHM1 (BL2SEQ (13Wheeler D.L. Barrett T. Benson D.A. Bryant S.H. Canese K. Chetvernin V. Church D.M. DiCuccio M. Edgar R. Federhen S. Geer L.Y. Helmberg W. Kapustin Y.

To further characterize dapr in silico, we used HMMER (14Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar) with the PFAM (Version 19) (15Finn R.D. Mistry J.

Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) PSSM scoring matrices to find conserved domain structures. PFAM matrices predicted (p < 0.005) two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains found centrally from amino acid positions 213 to 309 and 362 to 465 (Fig. 1A). The SMART data base search predicted (p < 0.05) the same two PH domains along with a C1 (protein kinase C conserved region 1) binding domain located from amino acids 670 to 720 near the carboxyl-terminal end. We did not find any predicted kinase domains. Because this was a novel gene, we searched for homologous sequences in the various public databases available at NCBI (13Wheeler D.L. Barrett T. Benson D.A. Bryant S.H. Canese K. Chetvernin V. Church D.M. DiCuccio M. Edgar R. Federhen S. Geer L.Y. Helmberg W. Kapustin Y. Kenton D.L. Khovayko O. Lipman D.J. Madden T.L. Maglott D.R. Ostell J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 173-180Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and University of California Santa Cruz (17Hinrichs A.S. Karolchik D. Baertsch R. Barber G.P. Bejerano G. Clawson H. Diekhans M. Furey T.S. Harte R.A. Hsu F. Hillman-Jackson J. Kuhn R.M. Pedersen J.S. Pohl A. Raney B.J. Rosenbloom K.R. Siepel A. Smith K.E. Sugnet C.W. Sultan-Qurraie A. Thomas D.J. Trumbower H. Weber R.J. Weirauch M. Zweig A.S. Haussler D. Kent W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 590-598Crossref Scopus (741) Google Scholar). We were able to find homologous genes or gene fragments for dapr across all sequenced Vertebrata (see supplemental Fig. S2 for an example alignment), none of which have been characterized. Dapr homology is greatest within the sequenced Tetrapoda, with similarity (>80%) over all exons. Outside of the Tetrapoda, sequence similarity to other Vertebrata (such as the Chondrichthyes and Petromyzontiformes) is confined to exons 4, 5, and 6 near the carboxyl-terminal end. Expression and Subcellular Localization of Dapr—To begin characterizing Dapr, we used real-time PCR to determine its steady-state mRNA levels in a variety of tissue types. Dapr was found to be expressed in all tissues profiled (Fig. 1B). When normalized to the tissue with the lowest expression levels (liver), skeletal muscle and heart were found to demonstrate the greatest quantities of dapr mRNA transcript. In C2C12 cells, levels rose 2.4 ± 0.7-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) above predifferentiation expression levels (Fig. 1C). Using an antibody raised against Dapr, we then examined protein expression in control and 3-day-differentiated C2C12 cells (Fig. 1D). No discernible change was observed in the level of protein between these time points. Utilizing the online resource genepaint (18Visel A. Thaller C. Eichele G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (database issue): 552-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we found RNA in situ hybridization probes to dapr were expressed ubiquitously in developing E14.5 stage mouse embryos. Furthermore, we found Dapr protein was expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (data not shown). Using immunohistochemistry, subcellular localization of Dapr within undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts was found to be primarily in the Golgi apparatus (Figs. 1E and 5A). After differentiation, Dapr moved away from this organelle and localized to the cytoplasm and cell membrane (see Fig. 5C). Binding of PKB to Dapr—Understanding the importance of the PI3K signaling pathway in muscle differentiation, we looked at one of its key proteins, PKB, to see if there was any association with Dapr. To test the specificity of Dapr binding to endogenous PKB, we generated a GST fusion protein with the full-length protein (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S3). The GST fusion protein was then incubated with cell lysates from C2C12 myoblast cells and 3-day differentiated cells. Dapr was found to selectively bind to endogenously expressed PKB in vitro. Nonspecific binding was not observed to either the glutathione-agarose beads or to the GST protein. Furthermore, no signal was detected when the samples were probed for the controls PI3K or MKK6, a mitogen-activated kinase kinase from the SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase) pathway (Fig. 2A). Signaling through PKB is one of the key routes for insulin-mediated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis (19Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar), with glycogen synthase being the primary downstream-regulated target in skeletal muscle (20McManus E.J. Sakamoto K. Armit L.J. Ronaldson L. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). We, thus, performed GST pulldown assays to test for any association between glycogen synthase and Dapr, but no association was found. Binding intensity of PKB to Dapr was comparable with glycogen synthase kinase 3β (supplemental Fig. S4). To further ascertain PKB and Dapr association, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2B). HeLa cells were transfected with vectors expressing Dapr and PKB. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged PKB resulted in detection of Myc-tagged Dapr. This clearly demonstrates that PKB binds to Dapr. We also attempted to immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged (amino- and carboxyl-terminal) Dapr but were unable to detect PKB. This is undoubtedly due to the inaccessibility of the Myc epitope during immunoprecipitation as compared with on a denaturing gel. To narrow down the potential binding region of this association, we divided Dapr into four arbitrary segments (see the legend to Fig. 2C for explicit boundaries) using the edges of the two PH domains as a rough initial guideline. PKB demonstrated no associations with any of the fragments in isolation (data not shown). However, when combinations of the subfragments were placed together, PKB association was apparent (Fig. 2C). Binding appeared to be strongest if the first fragment and the two PH domain-containing fragments were present. Combinations containing the last fragment with the C1 binding domain seemed to show a decrease in binding. The activation of PKB is an important part of its function during differentiation (1Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We, thus, determined its phosphorylation status (supplemental Fig. S5) in vitro. PKB was found to be phosphorylated regardless of the differentiation status of the cells. Overexpression of Dapr did not alter the phospho-status of PKB (data not shown). Dapr Moves to the Membrane after Initiation of Differentiation—As membrane localization is an important component of PI3K signaling, we employed differential centrifugation to examine the localization of Dapr and PKB during differentiation. Before differentiation, Dapr and PKB were both found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A). Three days after the initiation of differentiation, both Dapr and PKB were found to be in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions. When myristoylated PKB was introduced, Myc-tagged Dapr was found to move to the membrane (Fig. 3B). Knockdown of Dapr Inhibits Differentiation of C2C12 Myoblasts— We next investigated the impact that a loss of Dapr would have on the process of differentiation using RNA interference. C2C12 cells were transfected with siRNA oligos (see “Experimental Procedures” for sequence and transfection protocol). Cell lysates and immunohistochemically stained whole cells were then characterized for Dapr protein expression. Exposure to siRNA oligos resulted in significant reduction of Dapr protein at the time of differentiation (Figs. 4A and 5, B and D). No changes were observed in the protein levels of PKB or β-tubulin, indicating that the influence of the siRNA oligo was specific only to Dapr. To better understand the impact that a loss of Dapr has on differentiating C2C12 cells in regard to the subcellular localization of PKB, we examined the activity of Dapr and PKB using differential centrifugation on control and siRNA treated cells. After initiation of differentiation in control cells, PKB and Dapr were found to be in the membrane fraction (Fig. 4B). However, knockdown of Dapr resulted in the complete absence of PKB in the membrane fraction. On a more global level, knockdown of Dapr had a significant effect on the resultant phenotype of cultures of differentiating myoblasts, with fewer formations of myotubes present (Fig. 4C). As a functional marker to measure the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, levels of sarcomeric actin (S-actin) were measured. During the normal course of differentiation, S-actin is fully elevated in expression after 2 days. Knockdown of Dapr expression resulted in a delay of S-actin expression to normal levels at 3 days of differentiation (Fig. 4D). The fact that S-actin levels do reach normal levels is undoubtedly due to the transient nature of the RNAi protocol and the fact that transfection rates are not 100%. In other words, cells that did not become transfected with RNAi oligos may overcome any inhibition presented by the siRNA in neighboring cells, eventually forcing fusion and expression of the proteins. Indeed, immunofluorescence showed that after Dapr knockdown those cells t"
