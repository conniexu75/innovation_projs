https://openalex.org/W2115797520,"Optical detection and spectroscopy of single molecules and single nanoparticles have been achieved at room temperature with the use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Individual silver colloidal nanoparticles were screened from a large heterogeneous population for special size-dependent properties and were then used to amplify the spectroscopic signatures of adsorbed molecules. For single rhodamine 6G molecules adsorbed on the selected nanoparticles, the intrinsic Raman enhancement factors were on the order of 10(14) to 10(15), much larger than the ensemble-averaged values derived from conventional measurements. This enormous enhancement leads to vibrational Raman signals that are more intense and more stable than single-molecule fluorescence."

https://openalex.org/W2046344304,"The complex phase diagram of high-critical temperature (Tc) superconductors can be deduced from an SO(5) symmetry principle that unifies antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity. The approximate SO(5) symmetry has been derived from the microscopic Hamiltonian, and it becomes exact under renormalization group flow toward a bicritical point. This symmetry enables the construction of a SO(5) quantum nonlinear final sigma model that describes the phase diagram and the effective low-energy dynamics of the system. This model naturally explains the basic phenomenology of the high-Tc superconductors from the insulating to the underdoped and the optimally doped region."

https://openalex.org/W2091114915,"The extent of terrestrial vertebrate extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous is poorly understood, and estimates have ranged from a mass extinction to limited extinctions of specific groups. Molecular and paleontological data demonstrate that modern bird orders started diverging in the Early Cretaceous; at least 22 avian lineages of modern birds cross the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Data for several other terrestrial vertebrate groups indicate a similar pattern of survival and, taken together, favor incremental changes during a Cretaceous diversification of birds and mammals rather than an explosive radiation in the Early Tertiary."
https://openalex.org/W2123190981,"In many cells, stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by both receptor tyrosine kinases and receptors that couple to pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins proceed via convergent signaling pathways. Both signals are sensitive to inhibitors of tyrosine protein kinases and require Ras activation via phosphotyrosine-dependent recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation mediates ligand-induced receptor autophosphorylation, which creates the initial binding sites for SH2 domain-containing docking proteins. However, the mechanism whereby G protein-coupled receptors mediate the phosphotyrosine-dependent assembly of a mitogenic signaling complex is poorly understood. We have studied the role of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in G protein-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in a transiently transfected COS-7 cell system. Stimulation of Gi-coupled lysophosphatidic acid and α2A adrenergic receptors or overexpression of Gβ1γ2 subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc adapter protein, which then associates with tyrosine phosphoproteins of approximately 130 and 180 kDa, as well as Grb2. The 180-kDa Shc-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein band contains both epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and p185neu. 3-5-fold increases in EGF receptor but not p185neu tyrosine phosphorylation occur following Gi-coupled receptor stimulation. Inhibition of endogenous Src family kinase activity by cellular expression of a dominant negative kinase-inactive mutant of c-Src inhibits Gβ1γ2 subunit-mediated and Gi-coupled receptor-mediated phosphorylation of both EGF receptor and Shc. Expression of Csk, which inactivates Src family kinases by phosphorylating the regulatory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue, has the same effect. The Gi-coupled receptor-mediated increase in EGF receptor phosphorylation does not reflect increased EGF receptor autophosphorylation, assayed using an autophosphorylation-specific EGF receptor monoclonal antibody. Lysophosphatidic acid stimulates binding of EGF receptor to a GST fusion protein containing the c-Src SH2 domain, and this too is blocked by Csk expression. These data suggest that Gβγ subunit-mediated activation of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases can account for the Gi-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events that direct recruitment of the Shc and Grb2 adapter proteins to the membrane.

INTRODUCTIONThe low molecular weight G protein Ras functions as a signaling intermediate in many pathways involved in the regulation of cellular mitogenesis and differentiation. Ras activation by growth factor receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity follows ligand-induced phosphorylation of specific docking sites on the receptor itself or adapter proteins, such as Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1, which serve to recruit Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors to the plasma membrane (1Medema R.H.

Our data demonstrate that in COS-7 cells, Gi-coupled receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor results in formation of a complex between the membrane-associated EGF receptor and the cytosolic adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, thus providing a scaffold for the assembly of a mitogenic signaling complex. The Gi-coupled receptor effects can be mimicked by cellular overexpression of Gβγ subunits, suggesting that the process is Gβγ subunit-mediated. Because inhibition of endogenous Src kinases blocks both G protein-coupled receptor-mediated EGF receptor phosphorylation and binding of the EGF receptor to the c-Src SH2 domain, the data also suggest that Src family kinases directly associate with and phosphorylate the EGF receptor following Gi-coupled receptor stimulation.Fig. 6 depicts a model of Gβγ subunit-mediated, Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation that is consistent with these data. Gβγ subunit-dependent activation of endogenous Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases is an early event following Gi-coupled receptor stimulation (19Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Once activated, the Src kinases mediate phosphorylation of several intracellular targets, including receptor tyrosine kinases, adapter proteins such as Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1, and possibly cytoskeletally associated Src substrates such as focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. Once phosphorylated, membrane-associated proteins such as the receptor tyrosine kinases and focal adhesion kinase would provide docking sites for the SH2 domains of the Shc and Grb2 adapter molecules, resulting in the recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and potentially of other components of the mitogenic signaling complex, to the plasma membrane. The ensuing activation of Ras would recruit the Raf kinase to the membrane and initiate the phosphorylation cascade leading to MAP kinase activation.Depending upon cell type, the G protein-coupled receptors for angiotensin II, LPA, and α-thrombin have been shown to stimulate ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor (16Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β subunit (14Rao G.N.

Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The finding that several receptor tyrosine kinases undergo G protein-coupled receptor-mediated phosphorylation suggests the existence of a common mechanism that is not receptor tyrosine kinase-specific, such as activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase or inhibition of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase. Our data, demonstrating inhibition of Gi-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by specific inhibitors of Src family kinases, support the hypothesis that activation of Src kinases can account for the observed receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation.The role of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of receptor tyrosine kinases in Gi-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is unclear. Daub et al. (17Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) have reported that inhibition of EGF receptor function in Rat1 cells, by either an EGF receptor-selective tyrphostin, AG1478, or expression of a dominant negative mutant EGF receptor, blocks endothelin-1, LPA, and α-thrombin receptor-mediated EGF receptor/HER2 phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation. They conclude that a ligand-independent transactivation of the EGF receptor/HER2 tyrosine kinase is responsible for G protein-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Our data suggest that activation of Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases by Gi-coupled receptors can account for tyrosine phosphorylation of both the EGF receptor and the Shc adapter protein in COS-7 cells. The finding that inhibition of endogenous Src kinase activity blocks Gi-coupled receptor-mediated EGF receptor phosphorylation suggests that Src kinase activation precedes receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation but does not preclude the possibility that Src-mediated phosphorylation modulates the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase. However, using a monoclonal antibody that can discriminate between c-Src-mediated phosphorylation and EGF receptor autophosphorylation, we have been unable to detect increased EGF receptor autophosphorylation following either overexpression of Y530F p60c-src or Gi-coupled receptor stimulation.The mechanism whereby effectors of activated G protein-coupled receptors stimulate Src family kinases is unknown. Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity may play a role in Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation in some cells. Gβγ subunit-mediated PI3K activity has been described in neutrophils and platelets (36Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T.

We have previously reported that Gi-coupled receptor- and Gβγ subunit-mediated MAP kinase activation in COS-7 and CHO cells is sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 and to expression of a dominant negative form of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (39Hawes B.E.

Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), may provide an explanation for this phenomenon.Interaction between Src kinases and novel Gβγ subunit-regulated nonreceptor tyrosine kinases might also contribute to the regulation of Src kinase activity. In neuronal cells, Gq-coupled receptors have been shown to stimulate the Ca2+ and protein kinase C dependent tyrosine protein kinase, PYK2 (41Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E.

PYK2 is a member of the focal adhesion kinase family of integrin receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and like p125FAK (42Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T.

Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). However, phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization are apparently unable to account for G protein-coupled receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in many noneuronal cells (4Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and Tsk, two members of a family of pleckstrin homology domain-containing tyrosine protein kinases that includes Btk, Itk, Tsk and Tec A, are reportedly regulated by Gβγ subunits (46Langhansrajasekaran S.A. Wan Y. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8601-8605Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, Btk interacts with the Src family kinases Fyn, Lyn, and Hck (47Cheng G. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8152-8155Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and Src-Btk interaction is associated with Btk autoactivation (48Mahajan S. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Kut S.A. Saouaf S.J. Bolen J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5304-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This is unlikely to be a general mechanism for G protein-coupled receptor regulation of Src kinases, however, because the pleckstrin homology domain-containing tyrosine kinases appear to have limited tissue distribution and are not known to be involved in the regulation of Ras.The data presented in this report suggest that both Src family kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases play central roles in directing the assembly of membrane-associated mitogenic signaling complexes in response to Gi-coupled receptor activation in some cells. An understanding of the mechanisms whereby G protein-coupled receptors regulate tyrosine protein phosphorylation and of the basis for cross-talk between G protein-coupled receptor and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways may ultimately provide strategies for selective activation or inhibition of cellular proliferation. INTRODUCTIONThe low molecular weight G protein Ras functions as a signaling intermediate in many pathways involved in the regulation of cellular mitogenesis and differentiation. Ras activation by growth factor receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity follows ligand-induced phosphorylation of specific docking sites on the receptor itself or adapter proteins, such as Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1, which serve to recruit Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors to the plasma membrane (1Medema R.H.

Small copper clusters, typically two to four atomic layers in height, were precisely positioned on a gold(111) electrode by a process in which copper was first deposited onto the tip of the scanning tunneling microscope, which then acted as a reservoir from which copper could be transferred to the surface during an appropriate approach of the tip to the surface. Tip approach and position were controlled externally by a microprocessor unit, allowing the fabrication of various patterns, cluster arrays, and “conducting wires” in a very flexible and convenient manner."

Previous work demonstrated that syntaxin and SNAP-25 bind to each other with high affinity and that their binding regions are predicted to form coiled coils. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used here to study the α-helicity of the individual proteins and to gain insight into structural changes associated with complex formation. Syntaxin displayed approximately 43%α-helical content. In contrast, the α-helical content of SNAP-25 was low under physiological conditions. Formation of the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex was associated with a dramatic increase in α-helicity. Interaction of a 90-residue NH2-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 comprising the minimal syntaxin binding domain lead to a similar but less pronounced increase in α-helicity. Single amino acid replacements in the putative hydrophobic core of this fragment with hydrophilic amino acids abolished the induced structural change and disrupted the interaction monitored by binding assays.

Neurotransmitters are released from presynaptic nerve endings by Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Several lines of evidence suggest that exocytotic membrane fusion is mediated by a complex of conserved proteins which includes the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein or VAMP) and the synaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25. Homologs of these neuronal proteins have been identified in many non-neuronal cell types including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that the mechanism of exocytotic membrane fusion is conserved in all eukaryotic cells (for review, see Refs. 1Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 2Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 3Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol.

Although the evidence linking these proteins to membrane fusion is quite compelling, very little is known about their mechanism of action. Rothman and colleagues (5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar) found that the three membrane proteins form a complex that interacts with additional soluble proteins known to support membrane fusion in cell-free extracts (5Sollner T.

These soluble proteins include the SNAPs 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP(s)soluble NSF attachment protein(sNSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinSNAP-25synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDaSNARESNAP receptorDTTdithiothreitolGSTglutathione S-transferase. (soluble NSF attachment proteins) with three isoforms (α-, β- (brain-specific), and γ-SNAP), and the ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein). SNAPs and NSF apparently operate on all relatives of the synaptobrevin/syntaxin/SNAP-25 protein families, which are therefore commonly referred to as SNAREs (SNAP receptors). ATP hydrolysis by NSF leads to disassembly of the synaptobrevin-syntaxin-SNAP-25-complex (6Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E.

Ultimately, vesicle docking and membrane fusion can be viewed as a series of sequential protein assembly and disassembly steps which may involve structural changes and regulated interactions of at least some of the proteins with the participating phospholipid bilayers. It is therefore of interest to understand the structural basis of these processes. The three proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 assemble spontaneously into a complex that sediments at 7 S (5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2627) Google Scholar) and which is resistant to mild treatment by SDS (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A complex with very similar properties can be assembled in vitro from recombinant proteins that lack their transmembrane domains (syntaxin, synaptobrevin) or lack their posttranslationally added palmitoyl side chains (SNAP-25), respectively. The in vitro complex is also resistant to mild SDS treatment and can be disassembled by NSF in the presence of ATP (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Each of these three proteins can bind to one of its two partners, forming binary complexes. SNAP-25 binds syntaxin with high affinity (EC50 of about 0.4 μM for SNAP-25) (11Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H.

Truncation-, deletion-, and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed the minimal essential domains of each of the proteins which participates in the formation of the binary and the ternary complexes (9Hayashi T.

Interestingly, the interaction of SNAP-25 with synaptobrevin requires both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domain of the SNAP-25 molecule (13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of synaptobrevin to either syntaxin or SNAP-25 requires most of the conserved part of synaptobrevin (amino acids 27-96, excluding the transmembrane region) (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). We have used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to study the secondary structure of syntaxin and SNAP-25 and that of their binary complex. Although CD spectroscopy is incapable of providing detailed structural information it can be used to assess the approximate α-helical content of a protein. Furthermore, it can be used to assess changes of secondary structure which occur upon modification of the environment or upon complex formation. The SNAP-25 and syntaxin variants from the leech (Hirudo medicinalis) were used in this study. Both are highly homologous to their mammalian counterparts. As part of our efforts to develop the Retzius cell of the leech (H. medicinalis) as a model system for studying the mechanisms of synaptic transmission (15Bruns D. Jahn R. Nature. 1995; 377: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), all experiments were based on leech syntaxin and leech SNAP-25 isoforms. cDNA clones encoding H. medicinalis syntaxin and SNAP-25 were isolated from a λ-Zap library prepared from the nerve cord of the leech. The leech variants of the synaptic proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin exhibit high homology to their mammalian counterparts. A detailed description of the cloning strategy and the nucleotide sequences will be published elsewhere. 2Bruns, D., Engers, S., Yang, C., Ossig, R., Jeromin, A., and Jahn, R. (1997) J. Neurosci., in press. For the bacterial expression of recombinant proteins, full-length and truncated coding sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides containing BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites and subcloned into pGEX4-T (Pharmacia) or pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). For the generation of full-length SNAP-25 (1-212) the sense and antisense primers were 5-CCGGGATCCATGGCCAAGGATATCAAG-3 and 5-GCGGAATTCTTATTCTTTCAGGAGTTTGC-3, respectively. For the generation of the 3 deletion mutant SNAP-251-90wt the primer 5-GCGGAATTCTTATTCCATCCCTTCCAGGTT-3 was used. For the generation of the 5 deletion mutant SNAP-25112-212 the primer 5-GCGGGATCCTGGAACAAGGGCGACGAGGGA-3 was used. Leech syntaxin (residues 1-271, comprising the entire cytoplasmic domain) was constructed using primers that were complementary to codons of amino acids 1-6 and 266-271. Site-directed mutagenesis of SNAP-251-90 (see Fig. 8) was performed using the overlapping primer method (16Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sinisky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). All mutants were confirmed by resequencing the entire coding region. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads essentially as described (13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT was used as chromatography buffer. Fusion proteins containing His6 tags (expressed in pTrcHisA) were purified by Ni2+-Sepharose chromatography as described (13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration stepwise to 40, 80, 120, or 240 mM (in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl). Fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. Imidazole-containing fractions with recombinant protein were dialyzed against FPLC-buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). His6-tagged proteins were purified further by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column using an FPLC system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After loading, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 1,000 mM NaCl, and fractions containing the purified proteins were pooled. For the purification of the binary complex of SNAP-25 and syntaxin, both purified proteins were incubated overnight, dialyzed against FPLC-buffer A, loaded on a Mono Q column, and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 1,000 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, and its homogeneity was verified by size exclusion chromatography on an HR-10/30 Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia). Far UV-CD spectra were obtained by averaging 5-20 scans with a step size of 0.5 nm on an AVIV model 62DS CD spectrometer at 25°C. All measurements were performed in a Hellma quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 or 0.5 cm. All CD spectra were performed with purified His6-tagged proteins (pTrcHisA). After purification the proteins were dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl (standard conditions) and concentrated by ultrafiltration to final concentrations of 1-10 mg/ml. Protein concentrations of SNAP-251-90 fragments and of the purified SNAP-25-syntaxin complex were calibrated by internally standardized amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (carried out by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University) and subsequentially determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Protein concentrations of SNAP-25112-212-fragment, syntaxin1-271, and full-length SNAP-25 were determined by the Coomassie Blue binding method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, all recordings for single proteins were performed in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl. The CD spectra of SNAP-25-syntaxin complexes were recorded after reaching equilibrium following an overnight incubation at 4°C in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, comparable to the conditions used for binding assays with GST fusion proteins. To evaluate changes of the CD spectrum attributable to complex formation, the theoretical noninteracting spectrum was calculated from the spectra of the individual proteins using the equation [Θ]sum = (c1n1[Θ]1+ c2n2[Θ]2)/(c1n1+ c2n2), where c1 and c2 are the respective concentrations of peptide molarity, n1 and n2 are respective number of amino acids, and [Θ]1 and [Θ]2 are the observed mean residue ellipticities of the two proteins. The CD spectrum of the purified SNAP-25-syntaxin complex was recorded in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. The molar ellipticity was calculated assuming a 1:1 complex. The fractional α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the assumption that for 100%α-helix the mean residue ellipticity, [Θ], at 222 nm is [Θ]222= −36,300 (1-2.57/X), where X is the number of amino acids in the protein (19Chen Y.H.

Size exclusion chromatography was performed on an HR-10/30 Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing NaCl concentrations as indicated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25°C. The elution profiles were monitored photometrically at 280 nm. 200 μl of protein solution (10 μM of protein) was loaded. Globular proteins that were used as molecular mass standards were loaded at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml and included alcohol dehydrogenase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, and myoglobulin (molecular mass = 150, 66, 45, 29.5, and 17 kDa, respectively). Soluble proteins were incubated together with indicated amounts of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Incubations were carried out overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of binding buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were finally solubilized in SDS sample buffer (final concentrations: 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerine, 3%β-mercaptoethanol) and heated for 5 min at 95°C, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using T7-tagged monoclonal antibody (Novagen). The blots were stained with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody using nitro blue tetrazolinum and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.

CD spectra of SNAP-25 and syntaxin are shown in Fig. 1A in 10 mM phosphate buffer and 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The CD spectrum of syntaxin, with two clearly defined minima at 208 and 222 nm, suggests an α-helical content of approximately 43%. In contrast, the CD spectrum of SNAP-25 indicates little α-helical content (approximately 14%) and is reminiscent of partially unstructured proteins (23Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar). For more detailed studies of the interaction between SNAP-25 and syntaxin, a NH2-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 was generated which comprises the minimal domain required for syntaxin binding (SNAP-251-90wt). This fragment showed a slightly higher α-helical content (approximately 20%) than the full-length protein (Fig. 1B). The CD spectrum of SNAP-251-90wt did not change when the protein concentration was varied more than 100-fold (ranging from 0.3 to 36 mM, Fig. 1C). A fragment of the COOH-terminal half of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25112-212) exhibited a CD spectrum similar to that of the full-length protein, with an α-helical content of approximately 13% (Fig. 1B). Increasing NaCl concentrations lead to a dramatic increase 3Programs are available on the World Wide Web (URLs: http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/COILS_form.html and http://ostrich.lcs.mit/. edu/cgi-bin/score).of the α-helicity of SNAP-251-90wt (Fig. 2, A and B), with minima at 208 and 222 nm clearly visible already at a concentration of 300 mM NaCl. The α-helical content in 1 M NaCl was about 44%. To investigate if the increased α-helical content at higher ionic strength was associated with a change in the oligomeric state of the molecule, samples were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. In 100 mM NaCl, SNAP-251-90wt eluted in two peaks with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 90 kDa. At 500 mM NaCl the molecule eluted in two peaks with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 160 kDa. When the NaCl 3Programs are available on the World Wide Web (URLs: http://ulrec3.unil.ch/software/COILS_form.html and http://ostrich.lcs.mit/. edu/cgi-bin/score). concentration was raised to 1 M, the protein eluted as a single peak of molecular mass of 160 kDa (Fig. 2C). Apparently, high ionic strength induced the formation of a defined higher order oligomer with apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa, whereas in low salt the protein structure is undefined, and the two peaks may correspond to different oligomeric species. The view that SNAP-251-90wt is more structured in high salt was further supported by limited tryptic digestion of the protein. In high salt, only partial digestion was observed, resulting in a defined fragment of reduced size, whereas in 100 mM NaCl the protein was digested into small fragments (not shown). Divalent cations were about 100-fold more potent than monovalent cations in inducing α-helical structure in SNAP-251-90wt (Fig. 3) with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ being effective. This potency is only partially attributable to the increased ionic strength because similar concentrations of divalent anions were ineffective (not shown). Rather, it may be due to more efficient shielding of charges or formation of salt bridges between negatively charged residues. As shown in Fig. 4, lowering the pH to 6.0 also increased the α-helical content in SNAP-251-90wt. At pH 3 the α-helical content increased even further. This may be explained by the fact that SNAP-251-90wt is negatively charged at neutral pH (calculated pI = 4.55 including the His6 tag; note also that the protein was insoluble at pH values around its isoelectric point). Negatively charged groups become protonated at low pH, thus neutralizing potential charge-charge repulsions (24Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the α-helical content of full-length SNAP-25 was somewhat lower than that of the NH2-terminal fragment SNAP-251-90. The increase in its α-helical content in high salt or at low pH was also less pronounced (19% in 1 M NaCl; 38% at pH 3) than for the NH2-terminal fragment. When the COOH-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25112-212) was analyzed at high ionic strength or at low pH, no increase in α-helical content was observed (not shown). This suggests that the α-helical structure induced by these environmental changes is confined to the NH2-terminal half of the molecule. In the next series of experiments we investigated whether the binding of SNAP-25 to syntaxin was associated with changes in secondary structure. For this purpose, CD spectra were obtained after an overnight incubation of approximately equimolar concentrations of syntaxin and full-length SNAP-25. The CD spectrum of this complex was compared with the sum of spectra (i.e. theoretical, noninteracting) that were recorded for each individual protein, corrected for variations of the protein concentrations (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 5A, the CD spectrum of the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex was clearly more α-helical than the theoretical noninteracting sum of the individual spectra, demonstrating that the complex had a higher α-helical content than the individual components alone. A similar but less pronounced increase was observed when the NH2-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 (SNAP-251-90wt) instead of the full-length protein (Fig. 5B) was used in the binding reaction. In contrast, no increase in α-helicity was observed upon mixing of the COOH-terminal half of SNAP-25 (SNAP-25112-212) with syntaxin (Fig. 5C). The observed increase in α-helicity during complex formation may be due to a change in SNAP-25 alone, in syntaxin alone, or in both proteins. However, the CD spectrum of syntaxin did not change under any of the environmental conditions tested (high salt, divalent ions, high or low pH; not shown), whereas α-helicity could readily be induced in SNAP-25. This suggests that the increase in α-helicity upon complex formation is due to a change in SNAP-25. CD spectra of the complexes were also recorded in high salt (1 M NaCl; Fig. 5, D and E). When the spectra were compared with the theoretical noninteracting sum of the spectra of the individual components under these conditions, the induced α-helicity was less pronounced in the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex, and no induction was observed in the SNAP-251-90wt-syntaxin complex. Since the induced α-helicity was always larger for the full-length SNAP-25-syntaxin complex than for the SNAP-251-90wt-syntaxin complex, it is likely that the COOH-terminal half of SNAP-25 also becomes more structured upon complex formation. Although binding experiments have demonstrated that binding of full-length SNAP-25 to syntaxin occurs with high affinity, it cannot be excluded that dynamic equilibria exist which may contribute to the spectrum. For these reasons, the binary complex was purified by ion exchange chromatography, and its homogeneity was verified by size exclusion chromatography. No measurable dissociation occurred during purification (data not shown). The purified complex has a CD spectrum that is very similar to that of the complex formed directly from its constituents without further purification (compare Fig. 5, F and D), although the molar ellipticities are somewhat higher. This indicates that in the mixing experiments the resulting CD spectrum is determined mainly by the complex. No direct binding of a COOH-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 to syntaxin has been described in previous studies (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the COOH-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 might bind only when a complex between syntaxin and the NH2-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 has formed. To confirm this idea, GST-syntaxin, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, was incubated sequentially with SNAP-251-90wt and SNAP-25112-212. As shown in Fig. 6A, SNAP-25112-212 bound to syntaxin when SNAP-251-90wt was present, whereas no binding was observed to syntaxin alone. A similar result was obtained when GST-SNAP-251-90wt was immobilized. Again, binding of SNAP-25112-212 was dependent on the presence of syntaxin (Fig. 6B). In the last series of experiments, amino acid substitutions were introduced in the NH2-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 to investigate how changes in the ability to bind syntaxin correlate with structural changes observed by CD. The first mutation consisted of a glycine to aspartic acid substitution in the highly conserved (cf Fig. 8) position 51 (SNAP-251-90GD). This substitution was motivated by a similar exchange at the homologous position in the yeast Sec9-protein which results in a temperature-dependent loss of function phenotype (25Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Sec9 is an essential gene in yeast which is required for the final exocytotic step in the constitutive membrane trafficking pathway. Although Sec9p is considerably larger than SNAP-25, the COOH-terminal domain, which is homologous to SNAP-25, is apparently sufficient to sustain wild type function (25Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), suggesting that Sec9 is a member of the SNAP-25 protein family. As shown in Fig. 7A, the SNAP-251-90GD variant was unable to bind to syntaxin. In the second set of mutations, either one or both of two conserved hydrophobic amino acids, Met-40 and Met-43, were replaced with glutamate residues (SNAP-251-90M40E, SNAP-251-90M43E, and SNAP-251-90EE). No binding of these mutants to GST-syntaxin was observed (Fig. 7A). In parallel, we substituted both methionines with leucines (SNAP-251-90LL), i.e. a hydrophobic but structurally different amino acid with a comparable side chain volume. In fact, several SNAP-25 variants contain leucine at position 43, whereas Met-40 is conserved (see Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 7A, the resultant mutant protein bound to syntaxin in a manner indistinguishable from wild type. The CD spectra of the mutant proteins had a shape similar to that of SNAP-251-90wt, but they differed in their α-helical content (Fig. 7B). SNAP-251-90LL showed higher α-helicity than wild type, whereas SNAP-251-90EE had lower α-helicity (Fig. 7B), an effect that was less pronounced for the single site mutants SNAP-251-90M40E and SNAP-251-90M43E (not shown). Similarly, substitution of Gly-51 with aspartic acid (SNAP-251-90GD) reduced the α-helical content (Fig. 7B). These differences between the α-helical contents of the binding and nonbinding mutants became more pronounced at high ionic strength or in the presence of divalent cations (not shown). All SNAP-251-90 variants had a high α-helical content at pH 3. Apparently, protonation of the glutamate (SNAP-251-90EE) or the aspartate side chains (SNAP-251-90GD) restores the ability of these mutants to form α-helices. Upon interaction with syntaxin the binding mutant SNAP-251-90LL exhibited an increase in α-helicity which was very similar to that of the wild type fragment (Fig. 7C). In contrast, no difference between the measured and calculated CD spectra was observed when the nonbinding mutants (SNAP-251-90EE and SNAP-251-90GD) were mixed with syntaxin (Fig. 7, D and E). The binding of syntaxin and SNAP-25 is thought to be part of a sequence of protein-protein interactions that leads from vesicle docking to membrane fusion. Although an increasing number of these interactions are known and the participating protein domains have been identified, no biophysical and structural information regarding these interactions has been available up to now. The CD data presented here demonstrate that the formation of a binary complex between syntaxin and SNAP-25 is associated with a dramatic increase in α-helical content which presumably occurs mainly in SNAP-25. Is the interaction between the two proteins mediated by direct interaction between adjacent α-helices? Several investigators noted earlier that the minimal binding domains of both SNAP-25 and syntaxin have a high propensity for the formation of coiled coils (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and suggested that binding is mediated by such interactions. The dramatic increase in α-helical content upon complex formation is consistent with an induced coiled coil formation, although alternative structures cannot be excluded at present. Two-stranded coiled coils consist of two amphipathic right-handed α-helices that are twisted around each other, forming a left-handed superhelix (26Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar). The individual helices bury hydrophobic residues along one side of the helix. These side chains form the hydrophobic core of the superhelix and are often flanked by charged side chains that interact electrostatically (24Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Coiled coils frequently form the basis of regulated protein-protein interactions, e.g. binding and activation of bZIP transcription factors (27Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 28Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8020-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have reanalyzed the binding domains of all hitherto reported isoforms of syntaxin and SNAP-25 using two different algorithms (20Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar, 21Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The results generally confirm the high scores reported earlier. However, there is considerable variation between different species and between the two algorithms, particularly for the NH2-terminal portion of SNAP-25. In this domain, two sets of heptad repeats were identified (13, see Fig. 8). Although both algorithms yield a probability of 1.0 for coiled coil formation of the second repeat in all species variants, the scores are much more divergent for the first repeat (Lupas (20Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar, 21Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a window size of 27 residues/paircoil (22Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar): rat 1.0/0.68, goldfish 0.99/0.51, Torpedo 0.44/0, Drosophila 0.36/0, leech 0.02/0). Helical wheel projection of the two putative repeats (Fig. 8, B and C) shows that according to the predictions Met-40 and Met-43 of the SNAP-25 molecule would be located in the hydrophobic core of a coiled coil. Their replacement with charged side chains would be expected to destabilize a coiled coil interaction, whereas their replacement with appropriate hydrophobic side chains should have little or no effect. These predictions agree with our experimental findings. Our data show that not only the NH2-terminal domain of SNAP-25, but also the COOH-terminal domain participates in binding to syntaxin, although, unlike the NH2-terminal domain, it cannot bind on its own. Binding of the NH2-terminal domain results in an increase in α-helicity which is similar to but less pronounced than binding of the full-length protein. This difference reflects a true structural difference and not merely a higher relative complex concentration since in 1 M NaCl an increase in α-helicity is only observed when full-length SNAP-25 is used. It is likely that the COOH-terminal domain also undergoes a structural change upon binding, although other explanations cannot be ruled out. Previous work has established that the COOH terminus of SNAP-25 is required for binding of synaptobrevin to SNAP-25 (13Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, furthermore, that formation of the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex greatly increases the affinity for synaptobrevin beyond that of either partner alone (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that formation of the ternary complex is mediated by a global structural change in SNAP-25 which in turn provides an optimized attachment site for synaptobrevin.

The Stat1 protein is required for all transcriptional responses to IFN (both type I and type II). Responses to type I IFN (α and β) also require Stat2 and the IFN regulatory factor family protein p48, which form a heterotrimeric transcription complex with Stat1 termed ISGF3. Stat1 homodimers formed in response to IFN-γ treatment can also interact with p48 and function as transcriptional activators. We now show that Stat2 is capable of forming a stable homodimer that interacts with p48, can be recruited to DNA, and can activate transcription, raising a question of why Stat1 is required. Analysis of the transcriptional competence, affinity, and specificity of Stat2-p48 complexes compared with other Stat protein-containing transcription factor complexes suggests distinct roles for each component. Although Stat2 is a potent transactivator, it does not interact stably with DNA in complex with p48 alone. Adding Stat1 increases the affinity and alters the sequence selectivity of p48-DNA interactions by contacting a half-site of its palindromic recognition motif adjacent to a p48 interaction sequence. Thus, ISGF3 assembly involves p48 functioning as an adaptor protein to recruit Stat1 and Stat2 to an IFN-α-stimulated response element, Stat2 contributes a potent transactivation domain but is unable to directly contact DNA, while Stat1 stabilizes the heteromeric complex by contacting DNA directly.

By itself p48 has a low affinity for the ISRE sequence and no transcriptional activity, but complexed with the Stat1-Stat2 heterodimer that is formed upon IFN-α treatment, it forms a significantly more stable protein-DNA complex (5Veals S.A.

Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As a dimer (known as gamma-activated factor, or GAF) Stat1 binds directly to an enhancer element called gamma-activated site, or GAS (27Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and activates transcription of target genes containing this site in their promoters. A major difference between transcription factor binding at the GAS and the ISRE sequences is the presence of a p48 recognition element in the ISRE which allows p48 binding and thus Stat protein recruitment to this distinct site. As might be predicted from the sequence similarity between Stat1 and Stat2, it was found that Stat1 homodimers, in addition to Stat1-Stat2 heterodimers, also interact with p48 and bind the ISRE in response to IFN-γ treatment (28Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlietstra R.J. van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5645-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This Stat1-p48 complex binds the ISRE with a recognition specificity similar to ISGF3. Together the three distinct multimeric complexes activated by IFN-α and IFN-γ (ISGF3, GAF, and Stat1-p48) contribute to the characteristic patterns of gene transcription induced by these cytokines (18Bluyssen H.A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Stat2 suggested that this protein contributes the transactivation function of ISGF3 (29Qureshi S.A. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), prompting us to question the role for Stat1 in ISGF3. We found that Stat2, like other Stat proteins, is capable of forming a stable homodimer when phosphorylated in response to IFN-α. In conjunction with p48, Stat2 homodimers are capable of activating transcription from ISRE-containing genes in the absence of Stat1. However, Stat2-p48-DNA complexes are very unstable, only forming under conditions where these proteins are abundant. The increased affinity of ISGF3 over Stat2-p48 appears to be caused by additional sequence-specific DNA contacts contributed by Stat1 adjacent to the primary p48 binding sequence. Stat2, in contrast, is incapable of directly contacting the ISRE sequence. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum.

Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) were used as competitors at 20-fold molar excess. To determine the sequence recognition specificity of the Stat2-Stat2-p48, Stat2-Stat1-p48, and Stat1-Stat1-p48 complexes, binding was tested to wild type (GGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTCCCGAGGATC) and point-mutated (T89: GGCTTCAGTTTCGGTTTAGTTTCGGTTTCCCTTTCCCGAGGATC) ISRE probes (22Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) labeled to equal specific activities. Dissociation rates of protein-DNA complexes were determined essentially as described (1Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Fu X.Y. Levy D.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1753-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), using cytoplasmic extracts containing DNA-binding complexes composed of p48, Stat2-p48, or Stat2-Stat1-p48 (ISGF3). The approximate half-life of each complex was determined by quantitative PhosphorImager analysis. In response to IFN-α, tyrosine phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 multimerize to form either Stat1 homodimers that bind GAS sequences through an intrinsic DNA binding domain (46Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) or Stat1-Stat2 heterodimers that bind ISRE sequences through the DNA binding domain of p48 (22Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that Stat2 may homodimerize in a manner analogous to phosphorylated Stat1, we first examined the ability of Stat2 to bind ISRE sequences in the presence of p48 (Fig. 1A). Tyrosine phosphorylated Stat2 and p48 in extracts from transfected 293T cells were assayed for protein-DNA interaction by gel mobility shift using an ISRE probe. Cell extracts containing activated Stat2 (lane 1) or p48 (lane 2) displayed no ISGF3-like ISRE binding activity. However, mixing protein extracts containing activated Stat2 with extracts containing p48 produced a slowly migrating complex (lane 3). This complex bound antibodies specific for p48 (lane 4) or Stat2 (lane 5), whereas antibodies against Stat1 (lane 6) or Stat3 (lane 7) had no effect, showing that endogenous Stat1 protein did not participate in formation of this complex. The sequence recognition specificity of the complex was tested by competition assay. A 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled ISRE abrogated all binding to the probe (lane 8). In contrast, unlabeled PRDI (an ISRE-related sequence oligonucleotide; lane 9) or GAS (lane 10) competed poorly or failed to compete. These results indicated that Stat2 binds DNA in the presence of p48 with a specificity similar to ISGF3. Formation of an ISGF3-like complex composed of Stat2 and p48 suggested that Stat2 might homodimerize, analogous to Stat1. This possibility was tested by coexpressing full-length and truncated, recombinant Stat2 (Fig. 1B). Full-length Stat2 tagged with an HA epitope (Stat2-HA) and a shorter, untagged form (ΔStat2) that lacks the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids were expressed in 293T cells. Extracts containing Stat2-HA (lane 1), ΔStat2 (lane 2), or Stat2-HA and ΔStat2 together (lane 3) showed equal expression levels for the different proteins. A smaller protein, apparently a proteolytic product of recombinant Stat2-HA lacking the carboxyl terminus and epitope tag, was also detected (lanes 1 and 3). Endogenous Stat2, which is expressed in 293T cells at much lower levels than recombinant protein, was not detected at this exposure. When these extracts were precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope followed by Western blotting using the Stat2 antibody (lanes 4-6), untagged ΔStat2 was recovered from extracts of cells where it was coexpressed with Stat2-HA (lane 6), but not from extracts containing Stat2-HA (lane 4) or ΔStat2 (lane 5) alone. Efficient interaction between Stat2-HA and ΔStat2 required tyrosine phosphorylation, as indicated by a need for Jak1 kinase and by a lack of interaction with a Stat2 mutant in which tyrosine 690 was replaced by phenylalanine (data not shown). The same cell extracts were also assayed by gel shift (Fig. 1C). Extracts containing phosphorylated Stat2-HA, mixed with extracts from p48-transfected cells, displayed a slowly migrating complex (lane 1), which was supershifted by antibodies against HA (lane 2) or Stat2 (lane 3). Under the same conditions, extracts containing ΔStat2 displayed a faster migrating complex (lane 4) which was only disrupted by Stat2-specific antibody (lane 6), but not by antibody against HA (lane 5). Both complexes, together with a new complex of intermediate mobility, were observed when extracts from cells coexpressing Stat2-HA and ΔStat2 were mixed with extracts containing p48 (lane 7). Antibodies against Stat2 disrupted all three complexes (lane 9), whereas the antibody specific for HA supershifted only the slower two complexes (lane 8). These results confirmed that the slower mobility complex contained Stat2-HA homodimers, the faster complex contained ΔStat2 homodimers, and the intermediate complex consisted of Stat2-HA-ΔStat2 heterodimers. Overall, these data demonstrated that activated Stat2 formed homodimers that bind the ISRE when complexed with p48. Formation of the Stat2-ΔStat2 gel shift complexes, like the interactions detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B), depended on tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat2. Extracts containing a mutant Stat2 in which tyrosine 690 was changed to phenylalanine (lanes 10 and 11) no longer displayed ISRE binding activity when mixed with p48-containing extracts. Similarly, extracts from cells coexpressing Stat2(F) and ΔStat2 only displayed the faster migrating complex (lane 11) consisting of ΔStat2 homodimers. Formation of all of these complexes required the presence of an active tyrosine kinase (not shown). IFN-unresponsive U3A cells lack Stat1 protein (32Miller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and extracts of U3A cells displayed no IFN-inducible ISRE binding activity when assayed by gel shift (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). The same was true for U3A cells transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for Stat2 (lanes 3 and 4, respectively), whereas cells transfected with a p48 expression plasmid displayed a rapidly migrating complex characteristic of p48, present in untreated (lane 5) as well as IFN-treated cells (lane 6). Interestingly, cells cotransfected with Stat2 and p48 plasmids (lanes 7-14) displayed a novel, slowly migrating complex inducible by IFN-α (lane 8). Antibody reactivity identified the composition of this complex. The slow mobility complex as well as the p48 complex were supershifted by antibodies specific for p48 (lane 11). Likewise, the slowly migrating complex, but not the p48 complex, was disrupted by antibodies against Stat2 (lane 13). In contrast, antibodies against Stat1 (lane 12) or Stat3 (lane 14) had no effect on either complex, indicating that a Stat2-p48-DNA complex formed in response to IFN-α. The transcriptional potency of the Stat2-p48 complex was tested on an ISRE-reporter construct. U3A cells were transfected with the IFN-α-responsive reporter construct ISG54-LUC alone or together with expression plasmids directing the synthesis of Stat2 or p48 (Fig. 2B). U3A cells failed to express ISG54-LUC in response to IFN-α, nor did U3A cells transiently transfected with plasmids for Stat2 or p48 alone show a significant response to IFN-α. However, cotransfection of all three plasmids (ISG54-LUC, Stat2, and p48) resulted in a 5-fold induction of luciferase activity in response to IFN-α, a response that depended on the presence of the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain of Stat2. We conclude that the Stat2-p48 complex can activate transcription in response to IFN-α provided that sufficient quantities of Stat2 and p48 proteins are present. The level of transactivation was similar to that observed following transfection of U3A cells with Stat1 cDNA (28Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlietstra R.J. van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R.

The latter is an ADP-ribosyltransferase, which activates the α-subunit of the stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase. In this study, the enzymatic reduction of membrane-bound CT in CaCo-2 human intestinal epithelial cells was characterized. Whereas diphtheria toxin was found to be reduced by a cell surface population of protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and its cytotoxicity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, bacitracin, or anti-PDI antibodies, these inhibitors had no effect on CT reduction or activity in intact cells. In contrast, the reduction of CT in vitro by either postnuclear supernatants (PNS) or microsomal membranes in the presence of Triton X-100 was significantly inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid and bacitracin. Anti-PDI monoclonal antibodies likewise inhibited the in vitro reduction of CT and also were effective in depleting reductase activity from PNS. Since inhibition and depletion were not observed in the absence of detergent, these results suggested that the reductase activity was a soluble component localized to the lumen of microsomal vesicles and correlated with the presence of protein-disulfide isomerase. This was further confirmed by showing a corresponding depletion of reductase activity and PDI in alkali-treated microsomes. This activity was restored when purified bovine PDI was added back to alkali-treated microsomes in a redox buffer that reflected conditions found in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When the CT-related reductase activity was assayed in subcellular fractions of PNS-derived membranes isolated on a 9-30% Iodixanol gradient, the activity, as measured by CT-A1 peptide formation localized to those fractions containing PDI. Likewise CT-A1 peptide formed in intact cells co-localized to those membrane fractions containing the majority of cellular PDI. Furthermore, the banding density corresponded to a region of the gradient containing ER-derived membranes. These results indicated that CT was a substrate for PDI-catalyzed reduction in intact cells and supported the hypothesis that CT reduction and activation occurs in the ER.

https://openalex.org/W1996320201,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 encodes a heterotrimeric helicase-primase composed of the products of the UL5, UL52, and UL8 genes. UL5 possesses six motifs conserved among superfamily 1 of helicase proteins. Substitutions of conserved residues in each motif abolishes DNA replication in vivo (Zhu, L., and Weller, S. K. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 469-479). Purified UL5.52 harboring a Gly to Ala change in motif V retains primase and helicase activities in vitro but exhibits a higher KM for single-stranded DNA and lower DNA-dependent ATPase activity (Graves-Woodward, K. L., and Weller, S. K. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13629-13635). We have purified and characterized six other subcomplexes with residue changes in the UL5 helicase motifs. Each variant subcomplex displays at least wild type or greater levels of primase and DNA binding activities, but all are defective in helicase activity. Mutations in motifs I and II exhibit profound decreases in DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Mutations in motifs III-VI decrease DNA-dependent ATPase activity 3-6-fold. Since mutations in motifs III, IV, V, and VI do not eliminate ATP hydrolysis or DNA binding, we propose that they may be involved in the coupling of these two activities to the process of DNA unwinding. This analysis represents the first comprehensive structure-function analysis of the conserved motifs in helicase superfamily 1."

The hydrogen atoms are located in square pyramidal cavities of the Rh 13 cluster, in positions almost coplanar with the Rh 4 faces on the surface of the cluster. They are slightly displaced inward, toward the central rhodium atom of the cluster, with average H-Rh(central) and H-Rh(surface) distances of 1.84(2) and 1.97(2) angstroms, respectively. This result shows that hydrogen, which normally forms only one bond, can be attached to five other atoms simultaneously in a large metal cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2050713663,"Transmembrane isoforms of the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM (N-CAM-140 and N-CAM-180), are vectorially targeted from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral domain upon expression in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Powell, S. K., Cunningham, B. A., Edelman, G. M., and Rodriguez-Boulan, E. (1991) Nature 353, 76-77). To localize basolateral targeting information, mutant forms of N-CAM-140 were constructed and their surface distribution analyzed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. N-CAM-140 deleted of its cytoplasmic domain shows a non-polar steady state distribution, resulting from delivery from the trans-Golgi network to both the apical and basolateral surfaces. This result suggests that entrance into the basolateral pathway may occur without cytoplasmic signals, implying that apical targeting from the trans-Golgi network is not a default mechanism but, rather, requires positive sorting information. Subsequent construction and analysis of a nested set of C-terminal deletion mutants identified a region of 40 amino acids (amino acids 749-788) lacking tyrosine residues required for basolateral targeting. Addition of these 40 amino acids is sufficient to restore basolateral targeting to both the non-polar cytoplasmic deletion mutant of N-CAM as well as to the apically expressed cytoplasmic deletion mutant of the p75 low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), indicating that this tyrosine-free sequence is capable of functioning independently as a basolateral sorting signal. Deletion of both cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains resulted in apical secretion of N-CAM, demonstrating that the ectodomain of this molecule carries recessive apical sorting information.

Brackenbury R. Rutishauser U. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6841-6845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-CAM has since been found to be developmentally expressed as a family of isoforms in a variety of both neural and non-neural tissues including skin (3Chuong C.-M. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1009-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), muscle (4Covault J. Merlie J.P. Goridis C. Sanes J.R. J.

Cell. 1991; 67: 21-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These interactions are fundamental to the establishment of form and pattern in diverse developmental pathways including that of the central nervous system, heart, limb, and kidney. Within the central nervous system, morphogenetic events involving N-CAM include neurite outgrowth (11Doherty P. Fruns M. Seaton P. Dickson G. Barton C.H. Sears T.A. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1990; 343Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), muscle innervation (12Landmesser L. Dahm L. Schultz K. Rutishauser U. Dev. Biol. 1988; 130: 645-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and axonal regeneration (13Rieger F. Nicolet M. Pincon-Raymond M. Murawsky M. Levi G. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). N-CAM is also predicted to play a role in synaptic plasticity by directing morphological changes in synaptic structures that are associated with learning and memory (14Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). neural cell adhesion molecule Madin-Darby canine kidney cells trans-Golgi network polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis neurotrophin receptor. Although encoded by a single gene, alternative splicing generates a large number of N-CAM isoforms. The three predominant neural variants, N-CAM-180, N-CAM-140, and N-CAM-120 share a common ectodomain, but whereas N-CAM-140 and N-CAM-180 are transmembrane proteins, N-CAM-120 is anchored to the surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The polarized surface distribution of N-CAM isoforms in different cell types suggests that spatial segregation within the plasma membrane may play a role in regulating adhesive interactions. In the retinal pigment epithelium, N-CAM-140 is segregated to the apical surface in vivo (15Gundersen D. Powell S.K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). N-CAM is also localized to the motor end plate of the myofibril of striated muscle (16Rieger F. Grumet M. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Within the nervous system, N-CAM-180 is found polarized to growth cones (17Pollerberg G.E. Burridge K. Krebs K.E. Goodman S.R. Schachner M. Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), to sites of cell-cell contact (18Letourneau P.C. Shattuck T.A. Development. 1989; 105: 505-519PubMed Google Scholar), and to postsynaptic membranes (19Persohn E. Pollerberg G.E. Schachner M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1989; 288: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Additionally, N-CAM-180 is polarized to the somatodendritic domain and excluded from axons of mouse hippocampal neurons (20Persohn E. Schachner M. J. Neurocytol. 1990; 19: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the mechanisms by which the polarity of N-CAM is achieved are not well characterized. Intracellular sorting and vectorial delivery provide an important means by which plasma membrane asymetry is generated. Different cell types including kidney (21Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), retinal pigment epithelium (22Bok D. O'Day W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and intestinal (23Rindler M.J. Traber M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) cell lines, as well as presumptive myocytes (24Peng I. Dennis J.E. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Fischman D.A. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and hippocampal neurons (25Dotti C.G. Simons K. Cell. 1990; 62: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) are all able to sort proteins intracellularly as demonstrated by the polarized surface delivery of viral proteins. Much of what is known about the mechanisms of protein sorting and targeting has been obtained from in vitro studies of epithelial cells. For example, in MDCK cells, most membrane proteins follow a direct route from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to their resident membranes (21Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The TGN discriminates between apical and basolateral proteins and sorts them into specific vesicles which are then targeted and delivered to the appropriate surface (21Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This intracellular sorting of membrane proteins in MDCK cells is in many cases signal-mediated, and dependent on both lipid and proteinaceous signals. Whereas glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage serves to target proteins apically, basolateral localization is dependent on discrete cytoplasmic amino acid sequences (reviewed in Ref. 26Le Gall A.H. Yeaman C.A. Muesch A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic determinants capable of targeting proteins from the TGN to the basolateral surface often overlap with tyrosine-based determinants required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in several basolateral proteins (as found in the low density lipoprotein receptor (27Matter K. Hunziker W. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 71: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), lysosomal glycoprotein 120 (28Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), lysosomal acid phosphatase (29Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the Fc receptor (28Hunziker W. Harter C. Matter K. Mellman I. Cell. 1991; 66: 907-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)). Detailed point mutational analysis within these overlapping signals (29Prill V. Lehmann L. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2181-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Matter K. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) has shown that these two sorting activities can be separated, suggesting that basolateral targeting utilizes secondary structural motifs related to but not identical to the tyrosine-based endocytic signal which has been characterized to form a type 1 β-turn (31Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Basolateral signals such as in the transferrin receptor (32Dargemont C. Le Bivic A. Rothenberger S. Iacopetta B. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and polymeric Ig receptor (33Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) are not associated with endocytic activity. However, structural analysis of the polymeric Ig receptor basolateral signal has shown that it consists of a β-turn followed by a nascent helix, which, when compromised by point mutations, leads to decreases in sorting fidelity (34Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) further supporting the involvement of β-turns in the basolateral sorting of membrane proteins. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that differential isoform expression can dictate the surface membrane distribution of N-CAM. When expressed in MDCK cells, N-CAM-120 is targeted to the apical surface, whereas the transmembrane isoforms (N-CAM-140 and N-CAM-180) are sorted basolaterally (1Powell S.K. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nature. 1991; 353: 76-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this work, we extend these findings and characterize a cytoplasmic peptide directing the intracellular sorting of transmembrane N-CAM. The surface distribution of mutant constructs of N-CAM-140 expressed in MDCK cells reveals 40 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain required for basolateral targeting. These 40 amino acids function independently as a basolateral sorting signal as indicated by its ability to re-direct both a nonpolar mutant of N-CAM and a heterologous apical protein to the basolateral surface. The function of this tyrosine-independent signal requires regions predicted to form β-turn structures. However, point mutational analysis within these putative turn sequences did not identify specific residues critical for basolateral targeting. Finally, the apical secretion of soluble forms of N-CAM demonstrates the presence of apical sorting information in the N-CAM ectodomain. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), propidium iodide from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Protein-A Sepharose was purchased form Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), and sulfo-NHS-biotin (sulfosuccinimidobiotin), NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate), and NHS-SS-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate) from Pierce Chemical Co. Products for molecular biology were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Chicken N-CAM-180 cDNA (pEC1401) (36Edelman G.M. Murray B.A. Mege R.-M.

Cunningham (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cytoplasmic deletion mutant, 712t, was generated using an AatII site 2 amino acids from the transmembrane domain of N-CAM. After AatII digestion, the fragment encoding the N-CAM truncation was blunt ended and ligated to XbaI linkers containing a stop codon. An XbaI site 5 to the start codon allowed the subsequent subcloning of the truncation mutant into the pCMV5 eukaryotic expression vector. The N-CAM truncation mutants, 788t, 770t, 749t, 725t, and 691t (identified by the amino acid site of truncation as numbered in Cunningham et al. (37Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J. Murray B.A. Prediger E.A. Brackenbury R. Edelman G.M. Science. 1987; 236: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar)) were constructed using polymerase chain reaction amplification with pEC1401 as template. In all cases, the 5 polymerase chain reaction primer GGG GGT ACC AGC TTG GGC TGC AGG TCG ACT was used to introduce a KpnI site 5 to the start of the N-CAM coding sequence. Unique 3 primers inserted a stop codon (TAG) and ClaI restriction site at the sites of truncation. The sequence of the 3 primers is as follows: 788t, GGG ATC GAT CCC CAG GCC TGA CGT AGG GCT. The amplification products were gel purified, digested with KpnI/ClaI, and subcloned into pCMV5. The sequence of these and all subsequent mutant constructs was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or performed by Cornell University DNA Services (Ithaca, NY). Sequencing of one DNA clone of 691t revealed a point deletion which resulted in a nonsense mutation, truncating N-CAM after tyrosine 615. The expression of both soluble forms of N-CAM (691t and 615t) was subsequently analyzed. To construct 719t, pCMV5 containing 725t was digested with KpnI and AatII to release a 2.3-kilobase pair fragment encoding N-CAM amino acids 1-712. Two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides encoding amino acids 713-719 flanked with a 5 AatII site and a 3 stop (TAG) codon and ClaI site were synthesized (Department of Biochemistry, NYU School of Medicine, New York; sequence available upon request) annealed, and after digestion with AatII and ClaI, fused to the 2.3-kilobase pair fragment and cloned into pCMV5. To construct the N-CAM/N-CAM fusion constructs, 712t/1-40 and 712t/1-29, nucleotides encoding cytoplasmic amino acids 749-788 or amino acids 749-777 were amplified and fused to the cytoplasmic deletion mutant, 712t. Both fragments were amplified using the 5 primer GCG GAC GTC GCC TTC TCG AAA GAT GAG TCC AAG introducing a 5 AatII site, and 3 primers GGG ATC GAT GTG TTT TCC CCC ATC ATG GTT G, respectively, introducing a 3 stop codon and ClaI site. The purified amplification products were ligated in-frame to the 2.3-kilobase KpnI-AatII fragment described above, and cloned into pCMV5. 712t/1-21 was similarly constructed, using a synthetic complementary pair of oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acids 749-769 (sequence available upon request). To create the fusion construct, p75t/1-40, a 950-base pair KpnI-PvuII fragment encoding the ectodomain, transmembrane domain, and first 5 cytoplasmic amino acids of p75NTR was isolated from a full-length human p75NTR cDNA clone in pBluescript (kindly provided by Barbara Hempstead, Department of Medicine, Cornell University Medical College). The basolateral N-CAM signal was amplified using the 5 primer GGT GAC GCG TTC TCG AAA GAT GAG TCC which introduced a silent point mutation creating a unique 5 MluI site and the 3 primer GG AGG TCT AGA TTC TGT TAG TGG GGT GGT CTC introducing a 3 stop codon and XbaI site. The amplified fragment was digested with MluI/XbaI, gel isolated, and the p75NTR and N-CAM fragments blunt end ligated and cloned into pCMV5 in a tripartite ligation reaction. Reading frame of the chimera was restored upon ligation. The pXba1 (39Hempstead B.L. Patil N. Thiel B. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9595-9598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mutant of human p75NTR which we refer to as p75t, was obtained from B. Hempstead in the expression vector pMV7 and subcloned as an EcoRI-XbaI fragment into pCMV5. A unique SplI site was added immediately 5 to the sequence encoding the putative β-turn regions in the construct p75t/1-40, by mutating the native sequence CGG ACC to CG AC using polymerase chain reaction (p75t/1-40/Spl1). Alanine point mutants were created using sets of synthetic oligonucleotides encoding native or mutated sequence which were annealed and ligated as above, and cloned into the SplI-XbaI restriction sites of p75t/1-40Spl1. The sequence of all oligonucleotides is available upon request. MDCK cells strain II were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential media supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and antibiotics. MDCK cells were transfected using the DNA-calcium phosphate procedure (40Graham F. Van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Stably expressing clones were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 or 200 μg/ml hygromycin, isolated with cloning rings, and screened for expression by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.075% saponin, and incubated with the rabbit anti-chicken N-CAM polyclonal antibody (R527), mouse anti-chicken N-CAM monoclonal 5e (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), or an anti-p75NTR monoclonal antibody (41Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Expression was visualized after incubation with the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. 5-day-old filter grown monolayers of transfected MDCK cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS-CM) and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Non-permeabilized monolayers were incubated with the anti-N-CAM monoclonal antibody, mAb 5e (1:500), or anti-human p75NTR monoclonal antibody (1:100). After permeabilization with 0.075% saponin in PBS-CM, monolayers were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and RNase, and nuclei subsequently labeled with propidium iodide. Immunofluorescent samples were examined using a Molecular Dynamics confocal microscope (Sunnyvale, CA). -To determine steady state protein distribution, 5-6-day filter grown monolayers of stably transfected MDCK cells were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin or NHS-LC-biotin two times, either apically or basolaterally as described previously (41Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After biotinylation, filters were excised and monolayers solubilized in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors). Extracts were preincubated with fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells, centrifuged, and cleared supernatants incubated with R527 anti-N-CAM antibody (1:300) overnight. After 2 h incubation with protein A-Sepharose (10 mg/ml) the immunoprecipitates were washed as described (41Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For p75NTR immunoprecipitations, the anti-p75NTR monoclonal antibody was first coupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG bound to protein A-Sepharose. Bound proteins were released from the beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for visualization with radioiodinated streptavidin. To examine polarized delivery to the cell surface, we used a biotin targeting assay (41Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 5-6-day filter grown monolayers were pulse labeled for 15 min. At various time points during chase, filters were chilled to 4°C, biotinylated from the apical or basolateral surface, and immunoprecipitated as indicated above. Samples were subsequently re-precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and the biotin-labeled immunoprecipitates separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. Cells grown on Transwell filters for 5-6 days were biotinylated through a linkage sensitive to reduction either apically or basolaterally with NHS-SS-biotin as described (41Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37°C for various times before cooling to 4°C to allow for protein internalization. Non-internalized biotin label was subsequently removed by incubation with 50 mM glutathione in 90 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 60 mM NaOH, and 10% fetal bovine serum followed by a 15-min incubation with 0.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in PBS-CM. Monolayers were subsequently washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated. After electrophoresis and transfer to Immobilon P in nonreducing conditions, biotin-labeled proteins were detected by 125I-streptavidin blotting. Both the 140- and 180-kDa isoforms of N-CAM have been previously demonstrated to be targeted to the basolateral surface upon expression in MDCK cells (35Powell S.K. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nature. 1991; 353: 76-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To examine whether the cytoplasmic tail of N-CAM contained basolateral sorting information, a mutant form of N-CAM deleted of its cytoplasmic tail (712t) was constructed and stably expressed in MDCK cells (Fig. 1A). Indirect immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy indicated that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of N-CAM resulted in a loss of basolateral polarity (Fig. 2A), with the truncated protein expressed on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cells. These vertical sections clearly show that the basolateral pool of N-CAM-140 is predominantly segregated to the lateral edges of the cells and not found diffusely throughout the basolateral surface, possibly reflecting retention at the lateral surface due to homophilic interactions between neighboring cells expressing N-CAM.Fig. 2Polarity of the N-CAM cytoplasmic deletion mutant, 712t, in MDCK cells. A, stably transfected MDCK cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde after 5 days of culture on filters. Expression of the truncated N-CAM construct was detected using a rabbit antibody directed against N-CAM, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Labeled cells were visualized and vertical sections produced using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Bar, 10 μm. B, stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the N-CAM cytoplasmic deletion mutant, 712t, were biotinylated from either the apical (A) or basolateral (B) domain. Surface mutant N-CAM was immunoprecipitated separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and after transfer to Immobilon P visualized with 125I-streptavidin. The last two sets of lanes show the steady state polarity of 712t in two independently isolated clones expressing different levels of protein. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain leads to a loss of basolateral polarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Domain specific biotin labeling of surface proteins and subsequent immunoprecipitation (see Fig. 2B) demonstrated that at steady state, whereas greater than 95% of surface N-CAM-140 was basolateral, a representative clone of 712t showed a basolateral polarity of 57.4% (±3.0, n = 3). To examine whether this change in polarity reflected a loss of intracellular sorting fidelity or the possible recruitment of 712t into an indirect pathway to the apical surface, we utilized a pulse-chase membrane targeting assay. In Fig. 3A, newly synthesized 712t reaches the apical and basolateral surfaces within 10-20 min of chase. Delivery to each surface shows similar kinetics and remains approximately 60% polarized to the basolateral surface throughout the chase period indicating that the deletion construct was directly transported to each surface domain. Therefore, the nonpolar distribution of 712t reflects a loss of basolateral sorting fidelity at the TGN and indicates a dependence on cytoplasmic sequences for the correct sorting of N-CAM to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells. This is not due to a general sorting defect of MDCK cells stably expressing 712t, as these cells sort correctly the basolateral marker E-cadherin (not shown) nor is it the result of clonal variation as more than 5 independently isolated clones expressing a range of different protein levels displayed similar sorting behavior. We considered the possibility that the nonpolar distribution of 712t might reflect a weakened association of 712t with the membrane due to the lack of charged residues in the cytoplasmic tail of 712t. However, the mutant protein exhibited basic characteristics of an integral membrane proteins as it was not extracted in either high salt or alkaline conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, pulse-labeled 712t was not detected in the media over an 8-h chase and all detectable protein remained cell-associated (data not shown) indicating that 712t is not shed from the cell surface. In these studies, we did not obtain clones expressing 712t at levels comparable to those expressing wild type N-CAM, suggesting that the non-polar targeting of this mutant is not due to saturation of the basolateral sorting machinery. To localize the putative basolateral signal, a series of C-terminal deletion mutants, truncated at amino acids 788, 770, 749, or 725 (Fig. 1A) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and stably expressed in MDCK cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A by immunofluorescence, these mutants show different membrane distributions. N-CAM-140 deleted of 22 C-terminal amino acids (788t) retained basolateral localization. However, deletion of 40 amino acids in the mutant 770t led to the nonpolar distribution of the protein, with staining evident on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the monolayer. 749t and 725t, deleted of 61 and 82 C-terminal amino acids, respectively, show predominantly apical surface staining. Immunoprecipitation from cells surface labeled with biotin confirmed this result (Fig. 4B). While 788t labeled predominantly from the basolateral side, 770t could be labeled from both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the monolayer. 749t and 725t were predominantly labeled from the apical surface. Targeting assays as described above demonstrated that the steady state polarized localization of 788t, 770t, 749t, and 725t resulted from the direct transport of these N-CAM constructs to their resident membrane domains (data not shown). The differential localization of the truncation mutants thus identifies (as su"

RBTN1 and RBTN2, also frequently activated in T-ALL, encode proteins only with tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. We found that aberrant expression of TAL1 detected in 11 out of 14 T-ALL cell lines was invariably accompanied by that of either RBTN1 or RBTN2 Forced expression of TAL1 together with RBTN1 or RBTN2, but not TAL1 alone, strongly induced artificial reporter genes in a TAL1/RBTN-negative T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL.

In this context, we carried out preliminary evaluation of a potential role of the T cell-specific GATA-binding protein, GATA3, in the transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN. We also showed that coexpression of TAL1 and RBTN1 in HPB-ALL strongly induced TALLA1, a highly specific T-ALL marker whose positivity correlated 100% with ectopic expression of TAL1 among various T-ALL cell lines.

TAL1 is normally expressed in erythroid, mastocytic, and megakaryocytic lineages of the hematopoietic system but not in T cells (4Pulford K. Lecointe N. Leroy-Viard K. Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D.

TAL1 encodes at least two polypeptides, full-length 42-kDa TAL1α (amino acid residues 1-331) and 22-kDa N-terminally truncated polypeptide TAL1β (amino acid residues 176-331) (6Bernard O. Lecointe N.

TAL1 proteins, having no intrinsic DNA binding activity, dimerize with the ubiquitously expressed E2A gene products, E47 and E12 (7Hsu H.-L. Cheng J.-T. Cheng Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell.

By using an artificial reporter gene containing multiple copies of the optimal TAL1/E2A binding sequence, transcriptional activity of the TAL1/E47 heterodimer was examined in transiently transfected murine C3H/10T1/2 fibroblasts (10Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). While the E47 homodimer strongly induced the reporter gene, the TAL1/E47 heterodimer was much less active, suggesting a negative regulatory role of TAL1 (10Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). So far, nothing is known about genes regulated by TAL1. Transcriptional activity of TAL1 in T cells has not been examined either. Transgenic mice expressing 42-kDa TAL1 in the T cell lineage did not develop tumors nor did mice irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus encoding TAL1 (11Elwood N.J.

Such findings may suggest that additional cofactors are necessary for TAL1 to be oncogenic in T cells (13Elwood N.J. Cook W.D. Metcalf D. Begley C.G.

They encode highly related proteins consisting of only two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like LIM domains, which are considered to mediate protein-protein interactions (17Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Nature. 1990; 346Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). RBTN1 and RBTN2 are mainly expressed in the brain and erythroid lineage cells, respectively, but not in normal T cells (18Foroni L. Boehm T. White L. Forster A. Sherrington P. Liao X.B. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Orkin S.H.

Transgenic mice expressing RBTN1 or RBTN2 in T cells developed tumors but at variable frequencies and only after long latency periods (∼10 months) (20Fisch P. Boehm T. Lavenir I. Larson T. Arno J.

In normal hematopoiesis TAL1 is considered to function in close collaboration with RBTN2 and a group of GATA binding zinc finger type transcription factors, GATA1 and GATA2 (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This conclusion comes from their overlapping patterns of expression in developing erythroid cells (4Pulford K. Lecointe N. Leroy-Viard K. Jones M. Mathieu-Mahul D. Mason D.Y.

Cell. 1994; 78: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that the activity of TAL1 in T cells as a transcriptional and oncogenic protein requires a similar set of transcriptional cofactors. Recently, efficient collaboration of TAL1 and RBTN2 in T cell oncogenesis has indeed been demonstrated in vivo by generating double transgenic mice (31Larson R.C. Lavenir I. Larson T.A. Bear R.

Previously we identified a highly specific surface marker of T-ALL designated TALLA1 (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TALLA1 is a new member of the tetraspans or transmembrane 4 superfamily and normally expressed in neurons, certain vascular endothelial cells, and certain epithelial cells but not at all in any hematopoietic cells including T cells (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 2M. Nagira, N. Fukuhara, and O. Yoshie, manuscript in preparation. The highly frequent ectopic expression of TALLA1 in T-ALL suggests that its aberrant expression is closely related to leukemogenesis of T-ALL. We have not, however, detected any T-ALL-associated genetic changes involving the TALLA1 gene that is located on X chromosome. 3N. Fukuhara, M. Nagira, Y. Ono, I. Ishikawa, and O. Yoshie, unpublished data. One possibility is that aberrantly activated transcription factors in T-ALL such as TAL1 are responsible for ectopic expression of TALLA1 In the present study, we examined expression of TAL1, RBTN1, and RBTN2 in a panel of 14 human T-ALL cell lines and evaluated transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN by monitoring expression of transfected artificial reporter genes and the endogenous TALLA1 gene. The transcriptional activity of TAL1 indeed requires RBTN1 or RBTN2 together with some other T cell-specific cofactors and induces the TALLA1 gene. Such a highly collaborative set of transcriptional factors may thus lead to development of T-ALL by modulating expression of downstream genes like TALLA1 All of the cell lines used in the present study were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For details of each cell line see Takagi et al. (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J.

The first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out from 1 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of reaction buffer using a RNA PCR kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). PCR was then set up using 2 μl from the reaction buffer as template in a 50-μl PCR reaction buffer containing 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Amplification was carried out by denaturation at 94°C for 1 min (5 min at the first cycle) and annealing/extension at 70°C for 5 min. The number of amplification cycles was 30 for TAL1, RBTN1, and E2A; 27 for GATA3; and 35 for RBTN2. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The oligonucleotides used as PCR primers were: TAL1, +5″-TCACCACCAACAATCGAGTGAAGAGG-3″ and −5″-CTCCTCCTGGTCATTGAGCAGCTTGG-3″; RBTN1, +5″-CGGAGCGCCCGAGATGATGGTGCTGG-3″ and −5″-GCAGTCGAGGTGATACACGTTGTCCC-3″; RBTN2, +5″-TCCCTCCCCAATGTCCTCGGCCATCG-3″ and −5″-CTCGGGCCTATATCATCCCATTGATC-3″; E2A, +5″-CAGCAGGGTTTCCAGGCCTGAGGTGC-3″ and −5″-GCTGCTGTGCGACTCAGTGAAGTGGG-3″; GATA3, +5″-TAAGATCGACGGTCAAGGCAACCACG-3″ and −5″-GTGGTGGATGGACGCTTGGAGAAGG-3″. The cDNAs for TAL1, RBTN1, RBTN2, and GATA3 were amplified from Jurkat or CEM by RT-PCR. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: TAL1α, +5″-GAGAGTCTAGACTCTCTAAATATGCCCCAGGATGACC-3″ and −5″-GAGAGTCTAGAGCTGGATGCCTCAGATGAGAGCTGAC-3″; TAL1β, +5″-GAGAGTCTAGAAGCCGGATGCCTTCCCTATGTTCACC-3″ and −5″-GAGAGTCTAGAGCTGGATGCCTCAGATGAGAGCTGAC-3″; RBTN1, +5″-CGGAGCGCCCGAGATGATGGTGCTGG-3″ and −5″-GCGTTACTGAACTTGGGATTCAAAGG-3″; RBTN2, +5″-TCCCTCCCCAATGTCCTCGGCCATCG-3″ and −5″-CTCGGGCCTATATCATCCCATTGATC-3″; GATA3, +5″-AGCACAGCCGAGGCCATGGAGGTGAC-3″ and −5″-GTGAGCATCGAGCAGGGCTCTAACCC-3″. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) and digested with EcoRI. The EcoRI fragments were then cloned into pMIKneo and pMIKhyg, yielding pMIKneoTAL1α, pMIKneoTAL1β, pMIKneoGATA3, pMIKhygRBTN1, and pMIKhygRBTN2. pMIKneo and pMIKhyg, which carry the genes conferring resistance to neomycin and hygromycin B, respectively, were constructed from an efficient eukaryotic expression vector pSRα (33Takebe Y.

Recipient cells (1 × 107) were transfected by electroporation with indicated combinations of plasmids together with 5 μg of pRC/cytomegalovirus-luciferase carrying the luciferase gene under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. After 72 h cell lysates were prepared and assayed for CAT activity after normalization of transfection efficiency by luciferase activity as described previously (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

The EcoRI fragments of the RBTN1 cDNA and RBTN2 cDNA were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector pMAL-c (New England Biolabs). The EcoRI fragment of the GATA3 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Production of fusion proteins (MBP-RBTN1, MBP-RBTN2, and GST-GATA3) in Escherichia coli BL21 (Novagen) and their purification were carried out following the protocols recommended by the manufacturers. GST alone or GST-GATA3 fusion protein was immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with MBP alone or MBP-RBTN fusion proteins that were preincubated with 1% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C for 20 min. Beads were spun down to collect supernatants and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline 5 times. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 mM reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins and supernatants were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-MBP (New England Biolabs). HPB-ALL cells (1 × 107) were cotransfected by electroporation with pMIKneo or pMIKneoTAL1α and pMIKhyg or pMIKhygRBTN1. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 5 × 105/ml and cultured under double selection with 600 μg/ml G418 and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. Rare growing cultures were individually expanded and determined for expression of transfected genes by RT-PCR (see above). Surface expression of TALLA1 was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson) after indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal anti-TALLA1 (B2D) as described previously (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis for TALLA1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts was also carried out as described previously (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of the TAL1 gene in T-ALL is now known to occur much more frequently than previously considered from the incidence of gross chromosomal rearrangements involving the TAL1 gene locus (2Bash R.O. Hall S. Timmons C.F. Crist W.M. Amylon M. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1995; 86: 666-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ectopic expression of RBTN1 and RBTN2 in T-ALL may be more frequent than the incidence of respective chromosomal translocations (3Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined 14 T-ALL cell lines for expression of TAL1, RBTN1, and RBTN2 together with that of E2A, whose products E47 and E12 are necessary for the TAL1 gene products to form a DNA binding heterodimer (7Hsu H.-L. Cheng J.-T. Cheng Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 11 out of 14 T-ALL cell lines were found to express TAL1, supporting a highly frequent aberrant expression of the TAL1 gene in T-ALL (2Bash R.O. Hall S. Timmons C.F. Crist W.M. Amylon M. Smith R.G. Baer R. Blood. 1995; 86: 666-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the same 11 cell lines were found to be exactly the ones that expressed either RBTN1 (2/11) or RBTN2 (9/11). The remaining 3 T-ALL cell lines expressed neither of them. All of the 14 cell lines expressed the E2A gene, which was thus useful as an internal control. The complete concordance of aberrant expression of TAL1 and RBTN1 or RBTN2 in 11 out of 14 T-ALL cell lines was striking, supporting their interdependent transcriptional and oncogenic activity in T cells. It is also notable that the 11 T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and RBTN1 or RBTN2 are exactly the ones that are strongly positive for surface expression of TALLA1, a highly specific tumor marker of T-ALL (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No natural target genes regulated by TAL1 are known yet. Hsu et al. (9Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that the heterodimers of TAL1 and E47 or E12 specifically bind to an E-box motif in vitro and regulate expression of an artificial reporter gene containing multiple copies of the optimal TAL1/E2A binding motif in murine C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (10Hsu H.-L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to use a similar artificial reporter gene system to examine transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN in T cells. The HSV tk minimal promoter (34McKnight S.L. Gravis E.R. Kingsbury R. Axel R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was linked to the CAT structural gene in pCAT-Basic (Promega), making tk-CAT, and then a DNA segment containing four copies of the optimal TAL1/E2A-binding site (AACAGATGGT) (9Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was inserted into the upstream sequence of the tk promoter, making tk-TAL1CS-CAT. HPB-ALL cells, which expressed E2A but not TAL1, RBTN1, or RBTN2 (Fig. 1), were used as a recipient. Due to alternative translation initiation sites, TAL1 proteins have at least two isoforms containing the bHLH motif, the 42-kDa TAL1α and an N-terminally truncated 22-kDa TAL1β (6Bernard O. Lecointe N. Jonveaux P. Souyri M. Mauchauffe M. Berger R. Larsen C.J. Mathieu-Mahul D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1477-1488PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the activity of both polypeptides. As shown in Fig. 2A, TAL1α or TAL1β alone did not significantly induce expression of the CAT reporter gene from tk-TAL1CS-CAT. RBTN1 or RBTN2 had no effect on the expression of the reporter gene either. In the presence of RBTN1 or RBTN2, however, TAL1 proteins strongly induced the reporter gene. The full-length TAL1α and the N-terminally truncated TAL1β were similarly effective in the presence of RBTN1 or RBTN2. Thus, RBTN1, which is expressed in the brain (18Foroni L. Boehm T. White L. Forster A. Sherrington P. Liao X.B. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and RBTN2, which is expressed in erythroid cells like TAL1 (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), both efficiently cooperated with TAL1. Unexpectedly, however, the reporter plasmid with only the tk minimal promoter and without 4 copies of the TAL1/E2A-binding motif (tk-CAT) was also nearly half as much induced by the coexpression of TAL1 and RBTN as tk-TAL1CS-CAT. Computer analysis revealed a single potential E-box element in the HSV tk minimal promoter and as many as 12 potential E-box elements in the pCAT-Basic plasmid itself. Some of these sequences may thus fortuitously function as a TAL1/E2A-binding site. The deletion of the potential E-box element in the tk promoter, however, did not affect induction of tk-CAT by the combination of TAL1 and RBTN (data not shown). The role of any of the E-box-like elements within pCAT-Basic in the induction by TAL1 and RBTN remains to be seen. We carried out the same transfection assays using a B-ALL cell line, BALL-1. As shown in Fig. 2B, little transcriptional activity of TAL1 proteins on tk-TAL1CS-CAT or tk-CAT was observed in BALL-1 even in the presence of RBTN1 or RBTN2. Similar negative results were obtained with another B cell line Raji or a monocytoid cell line U937 (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the transcriptional activity of TAL1 proteins requires, besides RBTN, still other cofactor(s) specifically present in T cells. In the erythroid lineage cells, GATA1 and GATA2, the zinc finger GATA binding transcription factors are expressed at high levels (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and in close collaboration with TAL1 and RBTN2 they play essential roles in the erythropoietic development and differentiation (27Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.-F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 28Shivdasani R.A. Mayer E.L. Orkin S.H.

Cell. 1994; 78: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Osada et al. (24Osada H. Grutz G. Axelson H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) demonstrated direct binding of RBTN2 with TAL1 and GATA2. On the other hand, they observed little significant binding between TAL1 and GATA1 or GATA2 (24Osada H. Grutz G. Axelson H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RBTN2 mediates interactions between TAL1 and GATA proteins. Among the GATA proteins, GATA3 is known to be expressed very specifically in the T cell lineage (37Ho I.-C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.-F. Orkin S.H. Leidon J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). We confirmed this in Fig. 3 where RT-PCR detected the expression of GATA3 in all the T-ALL cell lines tested but not in any other hematopoietic cell lines including BALL-1. Since it was not known whether RBTN1 or RBTN2 was capable of binding to the T cell-specific GATA3, we also examined direct binding of RBTN1 and RBTN2 to GATA3. To do this, GATA3 was expressed as a GST fusion protein, while RBTN1 and RBTN2 were expressed as MBP fusion proteins. GST alone or GST-GATA3 was immobilized by glutathione beads and incubated with MBP alone, MBP-RBTN1, or MBP-RBTN2. Free proteins and bound proteins eluted by glutathione were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-MBP. As shown in Fig. 4, GST-GATA3 but not GST alone retained MBP-RBTN1 and MBP-RBTN2 but not MBP alone. Thus, both RBTN1 and RBTN2 are capable of binding to GATA3. We also examined direct binding between TAL1 and GATA3 by the same protocol using MBP-TAL1 fusion protein and GST-GATA3 fusion protein. We did not observe any direct binding between TAL1 and GATA3 (data not shown).Fig. 4In vitro binding of GATA3 with RBTN1 and RBTN2. GST alone or GST-GATA3 fusion protein was immobilized to glutathione beads and incubated with MBP alone, MBP-RBTN1 fusion protein, or MBP-RBTN2 fusion protein. Unbound and bound fractions were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-MBP after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results led us to examine the effect of GATA3 on the transcriptional activity of TAL1/RBTN in T cells and non-T cells. For the sake of convenience, we used only the reporter plasmid tk-TAL1CS-CAT in the following experiments. We first examined the effect of GATA3 overexpression on the transcriptional activity of TAL1α in HPB-ALL (Fig. 5A). Transfection of GATA3 had no direct effect on the expression of tk-TAL1CS-CAT. GATA3 also did not collaborate with TAL1α. On the other hand, GATA3 clearly augmented the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1α and RBTN1 or RBTN2 by 2-3-fold. We next carried out the same transfection experiment using BALL-1 (Fig. 5B). As already shown in Fig. 2B, coexpression of TAL1α and RBTN1 or −2 hardly induced expression of tk-TAL1CS-CAT. The combination of TAL1α and GATA3 was, however, found to induce the reporter gene to some extent even without RBTN1 or −2. The combination of TAL1, GATA3, and especially RBTN1 further enhanced expression of the reporter gene to some extent. It should, however, be noted that the levels of induction of the reporter gene in BALL-1 even by the full combination of TAL1, GATA3, and RBTN1 or −2 were still far less than those seen in HPB-ALL by the combination of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2. Therefore, the exact role of GATA3 as a cofactor in the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN needs further evaluation. As mentioned above, the aberrant expression of TAL1 in T-ALL cell lines correlates 100% with strong expression of TALLA1, a highly specific tumor marker of T-ALL not detected on normal T cells (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine the role of TAL1 and RBTN in the ectopic expression of TALLA1, we cotransfected HPB-ALL with the following combinations of expression plasmids: pMIKneo + pMIKhyg, pMIKneoTAL1α+ pMIKhyg, pMIKneo + pMIKhygRBTN1, and pMIKneoTAL1α+ pMIKhygRBTN1. Stable transformants were isolated by double selection with G418 and hygromycin B, and expression of TAL1α and RBTN1 in each clone was determined by RT-PCR (data not shown). Two representative clones from each combination were then examined for surface TALLA1 by indirect immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). HPB-ALL clones transformed with vectors only or those expressing either TAL1α or RBTN1 alone showed little surface expression of TALLA1. In sharp contrast, HPB-ALL clones coexpressing TAL1α and RBTN1 were strongly positive for TALLA1. The two clones coexpressing TAL1α and RBTN1 also contained a large quantity of TALLA1 mRNA, whereas clones transfected with vectors only or those expressing either TAL1α or RBTN1 alone showed no such accumulation of TALLA1 mRNA (Fig. 6B). These results strongly suggest that the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN indeed induces, either directly or indirectly, the TALLA1 gene in T-ALL. TAL1, TAL2, and LYL1, whose bHLH domains are most closely related to each other among >60 bHLH proteins so far described, are all identified as the genes activated in T-ALL by recurrent chromosomal translocations (38Mellentin J.D. Smith S.D. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 39Xia Y. Brown L. Yang C.Y.-C. Tsan J.T. Siciliano M.J. Espinosa III, R. Le Beau M.M. Baer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11416-11420Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that these three bHLH proteins have a common mode of action in the leukemogenesis of T cells. RBTN1 and RBTN2, encoding closely related proteins containing only tandem LIM domains, represent another group of genes frequently activated by T-ALL-specific chromosomal translocations (14Boehm T. Foroni L. Kaneko Y. Perutz M.F. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 15McGuire E.A. Hockett R.D. Pollock K.M. Bartholdi M.F.

Wadman et al. (26Wadman I. Li J. Bash R.O. Forster A. Osada H. Rabbitts T.H. Baer R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4831-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) reported that TAL1, TAL2, and LYL1 all interacted with RBTN1 and RBTN2. Furthermore, Larson et al. (31Larson R.C. Lavenir I. Larson T.A. Bear R. Warren A.J. Wadman I. Nottage K. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) recently reported that double transgenic mice expressing both TAL1 and RBTN2 in T cells developed T cell tumors much more efficiently than those expressing either gene alone (12Robb L. Rasko J.E.J. Bath M.L. Strasser A. Begley C.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 205-209PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fisch P. Boehm T. Lavenir I. Larson T. Arno J. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H.

RBTNs, which are devoid of intrinsic DNA binding activity, may thus function as an essential cofactor for TAL1 and related bHLH proteins in their transcriptional and oncogenic activity in T cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of TAL1 in T cells indeed requires RBTN1 or RBTN2. First, we found that all the T-ALL cell lines expressing TAL1 do coexpress either RBTN1 or RBTN2 with 100% concordance (Fig. 1). Second, forced expression of TAL1 in a T-ALL cell line HPB-ALL strongly activated transcription from an artificial reporter gene under the control of the HSV tk minimal promoter with four copies of the optimal TAL1/E2A binding E-box motif in the upstream sequence (9Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan J.T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) only when RBTN1 or RBTN2 was coexpressed (Fig. 2). Third, TALLA1, a highly specific tumor marker of T-ALL (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) whose positivity shows 100% concordance with that of TAL1 among various T-ALL cell lines, was strongly induced by coexpression of TAL1 and RBTN1 in a TALLA1-negative T-ALL cell line HPB-ALL (Fig. 6). Collectively, RBTN1 or RBTN2 is indeed an essential cofactor for the positive transcriptional activity of TAL1 not only on the artificial reporter gene but also, either directly or indirectly, on an endogenous gene TALLA1 in T cells. Thus, the highly frequent ectopic expression of TALLA1 in T-ALL (32Takagi S. Fujikawa K. Imai T. Fukuhara N. Fukudome K. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Hinuma Y. Yoshie O. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) strongly suggests the presence of aberrant collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN in most T-ALL cases. The finding that mice coexpressing TAL1 and RBTN2 in the T cell lineage efficiently developed T cell tumors (31Larson R.C. Lavenir I. Larson T.A. Bear R. Warren A.J. Wadman I. Nottage K. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) further underscores the importance of such collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN in triggering the oncogenic process of T cells. Studies are now in progress to examine how the TALLA1 gene is induced in T cells by TAL1 and RBTN. Unexpectedly, the reporter gene with the HSV tk minimal promoter but without the upstream optimal TAL1/E2A-binding elements was also quite efficiently induced by the coexpression of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2 in HPB-ALL (Fig. 2). We have not yet examined the mechanism of this induction in detail. However, we may point out that there are a number of potential E-box-like elements in the original CAT plasmid (pCAT-Basic), some of which may function as fortuitous TAL1-responsive elements. Alternatively, TAL1 and RBTN may affect, somehow in a highly T cell-specific manner (see below), the expression and/or activity of transcription factors such as Sp1 and CTF that are known to interact with the HSV tk minimal promoter (40Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These possibilities are now under investigation. Surprisingly, TAL1 even in the presence of RBTN1 or RBTN2 hardly induced the artificial reporter genes in non-T cells (Fig. 2). This suggests that the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2 further requires some other cofactors specifically present in T cells. The fact that tumor-specific translocations involving TAL1, RBTN1, and RBTN2 are highly restricted to T-ALL and not observed in any other types of tumors (3Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) also supports that some T-cell specific cofactors are essential for the collaborative oncogenic activity of TAL1 and RBTN. In erythroid cells, TAL1 and RBTN2 are known to function in close collaboration with GATA1 or GATA2, the members of GATA-binding zinc finger type transcription factors (19Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4955-4958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the T cell-specific member of the GATA proteins, GATA3 (37Ho I.-C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.-F. Orkin S.H. Leidon J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), may be one of such cofactors in T cells. We showed that RBTN1 and RBTN2 were capable of directly binding to GATA3 in vitro (Fig. 4). We further demonstrated that overexpression of GATA3 in HPB-ALL augmented the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN1 or RBTN2 (Fig. 5). In BALL-1, TAL1 with and even without RBTN collaborated with GATA3 to induce the reporter gene (Fig. 5). These results may support that GATA3 is a cofactor for the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2 in T cells. However, it should also be noted that the observed collaborative transcriptional activities of TAL1, GATA3, and RBTN1 or −2 in BALL-1 were far less than those seen by the combination of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2 in HPB-ALL. Furthermore, we found that a dominant negative mutant of GATA3 KRR (35Smith V.M. Lee P.P. Szychowski S. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1515-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had no inhibitory effect at all on the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN in HPB-ALL (data not shown). The KRR mutant, which has three amino acids KRR (305-307) in the region between the two zinc fingers mutated to alanines, was shown to be totally inactive on a reporter gene linked to multiple GATA3-binding sites and to block transactivation of the same reporter gene by wild type GATA1, GATA2, or GATA3 (35Smith V.M. Lee P.P. Szychowski S. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1515-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the results with the KRR mutant still do not formally exclude the possibility of GATA3 as a cofactor because the KRR mutation may not affect the ability of GATA3 to function as such. Nevertheless, all of these observations may argue against a critical role of GATA3 in the collaborative transcriptional activity of TAL1 and RBTN1 or −2 in T cells. Thus, there may be more relevant cofactors for the TAL1/RBTN transcriptional complex in T cells besides or even independent of GATA3. Obviously further studies are needed to define cofactors for TAL1 and RBTN in T cells and to identify downstream genes whose expression in T cells is modulated, like TALLA1, by the TAL1/RBTN transcriptional complex. Such studies will lead to better understanding of the leukemogenesis of T cells and to a new therapeutic strategy for T-ALL. We thank Dr. K.

https://openalex.org/W2066306270,"Phosducin, which tightly binds βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, has been conjectured to play a role in regulating second messenger signaling cascades, but to date its specific function has not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate a potential role for phosducin in regulating olfactory signal transduction. In isolated olfactory cilia certain odorants elicit a rapid and transient cAMP response, terminated by a concerted process which requires the action of two protein kinases, protein kinase A (PKA) and a receptor-specific kinase (GRK3) (Schleicher, S., Boekhoff, I. Arriza, J., Lefkowitz, R. J., and Breer, H. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 1420-1424). The mechanism of action of GRK3 involves a Gβγ-mediated translocation of the kinase to the plasma membrane bound receptors (Pitcher, J. A., Inglese, J., Higgins, J. B., Arriza, J. L., Casey, P. J., Kim, C., Benovic, J. L., Kwatra, M. M., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1992) Science 257, 1264-1267). A protein with a molecular mass of 33 kDa that comigrates on SDS gels with recombinant phosducin and which is immunoreactive with phosducin antibodies is present in olfactory cilia. Recombinant phosducin added to permeabilized olfactory cilia preparations strongly inhibits termination of odorant-induced cAMP response and odorant-induced membrane translocation of GRK3. In addition, the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP stimulates membrane targeting of the receptor kinase. This effect is presumably due to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phosducin, which diminishes its affinity for binding to the Gβγ-subunit, thereby making Gβγ available to function as a membrane anchor for GRK3. A specific PKA inhibitor blocks the odorant-induced translocation of the receptor kinase. Consistent with this formulation, a non-phosphorylatable mutant of phosducin (phosducin Ser-73 Ala) is an even more effective inhibitor of desensitization and membrane targeting of GRK3 than the wild-type protein. A phosducin mutant that mimics phosphorylated phosducin (phosducin Ser-73 Asp) lacks this property and in fact recruits GRK3 to the membrane and potentiates desensitization. These results suggest that phosducin may act as a phosphorylation-dependent switch in second messenger signaling cascades, regulating the kinetics of desensitization processes by controlling the activity of Gβγ-dependent GRKs. Phosducin, which tightly binds βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins, has been conjectured to play a role in regulating second messenger signaling cascades, but to date its specific function has not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate a potential role for phosducin in regulating olfactory signal transduction. In isolated olfactory cilia certain odorants elicit a rapid and transient cAMP response, terminated by a concerted process which requires the action of two protein kinases, protein kinase A (PKA) and a receptor-specific kinase (GRK3) (Schleicher, S., Boekhoff, I. Arriza, J., Lefkowitz, R. J., and Breer, H. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 1420-1424). The mechanism of action of GRK3 involves a Gβγ-mediated translocation of the kinase to the plasma membrane bound receptors (Pitcher, J. A., Inglese, J., Higgins, J. B., Arriza, J. L., Casey, P. J., Kim, C., Benovic, J. L., Kwatra, M. M., Caron, M. G., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1992) Science 257, 1264-1267). A protein with a molecular mass of 33 kDa that comigrates on SDS gels with recombinant phosducin and which is immunoreactive with phosducin antibodies is present in olfactory cilia. Recombinant phosducin added to permeabilized olfactory cilia preparations strongly inhibits termination of odorant-induced cAMP response and odorant-induced membrane translocation of GRK3. In addition, the cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP stimulates membrane targeting of the receptor kinase. This effect is presumably due to PKA-mediated phosphorylation of phosducin, which diminishes its affinity for binding to the Gβγ-subunit, thereby making Gβγ available to function as a membrane anchor for GRK3. A specific PKA inhibitor blocks the odorant-induced translocation of the receptor kinase. Consistent with this formulation, a non-phosphorylatable mutant of phosducin (phosducin Ser-73 Ala) is an even more effective inhibitor of desensitization and membrane targeting of GRK3 than the wild-type protein. A phosducin mutant that mimics phosphorylated phosducin (phosducin Ser-73 Asp) lacks this property and in fact recruits GRK3 to the membrane and potentiates desensitization. These results suggest that phosducin may act as a phosphorylation-dependent switch in second messenger signaling cascades, regulating the kinetics of desensitization processes by controlling the activity of Gβγ-dependent GRKs. The olfactory system responds precisely to iterative stimulation; this characteristic feature is due to the phasic responses of receptor cells (3Getchel T.V. Shepherd G.M. J. Physiol. (London). 1978; 282: 541-560Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), based on a rapid termination of the odor-induced primary reaction (4Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that olfactory signaling is terminated by uncoupling the transduction cascade; the second messenger signal elicited by odors is turned off by a negative feedback reaction controlled by phosphorylation of odorant receptors mediated by two types of enzymes, a second messenger controlled kinase and a receptor specific kinase (GRK) 1The abbreviations used are: GRK3receptor-specific kinaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPKAprotein kinase A.

These observations raise the possibility that the two kinases act sequentially in a reaction cascade that is initiated by activating the second messenger-dependent kinase. The details of how these kinases interact, however, remain elusive. Several mechanisms seem plausible; second messenger-dependent kinase might directly phosphorylate and thus increase the enzymatic activity of receptor-specific kinases, similar to kinase-mediated activation of enzymes in regulating metabolic pathways (9Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for this mechanism; in fact, the sequence of GRK3 does not contain any concensus site for PKA phosphorylation. Alternatively, the receptor-specific kinase may be under tonic control of an as yet unknown inhibitor, the phosphorylation of which by PKA may relieve this inhibitory constraint (1Schleicher S.

It has recently been found that interaction of GRKs with βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Gβγ-subunits) is required for the cytosolic GRKs to be translocated to the membrane and subsequently phosphorylate the agonist-occupied receptors (2Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 11Haga K. Haga T.

Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These findings were extended by the observation that membrane targeting of GRK by docking onto βγ-subunits is an essential prerequisite for turning off the second messenger cascade (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosducin, a major soluble phosphoprotein first discovered in mammalian retinal tissue (16McGinnis J.F. Leveille P.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1985; 4: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Lolley R.N. Brown B.M. Farber D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) probably via structural domains within the amino-terminal region which are homologous to the Gβγ-binding domain of GRKs (19Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The notion that both proteins may compete for binding sites of the Gβγ complex has recently been confirmed (10Hekman M. Bauer P. Sohlemann R. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosducin is readily phosphorylated at serine residue 73 by protein kinase A, and this modification significantly reduces its binding affinity for Gβγ-subunits (19Hawes B.E. Touhara K.

In this study we set out to explore the hypothesis that phosducin might be capable of serving as a PKA controlled inhibitor of GRK in olfactory cilia. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River, Sulzfeld; fresh bovine olfactory epithelium was obtained from a local slaughterhouse and stored at −70°C. The odorants citralva (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadiennitrile), hedione (3-oxo-2-pentylcyclopentaneacetic acid methyl ester), and eugenol [2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)phenol] were provided by Drom, Baierbrunn, Germany. Protein kinase A inhibitor (Walsh inhibitor) as well as N6,2-O-dibutyryladenosine 3:5-cyclic monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) were obtained from Sigma. Radioligand assay kits for cAMP were provided by Amersham Corp. Subtype specific polyclonal antibodies against recombinant GRK3 were prepared as described previously (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); antibodies against phosducin were raised in rabbits and goats using recombinant phosducin as antigen and purified as described (22Schulz K. Danner S. Bauer P. Schroder S. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22546-22551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The purity grade of all chemicals used was >99%. A human phosducin plasmid (pBS-33K) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Shinohara (National Institutes of Health). An MluI site (ACGCGT) was introduced into pBS-33K by a single base mutation at position 252 (A C) employing a mutagenetic reverse primer containing a BsmI site. The forward primer contained a sequence complementary to the 5-end of phosducin (including the start codon and 5-nucleotides) and contained a 5-KpnI site. The polymerase chain reaction fragment generated from these primers was subcloned into pBS-33K and digested with KpnI/BsmI. Polymerase chain reaction-cassette mutagenesis of Ser-73 to Ala and Asp was accomplished using this new construct and the flanking MluI/HindIII sites. The introduction of mutations was verified by sequencing with Sequenase. The mutant phosducin cDNAs were ligated into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) as a fusion protein with 10 amino acids containing a hexahistidine sequence. Fusion protein constructs were introduced into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 and induced as described previously (23Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Touhara K. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induced cells were lysed in 50 mM HEPES, 1% Tween 20, protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim), pH 7.5, by freeze-thawing. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor, Sorvall instruments) for 20 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 8 M urea. After 4 h incubation with rotation, the solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. Ni-resin (proBond; Invitrogen) was then added to the supernatant and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with rotation. The same volume of buffer A containing 4 M urea was added, and the beads were collected in a column. The beads were washed with buffer A containing 4, 3, 2, and 1 M urea stepwise, and the washed beads were incubated with buffer A containing 1 M urea overnight at 4°C. The refolded His-6-fusion proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was then dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, 350 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 4°C. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Enriched preparations of olfactory cilia from rat and bovine olfactory epithelium were isolated using the calcium-shock method described by Anholt et al. (25Anholt R.R.H. Aebi U. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1403-1406Crossref Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (26Chen Z. Pace U. Heldman J. Lancet D. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2146-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All isolation steps were performed at 4°C. The olfactory epithelium was washed in Ringer solution (120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.6 mM K2HPO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 7.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4) and subsequently transferred to Ringer solution containing 10 mM calcium. Detached cilia were separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 7,700 × g The supernatant was collected, and the resulting pellet was resuspended again in Ringer solution with 10 mM CaCl2 and centrifuged as described above. The supernatants were combined and centrifuged for 15 min at 27,000 × g The pellet containing the detached cilia was resuspended in TME buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and stored at −70°C. Phosducin was immunoprecipitated from bovine isolated olfactory cilia preparations as described recently (27Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosolic fractions were prepared by homogenizing 8 mg of isolated cilia under liquid nitrogen and suspending them in 20 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 20 mg/liter benzamidine, 20 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. After turraxing, the samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with pre-washed Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After an additional centrifugation step, 5 μg of affinity purified rabbit anti-phosducin antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h before the immune complexes were bound by adding another aliquot of Protein A-Sepharose and pelleted by centrifugation. After washing the pellets with Brij buffer (1% Brij 96, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 20 mg/liter benzamidine, 20 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) the samples were resuspended in SDS-loading buffer containing 6 M urea and heated to 95°C for 5 min to release the protein. As a control, the same procedure was done with cytosol that has been heated to 95°C for 5 min followed by pelleting of the denatured protein. The samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and phosducin was detected using the IgG fraction of a second phosducin antiserum raised in goats (22Schulz K. Danner S. Bauer P. Schroder S. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22546-22551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.). A rapid kinetic system was used to determine odorant-induced changes of second messenger concentrations in the subsecond time range. Stimulation experiments were performed at 37°C as described previously (4Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Syringe I contained the stimulation buffer (200 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, 50 mM MOPS, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium cholate, 1 mM ATP, and 2 μM GTP, pH 7.4) and 12 nM free calcium calculated and adjusted as described by Pershadsingh and McDonald (28Pershadsingh H.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syringe II contained the olfactory cilia, and syringe III was filled with stop solution (7% perchloric acid). If not indicated otherwise, 205 μl of stimulation buffer was mixed with 20 μl of cilia; at the appropriate time (ms) the reaction was stopped by injection of perchloric acid. Quenched samples were stored on ice for 20 min and then analyzed for second messenger concentrations as described previously (29Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In all cases cilia were preincubated 10 min on ice with the recombinant phosducin mutants or the other modulators; control samples were incubated with TME buffer, which was used to dilute the protein. The concentrations of the different modulators indicated are the concentrations during pretreating the cilia. Odor-induced translocation of GRK3 from the cytosol to the membrane was performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique as described previously (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated olfactory cilia preparations in hypotonic TME buffer were pretreated for 15 min on ice with solutions of recombinant phosducin or the various modulators; control samples were incubated only with TME medium, which was used to dilute the protein. Prior to odor stimulation, cilia preparations (100 μl) and the stimulation buffer containing an odorant dilution of citralva, hedione, eugenol were adapted to 37°C. After adding the stimulation buffer (200 μl) the samples were incubated for 10 s at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. To separate the cytosolic and membrane fraction, samples were directly centrifuged for 1 h at 48,000 × g; during this period the samples became totally thawed without disturbing the balance of membrane and cytosolic distribution of GRK3. After resuspending the pellet in TME buffer, the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Microwell plates were coated with protein (200 ng to 1 μg of protein/100 μl 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.5) at 4°C overnight in a wet chamber. Unbound material was washed out with TBS (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl) and 0.1% gelatin. After preincubation with TBS gelatin containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature in a wet chamber, GRK3 antibody dilutions (1:1000 to 1:10,000) in TBS gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:15,000 in TBS gelatin, 1% bovine serum albumin). Each step was followed by three TBS gelatin washes. Antibody binding was visualized using a substrate solution containing 0.005% 3,5,3,5-tetramethylbenzidine and 0.003% H2O2 in 100 mM sodium acetate/citrate buffer, pH 6.0; the enzyme reaction was stopped after 20-30 min by adding 1 N H2SO4; extinction was measured at 450 nm with a Dynatech MR 700 microplate reader. In order to verify if phosducin is indeed present in olfactory cilia preparations, a combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies as described previously (27Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, a strong immunoreactive band of 33 kDa (lane 3) which comigrates with recombinant phosducin (lane 1) is visualized in the olfactory cilia preparation. The specificity of the reaction is supported by the negative reaction in lane 2 (control) which represents a boiled sample of cilia. Based on the labeling intensity, the concentration of phosducin in the cilia preparation seems to be in the same range as in other tissues (27Danner S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10145-10150Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To approach the question of whether phosducin may affect the kinetics of odor-induced second messenger signaling, the effect of exogenous phosducin on odor-induced cAMP responses in olfactory cilia was analyzed. Cilia preparations from the rat olfactory epithelium were preincubated with recombinant phosducin and subsequently stimulated with a mixture of odorants (citralva, hedione, and eugenol, 1 μM each); the odorant-induced cAMP response was monitored in the subsecond time range. Stimulation of control samples elicited a rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cAMP (Fig. 2) as described previously (4Breer H. Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Nature. 1990; 345: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In samples pretreated with recombinant phosducin the “onset kinetics” of the odorant-induced cAMP signal were virtually unaffected; however, the “off kinetics” were significantly changed; the elevated cAMP level decayed with a much slower rate. These results indicate that exogenous phosducin inhibited the rapid termination of the odor-induced second messenger signal; thus phosducin seems to interfere with the desensitization process. Since membrane targeting of GRK3 is a prerequisite for terminating the olfactory signaling cascade (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated if exogenous phosducin may affect the odor-induced translocation of GRK3. Isolated olfactory cilia were preincubated with exogenous phosducin and stimulated with an odor mixture; subsequently membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated and analyzed for receptor-specific kinase immunoreactivity as described previously (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In untreated cilia prior to odorant stimulation, only 21.2 ± 3.6% of the GRK immunoreactivity was found in the membrane fraction and about 78.8 ± 3.6% was in the cytosol (Fig. 3). Stimulation with odorants induced a significantly different distribution pattern of the GRK immunoreactivity, cytosol (54.6 ± 4.6) and membrane fraction (45.3 ± 4.6). In contrast, when cilia preincubated with phosducin were stimulated with odorants, the distribution pattern of kinase immunoreactivity did not change; most of the GRK remained in the cytosolic fraction. These results imply that exogenous phosducin prevents the translocation of GRK3 to the membrane-anchored Gβγ and that this may be the critical step by which phosducin interferes with the rapid desensitization (Fig. 2). If phosducin is tonically inhibiting the desensitization process by preventing GRK3 from docking onto βγ-subunits, then its phosphorylation by PKA may release this constraint, since previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of phosducin by PKA diminishes its potential to interfere with the interaction of GRK with Gβγ (10Hekman M. Bauer P. Sohlemann R. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the relevance of this hypothesis, experiments were performed measuring membrane targeting of GRK3 in the presence of a cAMP analogue which should activate protein kinase A, leading to phosphorylation of endogenous phosducin. The data indicate that in the presence of elevated cAMP levels, a significantly higher portion of GRK3 was associated with the membrane (Fig. 4). These results support the notion that protein kinase A may play a key role in controlling the membrane targeting of GRK3 in olfactory cilia induced by “cAMP odorants.” This view was further scrutinized in experiments using a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A. As shown in Fig. 5, the translocation of GRK3 elicited by odorant stimulation is attenuated by the Walsh inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner. These results further substantiate the essential role of PKA-mediated phosphorylation reactions in regulating the translocation of GRK. To further approach the functional role of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated phosducin, distinct mutants were prepared. In the phosducin-Ser-73 Ala mutant, serine 73 was changed to alanine, thus preventing its PKA-mediated phosphorylation; the phosducin-Ser-73 Asp mutant, in which serine 73 was substituted by aspartic acid, should mimic the phosphorylated form of phosducin due to its negatively charged side chain. Analyzing each mutant for its capability to become phosphorylated by PKA revealed that only wild-type phosducin undergoes phosphorylation whereas both mutants (Ala, Asp) are not phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 6A). These results confirm previous observations indicating that serine 73 is the target site for phosphorylation of phosducin by PKA (21Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize the functional properties of the different phosducin isoforms, their binding capacity for βγ-subunits of trimeric G-proteins was assessed. As shown in Fig. 6B, in control samples (without fusion protein) there is no βγ binding detectable; the wild-type phosducin as well as the phosducin-Ala mutant interacted with βγ-subunits to a similar extent. The pseudophosphorylated phosducin-Asp mutant displayed a significantly reduced binding to βγ-subunits, probably due to its reduced affinity. Subsequently the mutated forms of phosducin were assessed for their potency to affect termination of odor-induced second messenger signaling. The phosducin-Ala mutant, which cannot be modified by PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 6A) and which efficiently interacts with Gβγ-subunits (Fig. 6B), prevented the rapid decay of the odor-induced second messenger response (Fig. 7A); interestingly, this non-modifiable phosducin form was even more effective than the native form (Fig. 2) suggesting that exogenously applied native phosducin may be partially inactivated by PKA phosphorylation during preincubation. In cilia preparations preincubated with the pseudo-phosphorylated mutant phosducin-Asp, the rapid termination of the odor-induced cAMP signal was not blocked, but rather the cAMP signal decayed even more rapidly (Fig. 7B); in addition, the intensity of the response was reduced. These results indicate that phosducin-Asp does not attenuate but rather seems to facilitate the desensitization process. This could mean that an excess of pseudo-phosphorylated phosducin may expose more βγ-subunits for GRKs targeting, thus causing a recruitment of GRKs. Therefore, it is conceivable that an excess of phosphorylated phosducin may allow a membrane docking of GRK even before receptor stimulation. To assess this notion, the GRK3 distribution in cilia preparations was determined in the presence of the two phosducin mutants. As can be seen in Fig. 8A, the phosducin-Ala completely blocked the odor-induced translocation of GRK3 from the cytosol to the membrane (Fig. 8A). Thus, the non-phosphorylated form of phosducin, which actively interferes with the desensitization process (Fig. 7A) and efficiently interacts with Gβγ-subunits (Fig. 6A), prevents odor-induced translocation of GRK3. To approach the properties of the phosphorylated form of phosducin on GRK3 distribution, cilia were incubated with phosducin-Asp but not stimulated with odorants (Fig. 8B). The results indicate that after preincubation with phosducin-Asp 34.7 ± 9.8% of the GRK3 immunoreactivity was located in the membrane fraction compared with 21.2 ± 3.6 in untreated cilia. Upon stimulation with odorants under the same conditions, the proportion of GRK bound to the membrane (44.6 ± 8.2%) increased only slightly. These results indicate that an excess of pseudo-phosphorylated phosducin elicits a membrane targeting of GRK3. Experiments using exogenous phosducin and its mutated forms are consistent with the hypothesis that phosducin may control the kinetics of second messenger signaling in olfactory cilia by governing the stimulus-dependent translocation of a receptor-specific kinase. This observation is in line with previous in vitro studies demonstrating that binding of GRK2 to βγ-subunits is inhibited by phosducin (10Hekman M. Bauer P. Sohlemann R. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments employing phosducin mutants support the view that phosphorylation of phosducin may change its functional properties. A phosducin mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated, prevented the rapid decay of an odor-induced second messenger response even more efficiently than the native form. Furthermore, phosducin mutants that mimic the phosphorylated form, due to a negatively charged side chain, caused a constitutive translocation of GRK3 to the membrane suggesting that the phosphorylation status of phosducin may allow an anchoring of GRK3 to βγ-subunits. This could be due to the reduced binding affinity of phosphorylated phosducin to βγ-subunits as previously observed in experiments using fusion proteins with the amino terminus of phosducin (19Hawes B.E. Touhara K. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29825-29830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, reconstitution experiments have shown that the competition of phosducin and GRK for a common binding site on the Gβγ-complex is antagonized following phosphorylation of phosducin by PKA (10Hekman M. Bauer P. Sohlemann R. Lohse M.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Together with previous in vitro observations the findings of this study support a model in which phosducin is a phosphorylation-dependent regulator governing the membrane targeting of GRK; in its non-phosphorylated state phosducin strongly interacts with the βγ-subunits of trimeric G-proteins thus preventing the anchoring of GRK3 to these sites. Upon phosphorylation, the affinity of phosducin for the βγ-subunits is reduced and the blockade of GRK anchoring is relieved, so that the GRK can dock onto βγ-subunits and phosphorylate receptor proteins, thus uncoupling the transduction cascade. Previous studies have shown that a sequential interplay of two types of kinases is involved in terminating the odor-induced second messenger signal, a second messenger controlled kinase and a receptor-specific kinase (GRK3) (1Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Boekhoff I. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 259: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); both types of kinases are required for an effective desensitization of the olfactory cascade (1Schleicher S. Boekhoff I. Arriza J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sequential interplay of the two enzymes could be explained if phosducin is the previously proposed endogenous inhibitor of GRK3 action (15Boekhoff I. Inglese J. Schleicher S. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An odorant-induced rise of cAMP levels would activate protein kinase A leading to phosphorylation of phosducin which triggers the membrane targeting of GRK3 and phosphorylation of the receptor protein. Whether termination of the alternative olfactory pathway, odorant-induced generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, is controlled by a similar cascade is unclear. Previous studies have indicated that in this case protein kinase C plays a critical role, analogous to kinase A in the cAMP pathway (5Boekhoff I. Breer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The lack of obvious consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C makes it less likely that phosducin may also be involved in the phospholipase C pathway. However, recent studies have demonstrated that stimulation of protein kinase C elicits an activation of GRK due to a phosphorylation-mediated translocation to the plasma membrane (32Winstel R.

While the binding properties of Mig1p have been studied in vitro and the ability of Mig1p-Cyc8p (Ssn6p)-Tup1p to repress has been studied in vivo, no experiments have measured the effect of a carbon source on the in vivo binding of Mig1p or the effect of bound MIg1p on activator occupancy of the upstream activation sequence (UAS). To obtain this information, we used genomic footprinting to investigate glucose repression of MAL62, a gene that is also regulated by the Mal63p activator. These experiments show that two interrelated mechanisms are involved in the glucose repression of MAL62: 1) competition between the Mal63p activator and Mig1p for DNA binding and 2) modulation of Mig1p binding by the carbon source. Mig1p affects basal MAL62 expression in the absence of Mal63p by binding to a site in the MAL62 promoter and affects Mal63p-dependent synthesis by also inhibiting the access of Mal63p to site 1 in the UASMAL. The binding of Mig1p is increased in glucose and decreased in nonrepressing sugars, but the increased binding in glucose is not due to an increase in the levels of Mig1p. Mig1p inhibits gene expression in glucose by binding the Cyc8p (Ssn6p)-Tup1p repressor to the promoter of glucose-repressible genes. While the binding properties of Mig1p have been studied in vitro and the ability of Mig1p-Cyc8p (Ssn6p)-Tup1p to repress has been studied in vivo, no experiments have measured the effect of a carbon source on the in vivo binding of Mig1p or the effect of bound MIg1p on activator occupancy of the upstream activation sequence (UAS).

These experiments show that two interrelated mechanisms are involved in the glucose repression of MAL62: 1) competition between the Mal63p activator and Mig1p for DNA binding and 2) modulation of Mig1p binding by the carbon source. Mig1p affects basal MAL62 expression in the absence of Mal63p by binding to a site in the MAL62 promoter and affects Mal63p-dependent synthesis by also inhibiting the access of Mal63p to site 1 in the UASMAL. The binding of Mig1p is increased in glucose and decreased in nonrepressing sugars, but the increased binding in glucose is not due to an increase in the levels of Mig1p. Glucose regulates carbon utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inhibiting the transcription of numerous genes, by affecting mRNA stability, and by inactivating preexisting proteins. The enzymes affected include those involved in gluconeogenesis, in the Krebs cycle, in respiration, and in the early steps in the utilization of galactose and other sugars (1Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Together these mechanisms, collectively called glucose repression, function to partition carbon metabolism between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and to ensure the utilization of glucose in preference to other carbon sources. Although the mechanism of glucose repression is not understood, several of the genes involved have been identified. Central among these is MIG1, originally isolated as a multicopy inhibitor of GAL1 (2Nehlin J.O. Carlberg M. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 3Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). MIG1 encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein that binds to several glucose-regulated promoters (e.g. GAL1-10, SUC2) and in a complex with two other proteins, Tup1p and Cyc8p (Ssn6p), represses transcription during glucose growth. Deletion of MIG1 relieves glucose repression, and genetic experiments suggest that the ability of Mig1p to repress is regulated by a kinase encoded by SNF1 (4Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Genetics. 1994; 137: 49-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes required for maltose utilization are also subject to glucose repression. Maltose fermentation requires three proteins: the Mal63p activator, the Mal61p permease, and the Mal62p maltase. Maltose induces all three proteins; glucose inactivates maltose permease and represses transcription of MAL63, MAL61, and MAL62 (5Needleman R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2079-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Needleman R.B. Kaback D.B. Dubin R.A. Perkins E.L. Rosenberg N.G. Sutherland K.A. Forrest D.B. Michels C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2811-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Ni B. Regulation of MAL6 Gene Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 1984; Google Scholar). We have been studying the role of Mig1p in the MAL system and have recently shown that the deletion of a Mig1p binding site in the promoter of a constitutive allele of MAL63 (MAL63c-D8) relieves glucose repression (8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter site overlaps the transcriptional start site of MAL63 (7Ni B. Regulation of MAL6 Gene Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 1984; Google Scholar), implying that its removal may lead to an increased synthesis of Mal63c-D8p. If so, it remains to be explained how an increase in the synthesis of Mal63cp can release glucose repression. A clue is provided by the arrangement of binding sites for Mal63p and Mig1p in the MAL61-MAL62 divergent promoter. This promoter contains two Mig1p binding sites, with one, which we call site A, adjacent to the MAL63p binding site, site 1 (Fig. 1; Refs. 1Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar and 9Sirenko O.I. Ni B. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A simple explanation for the effect of increased Mal63cp concentrations on glucose repression would be that the binding of Mig1p to site A decreases Mal63c-D8p binding to site 1, reducing MAL62 expression. Increases in the synthesis of Mal63c-D8p (e.g. by the removal of a Mig1p site in the MAL63c promoter) would lead to increased site 1 occupancy and to increased MAL62 expression in glucose. To explain derepression of MAL62 expression on sugars such as galactose, it is necessary to have a mechanism in which the binding to site A and/or the activity of the Mig1p-Cyc8p (Ssn6p)-Tup1p complex is reduced. In its simplest form, a satisfactory model would be that the affinity of Mig1p for site A is modulated by “upstream” proteins that respond to an unknown glucose repression signal; proteins like Snf1p, for example, could function by decreasing Mig1p binding. However, there is no direct evidence for binding competition between Mig1p and Mal63p, and similar configurations of activator and repressor sites exist in yeast where mechanisms other than competitive binding are involved (10Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Similarly, no information is available on the possible carbon source modulation of Mig1p binding in vivo In this report we present experiments that measure the binding of Mal63p and Mig1p in vivo to their sites in the MAL62 promoter and correlate this binding with MAL62 expression. The results support a model in which Mig1p affects basal MAL62 expression in the absence of Mal63p by binding to site A and affects Mal63p-dependent synthesis by also inhibiting the access of Mal63p to site 1 in the MAL62 promoter. Competition between Mig1p and Mal63p requires a functional site 1, showing that it is a direct competition for DNA binding and not an indirect mechanism like squelching. Most importantly, the binding ability of Mig1p-Cyc8p (Ssn6p)-Tup1p is increased in glucose and decreased in nonrepressing sugars, indicating that regulation of Mig1p binding is involved in the glucose repression of MAL62 and probably other yeast genes. The strains used and the full genotypes are shown in Table I. The wild type S. cerevisiae strain was 332-5B (MAL6 MAL12). Strain 332-F is isogenic to 332-5B except for the introduction of a mal63 frameshift mutation. This was constructed by first replacing by homologous recombination approximately 0.4 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionUASupstream activation sequencePNPGasep-nitrophenol-α-glucosidase. of MAL63 (from the AvaII site in the promoter at −278 base pair to position +130 base pair in the coding sequence) with URA3 (11Chang M. Unusual Complementation at MAL6 Ph.D. thesis, Wayne State University School of Medicine. 1994; Google Scholar); the resulting strain, strain 332-Δ52, was a gift from Man Chang. Using primer TGAAAAAGAGAGGTCGACAATCCATTAG, a mal63 frameshift mutation was constructed at position +36 in MAL63; this primer also introduces a SalI site. The frameshift mutation deletes the Mal63p “zinc finger,” which has been shown to be required for DNA binding (9Sirenko O.I. Ni B. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing this frameshift mutation and containing regions of MAL63 5 and 3 to the URA3 insertion in the genome was transformed into strain 332-Δ52, and ura− recombinants were selected by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid. PCR of chromosomal DNA using primers AGCAGGCTAATACACCTGTTT (−583 of MAL63) and CTATATCAAGTGATGTGG (+911 of MAL63) yielded a PCR product of the expected size, which also contained the SalI site, confirming the desired construction. 332 ΔMIG1 (isogenic to 332-5B except for a deletion-insertion of MIG1) was constructed by one-step gene replacement (12Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar) using plasmid pJN41 (a gift of Hans Ronne), and the resulting strain checked by Southern analysis. Strain 332-F ΔMIG1 contains the mal63 frameshift mutation indicated above and a deletion-insertion of MIG1, but it is otherwise isogenic to strain 332-5B. Strain 332-J1 is isogenic to 332-5B except for the replacement of a region of the MAL12 promoter containing the UASMAL12 and the Mig1p binding site with URA3 and the replacement of site 1 in the MAL62 promoter with a site 1 sequence unable to bind Mal63p; the site 1 sequence CCGGAAATTTTCGCG (30Levine J. Tanouye L. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was mutated to CCGGAAATTTTCtaG using plasmid pOX1 (see below). Strain 332-J1 was constructed as follows. First, using plasmid pOX2 (see below) we constructed two strains by one-step gene replacement. 332-ΔpMAL12 is isogenic to 332-5B except for a deletion-insertion that replaced part of the MAL12 promoter and part of the MAL12 coding sequence with URA3 332-ΔpMAL62 was constructed in the same way as 332-ΔpMAL12 except that the MAL62 promoter and early coding sequences were replaced instead of the MAL12 promoter. Second, 332-ΔpMAL62 was used to create strain 332Δsite1 in which the MAL61-62 promoter site 1 was replaced with the mutated site by homologous recombination with plasmid pOX1. To confirm the construction the promoter region was isolated by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. 332-J1 was then constructed by crossing strains 332-ΔpMAL12 and 332Δsite1, utilizing as an intermediate crosses to strain 612-1D, which is isogenic to strain 332-5B but MATαTable IYeast strainsStrainsGenotypes332-5BMATa MAL6 MAL12 MIG1 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 trp1 his1A9Isogenic to 332-5B except MAL63::URA3332-FIsogenic to 332-5B except mal63 (frameshift)332 ΔMIG1Isogenic to 332-5B except MIG1::URA3332-F ΔMIG1Isogenic to 332-F except MIG1::URA3332-J1Isogenic to 332-5B except MAL12::URA3 site 1 mutation332 ΔTUP1Isogenic to 332-5B except TUP1::URA3332 ΔMIG1 ΔTUP1Isogenic to 332 ΔTUP1 except MIG1::URA3332 ΔCYC8Isogenic to 332-5B except CYC8::URA3332 ΔMIG1 ΔCYC8Isogenic to 332 ΔSSN6 except MIG1::URA3 Open table in a new tab kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction upstream activation sequence p-nitrophenol-α-glucosidase. Unless otherwise indicated, the cells used for genomic footprinting were grown on minimal medium (0.7% yeast nitrogen base, the required nutritional supplements, and a carbon source); better footprints were obtained on this medium. Minimal medium was SD (minimal plus glucose) and SM (minimal plus maltose). Complex media was YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone). Carbon sources were used at 2% for glucose (YPD, SD) and maltose (YPM, SM). YEPGE contained 3% glycerol and 2% ethanol. The PNPGase assay for maltase was described previously (20Hu Z. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to log phase on YEPM, centrifuged, washed, and transferred to YPD medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Footprinting was done after incubation for 30 minutes at 30°C. Yeast transformation was done using electroporation (13Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods. Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) or lithium acetate (14Elble R. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pOX1 was constructed by inserting the entire MAL61-62 promoter and part of the MAL62 coding sequence on an EcoRI-PstI fragment into phagemid pS1 (Promega). pOX1-BamHI is pOX1 but with a BamHI site introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at position −470 in the MAL61-62 promoter. Plasmid pOX2 was constructed by replacing the BamHI-BglII fragment of pOX1-BamHI with URA3 The plasmid pMIG1 containing MIG1 on a 2μ vector was a gift of Hans Ronne; it also contains URA3 and LEU-2d for selection. pJW 28 is the SalI-BglII fragment containing all of MAL63 cloned into plasmid Yep351 (15Myers A.M. Tzagaloff A. Kinny D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar); pJW30 contained the same SalI-BglII fragment of MAL63c-D8 in the same vector. The single copy plasmids pJW4 and pJW5 containing MAL63 or MAL63c, respectively, were described previously (8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pS1-45 is a derivative of pS1 and contains a ClaI-XbaI fragment encompassing part of the MAL63 coding region and more than 1.5 kb of the MAL63 promoter; it was used to generate the MAL63 antisense RNA used in the RNA protection assay. Plasmid pJW49 was constructed by inserting an EcoRI-SpeI fragment of MIG1 into pS1. The methods used were described previously (8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sirenko O.I. Ni B. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Kits for in vitro transcription and RNA protection (Ambion) were used for both antisense RNA preparation and for the RNA protection assay. A PstI-BglII fragment of pOX1 was used as the template for the generation of MAL62 antisense RNA, and a XbaI-TaqI fragment cloned into pS1 (pS1-45) was used to generate MAL63 antisense RNA. The MluI-SpeI fragment from plasmid pJW49 was used as a template for MIG1 antisense RNA. The actin control template is an EcoRI-BamHI fragment from the plasmid pPL9 (a gift from Man Chang). Direct counting of gels in an Ambis radiation analysis system was used to quantitate mRNA levels. The DNA preparation for genomic footprinting was essentially the same as that used in Diffley et al. (16Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). After the cells were grown to log phase, they were collected at 4°C and resuspended in 4-5 volumes (w/v) of lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Lysis was by vortexing with an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm) five times for 30 s, separated by 30 s on ice. Aliquots of the extract (0.3 ml) were treated with 30 μl containing 10-20 Kunitz units of DNase I (Sigma, type IV) for 30 s. Reactions were processed as described (17Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Hull M.W. Thomas G. Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was stopped by adding 330 μl of 1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM EDTA, extracted three times with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated with an equal volume of cold ethanol. The DNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 400 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The remaining RNA in the DNA preparation was removed by adding 5 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml, Sigma type I-AS, heat-treated) and incubating for 2-3 h at 37°C. After RNA digestion, the DNA was precipitated by adding 5-10 μl sodium acetate (3.0 M, pH 5.2) and 2-3 volumes of cold ethanol. The DNA was washed, dried, and resuspended in 50 μl of TE buffer. 3-5 μl of each sample was separated on a 1% agarose gel to determine the degree of digestion. DNA that had not been treated with DNase I ran as a single, broad high molecular weight band in the 20-kb region. DNase I-treated DNA, which showed a uniform distribution between 10 kb and 0.2 kb, was used for genomic footprinting. The “naked DNA” control (i.e. DNA that had been phenol-extracted) was cut using 10-100-fold less DNase I than for genomic cell lysates in DNase I assay buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 100 mM KCl, pH 8.0); this DNase I-treated DNA was also checked on a 1% agarose gel before it was used for primer extension. The wild type strain 332-5B contains two identical copies of the MALx2 promoter corresponding to MAL62 and MAL12; both are under the control of Mal63p. The genomic footprinting experiments therefore measure the occupancy of both promoters simultaneously. In experiments accessing the effect of a site 1 mutation and the competition between Mig1p and Mal63p for binding, it is necessary to either introduce the site 1 mutation into both the MAL62 and MAL12 promoters or to introduce it into one of the promoters and to delete the other. We chose to introduce it into the MAL62 promoter and to delete the promoter of MAL12 The primer was CTTCACTGCTTGGATACCAA, and it is located at positions −480 to −460 of the MAL61-62 promoter (Fig. 1). It was labeled by T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) according to the supplier's instructions. One-twentieth volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, and the DNA was precipitated with 5 volumes of cold ethanol. The mixture was kept for 30 min at −20°C, centrifuged 15 min at 10,000 × g, washed with 75% ethanol, and air-dried. The labeled primer was then dissolved in 5-10 μl of primer buffer (10 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA), and 2/3 volume of stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol FF) was added before the primer was gel-purified on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The procedures for genomic footprinting and primer extension were as described previously (17Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Hull M.W. Thomas G. Huibregtse J.M. Engelke D.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, Taq DNA polymerase was used for primer extension, with each primer extension reaction comprising 10-20 μg of DNA, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Cetus), 5 μl of 10 × Taq polymerase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μl of 50 mM MgCl2, 5 μl of a nucleotide stock solution (1 mM dATP, 1 mM dTTP, 1 mM dCTP, and 1 mM dGTP), 1-2 μl of 32P-labeled primer (specific activity of 3000-6000 Ci/mmol), and H2O to 50 μl. For genomic footprinting, we used 10 μg of chromosomal DNA; for genomic sequencing we used 2-5 μg of naked DNA. For the sequence standards, we used either 5 μl of a dideoxy-GTP stock (1 mM dATP, dCTP, dTTP, 100 μM dGTP, 500 μM dideoxy-GTP) or 5 μl of a dideoxy-ATP stock (1 mM dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 25 μM dATP, 1 mM dideoxy-ATP). It was sometimes necessary to adjust the relative amounts of dGTP and dideoxy-GTP or dATP and dideoxy-ATP. PCR was carried out for 15 rounds of primer extension; the cycle was as follows: 94°C for 1 min, 94-55°C for 1.5 min, 55°C for 3 min, 55-72°C for 1.5 min, 72°C for 4 min, and 72-94°C for 1.5 min. The product of the primer extension was precipitated by 3 volumes of ethanol, frozen at −20°C for 15 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and dried. The pellet was dissolved in 5 μl of TE buffer and 3 μl of sequencing stop buffer. It was heated at 95-100°C for 2 min and loaded onto a sequencing gel. The elimination of a Mig1p site in the promoter (site C) of the constitutive MAL63c-D8 allele leads to a substantial decrease in glucose repression (8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the deletion of site C led to increases in Mal63p expression and, if so, whether the postulated increases could relieve glucose repression. Since we were unable to obtain antibody of sufficient quality for determining the levels of Mal63p in vivo, we instead measured MAL63 mRNA during glucose growth in strain A9 (MAL63::URA3) transformed with one of three single copy plasmids: a MAL63 plasmid, a MAL63c-D8 plasmid with a wild type site C, and a MAL63c-D8 plasmid with a site C mutated to a sequence unable to bind Mig1p (Fig. 2; Refs. 19Lundin M.J. Nehlin O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and 20Hu Z. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Removal of site C acts as a promoter-up mutation, with a 2-fold increase in MAL63c mRNA. This strongly suggests that an increase in the concentration of Mal63p is responsible for the reduction in glucose repression in strain MAL63c-D8 seen after mutation of site C (8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly test if increased Mal63cp expression relieves glucose repression in strains containing MIG1, we manipulated the plasmid copy number of the MAL63 and MAL63c. If the model is correct, then increasing the amount of activated Mal63p by introducing multiple-copy MAL63c plasmids should also relieve glucose repression. We first tested the effect of Mig1p on glucose repression in our standard strain, 332-5B. Table II shows that deletion of MIG1 in the wild type MAL6 strain leads to an approximately 15-fold increase in maltase under glucose-repressed conditions with the final levels equal to those observed in wild type strains after derepressed growth in galactose (i.e. 20-60 units). Therefore, in the absence of Mig1p there is no glucose repression.Table II.Maltase activity is dependent on the gene dosage of the MIG1 and MAL63 allelesGenomic genotypesaThe strains are WT (MAL63 MIG1), 332-5B; Δ MAL63, 332-F; Δ MIG1, 332 ΔMIG1; ΔMIG1 Δ MAL63, 332-F ΔMIG1; site1 332-J1.Plasmid genotypesMaltase activityGlucoseGalactoseMaltosenmol PNPG/min/mg proteinWT<2281200Δ MAL63<1512bCells were grown on the glycerol/ethanol + maltose media.Δ MAL63MAL63, CEN4241784Δ MAL63MAL63c, CEN3511251228Δ MAL63MAL63, 2μ22592051Δ MAL63MAL63c, 2μ41711252260Δ MIG130261880Δ MIG1 Δ MAL63222520bCells were grown on the glycerol/ethanol + maltose media.Δ MIG1 Δ MAL63MAL63, CEN23321268Δ MIG1 Δ MAL63MAL63c, CEN81111183079Δ MIG1 Δ MAL63MAL63, 2μ41322268Δ MIG1 Δ MAL63MAL63c, 2μ171840004880site1<17118bCells were grown on the glycerol/ethanol + maltose media.site1MAL63, 2μ<16228bCells were grown on the glycerol/ethanol + maltose media.a The strains are WT (MAL63 MIG1), 332-5B; Δ MAL63, 332-F; Δ MIG1, 332 ΔMIG1; ΔMIG1 Δ MAL63, 332-F ΔMIG1; site1 332-J1.b Cells were grown on the glycerol/ethanol + maltose media. Open table in a new tab Maltase levels were then measured under repressed, nonrepressed, and induced conditions in strains having different copy number plasmids carrying MAL63, MAL63c, and MIG1 (Table II). Increases in the gene dosage of MAL63 and MAL63c relieve glucose repression as follows. 1) While strains ΔMAL63 (containing plasmid MAL63, CEN) and MAL63 have the same repressed level of maltase (repressed roughly 15-fold), increasing the gene dosage of MAL63 largely eliminates glucose repression in strain ΔMAL63 containing plasmid MAL63, 2μ, with the levels in glucose essentially the same as those in strains deleted for MIG1 2) If Mal63p is in its activated, constitutive form, Mal63cp, it not only relieves glucose repression mediated by the Mig1p, but also activates the expression of MAL62 in glucose media (e.g. compare strain ΔMAL63 containing plasmid MAL63, 2μ with strain ΔMAL63 containing plasmid MAL63c, 2μ). 3) The degree of MAL62 glucose repression depends upon the concentration of both wild type activator and constitutive. Increased MAL63 and MAL63c gene dosage (and, therefore, increases in the levels of Mal63p) relieve glucose repression. Table II shows that a MIG1 ΔMAL63 strain is glucose-repressed and that this repression is totally absent in a ΔMIG1 ΔMAL63 strain. One constitutive mAL43c strain, strain 1403-7A, is relatively insensitive to glucose repression and lacks the equivalent of site C in the MAL43c promoter. Introduction of a high copy MIG1 plasmid into this strain severely inhibits the synthesis of maltase during glucose growth; PNPGase is 378 nmol of PNPG/min/mg of protein for cells having no plasmid, and 34 nmol of PNPG/min/mg of protein for cells with the high copy pMIG1 plasmid. Mig1p must therefore confer glucose repression by another pathway independent of its effect on Mal63p synthesis. Since high levels of Mal63p can totally overcome glucose repression in MIG1 strains, this pathway must also be antagonized by increases in Mal63p. Maltase levels in glucose-grown cells are therefore likely to be set by the relative amounts of Mig1p and Mal63p. Since the Mig1p binding site, site A, is adjacent to the MAL63p binding site, site 1 (Fig. 1; Refs. 8Wang J. Needleman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 51-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sirenko O.I. Ni B. Needleman R.B. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Lundin M.J. Nehlin O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, and 20Hu Z. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), one possible explanation for the dependence of MAL62 expression of glucose-grown cells on the relative levels of Mal63p and Mig1p is that Mal63p and Mig1p compete for binding in the MAL62 promoter. High levels of Mig1p would repress by inhibiting Mal63p access to the UASMAL; raising the levels of Mal63p would overcome the inhibition. If binding competition between Mig1p and Mal63p is indeed partially responsible for the relief of glucose repression in a MIG1 (containing plasmid MAL63, 2μ) strain, increased expression of Mal63p in a ΔMIG1 strain should not affect maltase levels in glucose medium; i.e. we expect that maltase levels in a ΔMIG1 and a ΔMIG1 (containing plasmid MAL63, 2μ) strain would be equal. Within experimental error, this is precisely what we observe (Table II). The competition binding model requires that maltase levels measured in the gene dosage experiments (Table II) reflect changes in the transcription of MAL62 We therefore used RNA protection assays to measure MAL62 mRNA isolated from some of these strains. The results of some of these assays are presented in Fig. 3. They confirm that the enzyme activity shown in Table II accurately reflects altered transcription. We next sought direct evidence for the modulation of transcription in glucose by competition for promoter binding between Mal63p and Mig1p. In particular, it was necessary to identify the Mig1p and Mal63p binding sites in the MAL promoter in vivo We used in vivo genomic footprinting to determine if Mig1p binds to the consensus site previously identified in vitro, site A (Fig. 1; Refs. 19Lundin M.J. Nehlin O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and 20Hu Z. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that Mig1p does bind to site A in glucose-grown cells. Genomic footprinting for glucose grown MAL63 MIG1 (332-5B) and mal63 MIG1 (strain 332-F) cells shows a protected region in the MAL62 promoter identical to that seen in vitro for Mig1p footprinting at the SUC2, GAL4, and GAL1-10 promoters. In addition, both in vivo and in vitro footprints show a hypersensitive site at the 3-end of the GC box (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6; Refs. 2Nehlin J.O. Carlberg M. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar and 3Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To avoid the possible interference from the binding of Mal63p to site 1, we used the strain 332-F, which, unlike the A9 deletion strain, has an early mal63 frameshift mutation (Fig. 4A, lane 6); this mutation eliminates the region of Mal63p required for DNA binding (see “Experimental Procedures”; Table I). Inspection of the same region in the otherwise isogenic control strain, ΔMIG1 (MAL63 ΔMIG1; Fig. 4A, lane 4), clearly shows that the footprint is due to Mig1p (Fig. 4A, lane 5). The Mig1p footprint is most pronounced in strains lacking MAL63, but it is still apparent when MAL63 is present. In a separate experiment, we performed genomic footprinti"
