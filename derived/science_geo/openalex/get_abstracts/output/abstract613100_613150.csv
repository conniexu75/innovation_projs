https://openalex.org/W2794689995,"Escaping from imminent danger is an instinctive behaviour that is fundamental for survival, and requires the classification of sensory stimuli as harmless or threatening. The absence of threat enables animals to forage for essential resources, but as the level of threat and potential for harm increases, they have to decide whether or not to seek safety 1 . Despite previous work on instinctive defensive behaviours in rodents2-11, little is known about how the brain computes the threat level for initiating escape. Here we show that the probability and vigour of escape in mice scale with the saliency of innate threats, and are well described by a model that computes the distance between the threat level and an escape threshold. Calcium imaging and optogenetics in the midbrain of freely behaving mice show that the activity of excitatory neurons in the deep layers of the medial superior colliculus (mSC) represents the saliency of the threat stimulus and is predictive of escape, whereas glutamatergic neurons of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) encode exclusively the choice to escape and control escape vigour. We demonstrate a feed-forward monosynaptic excitatory connection from mSC to dPAG neurons, which is weak and unreliable-yet required for escape behaviour-and provides a synaptic threshold for dPAG activation and the initiation of escape. This threshold can be overcome by high mSC network activity because of short-term synaptic facilitation and recurrent excitation within the mSC, which amplifies and sustains synaptic drive to the dPAG. Therefore, dPAG glutamatergic neurons compute escape decisions and escape vigour using a synaptic mechanism to threshold threat information received from the mSC, and provide a biophysical model of how the brain performs a critical behavioural computation."
https://openalex.org/W2795832693,"Over the past three decades, considerable progress has been made in the development of methods to construct sp2 carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds using palladium, copper or nickel catalysis1,2. However, the incorporation of alkyl substrates to form sp3 C-N bonds remains one of the major challenges in the field of cross-coupling chemistry. Here we demonstrate that the synergistic combination of copper catalysis and photoredox catalysis can provide a general platform from which to address this challenge. This cross-coupling system uses naturally abundant alkyl carboxylic acids and commercially available nitrogen nucleophiles as coupling partners. It is applicable to a wide variety of primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids (through iodonium activation), as well as a vast array of nitrogen nucleophiles: nitrogen heterocycles, amides, sulfonamides and anilines can undergo C-N coupling to provide N-alkyl products in good to excellent efficiency, at room temperature and on short timescales (five minutes to one hour). We demonstrate that this C-N coupling protocol proceeds with high regioselectivity using substrates that contain several amine groups, and can also be applied to complex drug molecules, enabling the rapid construction of molecular complexity and the late-stage functionalization of bioactive pharmaceuticals."

https://openalex.org/W2809439755,"DNA double-strand breaks repaired by non-homologous end joining display limited DNA end-processing and chromosomal mobility. By contrast, double-strand breaks undergoing homology-directed repair exhibit extensive processing and enhanced motion. The molecular basis of this movement is unknown. Here, using Xenopus laevis cell-free extracts and mammalian cells, we establish that nuclear actin, WASP, and the actin-nucleating ARP2/3 complex are recruited to damaged chromatin undergoing homology-directed repair. We demonstrate that nuclear actin polymerization is required for the migration of a subset of double-strand breaks into discrete sub-nuclear clusters. Actin-driven movements specifically affect double-strand breaks repaired by homology-directed repair in G2 cell cycle phase; inhibition of actin nucleation impairs DNA end-processing and homology-directed repair. By contrast, ARP2/3 is not enriched at double-strand breaks repaired by non-homologous end joining and does not regulate non-homologous end joining. Our findings establish that nuclear actin-based mobility shapes chromatin organization by generating repair domains that are essential for homology-directed repair in eukaryotic cells. Polymerization of actin in the cell nucleus, promoted by the ARP2/3 complex, drives the clustering of double-strand DNA breaks into nuclear compartments where they can undergo homology-directed repair."
https://openalex.org/W2808968889,"Heterochromatin mainly comprises repeated DNA sequences that are prone to ectopic recombination. In Drosophila cells, 'safe' repair of heterochromatic double-strand breaks by homologous recombination relies on the relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery before strand invasion. The mechanisms responsible for this movement were unknown. Here we show that relocalization occurs by directed motion along nuclear actin filaments assembled at repair sites by the Arp2/3 complex. Relocalization requires nuclear myosins associated with the heterochromatin repair complex Smc5/6 and the myosin activator Unc45, which is recruited to repair sites by Smc5/6. ARP2/3, actin nucleation and myosins also relocalize heterochromatic double-strand breaks in mouse cells. Defects in this pathway result in impaired heterochromatin repair and chromosome rearrangements. These findings identify de novo nuclear actin filaments and myosins as effectors of chromatin dynamics for heterochromatin repair and stability in multicellular eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2809201980,"B cell receptor (BCR) signalling has emerged as a therapeutic target in B cell lymphomas, but inhibiting this pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has benefited only a subset of patients1. Gene expression profiling identified two major subtypes of DLBCL, known as germinal centre B cell-like and activated B cell-like (ABC)2,3, that show poor outcomes after immunochemotherapy in ABC. Autoantigens drive BCR-dependent activation of NF-κB in ABC DLBCL through a kinase signalling cascade of SYK, BTK and PKCβ to promote the assembly of the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 adaptor complex, which recruits and activates IκB kinase4-6. Genome sequencing revealed gain-of-function mutations that target the CD79A and CD79B BCR subunits and the Toll-like receptor signalling adaptor MYD885,7, with MYD88(L265P) being the most prevalent isoform. In a clinical trial, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib produced responses in 37% of cases of ABC1. The most striking response rate (80%) was observed in tumours with both CD79B and MYD88(L265P) mutations, but how these mutations cooperate to promote dependence on BCR signalling remains unclear. Here we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and functional proteomics to determine the molecular basis of exceptional clinical responses to ibrutinib. We discovered a new mode of oncogenic BCR signalling in ibrutinib-responsive cell lines and biopsies, coordinated by a multiprotein supercomplex formed by MYD88, TLR9 and the BCR (hereafter termed the My-T-BCR supercomplex). The My-T-BCR supercomplex co-localizes with mTOR on endolysosomes, where it drives pro-survival NF-κB and mTOR signalling. Inhibitors of BCR and mTOR signalling cooperatively decreased the formation and function of the My-T-BCR supercomplex, providing mechanistic insight into their synergistic toxicity for My-T-BCR+ DLBCL cells. My-T-BCR supercomplexes characterized ibrutinib-responsive malignancies and distinguished ibrutinib responders from non-responders. Our data provide a framework for the rational design of oncogenic signalling inhibitors in molecularly defined subsets of DLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W2809660639,"Viral infections continue to represent major challenges to public health, and an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the processes that contribute to viral life cycles is necessary for the development of new therapeutic strategies 1 . Viperin, a member of the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes, is an interferon-inducible protein implicated in the inhibition of replication of a broad range of RNA and DNA viruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus, rabies virus 2 and HIV3,4. Viperin has been suggested to elicit these broad antiviral activities through interactions with a large number of functionally unrelated host and viral proteins3,4. Here we demonstrate that viperin catalyses the conversion of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP (ddhCTP), a previously undescribed biologically relevant molecule, via a SAM-dependent radical mechanism. We show that mammalian cells expressing viperin and macrophages stimulated with IFNα produce substantial quantities of ddhCTP. We also establish that ddhCTP acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from multiple members of the Flavivirus genus, and show that ddhCTP directly inhibits replication of Zika virus in vivo. These findings suggest a partially unifying mechanism for the broad antiviral effects of viperin that is based on the intrinsic enzymatic properties of the protein and involves the generation of a naturally occurring replication-chain terminator encoded by mammalian genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2808827828,"Sample size determination for open-ended questions or qualitative interviews relies primarily on custom and finding the point where little new information is obtained (thematic saturation). Here, we propose and test a refined definition of saturation as obtaining the most salient items in a set of qualitative interviews (where items can be material things or concepts, depending on the topic of study) rather than attempting to obtain all the items. Salient items have higher prevalence and are more culturally important. To do this, we explore saturation, salience, sample size, and domain size in 28 sets of interviews in which respondents were asked to list all the things they could think of in one of 18 topical domains. The domains—like kinds of fruits (highly bounded) and things that mothers do (unbounded)—varied greatly in size. The datasets comprise 20–99 interviews each (1,147 total interviews). When saturation was defined as the point where less than one new item per person would be expected, the median sample size for reaching saturation was 75 (range = 15–194). Thematic saturation was, as expected, related to domain size. It was also related to the amount of information contributed by each respondent but, unexpectedly, was reached more quickly when respondents contributed less information. In contrast, a greater amount of information per person increased the retrieval of salient items. Even small samples (n = 10) produced 95% of the most salient ideas with exhaustive listing, but only 53% of those items were captured with limited responses per person (three). For most domains, item salience appeared to be a more useful concept for thinking about sample size adequacy than finding the point of thematic saturation. Thus, we advance the concept of saturation in salience and emphasize probing to increase the amount of information collected per respondent to increase sample efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2807789998,"It has been known for decades that the observed number of baryons in the local universe falls about 30-40% short of the total number of baryons predicted by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, as inferred from density fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background and seen during the first 2-3 billion years of the universe in the so called Lyman-alpha Forest. A theoretical solution to this paradox locates the missing baryons in the hot and tenuous filamentary gas between galaxies, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium. However, it is difficult to detect them there because the largest by far constituent of this gas - hydrogen - is mostly ionized and therefore almost invisible in far-ultraviolet spectra with typical signal-to-noise ratios. Indeed, despite the large observational efforts, only a few marginal claims of detection have been made so far. Here we report observations of two absorbers of highly ionized oxygen (OVII) in the high signal-to-noise-ratio X-ray spectrum of a quasar at redshift >0.4. These absorbers show no variability over a 2-year timescale and have no associated cold absorption, making the assumption that they originate from the quasar's intrinsic outflow or the host galaxy's interstellar medium implausible. The OVII systems lie in regions characterized by large (x4 compared to average) galaxy over-densities and their number (down to the sensitivity threshold of our data), agrees well with numerical simulation predictions for the long-sought warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). We conclude that the missing baryons have been found."

https://openalex.org/W2809662941,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest family of receptors encoded by the human genome (around 800 genes). They transduce signals by coupling to a small number of heterotrimeric G proteins (16 genes encoding different α-subunits). Each human cell contains several GPCRs and G proteins. The structural determinants of coupling of Gs to four different GPCRs have been elucidated1-4, but the molecular details of how the other G-protein classes couple to GPCRs are unknown. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the serotonin 5-HT1B receptor (5-HT1BR) bound to the agonist donitriptan and coupled to an engineered Go heterotrimer. In this complex, 5-HT1BR is in an active state; the intracellular domain of the receptor is in a similar conformation to that observed for the β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR) 3 or the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) 1 in complex with Gs. In contrast to the complexes with Gs, the gap between the receptor and the Gβ-subunit in the Go-5-HT1BR complex precludes molecular contacts, and the interface between the Gα-subunit of Go and the receptor is considerably smaller. These differences are likely to be caused by the differences in the interactions with the C terminus of the Go α-subunit. The molecular variations between the interfaces of Go and Gs in complex with GPCRs may contribute substantially to both the specificity of coupling and the kinetics of signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2808653474,"Molecular-scale manipulation of electronic and ionic charge accumulation in materials is the backbone of electrochemical energy storage1-4. Layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals are a diverse family of materials into which mobile ions can electrochemically intercalate into the interlamellar gaps of the host atomic lattice5,6. The structural diversity of such materials enables the interfacial properties of composites to be optimized to improve ion intercalation for energy storage and electronic devices7-12. However, the ability of heterolayers to modify intercalation reactions, and their role at the atomic level, are yet to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate the electrointercalation of lithium at the level of individual atomic interfaces of dissimilar vdW layers. Electrochemical devices based on vdW heterostructures 13 of stacked hexagonal boron nitride, graphene and molybdenum dichalcogenide (MoX2; X = S, Se) layers are constructed. We use transmission electron microscopy, in situ magnetoresistance and optical spectroscopy techniques, as well as low-temperature quantum magneto-oscillation measurements and ab initio calculations, to resolve the intermediate stages of lithium intercalation at heterointerfaces. The formation of vdW heterointerfaces between graphene and MoX2 results in a more than tenfold greater accumulation of charge in MoX2 when compared to MoX2/MoX2 homointerfaces, while enforcing a more negative intercalation potential than that of bulk MoX2 by at least 0.5 V. Beyond energy storage, our combined experimental and computational methodology for manipulating and characterizing the electrochemical behaviour of layered systems opens new pathways to control the charge density in two-dimensional electronic and optoelectronic devices."

https://openalex.org/W2804635920,"Gas permeation through nanoscale pores is ubiquitous in nature and has an important role in many technologies1,2. Because the pore size is typically smaller than the mean free path of gas molecules, the flow of the gas molecules is conventionally described by Knudsen theory, which assumes diffuse reflection (random-angle scattering) at confining walls3–7. This assumption holds surprisingly well in experiments, with only a few cases of partially specular (mirror-like) reflection known5,8–11. Here we report gas transport through ångström-scale channels with atomically flat walls12,13 and show that surface scattering can be either diffuse or specular, depending on the fine details of the atomic landscape of the surface, and that quantum effects contribute to the specularity at room temperature. The channels, made from graphene or boron nitride, allow helium gas flow that is orders of magnitude faster than expected from theory. This is explained by specular surface scattering, which leads to ballistic transport and frictionless gas flow. Similar channels, but with molybdenum disulfide walls, exhibit much slower permeation that remains well described by Knudsen diffusion. We attribute the difference to the larger atomic corrugations at molybdenum disulfide surfaces, which are similar in height to the size of the atoms being transported and their de Broglie wavelength. The importance of this matter-wave contribution is corroborated by the observation of a reversed isotope effect, whereby the mass flow of hydrogen is notably higher than that of deuterium, in contrast to the relation expected for classical flows. Our results provide insights into the atomistic details of molecular permeation, which previously could be accessed only in simulations10,14, and demonstrate the possibility of studying gas transport under controlled confinement comparable in size to the quantum-mechanical size of atoms. Specular scattering of atoms of helium gas flowing through atomically flat, two-dimensional channels results in frictionless gas flow, which is much faster than expected assuming purely diffusive scattering."

https://openalex.org/W2809397712,"Malignancy is accompanied by changes in the metabolism of both cells and the organism1,2. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with wasting of peripheral tissues, a metabolic syndrome that lowers quality of life and has been proposed to decrease survival of patients with cancer3,4. Tissue wasting is a multifactorial disease and targeting specific circulating factors to reverse this syndrome has been mostly ineffective in the clinic5,6. Here we show that loss of both adipose and muscle tissue occurs early in the development of pancreatic cancer. Using mouse models of PDAC, we show that tumour growth in the pancreas but not in other sites leads to adipose tissue wasting, suggesting that tumour growth within the pancreatic environment contributes to this wasting phenotype. We find that decreased exocrine pancreatic function is a driver of adipose tissue loss and that replacement of pancreatic enzymes attenuates PDAC-associated wasting of peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, reversal of adipose tissue loss impairs survival in mice with PDAC. When analysing patients with PDAC, we find that depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues at the time of diagnosis is common, but is not associated with worse survival. Taken together, these results provide an explanation for wasting of adipose tissue in early PDAC and suggest that early loss of peripheral tissue associated with pancreatic cancer may not impair survival."
https://openalex.org/W2809116049,"Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are associated with epigenetic states that form the basis for cell-type-specific gene expression1,2. Once established, histone PTMs can be maintained by positive feedback involving enzymes that recognize a pre-existing histone modification and catalyse the same modification on newly deposited histones. Recent studies suggest that in wild-type cells, histone PTM-based positive feedback is too weak to mediate epigenetic inheritance in the absence of other inputs3-7. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and heterochromatin formation define a potential epigenetic inheritance mechanism in which positive feedback involving short interfering RNA (siRNA) amplification can be directly coupled to histone PTM positive feedback8-14. However, it is not known whether the coupling of these two feedback loops can maintain epigenetic silencing independently of DNA sequence and in the absence of enabling mutations that disrupt genome-wide chromatin structure or transcription15-17. Here, using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we show that siRNA-induced H3K9me and silencing of a euchromatic gene can be epigenetically inherited in cis during multiple mitotic and meiotic cell divisions in wild-type cells. This inheritance involves the spreading of secondary siRNAs and H3K9me3 to the targeted gene and surrounding areas, and requires both RNAi and H3K9me, suggesting that the siRNA and H3K9me positive-feedback loops act synergistically to maintain silencing. By contrast, when maintained solely by histone PTM positive feedback, silencing is erased by H3K9 demethylation promoted by Epe1, or by interallelic interactions that occur after mating to cells containing an expressed allele even in the absence of Epe1. These findings demonstrate that the RNAi machinery can mediate transgenerational epigenetic inheritance independently of DNA sequence or enabling mutations, and reveal a role for the coupling of the siRNA and H3K9me positive-feedback loops in the protection of epigenetic alleles from erasure."

https://openalex.org/W2809642036,"Nanometre-sized objects with highly symmetrical, cage-like polyhedral shapes, often with icosahedral symmetry, have recently been assembled from DNA1–3, RNA4 or proteins5,6 for applications in biology and medicine. These achievements relied on advances in the development of programmable self-assembling biological materials7–10, and on rapidly developing techniques for generating three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions from cryo-electron microscopy images of single particles, which provide high-resolution structural characterization of biological complexes11–13. Such single-particle 3D reconstruction approaches have not yet been successfully applied to the identification of synthetic inorganic nanomaterials with highly symmetrical cage-like shapes. Here, however, using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle 3D reconstruction, we suggest the existence of isolated ultrasmall (less than 10 nm) silica cages (‘silicages’) with dodecahedral structure. We propose that such highly symmetrical, self-assembled cages form through the arrangement of primary silica clusters in aqueous solutions on the surface of oppositely charged surfactant micelles. This discovery paves the way for nanoscale cages made from silica and other inorganic materials to be used as building blocks for a wide range of advanced functional-materials applications. Machine-learning algorithms are used to generate single-particle three-dimensional reconstructions, revealing that highly symmetrical dodecahedral silica cages, around 10 nm in size, self-assemble in the presence of surfactant micelles."
https://openalex.org/W2809459633,"Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is a nuclear citrullinating enzyme that is critically involved in the release of decondensed chromatin from neutrophils as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs, together with fibrin, are implicated in host defense against pathogens; however, the formation of NETs (NETosis) has injurious effects that may outweigh their protective role. For example, PAD4 activity produces citrullinated neoantigens that promote autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, to which PAD4 is genetically linked and where NETosis is prominent. NETs are also generated in basic sterile inflammatory responses that are induced by many inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, hypoxia, and activated platelets. Mice that lack PAD4—deficient in NETosis—serve as an excellent tool with which to study the importance of NETs in disease models. In recent years, animal and human studies have demonstrated that NETs contribute to the etiology and propagation of many common noninfectious diseases, the focus of our review. We will discuss the role of NETs in thrombotic and cardiovascular disease, the induction of NETs by cancers and its implications for cancer progression and cancer-associated thrombosis, and elevated NETosis in diabetes and its negative impact on wound healing, and will propose a link between PAD4/NETs and age-related organ fibrosis.

https://openalex.org/W2808993718,"Nonsense mutations are present in 10% of patients with CF, produce a premature termination codon in CFTR mRNA causing early termination of translation, and lead to lack of CFTR function. There are no currently available animal models which contain a nonsense mutation in the endogenous Cftr locus that can be utilized to test nonsense mutation therapies. In this study, we create a CF mouse model carrying the G542X nonsense mutation in Cftr using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The G542X mouse model has reduced Cftr mRNA levels, demonstrates absence of CFTR function, and displays characteristic manifestations of CF mice such as reduced growth and intestinal obstruction. Importantly, CFTR restoration is observed in G542X intestinal organoids treated with G418, an aminoglycoside with translational readthrough capabilities. The G542X mouse model provides an invaluable resource for the identification of potential therapies of CF nonsense mutations as well as the assessment of in vivo effectiveness of these potential therapies targeting nonsense mutations."

Hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)-2 and -13, and type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which enhance neuronal survival and functions, were quantified in CSPG4E extracts. For CSPG4Es of 24 healthy control subjects, mean levels of hepatocyte growth factor, FGF-13, and IGF-1, but not FGF-2, were significantly higher by up to 7-fold than in their neuronal-derived exosomes, and mean levels of all 4 growth factors were significantly higher by up to 8-fold than in their astrocyte-derived exosomes. Mean CSPG4E levels of all growth factors were significantly lower in patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) (n = 24) than in age- and sex-matched cognitively normal control subjects (n = 24). Mean CSPG4E levels of all growth factors were also significantly lower in 15 patients at the stage of moderate dementia from AD (AD2) and at their preclinical stage 3 to 8 yr earlier (AD1), with no differences between values at stages AD1 and AD2. Current findings suggest that CSPG4 cells export in exosomes higher levels of neurotrophic factors than neurons or astrocytes and that CSPG4E neurotrophic factors are diminished early in AD, with no significant progression of decreases later in the course.—Goetzl, E.

https://openalex.org/W2809449137,"Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are crucial for cell volume regulation and have various roles in physiology and pathology. VRACs were recently discovered to be formed by heteromers of leucine-rich repeat–containing 8 (LRRC8) proteins. However, the structural determinants of VRAC permeation and gating remain largely unknown. We show here that the short stretch preceding the first LRRC8 transmembrane domain determines VRAC conductance, ion permeability, and inactivation gating. Substituted-cysteine accessibility studies revealed that several of the first 15 LRRC8 residues are functionally important and exposed to a hydrophilic environment. Substituting glutamate 6 with cysteine decreased the amplitudes of swelling-activated ICl,vol currents, strongly increased iodide-over-chloride permeability, and markedly shifted the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Importantly, these effects were reversed by 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate, which restores the negative charge at this amino acid position. Cd2+-mediated blocking of ICl,vol in cysteine variants suggested that the LRRC8 N termini come close together in the multimeric channel complex and might form part of the pore. We propose a model in which the N termini of the LRRC8 subunits line the cytoplasmic portion of the VRAC pore, possibly by folding back into the ion permeation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2809675811,"Mitochondrial accumulation of intracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides is present in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in related mouse models of AD. This accumulation is extremely toxic because Aβ disrupts the normal functions of many mitochondrial proteins, resulting in significant mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, understanding the mitochondrial accumulation of Aβ is useful for future pharmaceutical design of drugs to address mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of this accumulation process remains elusive. Here, using yeast mitochondria, we present direct experimental evidence suggesting that Aβ is specifically recognized by translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane subunit 22 (Tom22 in yeast; TOMM22 in human), a noncanonical receptor within the mitochondrial protein import machinery, and that this recognition is critical for Aβ accumulation in mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that residues 25-42 in the Aβ peptide mediate the specific interaction with TOMM22. On the basis of our findings, we propose that cytosolic Aβ is recognized by TOMM22; transferred to another translocase subunit, TOMM40; and transported through the TOMM channel into the mitochondria. Our results not only confirm that yeast mitochondria can be used as a model to study mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Aβ peptides in AD but also pave the way for future studies of the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial Aβ accumulation."

The main target autoantigen in GPA is the neutrophil serine protease (NSP) proteinase 3 (PR3) (EC 3.4.21.76) (3.Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Lüdemann J. Utecht B. Gross W.L.

GPA patients develop anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies to PR3 (PR3-ANCA) that bind to membrane-bound PR3 (PR3m) on the neutrophil surface (5.Kettritz R.

The membrane exposure of PR3 is mediated by a hydrophobic patch at the protease surface, which is not conserved in other related NSPs, such as human neutrophil elastase (HNE), cathepsin G (CG) and neutrophil serine protease 4 NSP-4 (7.Korkmaz B.

PR3m on purified neutrophils shows a bimodal pattern that is typical for 97% of all individuals. This bimodal PR3m is caused by subset-restricted epigenetically regulated expression of the neutrophil-specific PR3 receptor CD177 (10.Eulenberg-Gustavus C. Bähring S. Maass P.G. Luft F.C.

As a consequence, two distinct neutrophil subsets exist, namely CD177(neg)/PR3m(low) and CD177(pos)/PR3m(high) cells. Binding of PR3-ANCA to PR3m on cytokine-primed neutrophils induces cell activation, resulting in the liberation of microvesicles bearing the PR3 autoantigen at their surface (11.Hong Y.

Cathepsin C (CatC) (EC 3.4.14.1), also known as dipeptidyl peptidase I, is a lysosomal amino peptidase belonging to the papain superfamily of cysteine peptidases (20.Turk D. Janjić V. Stern I.

CatC catalyzes the cleavage of two residues from the N termini of peptides and proteins. CatC, which is ubiquitously expressed in mammals, is considered to be a major intracellular processing enzyme. High concentrations of CatC are detected in immune defense cells, including neutrophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. CatC is the physiological activator of several immune cell-associated serine proteases, such as NSPs (22.Adkison A.M. Raptis S.Z. Kelley D.G. Pham C.T.

The pro-forms mature in this very early developmental stage, induced by CatC, through the cleavage of the N-terminal dipropeptide. The cleavage of the dipropeptide by CatC results in a reorientation and remodeling of three surface loops within the activation domain of the protein and renders the S1 pocket of the active site accessible to substrates (25.Jenne D.E. Kuhl A. Production and applications of recombinant proteinase 3, Wegener's autoantigen: problems and perspectives.Clin. Nephrol. 2006; 66 (16995336): 153-15910.5414/CNP66153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After processing, the active proteases are stored in cytoplasmic granules. CatC is synthesized as a 60-kDa single chain pro-form containing an exclusion domain, a propeptide, a heavy chain, and a light chain (26.Dahl S.W. Halkier T. Lauritzen C. Dolenc I. Pedersen J.

The initial cleavages liberate the propeptide from the catalytic region.

PLS involves an aggressive prepubertal periodontitis, leading to complete tooth loss in adolescence and palmoplantar keratoderma.

Thus, it is conceivable that mimicking the genetic situation in PLS neutrophils by pharmacological CatC inhibition in bone marrow precursor cells would provide an attractive therapeutic strategy in GPA to eliminate major PR3-related disease mechanisms, including the PR3-ANCA autoantigen itself. However, the effect of CatC inactivation on PR3 that is presented on the neutrophil surface where it becomes accessible to anti-PR3 antibodies is not known. In this work, we investigated the consequences of CatC inactivation on membrane exposure of PR3. First, we quantified the residual proteolytic activity of CatC and PR3 in white blood cell (WBC) lysates or isolated neutrophils from PLS patients. Second, we studied the membrane exposure of PR3 on PLS neutrophils. Finally, we used a potent synthetic cell-permeable nitrile inhibitor to evaluate the effect of pharmacological CatC inhibition on membrane PR3 exposure in normal neutrophils generated from human CD34+ progenitor cells. Blood samples were collected from 15 PLS patients from European, Asian, and African countries. PLS diagnosis was firmly established by genetic testing. These patients carried either premature stop codon, missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations in their CTSC (Table 1). Blood from nine additional patients with clinically suspected PLS was obtained. These patients showed typical symptoms of early-onset periodontitis and hyperkeratosis (Fig. 1A). WBC lysates from these patients and from healthy controls differed by their protein profile, as observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B).Table 1Patient informationPatient numberAgeGenderEthnicity (country of origin)CatC mutationCatC activityPR3 activity (% of healthy controls)years%118MIndian (India)c.912C>A (p.Y304X)aRagunatha et al.

https://openalex.org/W2809510569,"Genetic heterogeneity of common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes is frequently considered. The present study conducted a focused analysis of potential candidate or susceptibility genes for common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes using multi-gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing. This study included patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, and epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. We identified pathogenic variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines and identified susceptibility variants using case-control association analyses and family analyses for familial cases. A total of 57 patients were enrolled, including 51 sporadic cases and 6 familial cases. Twenty-two pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of 16 different genes were identified. CACNA1H was the most frequently observed single gene. Variants of voltage-gated Ca2+ channel genes, including CACNA1A, CACNA1G, and CACNA1H were observed in 32% of variants (n = 7/22). Analyses to identify susceptibility variants using case-control association analysis indicated that KCNMA1 c.400G>C was associated with common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes. Only 1 family (family A) exhibited a candidate pathogenic variant p.(Arg788His) on CACNA1H, as determined via family analyses. This study identified candidate genetic variants in about a quarter of patients (n = 16/57) and an average of 2.8 variants was identified in each patient. The results reinforced the polygenic disorder with very high locus and allelic heterogeneity of common GGE syndromes. Further, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are suggested as important contributors to common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes. This study extends our comprehensive understanding of common genetic generalized epilepsy syndromes."

Oceanic phytoplankton contain some of the most efficient Rubisco enzymes, and diatoms in particular are responsible for a significant proportion of total marine primary production as well as being a major source of CO2 sequestration in polar cold waters. Until now, the biochemical properties and three-dimensional structures of Rubisco from diatoms were unknown. Here, diatoms from arctic waters were collected, cultivated, and analyzed for their CO2-fixing capability. We characterized the kinetic properties of five and determined the crystal structures of four Rubiscos selected for their high CO2-fixing efficiency. The DNA sequences of the rbcL and rbcS genes of the selected diatoms were similar, reflecting their close phylogenetic relationship. The Vmax and Km for the oxygenase and carboxylase activities at 25 °C and the specificity factors (Sc/o) at 15, 25, and 35 °C were determined. The Sc/o values were high, approaching those of mono- and dicot plants, thus exhibiting good selectivity for CO2 relative to O2. Structurally, diatom Rubiscos belong to form I C/D, containing small subunits characterized by a short βA–βB loop and a C-terminal extension that forms a β-hairpin structure (βE–βF loop). Of note, the diatom Rubiscos featured a number of posttranslational modifications of the large subunit, including 4-hydroxyproline, β-hydroxyleucine, hydroxylated and nitrosylated cysteine, mono- and dihydroxylated lysine, and trimethylated lysine.

We have characterized HemJ from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

The expression of FLAG-tagged Synechocystis 6803 HemJ protein (HemJ.f) and affinity isolation of HemJ.f under native conditions revealed that it binds heme b. The most stable HemJ.f form was a dimer, and higher oligomeric forms were also observed. Using both oxygen and artificial electron acceptors, we detected no enzymatic activity with the purified HemJ.f, consistent with the hypothesis that the enzymatic mechanism for HemJ is distinct from those of other PPO isoforms. The heme absorption spectra and distant HemJ homology to several membrane oxidases indicated that the heme in HemJ is redox-active and involved in electron transfer. HemJ was conditionally complemented by another PPO, HemG from Escherichia coli. If grown photoautotrophically, the complemented strain accumulated tripropionic tetrapyrrole harderoporphyrin, suggesting a defect in enzymatic conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX, catalyzed by coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPO).

https://openalex.org/W2808829074,"The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians is caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and has resulted in dramatic declines and extinctions of amphibian populations worldwide. A hypervirulent, globally-dispersed pandemic lineage (Bd-GPL) is thought to be largely responsible for population declines and extinctions, although numerous endemic lineages have also been found. Recent reports of amphibian declines have been linked to the emergence of Bd in Cameroon, a major hotspot of African amphibian diversity. However, it is not known whether Bd-GPL or other lineages have been found in this region. This study therefore aims to examine Bd lineage diversity in the region and predict the distribution of this pathogen under current and future climate conditions using data from this study and from historical records. Almost 15% (52/360) of individuals tested positive for Bd using a standard quantitative PCR diagnostic. Infected amphibians were found at all eight sites sampled in this study. Species distribution models generated in BIOMOD2 indicate that areas with highest predicted environmental suitability occur in the Cameroon highlands and several protected areas throughout the country. These areas of high environmental suitability for Bd are projected to shift or decrease in size under future climate change. However, montane regions with high amphibian diversity are predicted to remain highly suitable. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences obtained from a set of positive Bd samples indicate that most fall within the Bd-GPL lineage while the remainder group with isolates from either Brazil or South Korea. Although more in depth phylogenetic analyses are needed, identification of Bd-GPL lineages in areas of high amphibian diversity emphasizes the need to continue to monitor for Bd and develop appropriate conservation strategies to prevent its further spread."
https://openalex.org/W2808981308,"Osteoclasts are multinuclear bone-resorbing cells that differentiate from hematopoietic precursor cells. Prostate cancer cells frequently spread to bone and secrete soluble signaling factors to accelerate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. However, processes and mechanisms that govern the expression of osteoclastogenic soluble factors secreted by prostate cancer cells are largely unknown. MacroH2A (mH2A) is a histone variant that replaces canonical H2A at designated genomic loci and establishes functionally distinct chromatin regions. Here, we report that mH2A1.2, one of the mH2A isoforms, attenuates prostate cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis by maintaining the inactive state of genes encoding soluble factors in prostate cancer cells. Our functional analyses of soluble factors identify lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) as a major stimulator of osteoclastogenesis and an essential mH2A1.2 target for its anti-osteoclastogenic activity. Mechanistically, mH2A1.2 directly interacts with HP1α and H1.2 and requires them to inactivate LTβ gene in prostate cancer cells. Consistently, HP1α and H1.2 have an intrinsic ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in a mH2A1.2-dependent manner. Together, our data uncover a new and specific role for mH2A1.2 in modulating osteoclastogenic potential of prostate cancer cells and demonstrate how this signaling pathway can be exploited to treat osteolytic bone metastases at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W2808996136,"Dickkopf (Dkk) family proteins are important regulators of Wnt signaling pathways, which play key roles in many essential biological processes. Here, we report the first detailed structural and dynamics study of a full-length mature Dkk protein (Dkk4, residues 19-224), including determination of the first atomic-resolution structure for the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD1) conserved among Dkk proteins. We discovered that CRD1 has significant structural homology to the Dkk C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD2), pointing to multiple gene duplication events during Dkk family evolution. We also show that Dkk4 consists of two independent folded domains (CRD1 and CRD2) joined by a highly flexible, nonstructured linker. Similarly, the N-terminal region preceding CRD1 and containing a highly conserved NXI(R/K) sequence motif was shown to be dynamic and highly flexible. We demonstrate that Dkk4 CRD2 mediates high-affinity binding to both the E1E2 region of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6 E1E2) and the Kremen1 (Krm1) extracellular domain. In contrast, the N-terminal region alone bound with only moderate affinity to LRP6 E1E2, consistent with binding via the conserved NXI(R/K) motif, but did not interact with Krm proteins. We also confirmed that Dkk and Krm family proteins function synergistically to inhibit Wnt signaling. Insights provided by our integrated structural, dynamics, interaction, and functional studies have allowed us to refine the model of synergistic regulation of Wnt signaling by Dkk proteins. Our results indicate the potential for the formation of a diverse range of ternary complexes comprising Dkk, Krm, and LRP5/6 proteins, allowing fine-tuning of Wnt-dependent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2808845436,"This study evaluates the use of a mental health mobile clinic to overcome two major challenges to the provision of mental healthcare in resource-limited settings: the shortage of trained specialists; and the need to improve access to safe, effective, and culturally sound care in community settings. Employing task-shifting and supervision, mental healthcare was largely delivered by trained, non-specialist health workers instead of specialists. A retrospective chart review of 318 unduplicated patients assessed and treated during the mobile clinic's first two years (January 2012 to November 2013) was conducted to explore outcomes. These data were supplemented by a quality improvement questionnaire, illustrative case reports, and a qualitative interview with the mobile clinic's lead community health worker. The team evaluated an average of 42 patients per clinic session. The most common mental, neurological, or substance abuse (MNS) disorders were depression and epilepsy. Higher follow-up rates were seen among those with diagnoses of bipolar disorder and neurological conditions, while those with depression or anxiety had lower follow-up rates. Persons with mood disorders who were evaluated on at least two separate occasions using a locally developed depression screening tool experienced a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. The mental health mobile clinic successfully treated a wide range of MNS disorders in rural Haiti and provided care to individuals who previously had no consistent access to mental healthcare. Efforts to address these common barriers to the provision of mental healthcare in resource-limited settings should consider supplementing clinic-based with mobile services."
https://openalex.org/W2809148934,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the spectrum of upper limb functional activities and imaging finding in a cohort of patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Thirty-one patients of age between 5 and 29 years were included in the study (17 ambulant and 14 non-ambulant). They were all assessed using the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) test and muscle MRI of shoulder, arm and forearm in order to establish if the functional scores obtained at shoulder, mid and distal level related to specific patterns of involvement in each upper limb segment on muscle MRI. At shoulder level, latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, infraspinatus and subscapularis were always involved, even in patients with full functional scores at shoulder level. Diffuse and severe involvement of all muscles was found in the patients with a PUL shoulder functional score of ≤ 5. At arm level biceps brachii, brachialis and triceps were generally concordantly involved or spared. Some degree of involvement could already be detected in patients with reduced scores on the PUL mid domain. They were generally severely involved in patients with functional scores less than 6 at mid-level. At distal level supinator and pronator muscles were often involved, followed by brachioradialis and, less frequently, by the muscles of the flexor compartment. The extensor muscles were generally completely spared. A diffuse and severe involvement was found only in patients who had very low scores (8 or below) on the PUL distal domain. The integrated use of functional scales and imaging allowed to establish patterns of involvement at each level, and the functional scores that were more frequently associated with diffuse and severe involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2809597631,"Climate change, especially warming temperatures, may increase invasion and modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their ability to compete. To test the effects of warming on invasive plants, a mesocosm experiment was conducted to study competition between the invasive plant Egeria densa and the native hygrophyte Sparganium angustifolium under simulated warming conditions in a greenhouse. These two species were grown in monoculture (no competitor control) or mixed culture (competitor control) for two months under different temperature conditions (warming treatment or no-warming treatment). In S. angustifolium, the higher temperatures led to a shorter root length and significantly increased the aboveground traits of ramets, the total biomass, and the RGR (relative growth rate) but had no effect on the aboveground traits of genets. Growth in mixed culture significantly decreased the S. angustifolium ramet height under warmer conditions and significantly reduced the ramet root length, ramet number, genet biomass, root-to-shoot ratio and RGR of S. angustifolium under natural temperature conditions. All the morphological, biomass and growth traits of E. densa except for the root-to-shoot ratio were significantly increased by the warmer temperatures and decreased by growth in mixed culture. The RCI and RII of E. densa in both the no-warming and warmer environments were two and three times greater than those of S. angustifolium, whereas the ACI values for the two species were similar. Thus, S. angustifolium was a better competitor than E. densa under both temperature conditions. These results suggest that although the superior competitive ability of native species can inhibit E. densa growth, the performance of this species will be enhanced under future climate warming in cold regions."

The designed metamaterial exhibits an extra-large negative refractive index bandwidth of 6.34 GHz, with an operating frequency range from 4 to 18 GHz. We demonstrate the effects of substrate material thickness on the effective properties of metamaterial using two substrate materials: 1) flame retardant 4 and 2) flexible nickel aluminate. A finite integration technique based on the Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio electromagnetic simulator was used for our design, simulation, and investigation. A finite element method based on an HFSS (High Frequency Structure Simulator) electromagnetic simulator is also used to simulate results, perform verifications, and compare the measured results. The simulated resonance peaks occurred at 6.42 GHz (C-band), 9.32 GHz (X-band), and 16.90 GHz (Ku-band), while the measured resonance peaks occurred at 6.60 GHz (C-band), 9.16 GHz (X-band) and 17.28 GHz (Ku-band).

https://openalex.org/W2809680537,"Background Sialylated glycoconjugates play important roles in physiological and pathological processes. However, available sialylated oligosaccharides source is limited which is a barrier to study their biological roles. This work reports an efficient approach to produce sialic acid-modified lactuloses and investigates their inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Methods A one-pot two-enzyme (OPTE) sialylation system was used to efficiently synthesize sialylated lactuloses. Silica gel flash chromatography column was employed to purify the sialylated products. The purity and identity of the product structures were confirmed with mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The inhibitory effect of sialylated lactuloses against S. aureus was evaluated by using microplate assay, fluorescence microscopy, DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence staining and protein leakage quantification. Results Neu5Ac-containing sialylated lactuloses with either α2,3- or α2,6-linkages were efficiently synthesized via an efficient OPTE sialylation system using α-2,3-sialyltransferase or α-2,6-sialyltransferase, respectively. Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose and Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose significantly inhibited the growth of S. aureus. Fluorescence microscopy and DAPI fluorescence staining indicated that the sialylated lactuloses might disrupt nucleic acid synthesis of S. aureus. Conclusions Neu5Ac-containing sialylated lactuloses had higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus than non-sialylated lactulose. The inhibitory effect of Neu5Ac-α2,3-lactulose was superior to that of Neu5Ac-α2,6-lactulose. The sialylated lactuloses might inhibit S. aureus by causing cell membrane leakage and disrupting nucleic acid synthesis."

MAP2c differs from its sequence homologue Tau in the pattern and kinetics of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Moreover, the mechanisms through which MAP2c interacts with its binding partners and the conformational changes and dynamics associated with these interactions remain unclear. Here, we used NMR relaxation and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement techniques to determine the dynamics and long-range interactions within MAP2c. The relaxation rates revealed large differences in flexibility of individual regions of MAP2c, with the lowest flexibility observed in the known and proposed binding sites. Quantitative conformational analyses of chemical shifts, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement measurements disclosed that MAP2c regions interacting with important protein partners, including Fyn tyrosine kinase, plectin, and PKA, adopt specific conformations. High populations of polyproline II and α-helices were found in Fyn- and plectin-binding sites of MAP2c, respectively. The region binding the regulatory subunit of PKA consists of two helical motifs bridged by a more extended conformation. Of note, although MAP2c and Tau did not differ substantially in their conformations in regions of high sequence identity, we found that they differ significantly in long-range interactions, dynamics, and local conformation motifs in their N-terminal domains.

With this evolution, there is increasing interest in Canada in understanding the current delivery of HIV care, specifically where care is delivered, how, and by whom, to inform the design of care models required to meet the evolving needs of the population. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian care settings identified as delivering HIV care between June 2015 and January 2016. Given known potential differences in delivery approaches, we stratified settings as primary care or specialist settings, and described their structure, geographic location, populations served, health human resources, technological resources, and available clinical services. We received responses from 22 of 43 contacted care settings located in seven Canadian provinces (51.2% response rate). The total number of patients and HIV patients served by the participating settings was 38,060 and 17,678, respectively (mean number of HIV patients in primary care settings = 1,005, mean number of HIV patients in specialist care settings = 562). Settings were urban for 20 of the 22 (90.9%) clinics and 14 (63.6%) were entirely HIV focused. Primary care settings were more likely to offer preventative services (e.g., cervical smear, needle exchange, IUD insertion, chronic disease self-management program) than specialist settings. The study illustrates diversity in Canadian HIV care settings. All settings were team based, but primary care settings offered a broader range of preventative services and comprehensive access to mental health services, including addictions and peer support."
https://openalex.org/W2809274157,"Growing to lengths and weights exceeding 1.5 m and 45 kg, the hump-backed mahseer fish of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, India, is an iconic, mega-faunal species that is globally recognized as a premier freshwater game fish. Despite reports of their high extinction risk, conservation approaches are currently constrained by their lack of valid taxonomic identity. Using an integrative approach, incorporating morphology, molecular analysis and historical photographs, this fish can now be revealed to be conspecific with Tor remadevii, a species lacking a common name, that was initially, but poorly, described in 2007 from the River Pambar, a tributary of the River Cauvery in Kerala. Currently known to be endemic and restricted to the River Cauvery basin in the Western Ghats, T. remadevii is distinguished from congeners by its prominent hump originating above the pre-opercle and extending to the origin of the dorsal fin, a well-developed mandible resulting in a terminal or slightly superior mouth position, and the dorsal orientation of the eyes. While body colouration varies (silver, bronze, greenish) and is not considered a reliable diagnostic character, orange coloration of the caudal fin (sometimes extending to all fins) is considered a consistent characteristic. Having been first brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1849, and the recreational angling (game fishing) community in 1873, it has taken over 150 years to finally provide this iconic fish with a valid scientific name. This taxonomic clarity should now assist development and delivery of urgent conservation actions commensurate with their extinction risk."

We hypothesized that ARQ-197 (Tivantinib), a small molecule c-Met inhibitor, would reduce myeloma cell growth and prevent myeloma-associated bone disease in a murine model. In vitro we assessed the effects of ARQ-197 on myeloma cell proliferation, cytotoxicity and c-Met protein expression in human myeloma cell lines. In vivo we injected NOD/SCID-γ mice with PBS (non-tumour bearing) or JJN3 cells and treated them with either ARQ-197 or vehicle. In vitro exposure of JJN3, U266 or NCI-H929 cells to ARQ-197 resulted in a significant inhibition of cell proliferation and an induction of cell death by necrosis, probably caused by significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated c-Met. In vivo ARQ-197 treatment of JJN3 tumour-bearing mice resulted in a significant reduction in tumour burden, tumour cell proliferation, bone lesion number, trabecular bone loss and prevented significant decreases in the bone formation rate on the cortico-endosteal bone surface compared to the vehicle group. However, no significant differences on bone parameters were observed in non-tumour mice treated with ARQ-197 compared to vehicle, implying that in tumour-bearing mice the effects of ARQ-197 on bone cells was indirect. In summary, these res ults suggest that ARQ-197 could be a promising therapeutic in myeloma patients, leading to both a reduction in tumour burden and an inhibition of myeloma-induced bone disease."
https://openalex.org/W2809118679,"There are several animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus induction but the comparison between models is scarce. Food restriction generates benefits, such as reducing oxidative stress, but there are few studies on its effects on diabetes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the differences in physiological and biochemical parameters between diabetes models and their responses to food restriction. For this, 30 male Wistar rats were distributed in 3 groups (n = 10/group): control (C); diabetes with streptozotocin and cafeteria-style diet (DE); and diabetes with streptozotocin and nicotinamide (DN), all treated for two months (pre-food restriction period). Then, the 3 groups were subdivided into 6, generating the groups CC (control), CCR (control+food restriction), DEC (diabetic+standard diet), DER (diabetic+food restriction), DNC (diabetic+standard diet) and DNR (diabetic+food restriction), treated for an additional two months (food restriction period). The food restriction (FR) used was 50% of the average daily dietary intake of group C. Throughout the treatment, physiological and biochemical parameters were evaluated. At the end of the treatment, serum biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and insulin were evaluated. Both diabetic models produced hyperglycemia, polyphagia, polydipsia, insulin resistance, high fructosamine, hepatic damage and reduced insulin, although only DE presented human diabetes-like alterations, such as dyslipidemia and neuropathy symptoms. Both DEC and DNC diabetic groups presented higher levels of protein carbonyl groups associated to lower antioxidant capacity in the plasma. FR promoted improvement of glycemia in DNR, lipid profile in DER, and insulin resistance and hepatic damage in both diabetes models. FR also reduced the protein carbonyl groups of both DER and DNR diabetic groups, but the antioxidant capacity was improved only in the plasma of DER group. It is concluded that FR is beneficial for diabetes but should be used in conjunction with other therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2809057655,"Bioerosion, the removal of calcium carbonate from coral frameworks by living organisms, influences a variety of reef features, from their topographic complexity to the net balance of carbonate budgets. Little is known, however, about how macroborers, which bore into reef substrates leaving traces greater than 0.1 mm diameter, are distributed across coral reefs, particularly reef systems with high (>50%) stony coral cover or at mesophotic depths (≥30 m). Here, we present an accurate and efficient method for quantifying macroborer densities from stony coral hosts via image analysis, using the bioeroding barnacle, Lithotrya dorsalis, and its host coral, Orbicella franksi, as a case study. We found that in 2014, L. dorsalis densities varied consistently with depth and host percent cover in two Atlantic reef systems: the Flower Garden Banks (FGB, northwest Gulf of Mexico) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). Although average barnacle density was nearly 4.5 times greater overall in the FGB than in the USVI, barnacle density decreased with depth in both reef regions. Barnacle density also scaled negatively with increasing coral cover in the study areas, suggesting that barnacle populations are not strictly space-limited in their distribution and settlement opportunities. Our findings suggest that depth and host coral cover, and potentially, local factors may strongly influence the abundance of macroborers, and thus the rate of CaCO3 loss, in a given reef system. Our image analysis method for quantifying macroborers can be standardized across historical and modern reef records to better understand how borers impact host growth and reef health."
https://openalex.org/W2809285001,"Coxsackie B Virus (CBV) infection has been linked to the aetiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and vaccination has been proposed as prophylaxis for disease prevention. Serum neutralising antibodies and the presence of viral protein and RNA in tissues have been common tools to examine this potential disease relationship, whilst the role of anti-CBV cytotoxic T cell responses and their targets have not been studied. To address this knowledge gap, we augmented conventional HLA-binding predictive algorithm-based epitope discovery by cross-referencing epitopes with sites of positive natural selection within the CBV3 viral genome, identified using mixed effects models of evolution. Eight epitopes for the common MHC class I allele HLA-A*0201 occur at sites that appear to be positively selected. Furthermore, such epitopes span the viral genome, indicating that effective anti-viral responses may not be restricted to the capsid region. To assess the spectrum of IFNy responses in non-diabetic subjects and recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients, we stimulated PBMC ex vivo with pools of synthetic peptides based on component-restricted sequences identified in silico. We found responders were more likely to recognize multiple rather than a single CBV peptide pool, indicating that the natural course of infection results in multiple targets for effector memory responses, rather than immunodominant epitopes or viral components. The finding that anti-CBV CD8 T cell immunity is broadly targeted has implications for vaccination strategies and studies on the pathogenesis of CBV-linked diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2809160333,"The multimeric analysis (MA) of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) evaluates structural integrity and helps in the diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD). This assay is a matter of controversy, being considered by some investigators cumbersome and only slightly informative. The centralised study ‘Molecular and Clinical Profile of von Willebrand Disease in Spain (PCM-EVW-ES)’ has been carried out by including the phenotypic assessment and the genetic analysis by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the VWF gene (VWF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of MA to the diagnosis of these patients and their potential discrepancies. Two hundred and seventy out of 480 patients centrally diagnosed with VWD had normal multimers, 168 had abnormal multimers and 42 a total absence of multimers. VWF MA was of great significance in the diagnosis of 83 patients (17.3%), it was also of help in the diagnosis achieved in 365 additional patients (76%) and was not informative in 32 cases (6.7%). With regard to discrepancies, 110 out of 480 (23%) patients centrally diagnosed with VWD presented some kind of discordance between VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag and/or VWF:CB/VWF:Ag ratios, multimeric study and/or genetic results. The VWF MA was key in the presence of novel mutations as well as in cases with phenotypic discrepancies. A comparison between the contribution of MA and VWF:CB showed a clearly higher contribution of the former in the diagnostic process. These data seem to reinforce the relevance of the VWF MA in VWD diagnosis, despite all its limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2809390538,"Pooled CRISPR libraries are widely used in high-throughput screening to study various biological processes. Various pooled CRISPR libraries have been shared for CRISPR screens and useful tools have been developed to construct researcher's own libraries, however, many researchers are struggling to create their own pooled CRISPR libraries: it is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive process. In this study, we develop a simple method to customize conventional pooled CRISPR libraries using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We show that conventional pooled CRISPR libraries can be modified by eliminating gRNAs that target positive genes, enabling the identification of unknown target genes in CRISPR screening. CRISPR/Cas9 system can be applied as a precise tool for customizing conventional pooled CRISPR libraries and will broaden the scope of high-throughput screening technology."
https://openalex.org/W2809643370,"Protein-protein interactions are an important mechanism for the regulation of enzyme function allowing metabolite channeling, crosstalk between pathways or the introduction of post-translational modifications. Therefore, a number of high-throughput studies have been carried out to shed light on the protein networks established under different pathophysiological settings. Surprisingly, this type of information is quite limited for enzymes of intermediary metabolism such as betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase, despite its high hepatic abundancy and its role in homocysteine metabolism. Here, we have taken advantage of two approaches, affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry and yeast two-hybrid, to further uncover the array of interactions of betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase in normal liver of Rattus norvegicus. A total of 131 non-redundant putative interaction targets were identified, out of which 20 were selected for further validation by coimmunoprecipitation. Interaction targets validated by two different methods include: S-methylmethionine homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase 2, methionine adenosyltransferases α1 and α2, cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase and aldolase b. Network analysis identified 122 nodes and 165 edges, as well as a limited number of KEGG pathways that comprise: the biosynthesis of amino acids, cysteine and methionine metabolism, the spliceosome and metabolic pathways. These results further expand the connections within the hepatic methionine cycle and suggest putative cross-talks with additional metabolic pathways that deserve additional research."
https://openalex.org/W2808973368,"Progression of systemic scleroderma (SSc), a chronic connective tissue disease that causes a fibrotic phenotype, is highly heterogeneous amongst patients and difficult to accurately diagnose. To meet this clinical need, we developed a novel three-layer classification model, which analyses gene expression profiles from SSc skin biopsies to diagnose SSc severity. Two SSc skin biopsy microarray datasets were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The skin scores obtained from the original papers were used to further categorize the data into subgroups of low (<18) and high (≥18) severity. Data was pre-processed for normalization, background correction, centering and scaling. A two-layered cross-validation scheme was employed to objectively evaluate the performance of classification models of unobserved data. Three classification models were used: support vector machine, random forest, and naive Bayes in combination with feature selection methods to improve performance accuracy. For both input datasets, random forest classifier combined with correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method and naive Bayes combined with CFS or support vector machine based recursive feature elimination method yielded the best results. Additionally, we performed a principal component analysis to show that low and high severity groups are readily separable by gene expression signatures. Ultimately, we found that our novel classification prediction model produced global gene signatures that significantly correlated with skin scores. This study represents the first report comparing the performance of various classification prediction models for gene signatures from SSc patients, using current clinical diagnostic factors. In summary, our three-classification model system is a powerful tool for elucidating gene signatures from SSc skin biopsies and can also be used to develop a prognostic gene signature for SSc and other fibrotic disorders."
