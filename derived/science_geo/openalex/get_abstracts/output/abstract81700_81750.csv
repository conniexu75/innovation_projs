https://openalex.org/W1977282539,"A retrovirus belonging to the family of recently discovered human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV), but clearly distinct from each previous isolate, has been isolated from a Caucasian patient with signs and symptoms that often precede the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This virus is a typical type-C RNA tumor virus, buds from the cell membrane, prefers magnesium for reverse transcriptase activity, and has an internal antigen (p25) similar to HTLV p24. Antibodies from serum of this patient react with proteins from viruses of the HTLV-I subgroup, but type-specific antisera to HTLV-I do not precipitate proteins of the new isolate. The virus from this patient has been transmitted into cord blood lymphocytes, and the virus produced by these cells is similar to the original isolate. From these studies it is concluded that this virus as well as the previous HTLV isolates belong to a general family of T-lymphotropic retroviruses that are horizontally transmitted in humans and may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W1598924472,"We purified and characterized the bone proteoglycans from fetal calves, growing rats, and human fetuses. The major proteoglycan is part of the mineralized tissue matrix and only 10-20% can be extracted prior to demineralization. This bone proteoglycan is a small glycoconjugate (Mr = 80,000-120,000) containing approximately 20-30% protein and either one or two chondroitin sulfate chains (Mr = 40,000) attached to a relatively monodisperse protein core (Mr = 38,000). O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharide units are also present. Antibodies directed against the protein core of calf bone proteoglycan do not cross-react with cartilage, skin, corneal, or basement membrane proteoglycans in immunoassays and have minimal cross-reactivity with scleral proteoglycans. Quantitative immunoassays and indirect immunofluorescence were used to show that the molecule is localized to forming bone trabeculae and dentin, but not to any other tissue. Osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells adjacent to areas undergoing rapid osteogenesis also contain this small proteoglycan. A second proteoglycan (Mr approximately equal to 1,000,000) was extracted from newly forming bone prior to demineralization. This large proteoglycan, which was isolated from the cartilage-free areas of developing intramembranous bone, has a protein core similar to that of the cartilage aggregating proteoglycan and cross-reacts with antisera raised against these cartilage proteoglycans but not with the small mineral-entrapped proteoglycan. It contains larger (Mr = 40,000) and fewer chondroitin sulfate chains than its cartilage-derived analogue, and is localized to the soft connective tissue mesenchyme lying between growing bone trabeculae. More fully formed compact bone did not contain detectable quantities of this proteoglycan."

https://openalex.org/W2009701813,"Expression and DNA methylation of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) genome were investigated in murine teratocarcinoma cells after virus infection. The newly acquired viral genome was devoid of methylation, yet its expression was repressed. The integrated viral genome in undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells was methylated within 15 days after infection. Although 5-azacytidine decreased the level of DNA methylation, it did not activate M-MuLV in undifferentiated cells. Activation by 5-azacytidine occurred only in differentiated teratocarcinoma cells. Thus two independent mechanisms seem to regulate gene expression during the course of differentiation. The first mechanism operates in undifferentiated cells to block expression of M-MuLV and other exogeneously acquired viral genes, such as SV40 and polyoma virus, and does not depend on DNA methylation. The second mechanism relates only to differentiated cells and represses expression of genes in which DNA is methylated."
https://openalex.org/W2086355805,"The tandem P1, P2 promoter region of the rrnA ribosomal operon has been fused to the t1, t2 terminator region of the rrnB operon in pBR322 plasmid derivatives. This deletes most internal RNA structural elements ordinarily processed out of ribosomal operon transcripts. In vivo as well as in vitro transcripts arising from both promoters terminate predominantly in the t1 terminator region about 40 base pairs beyond the mature rrnB 5S RNA gene. Stringent control of the P1 and P2 promoted transcripts has been assessed in vivo. In these plasmid fusions, the upstream (P1) promoter activity was subject to stringent control, while the downstream (P2) promoter activity was inhibited by amino acid starvation in both stringent and relaxed hosts. A plasmid with an additional deletion of the P2 region also showed stringent regulation of the P1 promoter."

https://openalex.org/W2019340297,"The adult mouse brain contains complex populations of polyadenylated [poly(A)+] and nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)-] messenger RNA's (mRNA's). These mRNA's are separate sequence populations, similar in complexity, and in combination are equivalent to approximately 150,000 different mRNA sequences, of average length. Essentially all of the ""adult"" poly(A)+ mRNA's are present in the brain at birth. In contrast, most of the poly(A)- mRNA's are absent. Brain poly(A)- mRNA's begin to appear soon after birth, but the full adult complement is not reached until young adulthood. This suggests that these poly(A)- mRNA's specify proteins required for the biological capabilities of the brain that emerge during the course of postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W1547131709,"Rat brain cortex membranes bind to a conjugate of substance P and 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent, and this binding can be inhibited by a low concentration of substance P (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.4 X 10(-8) M). This binding is reversible and saturable (0.5 +/- 0.1 pmol of binding sites/mg of protein). Fragments of substance P as small as the carboxyl-terminal hexapeptide can inhibit the binding although their potency decreases with the decrease in the length of the peptides. The binding affinities of smaller peptides or peptides in which the carboxyl-terminal amide or amino acids are removed are drastically reduced. Biologically active analogs of substance P, physalaemin, eledoisin, substance P methyl ester, [D-Ala0]hepta(5-11)substance P, kassinin, and the eledoisin-related hexapeptide also can inhibit the binding. However, the binding is not inhibited by polypeptides structurally unrelated to substance P or by amine hormones/neurotransmitters. The binding affinities of biologically active peptides to rat brain cortex membranes are almost identical with their affinities for rat parotid cells which we previously determined. Furthermore, the recently described substance P antagonist, [D-Pro, D-Trp]substance P, inhibits the binding of the 125I-labeled substance P derivative to brain cortex membranes and to parotid cells equally well. These results suggest that the substance P receptors in the brain cortex and the parotid gland are similar. The brain cortex membrane binding of the 125I-labeled substance P derivative can be inhibited by micromolar concentrations of GTP, GDP, and their analogs. ITP and IDP were less active. Adenine and pyridine nucleotides were inactive."

The measurements were indicative of the cellular DNA content and base composition, cell concentration, and proliferative state of the population. The ratio of the chromomycin A3 signal to the Hoechst 33258 signal increased with the guanine-cytosine content of the cellular DNA for the six cultured species measured, following expectation. Bacteria in urine from patients with urinary tract infections were characterized without interference from host cell DNA, debris, or other particulates."
https://openalex.org/W1608232370,"Human small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) containing U1 and U2 snRNAs have been isolated from cultured cells by nonimmunological methods. The U1 snRNP population remained immunoprecipitable by systemic lupus erythematosis anti-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies throughout fractionation and contained polypeptides of molecular weights corresponding to those defined as U1 snRNP polypeptides by immunoprecipitation of crude extracts. The purified assemblies contained U1 RNA and nine snRNP polypeptides of molecular weights 67,000 (P67), 30,000 (P30), 23,000 (P23), 21,500 (P22), 17,500 (P18), 12,300 (P12), 10,200 (P10), 9,100 (P9), and 8,500 (P8). P67, P30, and P18 were unique to U1 snRNPs. The U2 snRNP population remained immunoprecipitable by the systemic lupus erythematosis anti-Sm antibody throughout fractionation. The purified U2 assemblies contained six polypeptides of molecular weights corresponding to those defined by immunoprecipitation to be common to U1 and U2 snRNPs including P23, P22, P12, P10, P9, and P8. In addition, U2 snRNPs contained a unique polypeptide of 27,000 Da."
https://openalex.org/W1593836835,"Poly(dA.dU), which is specifically tritiated at the 1'-, 2'- (ribo configuration), 3'-, or 4'-position of deoxyuridine, has been synthesized and the fate of the tritium has been determined upon degradation of the polymer by bleomycin, Fe(II), and O2. No tritium is labilized from the 1'-3H-labeled polymer as 3H2O; however, the resulting 3-(uridin-1'-yl)-2-propenal (uracil propenal) has the expected specific activity. The 2'-3H-labeled polymer affords 3H2O and no label in the uracil propenal. This result and the lack of solvent incorporation into the uracil propenal suggest that proton abstraction from C-2' to afford the trans-propenal is highly stereospecific. For the 3'-3H-labeled polymer, 3H2O is formed and the specific activity of the uracil propenal is identical to that of the deoxyuridine. This suggests that the labilization of the 3'-H is exclusively associated with free uracil formation. 3H2O is also formed from the 4'-3H-labeled polymer. These findings along with previous studies are consistent with the formation of uracil propenal and free uracil by the trapping of the initially formed 4'-radical species by O2 or by a monooxygen species, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1572333556,"Fourteen clonal hybridoma lines that secrete monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR) have been isolated. When analyzed by an immunoreplica technique, two mabs recognized the alpha subunit, three reacted with the beta subunit, one reacted with the gamma chain, and five recognized the delta subunit. One mab failed to react with any of the subunits using this assay and two mabs recognized determinants found on both the gamma and the delta subunits. These were classified according to their reactivities with the membrane-bound Torpedo AChR. One category is comprised of mabs (including both anti-alpha mabs) that recognize extracellular epitopes. A second classification included mabs that are unable to bind the membrane-associated AChR. The third category is comprised of mabs directed against cytoplasmic epitopes of the AChR. The latter mabs, all of which recognize the gamma or delta subunits or both, bind only slightly to sealed, outside-out Torpedo vesicles. The binding is increased 10-20-fold by either alkaline extraction or treatment of the vesicles with 10 mM lithium diiodosalicylate but not by permeabilization of the vesicles with saponin. Three of the six mabs in this category react with frog muscle endplates but only if the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane is accessible."
https://openalex.org/W2087472219,"A class of ampC beta-lactamase-hyperproducing mutants of Escherichia coli were shown to have the insertion element IS2 inserted into the ampC promoter. The insertion of IS2 in orientation II created a novel promoter in which the -35 region and the 17 bp long spacing sequence between the two consensus sequences are present in IS2 DNA, whereas the -10 region from the original ampC promoter is retained. In vitro transcription revealed that the transcription initiation site in the ampC::IS2 mutants was identical with that of ampC wild-type promoter. The novel promoter exhibited a 20-fold increase in promoter strength relative to the original ampC promoter, presumably due to the increase in the spacing sequence from 16 to 17 bp. The evolution of transposable elements and of control elements such as promoters are discussed on the basis of the findings described herein."
https://openalex.org/W1579401963,"Estrogen regulates the synthesis of the egg yolk precursor protein, vitellogenin, by causing both a 20-60-fold increase in the absolute rate of total nuclear RNA synthesis and a selective increase of at least several thousand fold in the absolute rate of vitellogenin gene transcription. Vitellogenin gene transcription is undetectable in unstimulated and withdrawn Xenopus laevis liver cells and in cultured Xenopus kidney cells allowing us to set a very low upper limit (less than 1 transcript/vitellogenin gene/day) on potential basal rates of vitellogenin gene transcription. The elevated rates of vitellogenin mRNA accumulation previously observed during restimulation of withdrawn liver cells (secondary estrogen stimulation) appear to be due to an increased rate of vitellogenin gene transcription. Both the maximum transcription rate and the rapidity of the early response increase on secondary estrogen stimulation. Relative transcription rates were determined by hybridization of pulse-labeled nuclear RNA to vitellogenin cDNA clones immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. The conversion of relative transcription rates to absolute transcription rates, was facilitated by development of a sensitive high performance liquid chromatography method for quantitation of the specific radioactivity of the cellular UTP pool."
https://openalex.org/W1583309635,"Tissue-specific patterns of rat glutathione S-transferase expression have been demonstrated by in vitro translation of purified poly(A) RNAs and by protein purification. Poly(A) RNAs from six rat tissues including heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and testis were used to program in vitro translation with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and [35S]methionine. The glutathione S-transferase subunits synthesized in vitro were purified from the translation products by affinity chromatography on S-hexylglutathione-linked Sepharose 6B columns. The affinity bound fractions were analyzed by Na dodecyl SO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. A subunit of Mr = 22,000 detected in the in vitro translation products of poly(A) RNAs from heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and testis is missing from the translation products of liver poly(A) RNAs. This Mr = 22,000 subunit is present only in the anionic glutathione S-transferase fraction purified from rat heart, kidney, lung, spleen, and testis. Purified anionic glutathione S-transferase from rat liver does not contain this subunit. The relative specific activities toward a dozen different substrates also demonstrate the nonidentity between liver and kidney anionic glutathione S-transferases. In addition, among the glutathione S-transferase subunits expressed in the liver, some of them could not be detected in the other tissues investigated. Our results indicate that tissue-specific expression of rat glutathione S-transferases may occur pretranslationally."

https://openalex.org/W2161161941,"E. coli 16S RNA in solution was photoreacted with hydroxymethyltrimethylpsoralen and long wave ultraviolet light. Positions of crosslinks were determined to high resolution by partially digesting the RNA with T1 RNase, separating the crosslinked fragments by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, reversing the crosslink, and sequencing the separated fragments. This method yielded the locations of crosslinks to ±15 nucleotides. Even finer placement has been made on the basis of our knowledge of psoralen reactivity. Thirteen unique crosslinks were mapped. Seven crosslinks confirmed regions of secondary structure which had been predicted in published phylogenetic models, three crosslinks discriminated between phylogenetic models, and three proved the existence of new structures. The new structures were all long range interactions which appear to be in dynamic equilibrium with local secondary structure. Because this technique yields direct information about the secondary structure of large RNAs, it should prove invaluable in studying the structure of other RNAs of all sizes."
https://openalex.org/W1558363775,"The enzyme tryptophan oxygenase (EC 1.13.11.11), which is synthesized in rat liver, is induced by glucocorticoids. We have used cloned tryptophan oxygenase genomic and cDNA sequences to study the mechanism of induction. Rat liver poly(A+) RNA was separated on a formaldehyde gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to a nick-translated tryptophan oxygenase cDNA clone to analyze the kinetics of tryptophan oxygenase mRNA accumulation. Transcription in isolated rat liver nuclei was investigated to determine the relative rate of transcription of the tryptophan oxygenase gene. Analysis of the accumulation of albumin mRNA, which is unaffected by glucocorticoids, served as an internal control. We show here that the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone causes a 10-fold increase in the concentration of tryptophan oxygenase mRNA sequences in rat liver, and that this is a consequence of transcriptional activation of the tryptophan oxygenase gene."
https://openalex.org/W2034218422,"Concentrations of biogenic amine metabolites in discrete brain areas differed significantly between dogs with genetically transmitted narcolepsy and age- and breed-matched controls. Dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were consistently elevated in the brains of narcoleptic animals, while homovanillic acid was not. Narcoleptic animals consistently exhibited lower utilization of dopamine and higher intraneuronal degradation of dopamine but no uniform decrease in serotonin utilization. Hence neuropathology appears to be associated with genetically transmitted canine narcolepsy. The data indicate a nonglobal depression of dopamine utilization or turnover or both."
https://openalex.org/W1527182605,"Using a titration procedure, we measured the proportion of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin mRNA in normal, regenerating, and preneoplastic rat livers. AFP mRNA constitutes approximately 0.006% of the polysomal polyadenylated RNA of normal livers and this proportion increases only slightly before the onset of DNA synthesis in liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy or CCl4 injury. In either model of liver regeneration, the proportion of AFP mRNA in polysomal RNA is highest approximately 24 h after the peak of DNA synthesis. The increase in the proportion of AFP mRNA in polysomal RNA is relatively small during liver regeneration (2-4-fold) but is larger (30-50-fold) in preneoplastic livers of rats fed a choline-deficient diet containing 0.1% ethionine. In contrast to those changes in AFP mRNA, albumin mRNA levels remain unchanged during liver regeneration and double in preneoplastic livers. Our results indicate that the concept of retrodifferentiation as it applies to liver regeneration and certain types of hepatic neoplasia needs reevaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2054538541,"Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from bovine muzzle epidermis was microinjected into nonepithelial cells containing only intermediate-sized filaments of the vimentin type. In recipient cells keratin polypeptides are synthesized and assemble into intermediate-sized filaments at multiple dispersed sites. We describe the time course and the pattern of de novo assembly of keratin filaments within living cells. These filaments were indistinguishable, by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic criteria, from keratin filament arrays present in true epithelial cells. The presence of extended keratin fibril meshworks in these injected cells is compatible with cell growth and mitosis. Double immunolabeling revealed that newly assembled keratin was not codistributed with microfilament bundles, microtubules or vimentin filaments. We suggest that assembly mechanisms exist which in vivo sort out newly synthesized cytokeratin polypeptides from vimentin."
https://openalex.org/W1518407873,"The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase was increased in two human osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, SAOS and TE85, after treatment with 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). Enzyme activity increased when the cells were incubated with concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 between 10(-9) and 10(-7) M and cell growth was not inhibited at these concentrations. The specific activity of alkaline phosphatase was 4- to 7-fold higher than that in the control cells after 5 to 7 days of continuous exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3. Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the enzyme from both control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cultures cross-reacted with antisera specific for the phosphatase isoenzyme produced by normal human bone, and did not cross-react with antisera specific for the placental alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme. The increased enzyme activity in cultures induced with 1,25(OH)2D3 correlated with an absolute increase in the number of bone-specific phosphatase molecules, as determined by radioimmunoassay. No effect on alkaline phosphatase activity was observed when the cells were treated with other vitamin D metabolites or with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. Comparative studies demonstrated that hydrocortisone, another steroid hormone, increased the phosphatase activity with a different time course than did 1,25(OH)2D3. High affinity cytoplasmic receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 and hydrocortisone were found in the SAOS and TE85 cells."

https://openalex.org/W1509074378,"Ganglio-N-triaosylceramide (GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer), a tumor-associated marker for L5178 cells, was previously reported to separate on thin layer chromatography into three distinct bands (bands a, b, and c). The present paper describes the characterization of these bands and the factor that determines the degree of glycolipid exposure at the cell surface and its antigenicity. 1) The resolution of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide into three bands was found to be due to molecules having different fatty acid compositions. Band a contained nervonic (C24:1) and lignoceric (C24:0) acids, band b contained palmitic acid (C16:0), and band c contained alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid. 2) Surface labeling of L5178c127 cells with galactose oxidase/sodium borotritide, followed by fluorography of the isolated glycolipids, revealed that all three bands were exposed on the surface of the cell. However, treatment of cells with sialidase before treatment with galactose oxidase resulted in a 10-fold increase of label incorporated into ganglio-N-triaosylceramide. Since no sialylated form of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide was detected on these cells, and no change in the chemical amount of this glycolipid could be detected, the increase of label into this molecule was due to the exposure by sialidase of a normally cryptic glycolipid. The exposure of ganglio-N-triaosylceramide after sialidase treatment was also reflected by the increased sensitivity of these cells to monoclonal antibodies to the glycolipid and complement after enzyme treatment. Thus, the results provide clear evidence that crypticity, as well as antigenicity, of a membrane glycolipid is determined by the degree of sialylation in a second membrane glycoconjugate."

https://openalex.org/W1673704528,"Rous sarcoma virus transformed-chick embryo fibroblasts contain decreased amounts of the adhesive protein fibronectin that results from a lowering of fibronectin mRNA levels (Fagan, J.B., Sobel, M.E., Yamada, K.M., de Crombrugghe, B., and Pastan, I. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 520-525). In the present study, nuclei isolated from chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and Rous sarcoma virus transformed-chick embryo fibroblasts (RSV-CEF) were used to measure relative rates of fibronectin RNA synthesis. [32P]RNA was synthesized by preinitiated endogenous RNA polymerases in nuclei, and the radioactive RNA was subsequently hybridized to DNA fragments spanning approximately 40 kilobase pairs (approximately 85%) of the fibronectin gene. Transformation of CEF by RSV resulted in a 7- to 8-fold reduction in the amount of 32P-labeled nuclear RNA hybridizing with fibronectin DNA sequences when the nuclei were incubated for either 3.5 or 45 min. These results indicate that decreased transcription and not reduced RNA stability plays a major role in lowering fibronectin mRNA levels in RSV-CEF. When nuclear RNA was transcribed in the presence of Sarkosyl, diminished RNA synthesis was still observed suggesting that reduced fibronectin transcription in RSV-CEF is not due to a block in RNA chain elongation. Our data indicate that transcriptional regulation of the fibronectin gene is an important mechanism of lowering steady state levels of fibronectin mRNA in RSV-CEF."
https://openalex.org/W1666172410,"Monoclonal antibody BBM.1 (Brodsky, F.M., Bodmer, W. F., and Parham, P. (1979) Eur. J. Immunol. 9, 536-545) identifies an antigenic determinant of human beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M). The antibody binds free and HLA-A,B-associated beta 2-M with similar affinity, showing that the BBM.1 antigenic determinant does not involve residues of beta 2-M that interact with HLA-A,B heavy chains. Peptides (SWH.1-5) synthesized from residues 35-50 of the beta 2-M sequence specifically inhibit the binding of BBM.1 to cell surfaces. Their inhibitory activity is destroyed by trypsin treatment. The observations (i) that BBM.1 does not bind to beta 2-M of species other than man, gorilla, and chimpanzee and (ii) that arginine 45 is the only human-specific residue between positions 35 and 50 suggested that this residue might be part of the BBM.1 antigenic determinant. This hypothesis was confirmed by reversible modification of arginine residues with cyclohexanedione. Modification of arginines in native beta 2-M and of the single arginine, corresponding to position 45, in the peptide SWH.5 resulted in up to 95% loss of BBM.1 inhibitory activity. Reversal of the modification by treatment with hydroxylamine resulted in complete recovery of activity. Rabbit antibodies elicited by immunization of SWH.5 conjugated to bovine serum albumin showed no detectable reaction with native beta 2-M but did specifically react with human beta 2-M after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoresis onto nitrocellulose. These results thus identify a region around residue 45 of the beta 2-M polypeptide which is exposed to the environment and not involved in binding HLA-A,B heavy chain. Analysis of the beta 2-M sequence by calculating local hydrophilicity indices (Hopp, T. P., and Woods, K. R. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 3824-3828) agree with this region being a major antigenic determinant. Models of beta 2-M structure as an immunoglobulin domain show this region of polypeptide to be part of a loop between the two layers of beta-pleated sheet, also consistent with it being a major antigenic determinant. The position of the loop favors a model in which beta 2-M interacts with HLA across the four-stranded beta-pleated sheet like an immunoglobulin constant region domain."
https://openalex.org/W1545854848,"Total RNA and poly(A+) RNA, isolated from 13.5-day-old mouse embryo parietal endoderm cells and from differentiated F9 teratocarcinoma cells that synthesize laminin and entactin, were translated in the reticulocyte lysate. Antiserum raised against purified and denatured laminin B chains specifically immunoprecipitated from the translation reaction polypeptides of Mr = 205,000, 200,000, and 185,000. Antiserum against the native complex of laminin and entactin also immunoprecipitated these polypeptides, although less efficiently. In addition, this antiserum immunoprecipitated polypeptides of Mr = 300,000, 270,000, and 140,000. Antiserum against purified and denatured entactin immunoprecipitated only the Mr = 140,000 polypeptide. In contrast, no polypeptides were immunoprecipitated from translation reactions programmed with RNA from undifferentiated F9 cells that produce only small amounts of laminin and entactin. The in vitro synthesized polypeptides migrate on NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis slower than the respective unglycosylated laminin and entactin chains isolated from cells treated with tunicamycin. Supplementing the reticulocyte lysate with dog pancreas microsomal membranes yields in vitro translation products which co-migrate with the respective glycosylated laminin and entactin chains of control cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the polypeptides described represent in vitro synthesized laminin and entactin chains."
https://openalex.org/W1577623049,"A number of monoclonal antibodies against diphtheria toxin were isolated. Some of their properties were determined. Antibody 2 reacts with the region of between 30 and 46 kDa from the NH2 terminus of toxin. Antibody 7 reacts with the COOH-terminal 17-kDa region of toxin. These two antibodies show sharp contrasts in their effects on toxin action in cultured cells. When antibody 2 or 7 and toxin were mixed, incubated at 37 “C, and then added to sensitive Vero cells, antibody 7 blocked toxin action, but antibody 2 did not. When antibody 2 or 7 was added to cells to which toxin had been prebound at 4 “C, and the cells were then shifted to 37 “C, antibody 7 did not block toxin action, but antibody 2 inhibited intoxication. Antibody 7 blocked binding of 1261-toxin to cells and did not block degradation of toxin associated with cells. Antibody 2 did not block binding of 1261-toxin to cells, and was able to bind to cells in the presence of toxin. The results obtained from the effect of antibody 2 on degradation of i251-toxin associated with cells resemble those seen with amines, which block toxin action but do not inhibit binding of toxin to cells. These facts show that antibody 2 does not block binding of toxin to cell surfaces, but blocks the entry of toxin into the cytosol at a step after binding of toxin to the receptor. Antibodies 14 and 15 react with fragment A of diphtheria toxin, but have no effect on any activity of toxin. The other monoclonal antibodies have effects on toxin binding and entry intermediate between those of 2 and 7."
https://openalex.org/W1503400677,"Separation of rat sciatic nerve myelin proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis 18 h after injection of [3H]palmitic acid into the nerve demonstrated acylation of the PO protein. When sciatic nerve myelin labeled with [3H]palmitic acid was extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol or chloroform/methanol, the radioactivity associated with PO was retained. These results provided evidence that the radioactivity derived from [3H]palmitic acid in PO protein was not due to labeled phospholipid bound to PO protein by strong physical interaction. Furthermore, the radioactivity associated with purified preparations of PO remained after dialysis and re-electrophoresis, providing additional evidence that [3H]palmitic acid was firmly bound to PO. Treatment of myelin proteins with hydroxylamine at pH 6.6 released most of the radioactivity, indicating that [3H]palmitic acid was covalently bound by ester linkage to PO. Cleavage of purified acylated PO with methanolic NaOH released 85% of the protein-bound radioactivity. Gas-liquid chromatography of the fatty acids released from PO showed labeling of methyl esters of palmitate, stearate, and oleate (56, 16, and 5%, respectively). In addition, a small unlabeled peak with retention time identical with methyl linoleate was also observed. Intraneural injection of a mixture of [3H]palmitic acid and [14C]fucose or [3H]palmitic acid and [35S]sulfate in vivo followed by disc gel electrophoresis and determination of incorporated radioactivity clearly showed that PO was glycosylated, sulfated, and acylated.

https://openalex.org/W2056793599,"We have examined the transcription of two plasmid-encoded, stable RNAs; a shortened 16S ribosomal RNA and the spacer transfer RNA2Glu from the Escherichia coli rrnB operon. Plasmid deletions were constructed in vitro, in order to examine the DNA regions required for stringent control of rRNA expression in vivo during amino acid starvation. We find that rRNA synthesized from plasmids does exhibit a relA-dependent, stringent response. The DNA sequences required for this regulation do not extend beyond 20 bases downstream of the P1 transcription initiation site. Deletion of P2, the second of the two tandem rRNA promoters, does not weaken the stringent control of transcripts from P1. These results demonstrate that pause sites for RNA polymerase identified in vitro do not play a significant role in the stringent control of rRNA synthesis in vivo and imply that stringent regulation takes place at the level of initiation, rather than elongation, of transcription. Surprisingly, we find that the presence of extra intact rrnB operons (carried by a multicopy plasmid) reduces the magnitude of the stringent response."
https://openalex.org/W1494320771,"Oxygen does not quench the luminescence of either free Tb or of Tb bound to dipicolinate. However, sensitized Tb luminescence in complexes of that ion with elastase, thermolysin, and alpha-amylase is quenched by oxygen at rates that far exceed that with which the intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins is quenched. We infer that this more rapid quenching of Tb luminescence indicates a major role for energy transfer from tryptophan moieties in a triplet excited state."

https://openalex.org/W1606153087,"Cyclic GMP efflux from liver slices was studied when the intracellular cyclic GMP levels were elevated by incubation with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (0.1 mM) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.25 mM). A probenecid-sensitive and a probenecid-insensitive efflux system for cyclic GMP was found. It is suggested that the former system operates a carrier, which is saturable, the capacity of which is increased by alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide. The rate of net efflux of cyclic GMP increases 20-fold in the temperature interval 18-37 degrees C. Probenecid (0.5 mM) gives 50% inhibition of this system. The probenecid-insensitive cyclic GMP efflux component probably corresponds to passive diffusion. It appears that efflux may be an important complement to cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity in reducing intracellular cyclic GMP levels."
https://openalex.org/W1572549213,"The complexity of messenger RNA in growing or starved Tetrahymena thermophila is similar and unusually high (approximately 4.5 X 10(7) nucleotides). The complexity of nuclear RNA in growing cells (approximately 7.8 X 10(7) nucleotides) is only about 1.7 times that of mRNA. The concentration of complex class (rare) messages (approximately 53 copies/growing cell and approximately 11 copies/starved cell) is low in comparison to the size of the cell. The concentration of complex nuclear transcripts is also very low (approximately 0.7 copies/growing cell nucleus and approximately 2.6 copies/starved cell nucleus) considering that the macronucleus contains 45 to 90 copies of each single copy sequence. The complex sequence sets found on polysomes of growing and starved cells overlap about 80% and about 60% of the complex nuclear transcripts appear to be held in common. About 60% of macronuclear single copy DNA is transcribed in one or both physiological states. Although growing and starved cells have extremely different fractions of their messages loaded onto polysomes, within each cell type the complex messages in polysomal and nonpolysomal cytoplasmic fractions are indistinguishable, suggesting that exchange may occur between loaded and unloaded messages. Although T. thermophila DNA has an unusually low G + C content (23%), sequences coding for complex RNAs have base ratios similar to those of total DNA. Therefore, codon usage in Tetrahymena must be extremely biased towards adenine- and uridine-rich codons."

https://openalex.org/W1597088907,"The 5' ends of U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNA) are capped by a structure which contains N2,N2-7-trimethylguanosine (m2,2,7 G). m2,2,7 G was used as hapten to raise antibodies in rabbits, and these antibodies were linked to Sepharose. When deproteinized RNA was passed through this antibody column, these snRNA species were retained by the column. Conversely, 4 S, 5 S, 5.8 S, U6, and 7 S RNA, whose 5' termini do not contain m2,2,7 G, were not recognized. After a nuclear extract was loaded on the column, U1 RNA and some U2 RNA were retained. Therefore, the 5' ends of at least U1 RNA are accessible when this RNA species is in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) form. This is of interest, since it has been proposed that the 5' terminus sequence of U1 RNA may hybridize with splice junctions in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNP) during mRNA splicing. The retention of m2,2,7 G-containing RNA species by these antibodies is not due to association of snRNAs or snRNPs with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) or hnRNP (and antibody recognition of 7-monomethylguanosine residues in hnRNA), since the reaction still occurs after removal of hnRNA or hnRNP by sucrose gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1617808866,"The effect of beta-fluoroasparagine on N-linked glycosylation was examined in a cell-free translation system in which glycosylation is coupled to protein synthesis. The threo-isomer markedly inhibited glycosylation at a concentration of 1 mM, and this effect was blocked by L-asparagine, indicating that glycosylation was inhibited secondary to incorporation of the asparagine analog into protein. The erythro-isomer, at similar concentrations, was not incorporated into protein and had no effect on glycosylation. threo-beta-Fluoroasparagine is highly toxic to some mammalian cells in culture. Our observations suggest that its toxicity may be due in part to the failure of the fluoroasparagine-containing protein to become glycosylated. The data suggest that this analog will be useful for examining the structural determinants for glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2035409382,Human mononuclear leukocytes were exposed to microwaves at energies relevant to current public safety recommendations. No detectable effects on viability or function of the leukocytes resulted from exposure to microwaves at specific absorption rates up to 4 milliwatts per milliliter. The results were highly reproducible and provided no evidence that current safety standard recommendations are inappropriate insofar as leukocyte function is concerned.
https://openalex.org/W1529432938,"Abstract The binding of eucaryotic elongation factor Tu (eEF-Tu) to nucleic acids was investigated. eEF-Tu binds to a variety of different nucleic acids with high affinity, showing a strong preference for 18 S and 28 S rRNA over transfer RNA and for ribose-containing polymers over polydeoxyribonucleotides. The factor binds at multiple sites on 28 S rRNA without strong cooperativity. eEF-Tu binds strongly to poly(G) and poly(U) but weakly, if at all, to poly(A) and poly(C). Experiments employing an airfuge demonstrate that eEF-Tu can form a quaternary complex containing the factor, 28 S rRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA, and GTP. The existence of two distinct RNA binding sites on eEF-Tu suggests that rRNA may play a role in the recognition of eEF-Tu.aminoacyl-tRNA.GTP complexes by polysomes. Support for this suggestion comes from experiments which show that poly(G) inhibits the factor-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to mRNA-programmed 80 S ribosomes. In addition, it is shown that eEF-Tu possesses an intrinsic GTPase activity which is stimulated significantly by 28 S rRNA, poly(G), and poly(U). The binding of eEF-Tu to poly(G) lowers the activation energy for eEF-Tu GTPase from 74.3 to 65.9 kJ . mol-1 and approximately doubles the Vmax of the enzymatic reaction. The results are discussed in relation to the binding of eEF-Tu to ribosomes during protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1520537655,"Solubilization of the major outer membrane protein of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, and subsequent isolation, has been achieved by both non-detergent- and detergent-based methods. The protein was differentially solubilized from other outer membrane proteins in 5 M guanidine thiocyanate which was exchanged by dialysis for 7 M urea. The urea-soluble protein was purified to homogeneity by a combination of DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and preparative electrophoretic techniques. Similar to the peptidoglycan-associated proteins of other Gram-negative bacteria, the protein was also purified by differential temperature extraction of the outer membrane in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunochemical analysis of the proteins isolated by the two techniques established the immunochemical identity and homogeneity of each preparation. Immunoblots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed that antibody directed against the major outer membrane protein reacted with the three high molecular weight aggregates present in the outer membrane which we have previously shown to be composed of the major outer membrane protein and three nonidentical small molecular weight proteins."
