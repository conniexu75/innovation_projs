https://openalex.org/W2948485804,"The existence of a paradoxical supersolid phase of matter, possessing the apparently incompatible properties of crystalline order and superfluidity, was predicted 50 years ago. Solid helium was the natural candidate, but there supersolidity has not been observed yet, despite numerous attempts. Ultracold quantum gases have recently shown the appearance of the periodic order typical of a crystal, due to various types of controllable interactions. A crucial feature of a D-dimensional supersolid is the occurrence of up to D+1 gapless excitations reflecting the Goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of two continuous symmetries: the breaking of phase invariance, corresponding to the locking of the phase of the atomic wave functions at the origin of superfluid phenomena, and the breaking of translational invariance due to the lattice structure of the system. The occurrence of such modes has been the object of intense theoretical investigations, but their experimental observation is still missing. Here we demonstrate the supersolid symmetry breaking through the appearance of two distinct compressional oscillation modes in a harmonically trapped dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, reflecting the gapless Goldstone excitations of the homogeneous system. We observe that the two modes have different natures, with the higher frequency mode associated with an oscillation of the periodicity of the emergent lattice and the lower one characterizing the superfluid oscillations. Our work paves the way to explore the two quantum phase transitions between the superfluid, supersolid and solid-like configurations that can be accessed by tuning a single interaction parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2973090194,"A supersolid is a counter-intuitive state of matter that combines the frictionless flow of a superfluid with the crystal-like periodic density modulation of a solid1,2. Since the first prediction3 in the 1950s, experimental efforts to realize this state have focused mainly on helium, in which supersolidity remains unobserved4. Recently, supersolidity has also been studied in ultracold quantum gases, and some of its defining properties have been induced in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)5,6 and BECs coupled to two crossed optical cavities7,8. However, no propagating phonon modes have been observed in either system. Recently, two of the three hallmark properties of a supersolid-periodic density modulation and simultaneous global phase coherence-have been observed in arrays of dipolar quantum droplets9-11, where the crystallization happens in a self-organized manner owing to intrinsic interactions. Here we directly observe the low-energy Goldstone mode, revealing the phase rigidity of the system and thus proving that these droplet arrays are truly supersolid. The dynamics of this mode is reminiscent of the effect of second sound in other superfluid systems12,13 and features an out-of-phase oscillation of the crystal array and the superfluid density. This mode exists only as a result of the phase rigidity of the experimentally realized state, and therefore confirms the superfluidity of the supersolid."
https://openalex.org/W2973152168,"Melanin is a natural pigment that is produced by filamentous fungi. In this study, the endophytic species, Spissiomyces endophytica (strain SDBR-CMU319), produced a brown-black pigment in the mycelia. Consequently, the pigment was extracted from the dried fungal biomass. This was followed by pigment purification, characterization and identification. Physical and chemical characteristics of the pigment showed acid precipitation, alkali solubilization, decolorization with oxidizing agents, and insolubility in most organic solvents and water. The pigment was confirmed as melanin based on ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra analyses. The analyses of the elemental composition indicated that the pigment possessed a low percentage of nitrogen, and therefore, was not 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine melanin. Inhibition studies involving specific inhibitors, both tricyclazole and phthalide, and suggest that fungal melanin could be synthesized through the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene pathway. The optimum conditions for fungal pigment production from this species were investigated. The highest fungal pigment yield was observed in glucose yeast extract peptone medium at an initial pH value of 6.0 and at 25°C over three weeks of cultivation. This is the first report on the production and characterization of melanin obtained from the genus Spissiomyces."

The essential transcription factor ACE3 is involved in cellulase production in Trichoderma reesei; however, the mechanism by which ACE3 regulates cellulase activities is unknown. Here, we discovered that the nominal ace3 sequence in the T. reesei genome available through the Joint Genome Institute is erroneously annotated. Moreover, we identified the complete ace3 sequence, the ACE3 Zn(II)2Cys6 domain, and the ACE3 DNA-binding sites containing a 5′-CGGAN(T/A)3-3′ consensus. We found that in addition to its essential role in cellulase production, ace3 is required for lactose assimilation and metabolism in T. reesei. Transcriptional profiling with RNA-Seq revealed that ace3 deletion down-regulates not only the bulk of the major cellulase, hemicellulase, and related transcription factor genes, but also reduces the expression of lactose metabolism–related genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that ACE3 binds the promoters of many cellulase genes, the cellulose response transporter gene crt1, and transcription factor–encoding genes, including xyr1. We also observed that XYR1 dimerizes to facilitate cellulase production and that ACE3 interacts with XYR1. Together, these findings uncover how two essential transcriptional activators mediate cellulase gene expression in T. reesei. On the basis of these observations, we propose a model of how the interactions between ACE3, Crt1, and XYR1 control cellulase expression and lactose metabolism in T. reesei.

https://openalex.org/W2972719936,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most lethal form of tuberculosis infection, characterized by a dysregulated immune response that frequently leads to neurologic injury and death despite the best available treatment. The mechanisms driving the inflammatory response in TBM are not well understood. To gain insights into these mechanisms, we used a lipid mediator–profiling approach to investigate the regulation of a novel group of host protective mediators, termed specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of adults with TBM. Herein, using CSF from patients enrolled into a randomized placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive aspirin treatment, we found distinct lipid mediator profiles with increasing disease severity. These changes were linked with an up-regulation of inflammatory eicosanoids in patients with severe TBM and a decrease in the production of a number of SPMs. CSF proresolving mediator concentrations were also associated with 80-d survival. In survivors, we found a significant increase in proresolving mediator concentrations, including the lipoxygenase 5-derived 13-series resolvin (RvT)2, RvT4, and 15-epi-lipoxin B4, compared with those who died. Of note, treatment of patients with high-dose aspirin led to a decrease in the concentrations of the prothrombic mediator thromboxane A2, reduced brain infarcts, and decreased death in patients with TBM. Together, these findings identify a CSF SPM signature that is associated with disease severity and 80-d mortality in TBM.—Colas, R. A., Nhat, L. T. H., Thuong N. T. T., Gómez, E.

https://openalex.org/W2972404936,"Drought stress is an increasingly common and worrying phenomenon because it causes a loss of production in both agriculture and forestry. Teak is a tropical tree which needs alternating rainy and dry seasons to produce high-quality wood. However, a robust understanding about the physiological characteristics and genes related to drought stress in this species is lacking. Consequently, after applying moderate and severe drought stress to teak seedlings, an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) was used to measure different parameters in the leaves. Additionally, using the root transcriptome allowed finding and analyzing the expression of several drought-related genes. As a result, in both water deficit treatments a reduction in photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf relative water content was found. As well, an increase in free proline levels and intrinsic water use efficiency was found when compared to the control treatment. Furthermore, 977 transcripts from the root contigs showed functional annotation related to drought stress, and of these, TgTPS1, TgDREB1, TgAREB1 and TgPIP1 were selected. The expression analysis of those genes along with TgHSP1, TgHSP2, TgHSP3 and TgBI (other stress-related genes) showed that with moderate treatment, TgTPS1, TgDREB1, TgAREB1, TgPIP1, TgHSP3 and TgBI genes had higher expression than the control treatment, but with severe treatment only TgTPS1 and TgDREB1 showed higher expression than the control treatment. At the end, a schematic model for the physiological and molecular strategies under drought stress in teak from this study is provided. In conclusion, these physiological and biochemical adjustments in leaves and genetic changes in roots under severe and prolonged water shortage situations can be a limiting factor for teak plantlets’ growth. Further studies of those genes under different biotic and abiotic stress treatments are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2972408715,"Background Substance use is more prevalent among unemployed subjects compared to employed ones. However, quantifying the risk subsequent of job loss at short-term according to substance use remains underexplored as well as examining if this association persist across various sociodemographic and occupational positions previously linked to job loss. We examined this issue prospectively for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis use and their combination, among a large population-based sample of men and women, while taking into account age, gender, overall health status and depressive symptoms. Methods From the French population-based CONSTANCES cohort, 18,879 working participants were included between 2012 and 2016. At baseline, alcohol use disorder risk according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (mild, dangerous, problematic or dependence), tobacco (non-smoker, former smoker, 1–9, 10–19, >19 cigarettes/day) and cannabis use (never, not in past year, less than once a month, once a month or more) were assessed. Employment status at one-year (working versus not working) was the dependent variable. Logistic regressions provided Odds Ratios(OR(95%CI)) of job loss at one-year, adjusting for age, gender, self-reported health and depressive state (measured with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale). Stratified analyses were performed for education, occupational grade, household income, job stress (measured with the Effort-Reward Imbalance), type of job contract, type of work time and history of unemployment. In sensitivity analyses, employment status over a three-year follow-up was used as dependent variable. Results Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use were associated with job loss, from the second to the highest category: 1.46(95%CI:1.23–1.73) to 1.92(95%CI:1.34–2.75), 1.26(95%CI:1.09–1.46) to 1.78(95%CI:1.26–2.54) and 1.45(95%CI:1.27–1.66) to 2.68(95%CI:2.10–3.42), respectively, and with dose-dependent relationships (all p for trend <0.001). When introduced simultaneously, associations remained significant for the three substances without any between-substance interactions. Associations remained significant across almost all stratifications and over a three-year follow-up as well as after adjustment for all the sociodemographic and occupational factors. Conclusions Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use were independently associated with job loss at short-term, with dose-dependent relationships. This knowledge will help refining information and prevention strategies. Importantly, even moderate levels of alcohol, tobacco or cannabis use are associated with job loss at short-term and all sociodemographic and occupational positions are potentially concerned."
https://openalex.org/W2972488416,"Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are typically dispersed throughout their circumtropical range, but the species is also known to aggregate in specific coastal areas. Accurate site descriptions associated with these aggregations are essential for the conservation of R. typus, an Endangered species. Although aggregations have become valuable hubs for research, most site descriptions rely heavily on sightings data. In the present study, visual census, passive acoustic monitoring, and long range satellite telemetry were combined to track the movements of R. typus from Shib Habil, a reef-associated aggregation site in the Red Sea. An array of 63 receiver stations was used to record the presence of 84 acoustically tagged sharks (35 females, 37 males, 12 undetermined) from April 2010 to May 2016. Over the same period, identification photos were taken for 76 of these tagged individuals and 38 were fitted with satellite transmitters. In total of 37,461 acoustic detections, 210 visual encounters, and 33 satellite tracks were analyzed to describe the sharks’ movement ecology. The results demonstrate that the aggregation is seasonal, mostly concentrated on the exposed side of Shib Habil, and seems to attract sharks of both sexes in roughly equal numbers. The combined methodologies also tracked 15 interannual homing-migrations, demonstrating that many sharks leave the area before returning in later years. When compared to acoustic studies from other aggregations, these results demonstrate that R. typus exhibits diverse, site-specific ecologies across its range. Sightings-independent data from acoustic telemetry and other sources are an effective means of validating more common visual surveys."
https://openalex.org/W2972553640,"The resting-state brain is often considered a nonlinear dynamic system transitioning among multiple coexisting stable states. Despite the increasing number of studies on the multistability of the brain system, the processes of state transitions have rarely been systematically explored. Thus, we investigated the state transition processes of the human cerebral cortex system at rest by introducing a graph-theoretical analysis of the state transition network. The energy landscape analysis of brain state occurrences, estimated using the pairwise maximum entropy model for resting-state fMRI data, identified multiple local minima, some of which mediate multi-step transitions toward the global minimum. The state transition among local minima is clustered into two groups according to state transition rates and most inter-group state transitions were mediated by a hub transition state. The distance to the hub transition state determined the path length of the inter-group transition. The cortical system appeared to have redundancy in inter-group transitions when the hub transition state was removed. Such a hub-like organization of transition processes disappeared when the connectivity of the cortical system was altered from the resting-state configuration. In the state transition, the default mode network acts as a transition hub, while coactivation of the prefrontal cortex and default mode network is captured as the global minimum. In summary, the resting-state cerebral cortex has a well-organized architecture of state transitions among stable states, when evaluated by a graph-theoretical analysis of the nonlinear state transition network of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2972692227,"Background Membranous nephropathy (MN) is an autoimmune disease induced by circulating antibodies against the podocyte protein phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1-ab) in 80% of patients and represents the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. PLA2R1-ab levels correlate with disease activity and treatment response. However, their predictive role for long-term renal outcome is not clear. Methods The aim of this prospective observational multicenter study was to investigate the predictive role of PLA2R1-ab levels at the time of diagnosis for long-term outcome in a cohort of 243 patients with newly diagnosed biopsy-proven PLA2R1-associated MN. Statistical analyses included Cox proportional hazard models. The primary study endpoint was defined prior to data collection as doubling of serum creatinine or development of end-stage renal disease. Results During the median follow-up time of 48 months, 36 (15%) patients reached the study endpoint. Independent predictors for reaching the study endpoint were baseline PLA2R1-ab levels (HR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.11–1.66, p = 0.01), percentage of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (HR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.03–1.68, p = 0.03), PLA2R1-ab relapse during follow-up (HR = 3.22, 95%CI 1.36–7.60, p = 0.01), and relapse of proteinuria (HR = 2.60, 95%CI 1.17–5.79, p = 0.02). Fifty-four (22%) patients received no immunosuppressive treatment during the study, in 41 (76%) of them PLA2R1-ab spontaneously disappeared during follow-up, 29 (54%) patients had a complete remission of proteinuria, and 19 (35%) had a partial remission. Patients not treated with immunosuppression were more often females and had lower PLA2R1-ab levels, proteinuria, and serum creatinine at baseline compared to patients receiving immunosuppression. However, no conclusion on the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapies can be made, since this was not a randomized controlled study and treatment decisions were not made per-protocol. Conclusions PLA2R1-ab levels are, in addition to pre-existing renal damage, predictive factors for long-term outcome and should therefore be considered when deciding the treatment of patients with MN."
https://openalex.org/W2972872859,"CCL2/CCR2 signaling is believed to play an important role in kidney diseases. Several studies have demonstrated that blocking of CCR2 has a therapeutic effect on kidney diseases. However, the effects of CCR2 knockout on obesity-induced kidney injury remain unclear. We investigated the therapeutic effects and the mechanism of CCL2/CCR2 signaling in obesity-induced kidney injury. We used C57BL/6-CCR2 wild type and C57BL/6-CCR2 knockout mice: Regular diet wild type (RD WT), RD CCR2 knockout (RD KO), High-fat diet WT (HFD WT), HFD CCR2 KO (HFD KO). Body weight of WT mice was significantly increased after HFD. However, the body weight of HFD KO mice was not decreased compared to HFD WT mice. Food intake and calorie showed no significant differences between HFD WT and HFD KO mice. Glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides levels increased in HFD WT mice were decreased in HFD KO mice. Insulin resistance, increased insulin secretion, and lipid accumulation showed in HFD WT mice were improved in HFD KO mice. Increased desmin expression, macrophage infiltration, and TNF-α in HFD mice were reduced in HFD KO mice. HFD-induced albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and podocyte effacement were restored by CCR2 depletion. HFD-induced elevated expressions of xBP1, Bip, and Nox4 at RNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in HFD KO. Therefore, blockade of CCL2/CCR2 signaling by CCR2 depletion might ameliorate obesity-induced albuminuria through blocking oxidative stress, ER stress, and lipid accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2972938876,"Calcium is the key macromineral having a role in skeletal structure and function, muscle contraction, and neurotransmission. Bone remodeling is maintained through a constant balance between calcium resorption and deposition. Calcium deficiency is resolved through calcium supplementation, and among the supplements, water-soluble organic molecules attracted great pharmaceutical interest. Calcium glucoheptonate is a highly water-soluble organic calcium salt having clinical use; however, detailed investigations on its biological effects are limited. We assessed the effects of calcium glucoheptonate on cell viability and proliferation of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Calcium uptake and mineralization were evaluated using Alizarin red staining of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells treated with calcium glucoheptonate. Expression of osteogenic markers were monitored by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR assays. Increased proliferation and calcium uptake were observed in the MG-63 cells treated with calcium glucoheptonate. The treatment also increased the expression of osteopontin and osteogenic genes such as collagen-1, secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC), and osteocalcin. Calcium glucoheptonate treatment did not exert any cytotoxicity on colorectal and renal epithelial cells, indicating the safety of the treatment. This is the first report with evidence for its beneficial effect for pharmaceutical use in addressing calcium deficiency conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2973094707,"Boid Inclusion Body Disease (BIBD) is a potentially fatal disease reported in captive boid snakes worldwide that is caused by reptarenavirus infection. Although the detection of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IB) in blood cells serves as the gold standard for the ante mortem diagnosis of BIBD, the mechanisms underlying IB formation and the pathogenesis of BIBD are unknown. Knowledge on the reptile immune system is sparse compared to the mammalian counterpart, and in particular the response towards reptarenavirus infection is practically unknown. Herein, we investigated a breeding collection of 70 Boa constrictor snakes for BIBD, reptarenavirus viraemia, anti-reptarenavirus IgM and IgY antibodies, and population parameters. Using NGS and RT-PCR on pooled blood samples of snakes with and without BIBD, we could identify three different reptarenavirus S segments in the collection. The examination of individual samples by RT-PCR indicated that the presence of University of Giessen virus (UGV)-like S segment strongly correlates with IB formation. We could also demonstrate a negative correlation between BIBD and the presence of anti-UGV NP IgY antibodies. Further evidence of an association between antibody response and BIBD is the finding that the level of anti-reptarenavirus antibodies measured by ELISA was lower in snakes with BIBD. Furthermore, female snakes had a significantly lower body weight when they had BIBD. Taken together our findings suggest that the detection of the UGV-/S6-like S segment and the presence of anti-reptarenavirus IgY antibodies might serve as a prognostic tool for predicting the development of BIBD."
https://openalex.org/W2972309357,"Electronic cigarette refill liquids are commercially provided with a wide variety of flavoring agents. A recent study suggested that several common flavors may scavenge nitric oxide (NO) and cause endothelial dysfunction. It was the aim of the present study to investigate the effects of these flavors on NO/cyclic GMP-mediated signaling and vascular relaxation. We tested the flavoring agents for effects on Ca2+-induced cGMP accumulation and NO synthase activation in cultured endothelial cells. NO scavenging was studied with NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase and as NO release from a NO donor, measured with a NO electrode. Blood vessel function was studied with precontracted rat aortic rings in the absence and presence of acetylcholine or a NO donor. Cinnamaldehyde inhibited Ca2+-stimulated endothelial cGMP accumulation and NO synthase activation at ≥0.3 mM. Cinnamaldehyde and diacetyl inhibited NO-activated soluble guanylate cyclase with IC50 values of 0.56 (0.54–0.58) and 0.29 (0.24–0.36) mM, respectively, and caused moderate NO scavenging at 1 mM that was not mediated by superoxide anions. The other compounds did not scavenge NO at 1 mM. None of the flavorings interfered with acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation, but they caused relaxation of pre-contracted aortas. The most potent compounds were eugenol and cinnamaldehyde with EC50 values of ~0.5 mM. Since the flavors did not affect endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, NO scavenging by cinnamaldehyde and diacetyl does not result in impaired blood vessel function. Although not studied in vivo, the low potency of the compounds renders it unlikely that the observed effects are relevant to humans inhaling flavored vapor from electronic cigarettes."
https://openalex.org/W2972631858,"Endothelial up-regulation of VCAM-1 at susceptible sites in arteries modulates the recruitment efficiency of inflammatory monocytes that initiates atherosclerotic lesion formation. We reported that hydrodynamic shear stress (SS) mechanoregulates inflammation in human aortic endothelial cells through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via activation of the transcription factor x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Here, a microfluidic flow channel that produces a linear gradient of SS along a continuous monolayer of endothelium was used to delve the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of TNF-α-stimulated VCAM-1 expression. High-resolution immunofluorescence imaging enabled continuous detection of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1)-dependent, outside-in signaling as a function of SS magnitude. Differential expression of VCAM-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was regulated by the spatiotemporal activation of MAPKs, ER stress markers, and transcription factors, which was dependent on the mechanosensing of SS through PECAM-1 and PI3K. Inhibition of p38 specifically abrogated the rise to peak VCAM-1 at low SS (2 dyn/cm2), whereas inhibition of ERK1/2 attenuated peak ICAM-1 at high SS (12 dyn/cm2). A shear stress-regulated temporal rise in p38 phosphorylation activated the nuclear translocation of XBP1, which together with the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 1, promoted maximum VCAM-1 expression. These data reveal a mechanism by which SS sensitizes the endothelium to a cytokine-induced ER stress response to spatially regulate inflammation promoting atherosclerosis.-Bailey, K.

https://openalex.org/W2972288223,"Background Anemia is a common finding in patients with diabetes, even in the absence of kidney disease and is a risk factor for adverse outcomes, including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Despite this, relatively little is known about the burden of anemia among adults with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of anemia and its association with renal disease among diabetic adult outpatients attending a hospital in Northeast Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 diabetic adults at the diabetes clinic of Dessie Referral hospital in Northeast Ethiopia, from January to April 2018. Each patient provided a blood sample for hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels and urine for albuminuria. Anemia was defined by World Health Organization criteria (<13 g/dl for men and <12 g/dl for women). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was classified into 5 stages based on the eGFR and albuminuria. Results Anemia was present in 26.7% of the participants, and CKD in 43.0%. Anemia was more prevalent in patients with CKD (39.5%) than those without CKD (17.0%; P < 0.001). The prevalence of anemia increased with stage of CKD, from 22.6% at stage 1 to 100% at stage 4. Fifteen percent of the patients had anemia below the treatment threshold of 11 g ⁄dl. In multivariate analysis, older age (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI 1.11–5.21); type 2 diabetes (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.14–5.08); presence of hypertension (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI 1.35–10.57); high systolic BP (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.08); serum creatinine (AOR = 12.80, 95% CI 3.90–87.98) and low GFR (AOR = 9.50, 95% CI 4.05–22.28) were independently associated with greater odds for the presence of anemia Conclusions Anemia is commonly present among diabetic adults attending our diabetes outpatient clinic in Northeast Ethiopia, including those without kidney disease. Our findings highlight the need for incorporating anemia screening into routine diabetes care to enable early detection and treatment of anemia and hence improve the overall care of patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2972925795,"Potential environmental risks of genetically modified (GM) crops have raised concerns. To better understand the effect of transgenic rice on the bacterial community in paddy soil, a field experiment was carried out using pairs of rice varieties from two subspecies (indica and japonica) containing bar transgene with herbicide resistance and their parental conventional rice. The 16S rRNA gene of soil genomic DNA from different soil layers at the maturity stage was sequenced using high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform to explore the microbial community diversity among different rice soils. There were no significant differences in diversity indices between transgenic japonica rice and its sister conventional rice (japonica pair) among different soil layers, but, significant differences was observed between transgenic indica rice and its conventional rice (indica pair) in the topsoil layer around concentrated rice roots according to the ace diversity index. Though the japonica rice soil and indica rice soil were shared several key genera, including Rivibacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Roseomonas, Geobacter, Thiobacillus, Clostridium, and Desulfobulbus, the primary bacterial genera in indica rice soil were different from those in japonica rice. Synechococcus and Dechloromonas were present in japonica rice samples, while Chloronema, Flexibacter, and Blastocatella were observed in indica rice soil. Moreover, the abundance of genera between GM and non-GM varieties in japonica rice was significantly different from indica rice, and several bacterial communities influenced these differences. Anaerovorax was more abundant in transgenic japonica rice soil than conventional rice soil, while it was deficient in transgenic indica rice soil compared to conventional rice soil, and opposite responses to Deferrisoma were in that of indica rice. Thus, we concluded that transgenic indica and japonica rice had different effects on soil bacteria compared with their corresponding sister conventional rice. However, these composition and abundance difference only occurred for a few genera but had no effect on the primary genera and soil characteristics were mainly contributed to these differences. Thus, differences in bacterial community structure can be ignored when evaluating the impacts of transgenic rice in the complex soil microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2973056039,"Background Suicide prevention is a global priority. Despite the focus on primary care in suicide prevention, little is known about the contributory role of community pharmacists and nothing about the role of the wider community pharmacy team in this area. We aimed to explore the current and potential role of community pharmacy teams in self-harm and suicide prevention. Methods We conducted one-to-one semi-structured qualitative interviews with community pharmacy staff (pharmacists, pre-registration pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, dispensing/pharmacy assistants, delivery drivers) in the North West of England, UK. We identified themes from the interview transcripts through an iterative process of inductive thematic analysis. Results We conducted twenty-five interviews with community pharmacy staff. Many described examples of helping those who were contemplating suicide or self-harm. No participants had received suicide prevention training. We identified six themes. The first two themes (i) Relationship with Patient and (ii) Pharmacy environment were seen as facilitators, which, if supported by (iii) Training, could underpin the final three themes: (iv) Opportunities for contact, (v) Facilitated referral pathway and (v) Restricting access to means. The distinct lack of training should be overcome with evidence-informed training. Referral pathways should be clear and enable direct and accessible referral by community pharmacy teams. There are opportunities for existing pharmacy services and schemes to be adapted to maximise suicide and self-harm prevention activities. Pharmacy teams did not identify themselves to have a clear role in restricting access to medication. Conclusions Pharmacy teams already support patients in relation to self-harm and suicide, often relying on their personal experience in the absence of formal training. With the implementation of evidence-informed training and clear referral pathways, this could be done in a more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2972567015,"Concerns about the extent to which graduate programs adequately prepare students for the workplace have prompted numerous calls for reform. Understanding what employers look for in doctoral graduates can help schools better align graduate training with workplace needs. Twelve pharmaceutical scientists across diverse specialties and career pathways described the skills considered requisite for success in today’s science economy. Depth and breadth of knowledge, communication, collaboration, adaptability, research productivity, experiential training, and motivation and drive were among the themes identified. These results can be used to inform the development of doctoral curricula in the biomedical sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2772767554,"Unknown sequences, or gaps, are present in many published genomes across public databases. Gap filling is an important finishing step in de novo genome assembly, especially in large genomes. The gap filling problem is nontrivial and while there are many computational tools partially solving the problem, several have shortcomings as to the reliability and correctness of the output, i.e. the gap filled draft genome. SSPACE-LongRead is a scaffolding tool that utilizes long reads from multiple third-generation sequencing platforms in finding links between contigs and combining them. The long reads potentially contain sequence information to fill the gaps created in the scaffolding, but SSPACE-LongRead currently lacks this functionality. We present an automated pipeline called gapFinisher to process SSPACE-LongRead output to fill gaps after the scaffolding. gapFinisher is based on the controlled use of a previously published gap filling tool FGAP and works on all standard Linux/UNIX command lines. We compare the performance of gapFinisher against two other published gap filling tools PBJelly and GMcloser. We conclude that gapFinisher can fill gaps in draft genomes quickly and reliably. In addition, the serial design of gapFinisher makes it scale well from prokaryote genomes to larger genomes with no increase in the computational footprint."
https://openalex.org/W2973094281,"We aimed to determine the knowledge and practices regarding toxoplasmosis among housewives in the northern Mexican city of Durango. One hundred eighty-five women (mean age: 41.27 ± 12.40 years old) with an occupation of housewife were studied. A self-administered questionnaire was used. This tool included items about the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, its transmission routes, general clinical, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of toxoplasmosis, and practices to avoid infection. A minority (<10%) of women knew about the parasite, the disease, how the transmission occurs, the clinical manifestations, how an infection is diagnosed, the treatment, and how to avoid toxoplasmosis. Some women knew that cats can transmit T. gondii infection (20%), and that the parasite can be found in cat feces (20.5%). Only 7.6% of women knew that infection with T. gondii can be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or water. Only 1.1% of women knew about the prevalence of T. gondii infection. Some (4.9%) women used to taste raw meat while cooking, and 7.6% used to undercook meat. In addition, 20% of women used to eat raw dried meat, and 13.5% consumed untreated water. Less than 90% of women always washed their hands before cooking, and washed fruits or vegetables. The majority (75.1%) of women never wore gloves when handling raw meat. About one quarter (27.6%) of women always froze meat. And 16.2% of women cleaned cat feces. This is the first study regarding knowledge and practices about toxoplasmosis in housewives. Poor knowledge regarding T. gondii infection, toxoplasmosis, and practices to avoid infection among the housewives studied was found. High risk practices for infection were identified. Strategies to improve toxoplasmosis-related knowledge and practices to avoid T. gondii infection and its sequelae in housewives are highly needed."
https://openalex.org/W2972666723,"Objective We assess healthcare provider collaboration and the impact on patient outcomes using social network analysis, a multi-scale community detection algorithm, and generalized estimating equations. Material and methods A longitudinal analysis of health claims data of a large employer over a 3 year period was performed to measure how provider relationships impact patient outcomes. The study cohort included 4,230 patients with 167 providers. Social network analysis with a multi-scale community detection algorithm was used to identify groups of healthcare providers more closely working together. Resulting measures of provider collaboration were: 1) degree, 2) betweenness, and 3) closeness centrality. The three patient outcome measures were 1) emergency department visit, 2) inpatient hospitalization, and 3) unplanned hospitalization. Relationships between provider collaboration and patient outcomes were assessed using generalized estimating equations. General practitioner, family practice, and internal medicine were labeled as primary care. Cardiovascular, endocrinologists, etc. were labeled as specialists, and providers such as radiology and social workers were labeled as others. Results Higher connectedness (degree) and higher access (closeness) to other providers in the community were significant for reducing inpatient hospitalization and emergency department visits. Patients of specialists (e.g. cardiovascular) and providers specified as others (e.g. social worker) had higher rate of hospitalization and emergency department visits compared to patients of primary care providers. Conclusion Application of social network analysis for developing healthcare provider networks can be leveraged by community detection algorithms and predictive modeling to identify providers’ network characteristics and their impacts on patient outcomes. The proposed framework presents multi-scale measures to assess characteristics of healthcare providers and their impact on patient outcomes. This approach can be used by implementation experts for informed decision-making regarding the design of insurance coverage plans, and wellness promotion programs. Health services researchers can use the study approach for assessment of provider collaboration and impacts on patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2972495852,"Background The public hospital governance reform in China is pledged to improve the governance of public hospitals and deliver affordable and high-quality care. However, progress in public hospital reform has been slow. The reason is poorly understood. Methods A research center affiliated with China National Health Commission has conducted 32 workshops to interview 124 public hospital administrators from 30 provincial-level administrative divisions and 105 various-level government officials from three provinces. About 80% of administrators and 78% officials actively participated the discussions. We used a descriptive theoretical approach to understand the relationships between the governance reform and characteristics of its stakeholders. We also analyzed stakeholder interests and their power to influence the reform. Findings About 66% of hospital administrators, 72% of health officials, and less than 10% of other officials support a new hospital governing structure. Local leadership, hospital administrators, and health commission said that administrators should have more power over the management of public hospitals. Other government departments and healthcare professionals had reservations on the governance reform. The reform of public hospital governance faces significant obstacles. The interests of most government stakeholders are not aligned with public interests. All stakeholders perceived that their workload would increase in the short term because of the governance reform of public hospitals. Most people involved in the reform are not incentivized to collaborate. The health commission has limited financial resources and insufficient political power to implement a massive reform. Most importantly, the public hospital reform is not, and likely will not be, a top policy priority to the central government or local leaderships. Interpretation The health commission needs more political support and resources to speed up the public hospital reform. To fulfill the pledge of affordable, equitable access to quality care, Chinese government needs to overcome significant obstacles in the public hospital reform."
https://openalex.org/W2972590135,"Highly sensitive and low-cost DNA agarose gel detection systems were developed using non-mutagenic and loading dye-type DNA-staining reagents. The DNA detection system that used Midori Green Direct and Safelook Load-Green, both with an optimum excitation wavelength at ~490 nm, could detect DNA-fragments at the same sensitivity to that of the UV (312 nm)-transilluminator system combined with ethidium bromide, after it was excited by a combination of cyan LED light and a shortpass filter (510 nm). The cyan LED system can be also applied to SYBR Safe that is widely used as a non-toxic dye for post-DNA-staining. Another DNA-detection system excited by black light was also developed. Black light used in this system had a peak emission at 360 nm and caused less damage to DNA due to lower energy of UV rays with longer wavelength when compared to those of short UV rays. Moreover, hardware costs of the black light system were ~$100, less than 1/10 of the commercially available UV (365 nm) transilluminator (>$1,000). EZ-Vision and Safelook Load-White can be used as non-mutagenic and loading dye-type DNA-staining reagents in this system. The black light system had a greater detection sensitivity for DNA fragments stained by EZ-Vision and Safelook Load-White compared with the commercially available imaging system using UV (365 nm) transilluminator."
https://openalex.org/W2973138868,"Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) induces developmental toxicity in offspring. However, the long-term harmful effects on bone development and the intrauterine programming mechanism attributed to PNE remain unclear. In the present research, pregnant Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with nicotine (2 mg/kg/d) to obtain and analyze bone samples from the fetal and adult offspring. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were treated with nicotine during osteogenic differentiation to clarify the related molecular mechanisms. The results indicated that PNE led to bone dysplasia in the fetuses and reduced bone mass in the adult offspring, which was mediated by the sustained activation of the local bone renin angiotensin system (RAS) and suppressed osteogenic differentiation before and after birth. In vitro, nicotine suppressed BMSCs' osteogenic function through promoting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression and activating RAS. Furthermore, nicotine induced histone acetylase p300 into the nuclei of the BMSCs by acting on the α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α4β2-nAChR), leading to the increased histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation level of ACE and RAS activation. Taken together, the sustained activation of local bone RAS mediated prenatal nicotine-induced osteopenia in adult offspring via the α4β2-nAChR-p300-ACE pathway.-Xiao, H., Wen, Y., Pan, Z., Shangguan, Y., Magdalou, J., Wang, H., Chen, L.

https://openalex.org/W2964645666,"Glucocorticoid (GC) stimulation has been shown to increase cardiac contractility by elevated intracellular [Ca] but the sources for Ca entry are unclear. This study aims to determine the role of store-operated Ca entry (SOCE) for GC-mediated inotropy.Dexamethasone (Dex) pretreatment significantly increased cardiac contractile force ex vivo in Langendorff-perfused Sprague-Dawley rat hearts (2 mg/kg BW i.p. Dex 24 h prior to experiment). Moreover, Ca transient amplitude as well as fractional shortening were significantly enhanced in Fura-2-loaded isolated rat ventricular myocytes exposed to Dex (1 mg/mL Dex, 24 h). Interestingly, these Dex-dependent effects could be abolished in the presence of SOCE-inhibitors SKF-96356 (SKF, 2 μM) and BTP2 (5 μM). Ca transient kinetics (time to peak, decay time) were not affected by SOCE stimulation. Direct SOCE measurements revealed a negligible magnitude in untreated myocytes but a dramatic increase in SOCE upon Dex-pretreatment. Importantly, the Dex-dependent stimulation of SOCE could be blocked by inhibition of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) using EMD638683 (EMD, 50 μM). Dex preincubation also resulted in increased mRNA expression of proteins involved in SOCE (stromal interaction molecule 2, STIM2, and transient receptor potential cation channels 3/6, TRPC 3/6), which were also prevented in the presence of EMD.Short-term GC-stimulation with Dex improves cardiac contractility by a SOCE-dependent mechanism, which appears to involve increased SGK1-dependent expression of the SOCE-related proteins. Since Ca transient kinetics were unaffected, SOCE appears to influence Ca cycling more by an integrated response across multiple cardiac cycles but not on a beat-to-beat basis."
https://openalex.org/W2972667725,"ToxR and TcpP, two winged helix-turn-helix (w-HTH) family transcription factors, co-activate expression of the toxT promoter in Vibrio cholerae. ToxT then directly regulates a number of genes required for virulence. In addition to co-activation of toxT, ToxR can directly activate the ompU promoter and repress the ompT promoter. Based on a previous study suggesting that certain wing residues of ToxR are preferentially involved in toxT co-activation compared to direct ompU activation, we employed alanine-scanning mutagenesis to determine which residues in the wing of ToxR are required for activation of each promoter. All of the ToxR wing residues tested that were critical for transcriptional activation of toxT and/or ompU were also critical for DNA binding. While some ToxR wing mutants had reduced interaction with TcpP, that reduced interaction did not correlate with a specific defect in toxT activation. Rather, such mutants also affected ompU activation and DNA binding. Based on these findings we conclude that the primary role of the wing of ToxR is to bind DNA, along with the DNA recognition helix of ToxR, and this function is required both for direct activation of ompU and co-activation of toxT."
https://openalex.org/W2972760050,"Over the last decades, the European hare (Lepus europaeus) has become the subject of many interdisciplinary studies due to the sharp Europe-wide population decline. In European hares, the first stage of life until weaning and the subsequent dispersal have been sparsely studied, in particular, habitat selection, movements and survival rate, as juveniles´ precocial lifestyle is dominated by concealment, motionlessness and inconspicuousness. In this study, free-living juvenile European hares (leverets) were detected systematically by thermography (n = 394), radio-tagged or marked (n = 122) from birth until the fifth week of life to research their habitat usage and pre-dispersal movements. The day-resting places and night locations, as well as the distance moved by leverets with aging, were evaluated by generalized linear mixed effect models. In addition, the habitat preference was assessed by a conservative use-availability analysis. Up to the fifth week of life, 30.5% of all leverets used cultivated areas in the daytime. In contrast, the remaining 69.4% animals inhabitated linear or small planar structures in the daytime, with the edges of field tracks, hedges and some ruderal structures clearly being preferred. At nighttime, 93% of all juveniles, which occupied linear structures in the daytime, used the adjoining fields up to 20 m away from the next linear structure. Nocturnal distances of more than 60 m to the next edge rarely occurred before the end of the pre-weaning phase. The time of day and age have a significant influence on the distance moved by juvenile hares. With increasing age, leverets moved less during the day and roamed further at night. The results are largely consistent with the behavioral patterns found in the few previous studies on pre-weaning European hares and show the importance of hiding places for leverets in early life stages. This study should contribute to a better understanding of behavior in juvenile life-history stages of European hares that may help to identify vulnerable phases in their lifecycle. In addition, the findings can refine existing population models and improve conservation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2971038603,"Objective To investigate the association between weight status and sexual activity in middle-aged and older adults. Methods Cross-sectional analysis on Wave 6 (2012/13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Data were from 2,200 men and 2,737 women aged ≥50 years (mean 68.2 years). The explanatory variable was weight status, defined as normal-weight (BMI: ≤24.9), overweight (BMI: 25.0–29.9) or obese (BMI: ≥30) based on objective measurements of height and weight. Outcome variables were any self-reported sexual activity in the last year (yes/no) and, if yes, frequency of sexual intercourse in the last month. Covariates included a range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables. Associations were analysed using binary (past-year sexual activity) and ordinal (frequency of past-month sexual intercourse) logistic regression models. Results The majority (73.3%) of men and half (50.0%) of women reported any sexual activity in the last year. The odds of reporting any sexual activity in the last year did not differ significantly by weight status in either men or women. However, among those who were sexually active, men with overweight (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.15–1.81, p = 0.002) or obesity (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.07–1.77, p = 0.015), and women with overweight (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.05–1.71, p = 0.017) reported significantly more frequent sexual intercourse in the last month compared with those who had a BMI in the normal-weight range, after adjustment for covariates. Conclusion Older adults with overweight or obesity who are sexually active engage in more frequent sexual activity than those who are normal weight."
https://openalex.org/W2972924445,"Background Little is known about the components and contributing factors of door-to-balloon time after implementation of Door-to-Balloon Alliance quality-improving (QI) strategies, including the impact of door-to-ECG time on door-to-balloon time. Objective We investigated whether modification of emergency department (ED) triage processes could improve door-to-ECG and door-to-balloon times after implementation of QI strategies. Methods This was a retrospective before-and-after study of a prospectively collected database. From June 2014 to October 2014, interventions were implemented in our ED, including a protocol-driven ECG initiation and moving an ECG station and technician to the triage area. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who received ECG within 10 min of arrival; the secondary outcome was the percentage of patients with door-to-balloon times of <90 min from arrival. Patients from the year pre- and post-QI initiative were defined as the control and intervention groups, respectively. Results Enrollment comprised 214 patients with STEMI: 109 before the intervention and 105 after the intervention. We analyzed the components of the door-to-balloon process and found the door-to-ECG process was the most critical interval of delay (20.8%). Unrecognized symptoms were the most common cause of delay in the door-to-ECG process resulting in a significant impact on the door-to-balloon time. The intervention group had a higher percentage of patients with door-to-ECG times <10 min than did the control group (93.3% vs. 79.8%, p = 0.005), with a corresponding improvement in door-to-balloon times <90 min (91.1% vs. 76.2%, p = 0.007). In subgroup analysis, the intervention benefits occurred only in non-transferred or walk-in patients. After adjustment for possible co-variates, the QI interventions remained a significant contributing factor for achieving the door-to-ECG and door-to-balloon targets. Conclusions The modification of ED triage processes through implementation of QI strategies are effective in achieving better door-to-ECG times and thus, achieving door-to-balloon times <90 min. In patients presenting with ambiguous symptoms, improved door-to ECG target achievement rates, through a protocol-driven and multidisciplinary approach allows for earlier identification of STEMI."

Neurological impairment in DCM is variable and can involve complex upper limb dysfunction including loss of manual dexterity, hyper-reflexia, focal weakness, and sensory impairment. DCM can cause progressive loss of manual dexterity, reduced upper limb (UL) function and disability. The purpose of this study was to define relationships between impairment and disability of the UL and determine the impact of duration of symptoms on disease severity.An observational cross-sectional study quantifying disease severity, UL impairment and disability at time of diagnosis was conducted. A second observational longitudinal cohort was studied at the time of diagnosis and 1 year later.Toronto Western Hospital, Spine Program.The cross sectional study included 140 study subjects diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe DCM. For the longitudinal study, 61 study subjects with mild DCM were enrolled and split into two groups, one group with less than 12 months of symptom duration and more than 12 months.Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Assessment (mJOA); Graded Redefined Assessment of Sensation, Strength and Prehension (GRASSP); Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH).Pearson correlation coefficients between GRASSP and QuickDASH revealed significant relationships between strength, sensation and dexterity for all patients to varying degrees. The covariate (mJOA) was significantly related to QuickDASH, indicating duration of symptoms has an important effect on UL disability in the mild severity group.Strength, sensation and dexterity play a defining role in disability of the UL across all severities of DCM and are discriminant measures. Duration of symptoms has a significant impact on self-perceived disability, where a longer duration in mild patients results in diminished disability, suggesting adaptation. Duration of symptoms is an important factor to consider in the treatment plan for patients with mild disease."

https://openalex.org/W2972817233,"Background The narrative surrounding the management of potentially resectable pancreatic cancer is complex. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment. However resection rates are low, the risk of operative morbidity and mortality are high, and survival outcomes remain poor. The aim of this study was to create a prognostic Bayesian network that pre-operatively makes personalized predictions of post-resection survival time of 12months or less and also performs post-operative prognostic updating. Methods A Bayesian network was created by synthesizing data from PubMed post-resection survival analysis studies through a two-stage weighting process. Input variables included: inflammatory markers, tumour factors, tumour markers, patient factors and, if applicable, response to neoadjuvant treatment for pre-operative predictions. Prognostic updating was performed by inclusion of post-operative input variables including: pathology results and adjuvant therapy. Results 77 studies (n = 31,214) were used to create the Bayesian network, which was validated against a prospectively maintained tertiary referral centre database (n = 387). For pre-operative predictions an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.7 (P value: 0.001; 95% CI 0.589–0.801) was achieved accepting up to 4 missing data-points in the dataset. For prognostic updating an AUC 0.8 (P value: 0.000; 95% CI:0.710–0.870) was achieved when validated against a dataset with up to 6 missing pre-operative, and 0 missing post-operative data-points. This dropped to AUC: 0.7 (P value: 0.000; 95% CI:0.667–0.818) when the post-operative validation dataset had up to 2 missing data-points. Conclusion This Bayesian network is currently unique in the way it utilizes PubMed and patient level data to translate the existing empirical evidence surrounding potentially resectable pancreatic cancer to make personalized prognostic predictions. We believe such a tool is vital in facilitating better shared decision-making in clinical practice and could be further developed to offer a vehicle for delivering personalized precision medicine in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2972838574,"Background Limited data existed exclusively describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineage 3 (MTB-L3), sub-lineages, and clinical manifestations in Kampala, Uganda. This study sought to elucidate the circulating MTB-L3 sub-lineages and their corresponding clinical phenotypes. Method A total of 141 M. tuberculosis isolates were identified as M. tuberculosis lineage 3 using Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker analysis method. To ascertain the sub-lineages/sub-strains within the M. tuberculosis lineage 3, the direct repeat (DR) loci for all the isolates was examined for sub-lineage specific signatures as described in the SITVIT2 database. The infecting sub-strains were matched with patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics to identify any possible association. Result The data showed 3 sub-lineages circulating with CAS 1 Delhi accounting for 55% (77/141), followed by CAS 1-Kili 16% (22/141) and CAS 2/CAS 8% (12/141). Remaining isolates 21% (30/141) were unclassifiable. To explore whether the sub-lineages differ in their ability to cause increased severe disease, we used extent of lung involvement as a proxy for severe disease. Multivariable analysis showed no association between M. tuberculosis lineage 3 sub-lineages with severe disease. The risk factors associated with severe disease include having a positive smear (OR = 9.384; CI 95% = 2.603–33.835), HIV (OR = 0.316; CI 95% = 0.114–0.876), lymphadenitis (OR = 0. 171; CI 95% = 0.034–0.856) and a BCG scar (OR = 0.295; CI 95% = 0.102–0.854). Conclusion In Kampala, Uganda, there are three sub-lineages of M. tuberculosis lineage 3 that cause disease of comparable severity with CAS-Dehli as the most prevalent. Having HIV, lymphadenitis, a BCG scar and a smear negative status is associated with reduced severe disease."

https://openalex.org/W2973196051,"Background The combined impact of multiple healthy behaviors on health exceeds that of single behaviors. This study aimed to estimate trends in the prevalence of a healthy lifestyle among adults in Germany. Methods A data set of 18,058 adults aged 25–69 years from three population-based national health examination surveys 1990–92, 1997–99 and 2008–11 with complete information for five healthy behavior factors was used. A ‘daily intake of both fruits and vegetables, ‘sufficient physical exercise’, ‘no current smoking’ and ‘no current risk drinking’ were assessed with self-reports and ‘normal body weight’ was calculated based on measured body weight and height. A dichotomous ‘healthy lifestyle’ indicator was defined as meeting at least four out of five healthy behaviors. Age-standardized prevalence was calculated stratified by sex, age groups (25–34, 35–44, 45–54 and 55–69 years) and education level (low, medium and high). Trends were expressed in relative change (RC) between 1990–92 and 2008–11. Results In Germany, the overall prevalence of healthy lifestyle increased from 9.3% in 1990–92 to 13.5% in 1997–99 and to 14.7% in 2008–11 (RC: +58.1%). The prevalence increased among men and women and in all age groups, with the exception of men aged 45–54 years. The RC of increasing healthy lifestyle prevalence between 1990–92 and 2008–11 was stronger albeit on a higher level among women compared to men. Therefore, the gender difference in healthy lifestyle has increased, but age-related differences have overall decreased in this period. Among high educated men the prevalence of a healthy lifestyle increased between 1990–92 and 2008–11 from 10.6% to 16.3% (p = 0.01) and among high educated women from 16.4% to 30.3% and also among medium educated women (10.9 to 16.6, p<0.01), but no significant increase in healthy lifestyle prevalence was observed among men with low and medium education and among women with low education level. Conclusions The prevalence of a lifestyle with at least four out of five healthy behaviors markedly increased from 1990–92 to 2008–11. Nevertheless, additional health promotion interventions are needed to improve the number of combined healthy behavior factors and the awareness in the population that each additional healthy behavior factor leads to a further improvement in health, especially in men in the age-range 45 to 54 years, and among persons with low education level."
https://openalex.org/W2972324089,"Background Rabies is a devastating zoonotic disease of mammals that causes encephalitis and death. It is endemic in India, with an estimated annual 20,000 human deaths (one-third of the global rabies burden). The magnitude of animal rabies incidence is unknown. Methods In four sub-districts of Punjab, India, we monitored canine and livestock populations from August 15, 2016 to August 14, 2017. Demographic, clinical and rabies diagnostic laboratory (RDL) data were collected from suspected cases of rabies. The annual incidence rate / 10,000 animal years at risk (95% CI) in each sub-district was estimated for each species. Results During 2016–2017, a total of 41 suspected rabies cases were detected in the four selected sub-districts in Punjab. Laboratory confirmed rabies (LCR) incidence was 2.03/10,000 dog years (0.69, 5.96) and 2.71/10,000 dog years (1.14, 6.43) in stray and pet dogs, respectively. The LCR incidence in farmed buffalo and cattle was 0.19/10,000 buffalo years (0.07, 0.57) and 0.23/10,000 cattle years (0.06, 0.88), respectively. The LCR incidence amongst equine was 4.28/10,000 equine years (0.48, 38.10). Stray cattle rabies incidence in the selected sub-districts was 9.49/10,000 cattle years (3.51, 25.67). If similar enhanced surveillance for rabies was conducted state-wide, we estimate that 98 (34–294) buffalo, 18 (2–156) equine, 56 (15–214) farmed cattle, 96 (35–259) stray cattle, 128 (54–303) pet dogs and 62 (21–182) stray dogs would be expected to be confirmed with rabies in Punjab annually. Conclusion These results indicate that rabies incidence in animals, particularly in dogs and stray cattle, is much higher than previously suspected. We recommend that statewide enhanced disease surveillance should be conducted to obtain more accurate estimates of rabies incidence in Punjab to facilitate better control of this important disease."

It has been hypothesized that a subscale (items 3, 4, 5) may detect anxiety. The aim of this study is to assess whether this EPDS anxiety subscale is present in a community-based dataset, and if so, to assess its validity and stability during the first six months postpartum. Methods We obtained EPDS data of a community sample of 1612 women at 1 month, with follow-up at 3 and 6 months, postpartum (Post-Up study). We performed an exploratory factor analysis on the EPDS forcing two- and three-factor solutions. We assessed the correlations of the extracted factor subscales and the total EPDS with the short-form of the STAI (STAI-6). We examined the stability of the identified factors by means of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using the EPDS data collected at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Results Both the two- and three-factor solutions contained a hypothesized anxiety subscale of items 3,4,5,10, and fitted well with the 3- and 6-months EPDS data, with CFI and TLI values >.99 and RMSEA and SRMR values < .035 and < .45. The subscale’s Pearson correlations with the STAI-6 were moderate: .516, compared to .643 for the total EPDS. Conclusions The factor structure of the EPDS is stable across the first six months postpartum, and includes the subscale assumed to represent anxiety. However, this subscale as well as the total EPDS correlate only moderately with anxiety criteria. Using the EPDS thus does not imply adequate screening for anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2972543356,"The mechanism by which G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) signaling amplifies glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is unknown. We examined whether a GPR40 agonist, GW9508, could stimulate conventional and novel isoforms of PKC at two glucose concentrations (3 mM and 20 mM) in INS-1D cells.Using epifluorescence microscopy, we monitored relative changes in the cytosolic fluorescence intensity of Fura2 as a marker of change in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and relative increases in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS-GFP) as a marker of PKC activation in response to GW9508 at 3 mM and 20 mM glucose. To assess the activation of the two PKC isoforms, relative increases in membrane fluorescence intensity of PKCα-GFP and PKCε-GFP were measured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Specific inhibitors of each PKC isotype were constructed and synthesized as peptide fusions with the third α-helix of the homeodomain of Antennapedia.At 3 mM glucose, GW9508 induced sustained MARCKS-GFP translocation to the cytosol, irrespective of changes in [Ca2+]i. At 20 mM glucose, GW9508 induced sustained MARCKS-GFP translocation but also transient translocation that followed sharp increases in [Ca2+]i. Although PKCα translocation was rarely observed, PKCε translocation to the plasma membrane was sustained by GW9508 at 3 mM glucose. At 20 mM glucose, GW9508 induced transient translocation of PKCα and sustained translocation as well as transient translocation of PKCε. While the inhibitors (75 μM) of each PKC isotype reduced GW9508-potentiated, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1D cells, the PKCε inhibitor had a more potent effect.GW9508 activated PKCε but not PKCα at a substimulatory concentration of glucose. Both PKC isotypes were activated at a stimulatory concentration of glucose and contributed to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulin-producing cells."

This obstacle often is compounded by the tight clustering of homologous genes, which precludes the generation of multigene-deficient animals through standard interbreeding of single-deficient animals. Here, we describe an iterative, multiplexed CRISPR-based approach for simultaneous gene editing in the complex seven-member human airway trypsin-like protease/differentially expressed in a squamous cell carcinoma (HAT/DESC) cluster of membrane-anchored serine proteases. Through four cycles of targeting, we generated a library of 18 unique congenic mouse strains lacking combinations of HAT/DESC proteases, including a mouse strain deficient in all seven proteases. Using this library, we demonstrate that HAT/DESC proteases are dispensable for term development, postnatal health, and fertility and that the recently described function of the HAT-like 4 protease in epidermal barrier formation is unique among all HAT/DESC proteases. The study demonstrates the potential of iterative, multiplexed CRISPR-mediated gene editing for functional analysis of multigene clusters, and it provides a large array of new congenic mouse strains for the study of HAT/DESC proteases in physiological and in pathophysiological processes.

https://openalex.org/W2971733059,"Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) is a major crop that is widely cultivated, especially in Korea, Japan, and China. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology, the cost and time required for sequencing have decreased and the development of genome research accelerated. Genome sequencing of Chinese cabbage was completed in 2011 using the variety Chiifu-401-42, and since then the genome has been continuously updated. In the present study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of Chinese cabbage inbred line CT001, a line widely used in traditional or molecular breeding, to improve the accuracy of genetic polymorphism analysis. The constructed CT001 pseudomolecule represented 85.4% (219.8 Mb) of the Chiifu reference genome, and a total of 38,567 gene models were annotated using RNA-Seq analysis. In addition, the spontaneous mutation rate of CT001 was estimated by resequencing DNA obtained from individual plants after sexual propagation for six generations to estimate the naturally occurring variations. The CT001 pseudomolecule constructed in this study will provide valuable resources for genomic studies on Chinese cabbage."
https://openalex.org/W2972607117,"Of the fast ionotropic synapses, glycinergic synapses are the least well understood, but are vital for the maintenance of inhibitory signaling in the brain and spinal cord. Glycinergic signaling comprises half of the inhibitory signaling in the spinal cord, and glycinergic synapses are likely to regulate local nociceptive processing as well as the transmission to the brain of peripheral nociceptive information. Here we have investigated the rapid and prolonged potentiation of glycinergic synapses in the superficial dorsal horn of young male and female mice after brief activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked with lamina II-III stimulation in identified GABAergic neurons in lamina II were potentiated by bath-applied Zn2+ and were depressed by the prostaglandin PGE2, consistent with the presence of both GlyRα1- and GlyRα3-containing receptors. NMDA application rapidly potentiated synaptic glycinergic currents. Whole-cell currents evoked by exogenous glycine were also readily potentiated by NMDA, indicating that the potentiation results from altered numbers or conductance of postsynaptic glycine receptors. Repetitive depolarization alone of the postsynaptic GABAergic neuron also potentiated glycinergic synapses, and intracellular EGTA prevented both NMDA-induced and depolarization-induced potentiation of glycinergic IPSCs. Optogenetic activation of trpv1 lineage afferents also triggered NMDAR-dependent potentiation of glycinergic synapses. Our results suggest that during peripheral injury or inflammation, nociceptor firing during injury is likely to potentiate glycinergic synapses on GABAergic neurons. This disinhibition mechanism may be engaged rapidly, altering dorsal horn circuitry to promote the transmission of nociceptive information to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2972730724,"Personal control relies on the expectation that events are contingent upon one's own behavior. A common 'inconsistency compensation approach' posits that a violation of expectancies in social interaction triggers aversive arousal and compensatory effort. Following this approach, we tested the hypothesis that interventions affecting participants' decisions violate the expected personal control. In a modified version of the established cyberball paradigm, participants were not excluded, but consistently included. However, their decisions regarding the recipient of a ball throw in the virtual game were occasionally overruled (expectancy violation). We hypothesized that this intervention will trigger a P3 response in event-related brain potentials (ERP). Since this component is related to subjective expectancies, its amplitude was assumed to depend on the frequency of interventions (independent factor: loss of control). Further, we manipulated the vertical position of the participants' avatar on the computer screen (independent factor: verticality). Building on research showing that verticality is related to the self-assigned power and influences the expected level of control, we hypothesized that the ERP effects of intervention should be more pronounced for participants with avatars in superior position. As predicted, both experimental factors interactively affected the expression of the ERP response: In case of low intervention frequency, P3 amplitudes were significantly pronounced if the participants' avatar was positioned above as compared to below co-players (high > low self-assigned power). The effect of verticality could be traced back to a lack of adaptation of P3 amplitudes to recurring aversive events. By demonstrating that loss of control triggers ERP effects corresponding to those triggered by social exclusion, this study provides further evidence for a common cognitive mechanism in reactions to aversive events based on an inconsistency in expectancy states."
https://openalex.org/W2972741815,"To evaluate the long-term performance of the SonRtip atrial lead.To optimize atrioventricular and interventricular timing and thereby potentially improving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) responder rates, a lead integrated technology and a cardioverter/defibrillator-based algorithm measuring peak endocardial acceleration have been introduced. Long-term performance of the atrial lead (SonRtip PS55D, Sorin/MicroPort CRM, Italy) embedded with such a sensor has not been reported so far.Between 2012 and 2018, 143 patients underwent implantation of the SonRtip atrial lead in four Austrian medical centers. Conventional bipolar atrial leads implanted during the same period in 526 patients receiving CRT were used as control cohort.Among 669 patients included in the study, 10 (1.5%) showed increased atrial pacing thresholds and/or decreased atrial sensing amplitudes and/or sudden increase in atrial lead impedance (above 3000 Ω) after an uneventful early postoperative period. Seven (70%) of the malfunctioning leads were SonRtip leads (p <0.001). Lead replacement was needed in 4.2% of SonRtip leads (six out of 143) and in 0.38% of all other conventional atrial leads (two out of 526) (p <0.001). Because of unaltered atrial sensing properties, a wait and see strategy was chosen in two patients-one of them with a SonRtip lead. The implanted atrial lead in the latter person experienced a sudden increase in pacing threshold (4V/0.35ms).While short-term safety and stable technical performance of the SonRtip atrial lead could be confirmed, our study found an unexpectedly high malfunction rate over a longer follow-up period."
https://openalex.org/W2972860291,"In Southeast Asia, primary tropical rainforests are usually dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees belonging to Dipterocarpaceae, although arbuscular mycorrhizal trees often outcompete them after disturbances such as forest fires and clear-cutting, thus preventing dipterocarp regeneration. In some secondary tropical forests, however, potentially ECM trees belonging to Tristaniopsis (Myrtaceae) become dominant and may help ECM dipterocarp forests to recover. However, we have no information about their mycorrhizal status in these settings. In this study, we analyzed ECM fungal communities in tropical secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis and investigated which ECM fungal species are shared with other tropical or temperate areas. In total, 100 samples were collected from four secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis on Bangka Island. ECM tips in the soil samples were subjected to molecular analyses to identify both ECM and host species. Based on a >97% ITS sequence similarity threshold, we identified 56 ECM fungal species dominated by Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, and Clavulinaceae. Some of the ECM fungal species were shared between dominant Tristaniopsis and coexisting Eucalyptus or Quercus trees, including 5 common to ECM fungi recorded in a primary mixed dipterocarp forest at Lambir Hill, Malaysia. In contrast, no ECM fungal species were shared with other geographical regions, even with Tristaniopsis in New Caledonia. These results imply that secondary tropical forests dominated by Tristaniopsis harbor diverse ECM fungi, including those that inhabit primary dipterocarp forests in the same geographical region. They may function as refugia for ECM fungi, given that dipterocarp forests are disappearing quickly due to human activity."
https://openalex.org/W2972732533,"Background Previous studies showed that troponin blood levels may increase after exercise. In this study we assessed whether, among patients admitted with suspected unstable angina, the increase in high-sensitive troponin T (hs-TnT) levels after exercise stress test (EST) might help identify those with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and predict symptom recurrence during short term follow-up. Methods Maximal treadmill EST was performed in 69 consecutive patients admitted to the emergency room with a suspicion of unstable angina (acute chest pain but confirmed normal serum levels of cardiac troponins) was measured before and 4 hours after EST. Coronary angiography was performed in 22 patients (32.8%). Results hs-TnT increased after EST compared to baseline in the whole population (from 0.84±0.65 to 1.17±0.87 ng/dL, p<0.001). The increase was similar in patients with positive (n = 14) and negative (n = 55) EST (p = 0.72), and was also similar in patients with (n = 12) and without (n = 10) obstructive CAD at angiography (p = 0.91). The achievement of a heart rate at peak EST ≥85% of that predicted for age was the variable mainly associated with the post-EST hs-TnT increase at multivariable linear regression analysis (p = 0.005). The change after EST of hs-TnT did not predict the recurrence of symptoms or readmission for chest pain at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions Our data show that hs-TnT increased after EST in patients with suspected unstable angina, which seemed largely independent of most clinical and laboratory variables. Thus, hs-TnT assessed after EST does not seem to be helpful to identify patients with obstructive CAD in this kind of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2972763469,"In order to survive and function in the world, we must understand the content of our environment. This requires us to gather and parse complex, sometimes conflicting, information. Yet, the brain is capable of translating sensory stimuli from disparate modalities into a cohesive and accurate percept with little conscious effort. Previous studies of multisensory integration have suggested that the brain's integration of cues is well-approximated by an ideal observer implementing Bayesian causal inference. However, behavioral data from tasks that include only one stimulus in each modality fail to capture what is in nature a complex process. Here we employed an auditory spatial discrimination task in which listeners were asked to determine on which side they heard one of two concurrently presented sounds. We compared two visual conditions in which task-uninformative shapes were presented in the center of the screen, or spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli. We found that performance on the auditory task improved when the visual stimuli were spatially aligned with the auditory stimuli-even though the shapes provided no information about which side the auditory target was on. We also demonstrate that a model of a Bayesian ideal observer performing causal inference cannot explain this improvement, demonstrating that humans deviate systematically from the ideal observer model."
https://openalex.org/W2972828023,"Comparing the efficacy of inhaled antibiotics can be difficult in small groups of patients with cystic fibrosis and mild lung disease. In a feasibility study we compared Aztreonam lysine for inhalation solution (AZLI; Cayston®) to standard inhaled antibiotic therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis and near normal spirometry. To detect treatment responses we used both lung clearance index (LCI) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). At baseline, median FEV1 was 87% pred. and median LCI was 8.6 (upper limit of normal: 7.0). After 4 weeks, LCI improved by -0.36 after AZLI and deteriorated by +0.12 after tobramycin treatment (p = 0.039). No significant differences between treatments (p = 0.195) were observed using FEV1. These results suggest that lung clearance index can be used to detect treatment induced changes in subjects with mild lung disease."
