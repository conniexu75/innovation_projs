https://openalex.org/W1981118566,"Multispectral images of the basaltic surface of Venus obtained by Venera 13 were processed to remove the effects of orange-colored incident radiation resulting from interactions with the thick Venusian atmosphere. At visible wavelengths the surface of Venus appears dark and without significant color. High-temperature laboratory reflectance spectra of basaltic materials indicate that these results are consistent with mineral assemblages bearing either ferric or ferrous iron. A high reflectance in the near-infrared region observed at neighboring Venera 9 and 10 sites, however, suggests that the basaltic surface material contains ferric minerals and thus may be relatively oxidized."

https://openalex.org/W2062822302,Phosphorescence spectra of solutions frozen and at low temperatures (77 degrees K) possess more characteristic structure and detail than fluorescence spectra. They contain no background due to scattering of the exciting radiation. Thus greater analytical specificity and sensitivity are obtained. Some indole derivatives indistinguishable by spectrofluorimetry are easily differentiated by spectrophosphorimetry.

These algorithms represent a departure from the usual philosophy inherent in the study of many-body problems and have a number of significant features. Chief among these features are simplicity, weak dependence on dimensionality, and ease of transition between classical and quantum-mechanical descriptions. These methods are also readily adapted for use on massively paraliel computer architectures. These new stochastic methods represent a valuable addition to the tools available for the analysis of both equilibrium and time-dependent many-body problems."

https://openalex.org/W1969160085,Present commercial rigid foams are based on polyester raw materials. It has now been demonstrated that certain hydroxyl-terminated polyethers can be used satisfactorily as a major component of rigid urethane foams. These polyethers are hexafunctional materials prepared by reacting propylene oxide with sorbitol.
