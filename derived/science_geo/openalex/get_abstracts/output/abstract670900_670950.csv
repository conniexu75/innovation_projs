https://openalex.org/W3139113772,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis that has changed the life of millions globally. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the pandemic on mental health and quality of life among the general population in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. A total of 6142 adults from eighteen countries within the MENA region completed an online questionnaire between May and June 2020. Psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the social and family support impact was assessed with questions from the Perceived Support Scale (PSS). The IES-R mean score was 29.3 (SD = 14.8), corresponding to mild stressful impact with 30.9% reporting severe psychological impact. Most participants (45%–62%) felt horrified, apprehensive, or helpless due to COVID-19. Furthermore, over 40% reported increased stress from work and financial matters. Higher IES-R scores were found among females, participants aged 26–35 years, those with lower educational level, and participants residing in the North Africa region ( p &lt;0.005). About 42% reported receiving increased support from family members, 40.5% were paying more attention to their mental health, and over 40% reported spending more time resting since the pandemic started. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild psychological impact while it also encouraged some positive impact on family support and mental health awareness among adults in the MENA region. Clinical interventions targeted towards vulnerable groups such as females and younger adults are needed."

This study aimed to measure the level of mental health of the Malaysian public approximately 2 months after the pandemic’s onset. Between 12 May and 5 September 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. The target group included all members of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to assess mental health. There were increased depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms throughout the study period, with the depression rates showing the greatest increase. During the end of the data collection period (4 August–5 September 2020), there were high percentages of reported depressive (59.2%) and anxiety (55.1%) symptoms compared with stress (30.6%) symptoms. Perceived health status was the strongest significant predictor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. Individuals with a poorer health perception had higher odds of developing depression (odds ratio [OR] = 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.81–8.47) and anxiety (OR = 3.50; 95%CI 2.37–5.17) compared with those with a higher health perception. By demographics, young people–particularly students, females and people with poor financial conditions–were more vulnerable to mental health symptoms. These findings provide an urgent call for increased attention to detect and provide intervention strategies to combat the increasing rate of mental health problems in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3138954194,"The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel Betacoronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became a public health emergency worldwide. Few reports indicate that owned pets from households with at least one human resident that was diagnosed with COVID-19 can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 of pets from households with no COVID-19 cases or stray animals remains less assessed. Using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT 90 ), we investigated the infection and previous exposure of dogs and cats to SARS-CoV-2 during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June to August 2020, 96 animals were sampled, including 49 cats (40 owned and 9 stray) and 47 dogs (42 owned and 5 stray). Regarding owned pets, 75.6% (62/82) belonged to households with no COVID-19 cases. Samples included serum, and rectal and oropharyngeal swabs. All swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but serum samples of a stray cat and a stray dog presented neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, with PRNT 90 titer of 80 and 40, respectively. Serological data presented here suggest that not only owned pets from households with COVID19 cases, but also stray animals are being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3137026576,"Bariatric surgery in patients with obesity is generally considered to reduce cancer risk in patients with obesity. However, for colorectal cancer some studies report an increased risk with bariatric surgery, whereas others report a decreased risk. These conflicting results demonstrate the need of more long-term studies analyzing the effect of bariatric surgery on colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, data from the Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01479452, was used to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on long-term incidence of colorectal cancer. The SOS study includes 2007 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and 2040 contemporaneously matched controls who received conventional obesity treatment. Patients in the surgery group underwent gastric bypass (n = 266), banding (n = 376) or vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 1365). Information on colorectal cancer events was obtained from the Swedish National Cancer Registry. Median follow-up was 22.2 years (inter-quartile range 18.3–25.2). During follow up there were 58 colorectal cancer events in the surgery group and 67 colorectal cancer events in the matched control group with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.79 (95% CI:0.55–1.12; p = 0.183). After adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking status, and diabetes, the adjusted HR was 0.89 (95% CI:0.62–1.29; p = 0.551). When analyzing rectal cancer events separately- 19 events in the surgery group and 31 events in the control group-a decreased risk of rectal cancer with surgery was observed (HR = 0.56; 95% CI:0.32–0.99; p = 0.045, adjusted HR = 0.61 (95% CI:0.34–1.10; p = 0.099), while the risk of colon cancer was unchanged. To conclude- in this long-term, prospective study, bariatric surgery was not associated with altered colorectal cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W3138686467,"We report onset, course, correlations with comorbidities, and diagnostic accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab in 539 individuals suspected to carry SARS-COV-2 admitted to the hospital of Crema, Italy. All individuals underwent clinical and laboratory exams, SARS-COV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab, and chest X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT). Data on onset, course, comorbidities, number of drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (sartans), follow-up swab, pharmacological treatments, non-invasive respiratory support, ICU admission, and deaths were recorded. Among 411 SARS-COV-2 patients (67.7% males) median age was 70.8 years (range 5–99). Chest CT was performed in 317 (77.2%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 304 (96%). Fatality rate was 17.5% (74% males), with 6.6% in 60–69 years old, 21.1% in 70–79 years old, 38.8% in 80–89 years old, and 83.3% above 90 years. No death occurred below 60 years. Non-invasive respiratory support rate was 27.2% and ICU admission 6.8%. Charlson comorbidity index and high C-reactive protein at admission were significantly associated with death. Use of ACE inhibitors or sartans was not associated with outcomes. Among 128 swab negative patients at admission (63.3% males) median age was 67.7 years (range 1–98). Chest CT was performed in 87 (68%) and showed interstitial pneumonia in 76 (87.3%). Follow-up swab turned positive in 13 of 32 patients. Using chest CT at admission as gold standard on the entire study population of 539 patients, nasopharyngeal swab had 80% accuracy. Comorbidity network analysis revealed a more homogenous distribution 60–40 aged SARS-COV-2 patients across diseases and a crucial different interplay of diseases in the networks of deceased and survived patients. SARS-CoV-2 caused high mortality among patients older than 60 years and correlated with pre-existing multiorgan impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3139103154,"Background COVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed, yet optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the anticipated underlying disease prevalence. We model various combinations of key variables to identify and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses. Methods We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model, modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, symptom checking, and test cost on outcomes including case reduction and false positives. Findings Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test) reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day costs as low as $1.32. Interpretation A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with minimal loss of model performance."
https://openalex.org/W3138198416,"Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner, 1897) and Melanaphis sorghi (Theobald, 1904) are major worldwide crop pests causing direct feeding damage on sorghum and transmitting viruses to sugarcane. It is common in the scientific literature to consider these two species as synonyms, referred to as the ‘sugarcane aphid’, although no formal study has validated this synonymy. In this study, based on the comparison of samples collected from their whole distribution area, we use both morphometric and molecular data to better characterize the discrimination between M . sacchari and M . sorghi . An unsupervised multivariate analysis of morphometric data clearly confirmed the separation of the two species. The best discriminating characters separating these species were length of the antenna processus terminalis relative to length of hind tibia, siphunculus or cauda. However, those criteria sometimes do not allow an unambiguous identification. Bayesian clustering based on microsatellite data delimited two clusters, which corresponded to the morphological species separation. The DNA sequencing of three nuclear and three mitochondrial regions revealed slight divergence between species. In particular, the COI barcode region proved to be uninformative for species separation because one haplotype is shared by both species. In contrast, one SNP located on the nuclear EF1-α gene was diagnostic for species separation. Based on morphological and molecular evidence, the invasive genotype damaging to sorghum in the US, Mexico and the Caribbean since 2013 is found to be M . sorghi ."
https://openalex.org/W3136819235,"In recent years, the observed antibody sequence space has grown exponentially due to advances in high-throughput sequencing of immune receptors. The rise in sequences has not been mirrored by a rise in structures, as experimental structure determination techniques have remained low-throughput. Computational modeling, however, has the potential to close the sequence–structure gap. To achieve this goal, computational methods must be robust, fast, easy to use, and accurate. Here we report on the latest advances made in RosettaAntibody and Rosetta SnugDock—methods for antibody structure prediction and antibody–antigen docking. We simplified the user interface, expanded and automated the template database, generalized the kinematics of antibody–antigen docking (which enabled modeling of single-domain antibodies) and incorporated new loop modeling techniques. To evaluate the effects of our updates on modeling accuracy, we developed rigorous tests under a new scientific benchmarking framework within Rosetta. Benchmarking revealed that more structurally similar templates could be identified in the updated database and that SnugDock broadened its applicability without losing accuracy. However, there are further advances to be made, including increasing the accuracy and speed of CDR-H3 loop modeling, before computational approaches can accurately model any antibody."
https://openalex.org/W3137298421,"Objectives Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by maladaptive behaviors, amongst which hyperphagia is a life-long concern for individuals with PWS and their caregivers. The current study examined the contribution of hyperphagia and other factors to caregiver burden across lifespan, in 204 caregivers of individuals with PWS living in the US, using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and the hyperphagia questionnaire (HQ-CT). Results We found a strong relationship between ZBI and HQ-CT especially in individuals with PWS older than 4 y and showed that HQ-CT scores of individuals with PWS is positively correlated with ZBI scores of their caregivers. The weight status of individuals with PWS was not associated with HQ-CT and ZBI scores, except for obese individuals who had significantly higher HQ-CT scores when compared to normal weight PWS individuals. We looked at PWS symptoms and care-related issues that impacted individuals and caregivers the most. We found that care-related tasks had the biggest negative impact on caregivers of children aged 0–4 y, whereas anxiety, temper tantrums, and oppositional behaviors of older individuals with PWS had the biggest impact on their caregivers concomitant with their high caregiver burden. Finally, we assessed the variability of HQ-CT and ZBI over 6 months in a subgroup of 83 participants. Overall, neither measure differed between 6 months and baseline. Most individual’s absolute HQ-CT score changes were between 0–2 units, whereas absolute ZBI score changes were between 0–6 points. Changes in the caregiver’s or individual’s life had little or no effect on HQ-CT and ZBI scores. Conclusions This study demonstrates a relationship between hyperphagia and caregiver burden and sheds light on predominant symptoms in children and adolescents that likely underly PWS caregiver burden. The stability and relationship between HQ-CT and ZBI support ZBI as an additional outcome measure in PWS clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3137376460,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a global effect on people’s lifestyles. Many people have become physically inactive and developed irregular eating patterns, which leads to unhealthier lifestyles and aggravation of lifestyle-related diseases; these in turn increase the severity of COVID-19. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a smartphone application called “Taberhythm” to investigate eating patterns, physical activity, and subjective feelings of happiness. We aimed to compare lifestyle data before and during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to objectively assess lifestyle changes during quarantine. A total of 464 smartphone users (346 women, 35 ± 12 years old, body mass index [BMI] 23.4 ± 4.5) participated in Period A (January 7 to April 28, 2019) and 622 smartphone users (533 women, 32 ± 11 years old, BMI 23.3 ± 4.0) participated in Period B (January 6 to April 26, 2020). Compared with Period A, there was a sharp decline in physical activity during Period B (4642 ± 3513 vs. 3814 ± 3529 steps/day, p&lt;0.001), especially during the final 9 weeks in both periods (4907 ± 3908 vs. 3528 ± 3397 steps/day, p&lt;0.001); however, there were large variations in physical activity among participants. We found a surprising trend during Period B toward increased happiness among women aged 30–50 years, the group most affected by stay-at-home policies that led to working from home and school closure. Moreover, daily eating duration declined in this population. Additionally, there was a positive association of happiness with steps per day in Period B (ρ = 0.38, p = 0.02). Despite the many negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subjective feelings of happiness among middle-aged Japanese women tended to increase, which indicates that some favorable lifestyle changes that could be adopted during quarantine in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3138927063,"Previous studies have reported that early hospital arrival improves clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke; however, whether early arrival is associated with favorable outcomes regardless of reperfusion therapy and the type of stroke onset time is unclear. Thus, we investigated the impact of onset-to-door time on outcomes and evaluated the predictors of pre-hospital delay after ischemic stroke.Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients who arrived at the hospital within five days of onset from September 2019 to May 2020 were selected from the prospective stroke registries of Seoul National University Hospital and Chung-Ang University Hospital of Seoul, Korea. Patients were divided into early (onset-to-door time, ≤4.5 h) and late (>4.5 h) arrivers. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the effect of early arrival on clinical outcomes and predictors of late arrival.Among the 539 patients, 28.4% arrived early and 71.6% arrived late. Early hospital arrival was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (three-month modified Rankin Scale [mRS]: 0-2, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.03, 95% confidence interval: [CI] 1.04-3.96) regardless of various confounders, including receiving reperfusion therapy and type of stroke onset time. Furthermore, a lower initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (aOR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90-0.97), greater pre-stroke mRS score (aOR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.18-2.13), female sex (aOR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.14-2.58), unclear onset time, and ≤6 years of schooling (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03-3.00 compared to >12 years of schooling) were independent predictors of late arrival.Thus, the onset-to-door time of≤4.5 h is crucial for better clinical outcome, and lower NIHSS score, greater pre-stroke mRS score, female sex, unclear onset times, and ≤6 years of schooling were independent predictors of late arrival. Therefore, educating about the importance of early hospital arrival after acute ischemic stroke should be emphasized. More strategic efforts are needed to reduce the prehospital delay by understanding the predictors of late arrival."
https://openalex.org/W3130787125,"Characterization of metabolites and microbiota composition from human stool provides powerful insight into the molecular phenotypic difference between subjects with normal weight and those with overweight/obesity. The aim of this study was to identify potential metabolic and bacterial signatures from stool that distinguish the overweight/obesity state in children/adolescents. Using 1 H NMR spectral analysis and 16S rRNA gene profiling, the fecal metabolic profile and bacterial composition from 52 children aged 7 to 16 was evaluated. The children were classified into three groups (16 with normal-weight, 17 with overweight, 19 with obesity). The metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) among the study groups based on one-way ANOVA testing: arabinose, butyrate, galactose, and trimethylamine. Significantly different (p &lt; 0.01) genus-level taxa based on edgeR differential abundance tests were genus Escherichia and Tyzzerella subgroup 3. No significant difference in alpha-diversity was detected among the three study groups, and no significant correlations were found between the significant taxa and metabolites. The findings support the hypothesis of increased energy harvest in obesity by human gut bacteria through the growing observation of increased fecal butyrate in children with overweight/obesity, as well as an increase of certain monosaccharides in the stool. Also supported is the increase of trimethylamine as an indicator of an unhealthy state."
https://openalex.org/W3136995308,"There are limited treatments for dyschromia in burn hypertrophic scars (HTSs). Initial work in Duroc pig models showed that regions of scar that are light or dark have equal numbers of melanocytes. This study aims to confirm melanocyte presence in regions of hypo- and hyper-pigmentation in an animal model and patient samples. In a Duroc pig model, melanocyte presence was confirmed using en face staining. Patients with dyschromic HTSs had demographic, injury details, and melanin indices collected. Punch biopsies were taken of regions of hyper-, hypo-, or normally pigmented scar and skin. Biopsies were processed to obtain epidermal sheets (ESs). A subset of ESs were en face stained with melanocyte marker, S100β. Melanocytes were isolated from a different subset. Melanocytes were treated with NDP α-MSH, a pigmentation stimulator. mRNA was isolated from cells, and was used to evaluate gene expression of melanin-synthetic genes. In patient and pig scars, regions of hyper-, hypo-, and normal pigmentation had significantly different melanin indices. S100β en face staining showed that regions of hyper- and hypo-pigmentation contained the same number of melanocytes, but these cells had different dendricity/activity. Treatment of hypo-pigmented melanocytes with NDP α-MSH produced melanin by microscopy. Melanin-synthetic genes were upregulated in treated cells over controls. While traditionally it may be thought that hypopigmented regions of burn HTS display this phenotype because of the absence of pigment-producing cells, these data show that inactive melanocytes are present in these scar regions. By treating with a pigment stimulator, cells can be induced to re-pigment."
https://openalex.org/W3137080414,"Compared to young men, Ugandan young women are disproportionately impacted by HIV. Childhood transactional sex may contribute to this disparity. Using data from the 2015 Uganda Violence Against Children Survey, we used logistic regression models to assess the association between childhood transactional sex and negative outcomes. Among 18-24-year-old young women who had sex prior to 18 (n = 982), those who ever engaged in transactional sex had 5.9 times [adjusted odds ratio (AOR); confidence interval (CI): 1.6-22.2] higher odds of having multiple sexual partners in the past year; 5.2 times (AOR; CI: 2.1-12.9) higher odds of infrequent condom use in the past year; 3.0 times (AOR; CI: 1.2-7.9) higher odds of hurting themselves intentionally; and 3.2 times (AOR; CI: 1.3-7.7) higher odds of having attitudes justifying spousal abuse than young women who never engaged in transactional sex. Interventions for transactional sex and HIV in Uganda should consider prioritizing prevention, harm-reduction and continued investment in adolescent girls' and young women's futures."
https://openalex.org/W3137317320,"Testosterone is considered a potent anabolic agent in skeletal muscle with a well-established role in adolescent growth and development in males. However, the role of testosterone in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function throughout the lifespan has yet to be fully established. While some studies suggest that testosterone is important for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass, an understanding of the role this hormone plays in young, adult, and old males with normal and low serum testosterone levels is lacking. We investigated the role testosterone plays in the maintenance of muscle mass by examining the effect of orchiectomy-induced testosterone depletion in C57Bl6 male mice at ages ranging from early postnatal through old age (1.5-, 5-, 12-, and 24-month old mice). Following 28 days of testosterone depletion, we assessed mass and fiber cross-sectional-area (CSA) of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscles. In addition, we measured global rates of protein synthesis and degradation using the SuNSET method, western blots, and enzyme activity assays. Twenty-eight days of testosterone depletion resulted in reduced muscle mass in the two youngest cohorts, but had no effect in the two oldest cohorts. Mean CSA decreased only in the youngest cohort and only in the tibialis anterior muscle. Testosterone depletion resulted in a general increase in proteasome activity at all ages. No change in protein synthesis was detected at the terminal time point. These data suggest that within physiological serum concentrations, testosterone may not be critical for the maintenance of muscle mass in mature male mice; however, in young mice testosterone is crucial for normal growth."
https://openalex.org/W3137533989,"Background Violence against women has been one of the most prominent issue and a major public health concern. It is a principle violation of basic human rights and has both physical and mental effect on the victim. This study focuses on married and unmarried girls aged 15 to 19 years, belonging to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India. This study attempts to examine depression level among married and unmarried girls who have faced violence against them. With the unprecedented growth in social networking, online digital platform and its accessibility, the study also brings out the pertinent aspect of internet based violence and its psychological outcome on adolescent girls. Hence, the study can be seen as an important and needed value addition to the existing pool of knowledge on the subject. Methods The study uses Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults (UDAYA) project data for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Depressive symptoms among adolescent girl is the outcome variable of the study. Descriptive statistic and bivariate analysis has been used to get to preliminary results. Chi-squared test is used to test the significant of variables. Further, multi-variate analysis (logistic regression) was used. Results Almost 29, 23 and 26 percent of married adolescent girls had faced emotional, physical and sexual violence respectively. It was found that about five per cent of unmarried and eight per cent of married girls had high depressive symptoms. It was found that unmarried adolescent girls who had witnessed their father beating mother were 71 percent more likely to suffer from higher depressive symptoms [OR: 1.71, 1.09–2.69]. Adolescents who faced perpetrated bullying had 90 per cent [OR: 1.90, 1.32–2.72] and 86 per cent [OR: 1.86, 0.98–3.52] higher likelihood to suffer from higher depressive symptoms. Conclusion The study goes beyond intimate partner violence and includes various covariates to explain the association between violence and depressive symptoms among married and unmarried adolescents. Hence, more inclusive policies are needed to address the issue of violence against women as the spectrum of the violence is expanding with time."
https://openalex.org/W3138399376,"Introduction This study estimated the costs and incremental cost per case detected of screening strategies for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) in women living with HIV (WLHIV) attending HIV clinics in Burkina Faso. Methods The direct healthcare provider costs of screening tests (visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), VIA combined visual inspection with Lugol’s iodine (VIA/VILI), cytology and a rapid HPV DNA test ( care HPV)) and confirmatory tests (colposcopy, directed biopsy and systematic four-quadrant (4Q) biopsy) were collected alongside the HPV in Africa Research Partnership (HARP) study. A model was developed for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 WLHIV using data on CIN2+ prevalence and the sensitivity of the screening tests. Costs are reported in USD (2019). Results The study enrolled 554 WLHIV with median age 36 years (inter-quartile range, 31–41) and CIN2+ prevalence of 5.8%. The average cost per screening test ranged from US$3.2 for VIA to US$24.8 for cytology. Compared to VIA alone, the incremental cost per CIN2+ case detected was US$48 for VIA/VILI and US$814 for care HPV. Despite higher costs, care HPV was more sensitive for CIN2+ cases detected compared to VIA/VILI (97% and 56%, respectively). The cost of colposcopy was US$6.6 per person while directed biopsy was US$33.0 and 4Q biopsy was US$48.0. Conclusion Depending on the willingness to pay for the detection of a case of cervical cancer, decision makers in Burkina Faso can consider a variety of cervical cancer screening strategies for WLHIV. While care HPV is more costly, it has the potential to be cost-effective depending on the willingness to pay threshold. Future research should explore the lifetime costs and benefits of cervical cancer screening to enable comparisons with interventions for other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3139167504,"Mitochondrial dynamics is a possible modulator of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injuries (IRI). We previously reported that mice partially deficient in the fusion protein OPA1 exhibited higher IRI. Therefore, we investigated whether deficiency in the fission protein DRP1 encoded by Dnm1l gene would affect IRI in Dnm1l +/- mouse. After baseline characterization of the Dnm1l +/- mice heart, using echocardiography, electron microscopy, and oxygraphy, 3-month-old Dnm1l +/- and wild type (WT) mice were exposed to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The ischemic area-at-risk (AAR) and area of necrosis (AN) were delimited, and the infarct size was expressed by AN/AAR. Proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy were analyzed before and after I/R. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening sensitivity was assessed after I/R. Heart weight and left ventricular function were not significantly different in 3-, 6- and 12-month-old Dnm1l +/- mice than in WT. The cardiac DRP1 protein expression levels were 60% lower, whereas mitochondrial area and lipid degradation were significantly higher in Dnm1l +/- mice than in WT, though mitochondrial respiratory parameters and mPTP opening did not significantly differ. Following I/R, the infarct size was significantly smaller in Dnm1l +/- mice than in WT (34.6±3.1% vs . 44.5±3.3%, respectively; p&lt;0.05) and the autophagic markers, LC3 II and P62 were significantly increased compared to baseline condition in Dnm1l +/- mice only. Altogether, data indicates that increasing fusion by means of Dnm1l deficiency was associated with protection against IRI, without alteration in cardiac or mitochondrial functions at basal conditions. This protection mechanism due to DRP1 haploinsufficiency increases the expression of autophagic markers."
https://openalex.org/W3139211038,"Streetlamps enforce night lighting on urban forest trees, but scarce information is available concerning the ecophysiological performance of street trees under these conditions. In this study, maple ( Acer truncatum Bunge) and oak ( Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb.) seedlings were cultured with simulated exposure to streetlamp spectra in white (red/green/blue, 7.7:1.0:2.2) and red plus blue (RB; red/green/blue, 4.6:0.0:1.0) lights with photosynthetic photon flux rate of 80 μmol m -2 s -1 in a 18-h photoperiod. Nitrogen (N) was loaded through 15 weekly applications to an amount of 80 mg N plant -1 to mimic the mineral N deposition to landscape trees. Variables of biomass, carbohydrate accumulation, N and water contents were rarely found difference between the two LED-spectra treatments for both species. Compared to the un-lighted control, the RB spectrum lowered N concentration in oak seedlings and water content in maple seedlings. The white light spectrum resulted in an increase of starch concentration. Carbohydrate concentration had a positive relationship with biomass and N content across two species but a negative relationship with water content in maple seedlings. Overall, streetlamp-lights imposed effects on tree growth by a prolonged photoperiod instead of specific spectrum. Maple had a strong response of water uptake to streetlamp lighting at the cost of carbohydrate consumption, but oak had scarce demand of water-use for growth."
https://openalex.org/W3136269896,"Background The need for kidney transplantation drives efforts to expand organ donation. The decision to accept organs from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) can result in a clinical dilemma in the context of conflicting reports from published literature. Material and methods This observational study included all deceased donor kidney transplants performed in Australia and New Zealand between 1997 and 2017. The association of donor-AKI, defined according to KDIGO criteria, with all-cause graft failure was evaluated by multivariable Cox regression. Secondary outcomes included death-censored graft failure, death, delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection. Results The study included 10,101 recipients of kidneys from 5,774 deceased donors, of whom 1182 (12%) recipients received kidneys from 662 (11%) donors with AKI. There were 3,259 (32%) all-cause graft failures, which included 1,509 deaths with functioning graft. After adjustment for donor, recipient and transplant characteristics, donor AKI was not associated with all-cause graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.26), death-censored graft failure (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.92–1.28), death (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98–1.35) or graft failure when death was evaluated as a competing event (sub-distribution hazard ratio [sHR] 1.07, 95% CI 0.91–1.26). Donor AKI was not associated with acute rejection but was associated with DGF (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.27, 95% CI 1.92–2.68). Conclusion Donor AKI stage was not associated with any kidney transplant outcome, except DGF. Use of kidneys with AKI for transplantation appears to be justified."
https://openalex.org/W3136373176,"Nutritional support using exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) has been studied as primary therapy for the management of liver diseases, Crohn’s disease, and cancers. EEN can also increase the number of beneficial microbiotas in the gut, improve bile acid and lipid metabolism, and decrease the number of harmful dietary micro-particles, possibly by influencing disease occurrence and increasing immunity. This study investigated the effects of EEN-n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (3PUFAs) (EEN-3PUFAs) on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, and lipid or bile acid metabolism in mice. Metagenomic sequencing technology was used to analyze the effects of EEN-3PUFAs on the composition of gut microbiome signatures. The contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids in the feces and liver of the mice were assayed by gas chromatography and ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography/high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. The levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and D-lactic acid in the blood were used to assess intestinal permeability. The results indicated that EEN-3PUFAs could improve the composition of gut microbiome signatures and increase the abundance of Barnesiella and Lactobacillus (genus), Porphyromonadaceae , and Bacteroidia (species), and Bacteroidetes (phylum) after EEN-3PUFAs initiation. In addition, EEN-3PUFAs induced the formation of SCFAs (mainly including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) and increased the intestinal wall compared to the control group. In conclusion, EEN-3PUFAs modulate the alterations in gut microbiome signatures, enhanced intestinal barrier, and regulated the fatty acid composition and lipid metabolism shifts and the putative mechanisms underlying these effects."
https://openalex.org/W3046920063,"A number of epidemics, including the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic of 2002-2004, have been known to exhibit superspreading, in which a small fraction of infected individuals is responsible for the majority of new infections. The existence of superspreading implies a fat-tailed distribution of infectiousness (new secondary infections caused per day) among different individuals. Here, we present a simple method to estimate the variation in infectiousness by examining the variation in early-time growth rates of new cases among different subpopulations. We use this method to estimate the mean and variance in the infectiousness, $\beta$, for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the early stages of the pandemic within the United States. We find that $\sigma_\beta/\mu_\beta \gtrsim 3.2$, where $\mu_\beta$ is the mean infectiousness and $\sigma_\beta$ its standard deviation, which implies pervasive superspreading. This result allows us to estimate that in the early stages of the pandemic in the USA, over 81% of new cases were a result of the top 10% of most infectious individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3088682948,"With the increasing legalization of medical and recreational use of cannabis, more research is needed to understand the association between depression and consumer behavior related to cannabis consumption. Big social media data has potential to provide deeper insights about these associations to public health analysts. In this interdisciplinary study, we demonstrate the value of incorporating domain-specific knowledge in the learning process to identify the relationships between cannabis use and depression. We develop an end-to-end knowledge infused deep learning framework (Gated-K-BERT) that leverages the pre-trained BERT language representation model and domain-specific declarative knowledge source (Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO)) to jointly extract entities and their relationship using gated fusion sharing mechanism. Our model is further tailored to provide more focus to the entities mention in the sentence through entity-position aware attention layer, where ontology is used to locate the target entities position. Experimental results show that inclusion of the knowledge-aware attentive representation in association with BERT can extract the cannabis-depression relationship with better coverage in comparison to the state-of-the-art relation extractor."
https://openalex.org/W3136965157,"As the world grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of primary and secondary (K-12) schools. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection, even if asymptomatic. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. We focused our analysis on the United States, but the results are applicable to other countries as well. We demonstrate the potential for a large discrepancy between detected cases and true infections in schools due to the combination of high asymptomatic rates in children coupled with delays in seeking testing and receiving results from diagnostic tests. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of robust surveillance testing and contact-tracing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20–60 days without the emergence of sizeable disease clusters. At this point, even if schools choose to close after outbreaks occur, COVID-19 cases will be seeded from these school clusters and amplified into the community. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Reopening schools without surveillance testing and contact tracing measures in place will lead to spread within the schools and within the communities that eventually forces a return to remote learning and leaves a trail of infection in its wake."
https://openalex.org/W3137754345,"We sought to evaluate common leadership experiences and academic achievements obtained by current U.S. Medical School Deans of Medicine (DOMs) prior to their first appointment as Dean in order to elucidate a common pathway for promotion.In April-June 2019 the authors requested a curriculum vitae from each of the 153 LCME-accredited U.S. Medical School DOMs. The authors abstracted data on prior appointments, demographics, and achievements from CVs and online databases. Differences by gender and institutional rank were then evaluated by the Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.CVs were obtained for 62% of DOMs (95 of 153), with women comprising 16% of the responding cohort (15/95). Prior to appointment as DOM, 34% of respondents had served as both permanent Department Chair and Associate Dean, 39% as permanent Department Chair but not Associate Dean, and 17% as Associate Deans but not permanent Department Chair. There was a non-significant trend for men to have been more likely to have been a permanent Department Chair (76% vs 53%, p = 0.11) and less likely to have been an Associate Dean (48% vs 67%, p = 0.26) compared to women. Responding DOMs at Top-25 research institutions were mostly male (15/16), more likely to have been appointed before 2010 (38% vs 14%, p = 0.025), and had higher H-indices (mean (SD): 73.1 (32.3) vs 33.5 (22.5), p<0.01) than non-Top-25 Deans.The most common pathway to DOM in this study cohort was prior service as Department Chair. This suggests that diversification among Department Chair positions or expansion of search criteria to seek leaders from pools other than Department Chairs may facilitate increased diversity, equity, and inclusion among DOM overall."
https://openalex.org/W3139108944,"Background Asymptomatic Plasmodium infection (API) that occurs during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirths, abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight. API also hinders the control and prevention of malaria as infected hosts serve as silent reservoirs for transmission of Plasmodium species in the community. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of API and associated factors among pregnant women. This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Merti district, Oromia, Ethiopia among 364 pregnant women from March to September 2018. Methods Sociodemographic and obstetrics features were collected using a structured questionnaire. About 2ml of blood was collected from participants to detect Plasmodium species, gametocyte carriage rate, parasite density, and anemia. Results The prevalence of API among pregnant women was 3.6%. The proportion of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was 6(46.2%) and 7(53.8%) respectively. Out of 13 Plasmodium species identified, Gametocyte carriage rate was 4(30.7%). The geometric mean density of the asexual stage of the parasites was 994.7(interquartile [IQR], 320 to 2200) parasites/ul. The geometric mean gametocyte density was 303.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 160 to 600). The proportion of anemia among Plasmodium -infected participants was 12(92.3%). Previous infection by Plasmodium species (AOR = 5.42; 95% CI: 1.19–29.03, p = 0.047), lack of insecticide-treated bed net use (AOR = 6.52; 95% CI: 1.17–36.44, p = 0.032), and living close to stagnant water (AOR = 4.18; 95% CI (1.12–17.36, p = 0.049) were significantly associated with API. Anemia was significantly higher among Plasmodium -infected than non-infected pregnant women ( x 2 = 27.62, p &lt;0.001). Conclusion In the current study, a relatively high prevalence of API was detected among pregnant women. Identifying API in the community is important to prevent the unwanted outcomes of Plasmodium infection and its transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3135951953,"Prescriptions for gastric acid-suppressive agents, including proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine type-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), are rising. However, little data exist regarding their association with dementia in the Asian population. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the impact of the use of PPIs and H2RAs on the risk of dementia in an Asian population with upper gastrointestinal disease (UGID).We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study with a 10-year follow-up using data from 2000 to 2015 derived from Taiwan's Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. We included 6711 patients with UGID receiving gastric acid-suppressive agents, 6711 patients with UGID not receiving agents, and 6711 patients without UGID or treatment thereof, all at least 20 years of age. Groups were matched for age, sex, and index date. The association between gastric acid-suppressive agent use and dementia was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for potential confounders.The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of dementia for patients with UGID receiving gastric acid-suppressive agents compared with patients with UGID without gastric acid-suppressive agents was 1.470 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.267-1.705, p < 0.001). Both PPIs and H2RAs increase the risk of dementia (PPIs: aHR 1.886 [95% CI 1.377-2.582], p < 0.001; H2RAs: aHR 1.357 [95% CI 1.098-1.678], p < 0.01), with PPIs exhibiting significantly greater risk (aHR 1.456 [95% CI 1.022-2.075], p < 0.05).Our results demonstrate an increased risk of dementia in patients with UGID receiving gastric acid-suppressive agents, including PPIs and H2RAs, and the use of PPIs was associated with a significantly greater risk than H2RA use."
https://openalex.org/W3136672980,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a protein involved in inflammatory illnesses such as fibrosis and cancer; its overexpression in cardiovascular diseases promotes the biomineralization of blood vessels and other soft tissues. Moreover, there is an active component of oxidative stress related with those diseases. The present study relates serum OPN levels with nutritional condition and oxidative stress in a group of adolescents. Anthropometric measurements were performed, and fasting blood samples were analyzed to determine OPN concentrations, blood chemistry parameters (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, urea, uric acid, and creatinine) and oxidative stress biomarkers (Paraoxonase-1, Glutathione S-Transferase, Catalase, NAD(P)H Quinone Oxidoreductase, free carbonyl groups and malondialdehyde). Adolescents were categorized according to body mass index (BMI) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) criteria. We found increased OPN serum concentrations in overweight and obese adolescents, as well as in adolescents with MetS. Rises in OPN correlated with arm circumference and biomarkers of lipid peroxidation; with regard to serum glucose there was a trend to positive correlation. Our results suggest that serum OPN is associated to nutritional status and could be considered as an early biomarker of low-grade inflammation and probably the early biomineralization of soft tissues in adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3137488001,"Context Obesity, is a state of chronic inflammation, characterized by elevated lipids, insulin resistance and relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We have defined the accompanying decreased Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), ovarian steroids and reduced pituitary response to Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone (GnRH) as Reprometabolic syndrome, a phenotype that can be induced in healthy normal weight women (NWW) by acute infusion of free fatty acids and insulin. Objective To identify potential mediators of insulin and lipid-related reproductive endocrine dysfunction. Design, setting, participants Secondary analysis of crossover study of eumenorrheic reproductive aged women of normal Body Mass Index (BMI) (&lt;25 kg/m 2 ) at an academic medical center. Intervention Participants underwent 6-hour infusions of either saline/heparin or insulin plus fatty acids (Intralipid plus heparin), in the early follicular phase of sequential menstrual cycles, in random order. Euglycemia was maintained by glucose infusion. Frequent blood samples were obtained. Main outcome measures Pooled serum from each woman was analyzed for cytokines, interleukins, chemokines, adipokines, Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 (FGF-21) and markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (CHOP and GRP78). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare results across experimental conditions. Results Except for Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1β (MIP-1β), no significant differences were observed in serum levels of any of the inflammatory signaling or ER stress markers tested. Conclusion Acute infusion of lipid and insulin, to mimic the metabolic syndrome of obesity, was not associated with an increase in inflammatory markers. These results imply that the endocrine disruption and adverse reproductive outcomes of obesity are not a consequence of the ambient inflammatory environment but may be mediated by direct lipotoxic effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis."
https://openalex.org/W3137600714,"In the past year, an unprecedented climate movement has risen among European youth, so-called ""Fridays4Future"" (F4F). Thousands of pupils skip school every Friday to protest for better climate politics. The public debate on the protests contains highly mixed reactions, including praise as well as condemnation. Recent theoretical accounts propose that people’s engagement in community service and actions towards a greater good could be related to their moral identity. Moral identity (MI) is defined as the extent to which being moral is important to the personal identity. The current preregistered study investigates the link between moral identity and participants’ support for F4F in an online survey (N = 537). Results confirm the association between participants’ moral identity and their support for F4F, with the internalization scale predicting passive forms of support and the symbolization scale predicting active forms of support. Additionally, risk perception was found to play an important role. Thus, this study confirms the role of moral identity in people’s pro-environmental engagement and offers new insights in the context of an important and timely issue."
https://openalex.org/W3137601172,"Few studies have examined the effects of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions on the shift in human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) season in Japan. This study aims to test whether the number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological conditions are associated with the onset week of HRSV epidemic season. The estimation of onset week for 46 prefectures (except for Okinawa prefecture) in Japan for 4-year period (2014–2017) was obtained from previous papers based on the national surveillance data. We obtained data on the yearly number of inbound overseas travelers and meteorological (yearly mean temperature and relative humidity) conditions from Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), respectively. Multi-level mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that every 1 person (per 100,000 population) increase in number of overall inbound overseas travelers led to an earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in the year by 0.02 week (coefficient –0.02; P&lt;0.01). Higher mean temperature and higher relative humidity were also found to contribute to an earlier onset week by 0.30 week (coefficient –0.30; P&lt;0.05) and 0.18 week (coefficient –0.18; P&lt;0.01), respectively. Additionally, models that included the number of travelers from individual countries (Taiwan, South Korea, and China) except Australia showed that both the number of travelers from each country and meteorological conditions contributed to an earlier onset week. Our analysis showed the earlier onset week of HRSV epidemic season in Japan is associated with increased number of inbound overseas travelers, higher mean temperature, and relative humidity. The impact of international travelers on seasonality of HRSV can be further extended to investigations on the changes of various respiratory infectious diseases especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3136501627,"Understanding segregation plays a significant role in determining the development pathways of a country as it can help governmental and other concerned agencies to prepare better-targeted policies for the needed groups. However, inferring segregation through alternative data, apart from governmental surveys remains limited due to the non-availability of representative datasets. In this work, we utilize Call Data Records (CDR) provided by one of Estonia's major telecom operators to research the complexities of social interaction and human behavior in order to explain gender segregation. We analyze the CDR with two objectives. First, we study gender segregation by exploring the social network interactions of the CDR. We find that the males are tightly linked which allows information to spread faster among males compared to females. Second, we perform the micro-analysis using various users' characteristics such as age, language, and location. Our findings show that the prime working-age population (i.e., (24,54] years) is more segregated than others. We also find that the Estonian-speaking population (both males and females) are more likely to interact with other Estonian-speaking individuals of the same gender. Further to ensure the quality of this dataset, we compare the CDR data features with publicly available Estonian census datasets. We observe that the CDR dataset is indeed a good representative of the Estonian population, which indicates that the findings of this study reasonably reflect the reality of gender segregation in the Estonian Landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3136756514,"Fusarium wilt of watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus ) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon), has become an increasing concern of farmers in the southeastern USA, especially in Florida. Management of this disease, most often through the use of resistant cultivars and crop rotation, requires an accurate understanding of an area’s pathogen population structure and phenotypic characteristics. This study improved the understanding of the state’s pathogen population by completing multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of two housekeeping genes (BT and TEF) and two loci (ITS and IGS), aggressiveness and race-determining bioassays on 72 isolates collected between 2011 and 2015 from major watermelon production areas in North, Central, and South Florida. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) failed to group race 3 isolates into a single large clade; moreover, clade membership was not apparently correlated with aggressiveness (which varied both within and between clades), and only slightly with sampling location. The failure of multilocus sequence analysis using four highly conserved housekeeping genes and loci to clearly group and delineate known Fon races provides justification for future whole genome sequencing efforts whose more robust genomic comparisons will provide higher resolution of intra-species genetic distinctions. Consequently, these results suggest that identification of Fon isolates by race determination alone may fail to detect economically important phenotypic characteristics such as aggressiveness leading to inaccurate risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3136789747,"Objective Related evidences of metabolically unhealthy profile of adults with normal weight are not well characterized in the Chinese population. This is because they cannot be effectively identified by regular measurements (such as body mass index [BMI]). To overcome this gap in literature, this study aimed at investigating the association between body composition and metabolically unhealthy profile in Chinese adults with normal weight. Methods A total of 5427 individuals with normal-weight were recruited from 15820 people living in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in Northwest China. Normal-weight was defined as a BMI of 18.5–23.9 kg/m 2 . Metabolically unhealthy profile was assessed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUHNW) profile was defined in individuals who had normal weight and at least two cardiometabolic risk factors. Generalized linear model was used to investigate the association between body composition measured by bioelectrical impedance and metabolically unhealthy profile in adults with normal-weight. Results The percentage of metabolically unhealthy profile was 35.86% in adults with normal weight. Different MUHNW distributions were found between males and females depending on age. The percentage of the MUHNW profile significantly increased in women after the age of 55, contrary to men. The association between body composition and MUHNW was affected by age and sex. The increased adiposity indices (fat mass index [FMI], visceral fat level [VFL], waist circumference [WCF]), and reduced skeletal muscle mass ratio [SMR] showed significant differences between MUHNW and metabolically healthy with normal weight (MHNW) (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The distribution of MUHNW differed between ages and sexes. FMI, VFL, WCF and SMR could be responsible for the MUHNW adults, providing a new insight into the potential metabolic risks for the adults with normal weight in China. This directs us in the management of the MUHNW for their early prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3137221013,"Objective Many men living with HIV want to have children. Opportunities to reduce periconception HIV transmission include antiretroviral therapy as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis, limiting condomless sex to peak fertility, and sperm processing. Whether men have knowledge of or want to adopt these strategies remains unknown. Methods We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with men accessing HIV care in South Africa in 2014 to inform a safer conception intervention for men. Eligible men were 25–45 years old, living with HIV, not yet accessing treatment, and wanting to have a child with an HIV-negative or unknown serostatus female partner (referred to as the “desired pregnancy partner”). FGDs explored motivations for having a healthy baby, feasibility of a clinic-based safer conception intervention, and acceptability of safer conception strategies. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Twelve participants from three FGDs had a median age of 37 (range 23–45) years, reported a median of 2 (range 1–4) sexual partners, and 1 (range 1–3) desired pregnancy partner(s). A third (N = 4) had disclosed HIV-serostatus to the pregnancy partner. Emergent themes included opportunities for and challenges to engaging men in safer conception services. Opportunities included enthusiasm for a clinic-based safer conception intervention and acceptance of some safer conception strategies. Challenges included poor understanding of safer conception strategies, unfamiliarity with risk reduction [versus “safe” (condoms) and “unsafe” (condomless) sex], mixed acceptability of safer conception strategies, and concerns about disclosing HIV-serostatus to a partner. Conclusions Men living with HIV expressed interest in safer conception and willingness to attend clinic programs. Imprecise prevention counseling messages make it difficult for men to conceptualize risk reduction. Effective safer conception programs should embrace clear language, e.g. undetectable = untransmittable (U = U), and support multiple approaches to serostatus disclosure to pregnancy partners."
https://openalex.org/W3138980601,"Hyperglycemia is one of the major health concern in many parts of the world. One of the serious complications of high glucose levels is diabetic nephropathy. The preliminary microarray study performed on primary human renal tubular epithelial (hRTE) cells exposed to high glucose levels showed a significant downregulation of mTOR as well as its associated genes as well as lysosomal genes. Based on this preliminary data, the expression of various lysosomal genes as well as mTOR and its associated genes were analyzed in hRTE cells exposed to 5.5, 7.5, 11 and 16 mM glucose. The results validated the microarray analysis, which showed a significant decrease in the mRNA as well as protein expression of the selected genes as the concentration of glucose increased. Co-localization of lysosomal marker, LAMP1 with mTOR showed lower expression of mTOR as the glucose concentration increased, suggesting decrease in mTOR activity. Although the mechanism by which glucose affects the regulation of lysosomal genes is not well known, our results suggest that high levels of glucose may lead to decrease in mTOR expression causing the cells to enter an anabolic state with subsequent downregulation of lysosomal genes."
https://openalex.org/W3139440526,"Background Identifying pain-related response patterns and understanding functional mechanisms of symptom formation and recovery are important for improving treatment. Objectives We aimed to replicate pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns associated with the Fear-Avoidance Model, and its extension, the Avoidance-Endurance Model, and examined their differences in secondary measures of stress, action control (i.e., dispositional action vs. state orientation), coping, and health. Methods Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on self-report data from 536 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain at the beginning of an inpatient rehabilitation program. Measures of stress (i.e., pain, life stress) and action control were analyzed as covariates regarding their influence on the formation of different pain response profiles. Measures of coping and health were examined as dependent variables. Results Partially in line with our assumptions, we found three pain response profiles of distress-avoidance, eustress-endurance, and low-endurance responses that are depending on the level of perceived stress and action control. Distress-avoidance responders emerged as the most burdened, dysfunctional patient group concerning measures of stress, action control, maladaptive coping, and health. Eustress-endurance responders showed one of the highest levels of action versus state orientation, as well as the highest levels of adaptive coping and physical activity. Low-endurance responders reported lower levels of stress as well as equal levels of action versus state orientation, maladaptive coping, and health compared to eustress-endurance responders; however, equally low levels of adaptive coping and physical activity compared to distress-avoidance responders. Conclusions Apart from the partially supported assumptions of the Fear-Avoidance and Avoidance-Endurance Model, perceived stress and dispositional action versus state orientation may play a crucial role in the formation of pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns that vary in degree of adaptiveness. Results suggest tailoring interventions based on behavioral and functional analysis of pain responses in order to more effectively improve patients quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3129060528,"The rodent model of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (rNAION) is similar in many of its pathophysiological responses to clinical NAION. Like human NAION, there is significant variability in the severity of the lesion produced, and little is known of the parameters associated with rNAION induction severity or if pre- or early post-induction biomarkers can be identified that enable prediction of lesion severity and ultimate loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Adult male Sprague-Dawley outbred rats were evaluated for various parameters including physiological characteristics (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, hematocrit [Hct]), optic nerve head (ONH) appearance, pre- and post-induction mean diameter, and intravenous fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographic patterns of vascular leakage at 5 hours post-induction, performed using a spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) instrument. Early changes were correlated with ultimate RGC loss by Brn3a (+) immunohistology. RGC loss also was correlated with the relative level of laser exposure. The severity of ONH edema 2d, but not 5hr, post induction was most closely associated with the degree of RGC loss, revealing a threshold effect, and consistent with a compartment syndrome where a minimum level of capillary compression within a tight space is responsible for damage. RGC loss increased dramatically as the degree of laser exposure increased. Neither physiological parameters nor the degree of capillary leakage 5hr post induction were informative as to the ultimate degree of RGC loss. Similar to human NAION, the rNAION model exhibits marked variability in lesion severity. Unlike clinical NAION, pre-induction ONH diameter likely does not contribute to ultimate lesion severity; however, cross-sectional ONH edema can be used as a biomarker 2d post-induction to determine randomization of subjects prior to inclusion in specific neuroprotection or neuroregeneration studies."
https://openalex.org/W3137188169,"We executed two live animal ranking experiments, own-flock and group-animal ranking, to identify the breeding objectives of Arab and Oromo goat keepers in northwestern Ethiopia as a preliminary step towards designing sustainable breeding programs for two goat populations. In the own-flock ranking experiment, a total of 147 households, out of which 46 were Arab and 101 were Oromo goat keepers that live in semi-arid and sub-humid agroecologies respectively, were visited at their homesteads and were asked to choose their first best, second best, third best and the most inferior does from their own flock. The reasons of ranking and life history of the does (age, previous production and reproduction information) were inquired and recorded; live body weight and some linear body measurements were taken. In the group-animal ranking experiment, 12 breeding does and 12 breeding bucks from Arab goats and the same number of animals from Oromo goats were randomly selected. Life history of selected does and bucks (age, birth type, libido and temperament) were inquired from the owners. The selected animals were randomly grouped into four in Arab goats (three animals per group) and the same was applied in Oromo goats. Twelve farmers for Arab goats and the same number of farmers for Oromo goats who have not known the experimental animals were invited to do the ranking. Each person ranked the three animals in each group as 1 st , 2 nd and 3 rd , giving reasons of ranking. After a first round of ranking, s/he was then provided with the history of each individual animal and asked whether s/he would consider re-ranking them. This procedure was continued eight times until a person covered all groups of does and bucks. It was found out that in own-flock ranking experiment, keepers focus on productive, reproductive and behavioral traits (such as body size, mothering ability, twinning rate, kidding interval and temperament) while in group-animal ranking experiment, there was a general tendency to focus on observable physical traits like coat color, body size and body conformation. Simultaneous use of both own-flock and group-animal ranking experiments is advisable to identify breeding objective traits in production systems where record keeping is absent."
https://openalex.org/W3135991343,"Expression of the protease sensing receptor, protease activated receptor-2 (PAR2), is elevated in a variety of cancers and has been promoted as a potential therapeutic target. With the development of potent antagonists for this receptor, we hypothesised that they could be used to treat renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The expression of PAR2 was, therefore, examined in human RCC tissues and selected RCC cell lines. Histologically confirmed cases of RCC, together with paired non-involved kidney tissue, were used to produce a tissue microarray (TMA) and to extract total tissue RNA. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were then used to assess PAR2 expression. In culture, RCC cell lines versus primary human kidney tubular epithelial cells (HTEC) were used to assess PAR2 expression by qPCR, immunocytochemistry and an intracellular calcium mobilization assay. The TMA revealed an 85% decrease in PAR2 expression in tumour tissue compared with normal kidney tissue. Likewise, qPCR showed a striking reduction in PAR2 mRNA in RCC compared with normal kidney. All RCC cell lines showed lower levels of PAR2 expression than HTEC. In conclusion, we found that PAR2 was reduced in RCC compared with normal kidney and is unlikely to be a target of interest in the treatment of this type of cancer."

GlycA is a novel marker of systemic inflammation with low intra-individual variability and high analytic precision. GlycA has been associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) independent of other inflammatory markers. However, whether GlycA is associated with AF, specifically, has yet to be established. We examined the association between GlycA and AF in a multi-ethnic cohort. Methods We studied 6,602 MESA participants aged 45–85, with no clinical CVD at baseline, with data on GlycA and incident AF. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox models to evaluate the association between GlycA and incident AF. We also examined other inflammatory markers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL6) and fibrinogen] and incident AF for comparison. Results The mean (SD) age was 62 (10) years, 53% women. The mean plasma GlycA was 381 (62) μmol/L. Over median follow-up of 12.9 years, 869 participants experienced AF. There was no statistically significant association between GlycA and incident AF after adjusting for sociodemographics, CVD risk factors, and other inflammatory markers [Hazard Ratio (95% CI) per 1 SD increment in GlycA: 0.97 (0.88–1.06)]. Neither hsCRP nor fibrinogen was associated with incident AF in same model. In contrast, IL-6 was independently associated with incident AF [HR 1.12 per 1 SD increment (1.05–1.19)]. Conclusions Although GlycA has been associated with other CVD types, we found that GlycA was not associated with AF. More research will be required to understand why IL-6 was associated with AF but not GlycA. Clinical trial registration MESA is not a clinical trial. However, the cohort is registered at: URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00005487 Unique identifier: NCT00005487 ."
https://openalex.org/W3138611562,"Dental wear analysis through the use of an intraoral scanner is a reality of modern dentistry. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of qualitative tooth wear evaluation through three-dimensional images captured with an intraoral scanner and compared to clinical and photographic examinations. Eighteen adult volunteers of both genders (18 to 55 years old) were submitted to clinical exams, intraoral photographs and intraoral scanning protocol using an optical scanner (TRIOS® Pod, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). Occlusal tooth wear, from second to second premolars, was measured by two evaluators and reevaluated after 30 days, according to a slight modification of the method described by Mockers et al. Weighted Kappa was used to measure intra and inter-examiner agreement. The Friedman test was used to verify the differences among methods. Random and systematic errors were assessed using Bland-Altman plots. All statistical analysis was performed with p<0.05. There was a substantive agreement for clinical (K = 0.75) and photographic exams (K = 0.79) and a moderate agreement for intraoral scanner analysis (K = 0.60) for inter-examiner evaluation. A substantial intra-examiner agreement was obtained for both evaluators. No significant difference between the methods was observed (p = 0.7343 for examiner 1 and 0.8007 for examiner 2). The Bland-Altman plot confirmed no systematic errors between the methods and a random error of 0.25 with the scanner method when compared to clinical assessment. All three methods showed reliability in qualitative occlusal tooth wear evaluation. Intraoral scanning seems to be a sound and reliable tool to evaluate tooth wear when compared to traditional methods, considering the lower inter-examiner agreement and the inherent limitations of this pilot study. Further research will be necessary in order to achieve more robust evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3137513077,"The Panama Papers comprise one of the most recent influential leaks containing detailed information on intermediary companies (such as law firms), offshore entities and company officers, and serve as a valuable source of insight into the operations of (approximately) 214,000 shell companies incorporated in tax havens around the globe over the past half century. Entities and relations in the papers can be used to construct a network that permits, in principle, a systematic and scientific study at scale using techniques developed in the computational social science and network science communities. In this paper, we propose such a study by attempting to quantify and profile the importance of entities. In particular, our research explores whether intermediaries are significantly more influential than offshore entities, and whether different centrality measures lead to varying, or even incompatible, conclusions. Some findings yield conclusions that resemble Simpson’s paradox. We also explore the role that jurisdictions play in determining entity importance."
https://openalex.org/W3137638426,"Spectral similarity indices were used to select similar soil samples from a spectral library and improve the predictive accuracy of target samples. There are many similarity indices available, and precisely how to select the optimum index has become a critical question. Five similarity indices were evaluated: Spectral angle mapper (SAM), Euclidean distance (ED), Mahalanobis distance (MD), SAM_pca and ED_pca in the space of principal components applied to a global soil spectral library. The accordance between spectral and compositional similarity was used to select the optimum index. Then the optimum index was evaluated if it can maintain the greatest predictive accuracy when selecting similar samples from a spectral library for the prediction of a target sample using a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model. The evaluated physiochemical properties were: soil organic carbon, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), clay, silt, and sand content. SAM and SAM_pca selected samples were closer in composition compared to the target samples. Based on similar samples selected using these two indices, PLSR models achieved the highest predictive accuracy for all soil properties, save for CEC. This validates the hypothesis that the accordance information between spectral and compositional similarity can help select the appropriate similarity index when selecting similar samples from a spectral library for prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3139309702,"Background Health systems are undergoing widespread adoption of the collaborative chronic care model (CCM). Care structured around the CCM may reduce costly psychiatric hospitalizations. Little is known, however, about the time course or heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) for CCM on psychiatric hospitalization. Rationale Assessment of CCM implementation support on psychiatric hospitalization might be more efficient if the timing were informed by an expected time course. Further, understanding HTE could help determine who should be referred for intervention. Objectives (i) Estimate the trajectory of CCM effect on psychiatric hospitalization rates. (ii) Explore HTE for CCM across demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods Data from a stepped wedge CCM implementation trial were reanalyzed using 5 570 patients in CCM treatment and 46 443 patients receiving usual care. Time-to-event data was constructed from routine medical records. Effect trajectory of CCM on psychiatric hospitalization was simulated from an extended Cox model over one year of implementation support. Covariate risk contributions were estimated from subset stratified Cox models without using simulation. Ratios of hazard ratios (RHR) allowed comparison by trial arm for HTE analysis, also without simulation. No standard Cox proportional hazards models were used for either estimating the time-course or heterogeneity of treatment effect. Results The effect of CCM implementation support increased most rapidly immediately after implementation start and grew more gradually throughout the rest of the study. On the final study day, psychiatric hospitalization rates in the treatment arm were 17% to 49% times lower than controls, with adjustment for all model covariates (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.51–0.83). Our analysis of HTE favored usual care for those with a history of prior psychiatric hospitalization (RHR 4.92; 95% CI 3.15–7.7) but favored CCM for those with depression (RHR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41–0.91). Having a single medical diagnosis, compared to having none, favored CCM (RHR 0.52; 95% CI 0.31–0.86). Conclusion Reduction of psychiatric hospitalization is evident immediately after start of CCM implementation support, but assessments may be better timed once the effect size begins to stabilize, which may be as early as six months. HTE findings for CCM can guide future research on utility of CCM in specific populations."
https://openalex.org/W3138811240,"In previous experiments, a back-off movement was introduced as a motion strategy of robots to facilitate the order of passage at bottlenecks in human-robot spatial interaction. In this article we take a closer look at the appropriate application of motion parameters that make the backward movement legible. Related works in distance perception, size-speed illusions, and viewpoint-based legibility considerations suggest a relationship between the size of the robot and the observer's perspective on the expected execution of this movement. We performed a participant experiment (N = 50) in a virtual reality environment where participants adjusted the minimum required back-off length and preferred back-off speed as a result of the robot size, and the viewpoint of the back-off movement. We target a model-based approach on how appropriate back-off design translates to different sized robots and observer's viewpoints. Thus, we allow the application of back-off in a variety of autonomous moving systems. The results show a significant correlation between the increasingly expected back-off lengths with increasing robot size, but only weak effects of the viewpoint on the requirements of this movement. An exploratory analysis suggests that execution time might be a promising parameter to consider for the design of legible motion."
https://openalex.org/W3136428014,"Background Multiple case definitions are used to identify hospitalized patients with community-acquired acute respiratory infections (ARI). We evaluated several commonly used hospitalized ARI case definitions to identify influenza cases. Methods The study included all patients from a population-based surveillance site in Damanhour, Egypt hospitalized for a broad set of criteria consistent with community acquired ARIs. Naso- and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs were tested for influenza using RT-PCR. Sensitivity, specificity and PPV for influenza identification was compared between the 2014 WHO Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) definition (fever ≥38°C and cough with onset within 10 days), the 2011 WHO SARI definition (fever ≥38°C and cough with onset within 7 days), the 2006 PAHO SARI definition, the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP) pneumonia case definition, and the International Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) case definitions for moderate and severe pneumonia. Results From June 2009-December 2012, 5768 NP/OP swabs were obtained from 6113 hospitalized ARI patients; 799 (13.9%) were influenza positive. The 2014 WHO SARI case definition captured the greatest number of ARI patients, influenza positive patients and ARI deaths compared to the other case definitions examined. Sensitivity for influenza detection was highest for the 2014 WHO SARI definition with 88.6%, compared to the 2011 WHO SARI (78.2%) the 2006 PAHO SARI (15.8%) the IEIP pneumonia (61.0%) and the IMCI moderate and severe pneumonia (33.8% and 38.9%) case definitions (IMCI applies to &lt;5 only). Conclusions Our results support use of the 2014 WHO SARI definition for identifying influenza positive hospitalized SARI cases as it captures the highest proportion of ARI deaths and influenza positive cases. Routine use of this case definition for hospital-based surveillance will provide a solid, globally comparable foundation on which to build needed response efforts for novel pandemic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3137876310,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading environmental cause of childhood hearing impairment. However, its significance remains largely undocumented in many regions of the world. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical features of cCMV infection in East Asia. Neonates born at a municipal hospital in Taipei were prospectively recruited and underwent concurrent hearing and CMV screenings. Those who failed the hearing screening or screened positive for CMV were subjected to a focused audiological and/or virological surveillance. The characteristics of the newborns and their mothers were compared between the CMV-positive and CMV-negative groups. Of the 1,532 newborns who underwent concurrent hearing and CMV screenings, seven (0.46%) were positive for cCMV infection. All seven CMV-positive newborns were asymptomatic at birth, and none of them developed hearing or other symptoms during a follow-up period of 14.4±6.3 months. The mothers of the CMV-positive newborns demonstrated higher gravidity (2.4 ± 1.4 vs. 2.1 ± 1.2) and parity (2.0 ± 1.2 vs. 1.6 ± 0.7) than those in the CMV-negative group; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance. The prevalence of cCMV infection in Taipei newborns was 0.46%, which is slightly lower than that of other populations and that of a previous report in the Taiwanese population. The relatively low prevalence in this study might be attributed to the improved public health system and decreased fertility rate in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3137883172,"Introduction HIV testing is an important strategy for controlling and ultimately ending the global pandemic. Oral rapid HIV testing (ORHT) is an evidence-based strategy and the evidence-based shows is favored over traditional blood tests in many key populations. The dental setting has been found to be a trusted, convenient, and yet untapped venue to conduct ORHT. This study assessed the HIV testing behaviors and willingness to receive ORHT among dental patients in Xi’an, China. Methods A cross-sectional survey of dental patients from Xi’an was conducted from August to September 2017. Dental patients were recruited using a stratified cluster sampling. A 44-item survey was used to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge, HIV testing behaviors, and willingness to receive ORHT. Results Nine hundred and nine dental patients completed the survey with a mean HIV/AIDS knowledge score of 10.7/15 (SD 2.8). Eighty-four participants (9.2%) had previously received an HIV test. Participants would have a high rate of HIV testing if they had higher monthly income ( OR = 1.982, 95% CI : 1.251–3.140) and a higher HIV/AIDS knowledge score ( OR = 1.137, 95% CI : 1.032–1.252). Five hundred and eighty-two participants (64.0%) were willing to receive ORHT before a dental treatment, 198 (21.8%) were not sure, and 129 (14.2%) were unwilling. Logistic regression showed that age ( OR = 0.970, 95% CI : 0.959–0.982), HIV/AIDS knowledge score ( OR = 1.087, 95% CI : 1.031–1.145), previous HIV test ( OR = 2.057, 95% CI : 1.136–3.723), having advanced HIV testing knowledge ( OR = 1.570, 95% CI : 1.158–2.128), and having advanced ORHT knowledge ( OR = 2.074, 95%: CI 1.469–2.928) were the factors affecting the willingness to receive ORHT. Conclusions The majority of dental patients had not previously received an HIV test, although many were receptive to being tested in the dental setting. The dental setting as a venue to screen people for HIV needs further exploration, particularly because many people do not associate dentistry with chairside screenings. Increasing awareness of ORHT and reducing testing price can further improve the patient’s willingness to receive ORHT."
https://openalex.org/W3138956031,"To improve interpersonal comparability of self-reported measures, anchoring vignettes are increasingly collected in surveys and modeled as the hierarchical ordered probit (HOPIT) model. This paper—based on the idea of psychological distance—relaxes the assumption of vignette equivalence in the HOPIT by allowing for heteroscedasticity in respondents’ perceptions of vignettes. Particularly, we assume that respondents who are more similar to a vignette are more familiar with the condition described and therefore are capable of forming a more precise perception of the vignette. We show evidence in favor of this extended HOPIT through Monte Carlo simulations and an application concerning self-reported vision difficulty from the WHO Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE)."
