https://openalex.org/W1981653927,"The rice species Oryza sativa is considered to be a model plant because of its small genome size, extensive genetic map, relative ease of transformation and synteny with other cereal crops. Here we report the essentially complete sequence of chromosome 1, the longest chromosome in the rice genome. We summarize characteristics of the chromosome structure and the biological insight gained from the sequence. The analysis of 43.3 megabases (Mb) of non-overlapping sequence reveals 6,756 protein coding genes, of which 3,161 show homology to proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana, another model plant. About 30% (2,073) of the genes have been functionally categorized. Rice chromosome 1 is (G + C)-rich, especially in its coding regions, and is characterized by several gene families that are dispersed or arranged in tandem repeats. Comparison with a draft sequence indicates the importance of a high-quality finished sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2010942899,"Inappropriate activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but exactly how β-catenin works remains to be elucidated. To identify, in vivo, the target genes of β-catenin in the liver, we have used the suppression subtractive hybridization technique and transgenic mice expressing an activated β-catenin in the liver that developed hepatomegaly. We identified three genes involved in glutamine metabolism, encoding glutamine synthetase (GS), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and the glutamate transporter GLT-1. By Northern blot and immunohistochemical analysis we demonstrated that these three genes were specifically induced by activation of the β-catenin pathway in the liver. In different mouse models bearing an activated β-catenin signaling in the liver known to be associated with hepatocellular proliferation we observed a marked up-regulation of these three genes. The cellular distribution of GS and GLT-1 parallels β-catenin activity. By contrast no up-regulation of these three genes was observed in the liver in which hepatocyte proliferation was induced by a signal-independent of β-catenin. In addition, the GS promoter was activated in the liver of GS+/LacZ mice by adenovirus vector-mediated β-catenin overexpression. Strikingly, the overexpression of the GS gene in human HCC samples was strongly correlated with β-catenin activation. Together, our results indicate that GS is a target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the liver. Because a linkage of the glutamine pathway to hepatocarcinogenesis has already been demonstrated, we propose that regulation of these three genes of glutamine metabolism by β-catenin is a contributing factor to liver carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2325068802,"Pluripotent cells of embryonic origin proliferate at unusually rapid rates and have a characteristic cell cycle structure with truncated gap phases. To define the molecular basis for this we have characterized the cell cycle control of murine embryonic stem cells and early primitive ectoderm-like cells. These cells display precocious Cdk2, cyclin A and cyclin E kinase activities that are conspicuously cell cycle independent. Suppression of Cdk2 activity significantly decreased cycling times of pluripotent cells, indicating it to be rate-limiting for rapid cell division, although this had no impact on cell cycle structure and the establishment of extended gap phases. Cdc2-cyclin B was the only Cdk activity that was identified to be cell cycle regulated in pluripotent cells. Cell cycle regulation of cyclin B levels and Y15 regulation of Cdc2 contribute to the temporal changes in Cdc2-cyclin B activity. E2F target genes are constitutively active throughout the cell cycle, reflecting the low activity of pocket proteins such as p107 and pRb and constitutive activity of pRb-kinases. These results show that rapid cell division cycles in primitive cells of embryonic origin are driven by extreme levels of Cdk activity that lack normal cell cycle periodicity."
https://openalex.org/W2028051736,"The multilineage differentiation capacity of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells offers a potential testing platform for gene products that mediate mammalian lineage determination and cellular specialization. Identification of such differentiation regulators is crucial to harnessing ES cells for pharmaceutical discovery and cell therapy. Here we describe the use of episomal expression technology for functional evaluation of cDNA clones during ES-cell differentiation in vitro. Several candidate cDNAs identified by subtractive cloning and expression profiling were introduced into ES cells in episomal expression constructs. Subsequent differentiation revealed that the Wnt antagonist Sfrp2 stimulates production of neural progenitors. The significance of this observation was substantiated by forced expression of Wnt-1 and treatment with lithium chloride, both of which inhibit neural differentiation. These findings reveal the importance of Wnt signaling in regulating ES-cell lineage diversification. More generally, this study establishes a path for rapid and direct validation of candidate genes in ES cells."

https://openalex.org/W2066555136,"Three-dimensional DNA nanoscaffolds such as supramolecular tetrahedra can self-assemble from tris-oligonucleotidyls — synthetic three-armed building blocks in which three identical or non-identical short DNA sequences are connected by a tris-linking backbone1,2. Here we show that the connectivity information contained in these building blocks can be copied by using template-directed tris-linking. This finding is a crucial step towards the replication of nanoarchitectures that are based on tris-oligonucleotidyls and to the realization of artificially self-replicating systems on a nanometre scale."

https://openalex.org/W2005356916,"The Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) gene product is involved in the repair of various types of base modifications in actively transcribed DNA sequences. To investigate its significance for the repair of endogenous oxidative DNA damage, homozygous csb(-/-)/ogg1(-/-) double knockout mice were generated. These combine the deficiency of CSB with that of OGG1, a gene coding for the mammalian repair glycosylase that initiates the base excision repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Compared to ogg1(-/-) mice, csb(-/-)/ogg1(-/-) mice were found to accumulate with age severalfold higher levels of oxidited purine modifications in hepatocytes, splenocytes and kidney cells. In contrast, the basal (steady-state) levels of oxidative DNA modifications in cells from csb(-/-) mice were not different from those in wild-type mice and did not increase with age. The analysis of the repair rates of additional oxidative DNA base modifications induced by photosensitization in immortalized embryonic fibroblasts was in accordance with these findings: compared to wild-type cells, the global repair was only slightly affected in csb(-/-) cells, more compromised in ogg1(-/-) cells, but virtually absent in csb(-/-)/ogg1(-/-) cells. An inhibition of transcription by alpha-amanitin did not block the Csb-dependent repair in ogg1(-/-) fibroblasts. The influence of Csb on the global repair of 8-oxoG was not detectable in assays with total protein extracts and in a shuttle vector system. The data indicate a role for Csb in the removal of 8-oxoG from the overall genome that is independent of both Ogg1-mediated base excision repair and regular transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2319655436,"We report here that the Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) gene is a novel target of transcriptional activation by EWS-FLI1 and EWS-ERG, two fusion proteins that characterize Ewing family tumors (EFTs). To identify downstream targets of these EWS-ETS fusion proteins, we introduced EWS-ETS fusion constructs into a human fibrosarcoma cell line by retroviral transduction. cDNA microarray analysis revealed that Id2 expression was up-regulated by introducing the EWS-ETS fusion gene but not by the normal full-length ETS gene. An Id2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay showed that transactivation by EWS-ETS involves the minimal Id2 promoter and may function in cooperation with c-Myc within the full-length regulatory region. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed direct interaction between the Id2 promoter and EWS-FLI1 fusion protein in vivo. Significantly higher expression of Id2 and c-Myc was observed in all of the six EFT cell lines examined compared to six other sarcoma cell lines. Moreover, high levels of Id2 expression were also observed in five of the six primary tumors examined. Id2 is generally thought to affect the balance between cell differentiation and proliferation in development and is highly expressed in several cancer types. Considering these previous studies, our data suggest that the oncogenic effect of EWS-ETS may be mediated in part by up-regulating Id2 expression. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1206025"

https://openalex.org/W2132775861,"We reported recently that the silencing of RUNX3 is causally related to gastric cancer in humans. Here we report that in three of four cell lines derived from N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mouse glandular stomach carcinomas, Runx3 is silenced due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region, as we also observed for human gastric cancer cells. Although two of the sites we tested in the promoter of the fourth line were not methylated, in all four cases the silencing of Runx3 could be reversed by treatment of the cells with 5'-azacytidine and trichostatin A. Interestingly, the exogenous expression of RUNX3 in cell lines that do not express the endogenous gene caused an inhibition of growth in soft agar, suggesting that anchorage-independent growth could be used as an assay of RUNX3 activity in vitro. These observations suggest that the mouse system described here may be useful as a model for the study of human gastric carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1993308414,"The ErbB-4 receptor tyrosine kinase has a PDZ domain recognition motif at its carboxyl terminus. The first step in ErbB-4 proteolytic processing is a metalloprotease-dependent cleavage of the receptor ectodomain, which is not influenced by deletion of this motif. Metalloprotease cleavage of ErbB-4 produces a membrane-associated 80-kDa fragment that is a substrate for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage, which releases the cytoplasmic domain from the membrane and allows nuclear translocation of this fragment. Deletion of the PDZ domain recognition motif does abrogate the γ-secretase cleavage of ErbB-4. The wild-type 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment forms an association complex with presenilin, thought to be the catalytic moiety of γ-secretase activity. However, this association is significantly impaired by loss of the PDZ domain recognition motif from ErbB-4. Deletion of this ErbB-4 motif prevents the nuclear localization of the ErbB-4 cytoplasmic domain. Data also show that the basal cleavage of wild-type ErbB-4 by this proteolytic system can produce a sufficient level of ErbB-4 processing to negatively influence cell growth and that loss of the PDZ domain recognition motif abrogates this response.

ErbB-4 is a type I receptor tyrosine kinase that binds heregulin (HRG) 1The abbreviations used are: HRG, heregulin; PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; APP, amyloid precursor protein; WT, wild-type; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LTR, long terminal repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: HRG, heregulin; PDZ, PSD-95/discs large/ZO-1; APP, amyloid precursor protein; WT, wild-type; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LTR, long terminal repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline (1Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5609) Google Scholar). HRG also binds to ErbB-3. In addition some ErbB-1 ligands (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, betacellulin, and epiregulin) are reported to activate ErbB-4. Recently, ErbB-4 was shown to be processed by a novel proteolytic pathway (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), analogous to that which generates cell fate determination responses after activation of the Notch nontyrosine kinase receptor (3De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe W.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan A. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is also processed in a similar manner (4Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The first step in this pathway is cleavage within the ectodomain close to the plasma membrane. In the case of ErbB-4, this cleavage is stimulatable by TPA (5Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and, in some cell lines, by HRG (6Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This proteolytic event results in the release of a 120-kDa ErbB-4 fragment into the extracellular milieu and the cellular retention of an 80-kDa membrane-associated fragment. Ectodomain cleavage requires the transmembrane metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (7Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). After ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4, the cell-associated 80-kDa fragment containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains is cleaved by a γ-secretase activity releasing the cytoplasmic domain into the cytosol (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 8Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cytoplasmic domain fragment of ErbB-4 translocates into the nucleus. The function of the 80-kDa fragment in the nucleus is not known, although the carboxyl-terminal region of this fragment does display weak activity in the GAL4 transcription activation assay (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Importantly, γ-secretase inhibitors block the induction of cell death by HRG when T47D carcinoma cells are placed in serum-free media (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The nuclear localization of other receptor tyrosine kinases, including ErbB-1 (9Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), ErbB-3 (10Offterdinger M. Schöfer C. Weipoltshammer K. Grunt T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (11Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), have been described, but these do not appear to involve proteolytic processing of the receptors. At this time relatively little is known about how transmembrane metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme and γ-secretase recognize their substrates. In this study, evidence is provided that ErbB-4 PDZ domain recognition motif is necessary for γ-secretase cleavage. HRG β1 was purchased from R&D Systems. The cDNA for human ErbB-4 and rabbit antiserum to a carboxyl-terminal sequence (residues 1108–1264) of human ErbB-4 was generously provided by Dr. Matthias Kraus (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL) and used for Western blotting. Polyclonal antibodies C-18 to an epitope in the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-4 and H-70 to an epitope in the amino terminus of presenilin 1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (13-5900) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents, and TPA were obtained from Sigma. The γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E (12Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H.

Nuclear export signal inhibitor leptomycin B was provided by Dr. Minoru Yoshida (University of Tokyo, Japan). G418 sulfate was obtained from Mediatech Inc. All other chemicals were reagent grade from Sigma. COS7 and NIH3T3 cell lines were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. These cells and all NIH3T3-derived cells, described below, were routinely grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech Inc.). Experimental cultures were generally grown in 100-mm culture dishes until 90% confluence unless otherwise noted in the text. LTR-W.T.ErbB4 is an ErbB-4 expression vector under the control of a LTR promoter and is described elsewhere (13Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). It contains a neomycin selection marker. To produce a cDNA construct to express ErbB-4 with the carboxyl-terminal three residues TVV truncated, an 18-mer upstream primer, 5′-GACTACCTGCAGGAGTAC-3′, was synthesized to match a sequence within ErbB-4 cDNA containing a BamHI site. Also, a 31-mer downstream primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAATTCCGGTGTCTGTAAGG-3′, was made containing a SalI site next to stop code TAA, which terminates translation 9 bp before the wild-type ErbB-4 stop sequence. PCR amplification of LTR-W.T.ErbB4 cDNA with the above primers produced a 160-bp fragment that was then cut with BamHI andSalI to generate cohesive ends. The LTR-W.T.ErbB4 construct was processed to remove the small fragment between BamHI andSalI (next to the stop codon), and the PCR product was inserted into the exact site. The resulting construct, called LTR-ΔTVV, contains ErbB-4 cDNA with 9 bp corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal three residues, i.e. TVV, deleted. The mutant construct was verified by enzymatic digestion and DNA sequencing. For gene transfection, COS7 and NIH3T3 cells were transfected with LTR-W.T.ErbB4 or LTR-ΔTVV using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Typically, 2.0–2.5 μg of DNA was used to transfect cells in a 100-mm dish. COS7 cells were assayed for ErbB-4 receptor function 36–48 h after transfection. Stably transfected NIH3T3 cell lines were obtained after selection in G418 sulfate (400 μg/ml) for 2 months. Each stably transfected cell line, either WT ErbB-4 or ΔTVV mutant, represents a pool of several individual colonies. For each receptor species, two stable cell lines from independent transfections were established and assayed. Cell lysates were obtained essentially as described previously (5Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 90% confluent cell monolayers in 100 mm dishes were incubated overnight in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS (or 1% FBS, as indicated in the text). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with the indicated additions for the indicated times. Next, the cells were washed three times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS) and lysed in 1 ml of cold TGH lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm NaF) or mild TGH lysis buffer, having reduced levels of Triton X-100 (0.2%) and NaCl (20 mm). The lysed cells were scraped from the dish and placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C, and the supernatants were saved for Western blotting or immunoprecipitation. Preparation of membrane and cytosol fractions was described previously (5Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To analyze ErbB-4 in total cell lysates, ∼1–2 mg of cell lysate were immunoprecipitated and underwent Western blotting or ∼50 μg underwent blotting without immunoprecipitation. To assess ErbB-4 in cytosol and membrane fractions, equal volumes of each fraction representing equal numbers of cells were immunoprecipitated and then blotted. To precipitate proteins, ∼4 μg of ErbB-4 or presenilin 1 antibody was incubated (2 h at 4 °C) with lysates followed by a 1-h incubation with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Immune complexes were washed three times with the same lysis buffer (TGH or mild TGH), resuspended in 1× Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Subsequently, samples were electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Membranes were blocked by a 1-h incubation at room temperature in TBST buffer (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (for tyrosine phosphorylation detection) or 5% nonfat dry milk (for all others). Subsequently, ErbB-4 antiserum or phosphotyrosine antibody was added for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. Membranes were then washed thrice with TBST buffer, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A for 1 h, and after being washed with TBST buffer, visualized by ECL. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. The cells were then rehydrated with PBS for 10 min and, after a 45-min blocking period using 10% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS, were incubated with C-18 ErbB-4 antibody for 45 min. After thorough washing (three times in PBS), secondary antibody Alexa FluorTM 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes) was added for 30 min. The cells were then mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc.). A Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with ×40 (1.3 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective lens, and the single fluorochrome filter set for Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes) was used for visualization and recording images. The carboxyl terminus of ErbB-4 encodes a PDZ domain recognition motif that has been demonstrated to facilitate interaction with PSD95, a multi-PDZ domain-containing protein that is highly expressed in neuronal cells (14Garcia R.A. Vasudevan K. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y.-Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of ErbB-4 interaction with PDZ domains is not known. To test the possible functional role of the PDZ domain binding motif in ErbB-4, the three carboxyl-terminal residues that define this motif (16Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), were deleted to create the ErbB-4 mutant designated ΔTVV. We first tested by transient expression in COS7 cells the capacity of HRG to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of both WT ErbB-4 and the ΔTVV mutant. The results (Fig. 1 A) demonstrate that both forms of ErbB-4 are activated by exogenous HRG. Subsequently, permanent cell lines expressing WT ErbB-4 or the ΔTVV mutant were obtained by transfection of NIH3T3 cells, which do not endogenously express any ErbB family members. In these cells, HRG also activated both receptor isoforms to approximately equivalent extents (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with growth factor-dependent activation of both ErbB-4 species, HRG also activated Erk1 and Erk2 protein kinases when added to cells expressing WT ErbB-4 or the ΔTVV mutant (data not shown). The above results show that loss of the PDZ domain recognition motif does not abrogate ligand-dependent receptor activation and by inference cell surface expression. This result is slightly in contrast to a previous report which concluded that the ErbB-4 PDZ domain recognition motif was required for maximal growth factor activation of this receptor (15Huang Y.-Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The ΔTVV mutation of ErbB-4 was evaluated to assess the potential role of the PDZ domain recognition motif in the proteolytic processing pathway, which requires the participation of at least two integral membrane proteases. The initial step in this pathway is the metalloprotease cleavage of ErbB-4, which produces an 80-kDa membrane-associated fragment (5Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When cells expressing WT ErbB-4 or the ΔTVV mutant were treated with TPA, the 80-kDa fragment was produced at approximately the same rate from both receptor species for the first 60 min, as shown in Fig. 2. However, at a later time (3 h) the 80-kDa fragment generated in cells expressing the ErbB-4 ΔTVV mutant remained at a significant level, whereas the level of the fragment generated in cells expressing the wild-type receptor had significantly declined. These results indicate that whereas the ΔTVV mutation did not influence the metalloprotease cleavage of ErbB-4, the cell-associated fragment generated from the mutant receptor was significantly more metabolically stable. One means by which the membrane-associated 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment is metabolized is by γ-secretase cleavage. This cleavage converts the membrane-associated fragment, designated m80, to a cytosolic fragment, designated s80 (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Therefore, the TPA-dependent formation of the m80 and s80 ErbB-4 fragments from the WT and ΔTVV ErbB-4 receptors were examined 30 min after the addition of the agonist. Detection of anti-ErbB-4 reactive bands in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3) shows that the full-length (180-kDa) WT ErbB-4 and ΔTVV mutant proteins are degraded in the presence of TPA and that the m80 fragment is generated from each. However, the s80 ErbB-4 fragment is readily detected only in cells that express the WT receptor. Only a very low level of s80 is produced in cells expressing the ΔTVV mutant. After quantitating the s80 bands, it is estimated that production of this fragment is reduced by 90–95% in the ΔTVV mutant. The above results indicate that introduction of the ΔTVV mutation selectively abrogates conversion by γ-secretase of the mutant m80 ErbB-4 fragment to the s80 fragment. γ-Secretase catalytic activity is generally considered to be a property of presenilin proteins; however, this point remains unclear (17Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Other substrates of γ-secretase, such as APP and Notch, have been found to co-precipitate with presenilins (PS1, PS2) (18Xia W. Zhang J. Perez R. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A co-precipitation strategy was employed to ascertain whether presenilin associates with ErbB-4 and whether this is influenced by the receptor's PDZ domain recognition motif. The results, as shown in Fig. 4 (left panel), demonstrate that when PS1 is immunoprecipitated from untreated cells expressing the WT ErbB-4 receptor, anti-ErbB-4 reactive proteins are detected representing the full-length ErbB-4 (180-kDa) and the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment. When TPA is added to these cells, however, the level of 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment detected in the PS1 immunoprecipitate is greatly increased, as is the amount of 80-kDa fragment in these cells. Comparison of the amount of full-length ErbB-4 in untreated cells and 80-kDa fragment in TPA-treated cells suggests that PS1 associates preferentially with the 80-kDa fragment, which mostly represents the m80 γ-secretase substrate. In contrast, an almost undetectable level of ErbB-4 reactivity is found in PS1 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the ΔTVV mutant. The data in the right panelshow that in both cell types equal levels of full-length ErbB-4 are present and that in the presence of TPA the 80-kDa fragment is also detected at equivalent levels in both cell types. The results suggest that s80 is not generated from the m80 ΔTVV ErbB-4 mutant, because the latter fragment is unable to associate with PS1. The presence of PS2 in these cells was not detectable. If the absence of a PDZ domain recognition motif prevents efficient γ-secretase cleavage of ErbB-4, then it would be expected that the ΔTVV mutant receptor would fail to be translocated to the nucleus after the addition of TPA. The data in Fig. 5 show that whereas TPA addition to cells expressing the WT ErbB-4 receptor does provoke nuclear localization of ErbB-4 immunoreactivity, similar treatment of cells expressing the ΔTVV mutant reveals no nuclear ErbB-4 signal even if leptomycin B (23Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) is added to prevent nuclear export. The data additionally demonstrate that if leptomycin B is added but the cells are not stimulated with TPA, ErbB-4 reactive material is present in the nucleus of cells expressing the WT receptor but not in cells that express the ΔTVV mutant. This basal level of nuclear localized ErbB-4 is prevented in the cells expressing WT receptor by addition of the γ-secretase inhibitor Compound E (12Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higak J.N. Prakash S.R. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. Arneric S.P. Hartig P.R. Robertson D.W. Cordell B. Stern A.M.

When T47D mammary carcinoma cells are placed in serum-free medium, HRG-induced ErbB-4 cleavage leads to cell death in a manner that requires γ-secretase activity (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of the ErbB-4 cytoplasmic domain in COS cells results in cell death (8Lee H.J. Jung K.M. Huang Y.Z. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although a basal level of ErbB-4 cleavage exists in all cell systems, this was not sufficient to influence survival of the T47D cells. To investigate further the potential biological significance of basal ErbB-4 cleavage, the survival of the transfected NIH3T3 cells used in the experiments described herein was evaluated. The data in Fig. 6 show that when cells expressing WT ErbB-4 or the ΔTVV mutant are placed in serum-free medium, the WT ErbB-4 cells initially survived and slightly increased in cell number, but by day 3 nearly all had died. In contrast, cells that express the ΔTVV mutant ErbB-4 survive under the same culture conditions for at least 4 days. This result indicates that cells expressing the γ-secretase cleavable WT ErbB-4 are sensitive to cell death under these conditions, but the ΔTVV mutant does not produce a signal that provokes cell death. This also suggests that in these NIH3T3 cells, basal ErbB-4 cleavage is sufficient to provoke a cell response. To confirm that γ-secretase activity is necessary for this growth response, the experiment was repeated in the presence of Compound E, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor (12Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higak J.N. Prakash S.R. Combs A.P. Copeland R.A. Arneric S.P. Hartig P.R. Robertson D.W. Cordell B.

The cells were plated as described in Fig. 6, and cell numbers were determined 3 days later (Table I). The results demonstrate that only 14% of the cells expressing the WT ErbB-4 survived under these conditions, whereas 88% of the cells expressing the ΔTVV mutant survived. The addition of Compound E almost completely prevented cell death in cells expressing the WT ErbB-4 receptor but did not significantly alter the response of cells that express the ΔTVV mutant.Table IInfluence of γ-secretase inhibitor on cell growthAdditionsFinal cell number (×1000)WTΔTVVNone27.3 ± 11.4176.7 ± 12.3Compound E283.7 ± 32.9153.7 ± 11.5Approximately 2 × 105 cells expressing WT ErbB-4 or the ΔTVV mutant were plated in complete medium.

Each cell count represents triplicate determination. The major conclusion of the experimental results presented in the manuscript is that PDZ domains have a central role in the mechanism by which ErbB-4 is recognized and processed by γ-secretase activity. This proteolytic step seems to involve intramembranous cleavage of ErbB-4 and results in the release of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain (s80) into the cytosol and nucleus (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The immediate substrate for γ-secretase activity is not the full-length ErbB-4 but rather a membrane-associated fragment (m80) that is derived from the native receptor by metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of the receptor ectodomain (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The steps in this proteolytic pathway for ErbB-4 are analogous to those described for the proteolytic processing of Notch, a nontyrosine kinase receptor, and APP, a nonreceptor transmembrane molecule. The intramembranous cleavage of all three substrates requires γ-secretase activity. However, the cleavage sites in Notch and APP are dissimilar in sequence and relative location within the transmembrane domain (17Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Hence, γ-secretase recognition is not thought to depend on substrate primary sequence information, as is the case with many other proteases. The transmembrane sequence of ErbB-4 is unlike that of Notch or APP. The data presented herein show that the carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain recognition motif of ErbB-4 is required for γ-secretase cleavage of the ErbB-4 m80 fragment. This motif is also necessary for association of PS1 with the m80 ErbB-4 fragment. These results imply that the target of this ErbB-4 motif plays an important role in mediating intramembranous cleavage of ErbB-4. Others have identified PSD95 as one target of the ErbB-4 carboxyl-terminal sequence (14Garcia R.A. Vasudevan K. Buonanno A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3596-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Huang Y.-Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). PSD95, which is highly expressed in neuronal cells, contains three PDZ domains, two of which recognize ErbB-4. In neuronal tissue PSD95 functions to organize specialized complexes of transmembrane proteins (16Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In the non-neuronal cells used in the experiments described herein, we have been able to detect PSD95 family members in ErbB-4, but not PS1, immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Interestingly, the carboxyl terminus of the Cooh-terminal fragment of PS1 also contains a PDZ domain recognition sequence, and PDZ domain containing-proteins that recognize PS1 through this motif have been reported (22Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Xu X. Shi Y. Wu X. Gambetti P. Sui D. Cui M.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32543-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hence, it seems plausible to suggest that ErbB-4 association with γ-secretase involves PDZ domain-containing proteins acting as a scaffold to bridge the two molecules. Both APP and Notch have also been shown to associate with PS1 using co-precipitation methodology. However, the associations are not known to be direct and may involve other molecules. In the APP/PS1 association, evidence exists that a PDZ domain-containing protein interacts by a PDZ domain with PS1 and by another domain with APP (22Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because PDZ domain-containing proteins often multimerize, it is possible that multiple proteins having PDZ domains could facilitate ErbB-4 association with γ-secretase activity. Alternatively, it is possible that mutation of the ErbB-4 PDZ domain recognition motif alters the cell surface trafficking of ErbB-4 and prevents γ-secretase cleavage. We thank Dr. T. Golde for Compound E, Dr. M. Yoshida for leptomycin B, and Dr. M. Kraus for ErbB-4 antibody."

Unfortunately, because nothing is known about the molecular determinants that control the intracellular trafficking and cell surface targeting of hTHTR1, the precise cellular defect of such clinically isolated mutants remains undefined.Through analogy with other nutrient transporters, the intracellular trafficking and cell surface targeting processes likely involve specific molecular “motifs” within the amino acid sequence of hTHTR1. Such determinants can either be localized within specific regions of the polypeptide or result from protein conformation generated from sequences throughout the entire polypeptide sequence (16Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Lalioti V. Vergarajauregui S. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify regions of hTHTR1 important for cell surface targeting, we applied confocal imaging techniques to monitor both the steady-state distribution and real-time trafficking of seven hTHTR1 fusion proteins tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We have chosen a human duodenal cell line (HuTu-80) for these studies, because hTHTR1 is expressed at higher levels in human duodenum than other intestinal epithelia (11Reidling J.C. Subramanian V.S. Dudeja P.K. Said H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1561: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results show that (i) integrity of both the NH2-terminal sequence and the transmembrane backbone play an important role in the cell surface expression of hTHTR1; (ii) truncation of the backbone of hTHTR1 between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains, at a locus where several clinical TRMA mutations cluster (7Raz T. Labay V. Baron D. Szargel R. anbinder Y. Barrett T. Rabl W. Viana M.B. Mandel H. Baruchel A. Cayuela J.M. Cohen N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 13: 37-42Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Neufield E.J.

These results highlight how hTHTR1 is delivered to the cell surface of mammalian epithelia within a physiologically relevant context and define the regions of hTHTR1 in which mutation would likely impair thiamine absorption through disruption of normal cellular targeting mechanisms.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the physiological behavior of hTHTR1 within intestinal epithelial cell lines with regard to three issues. First, what regions of the hTHTR1 polypeptide are important for targeting hTHTR1 to the cell surface? Second, how do clinically relevant hTHTR1 truncations affect the cellular targeting of hTHTR1? Third, what cytoskeletal elements mediate hTHTR1 trafficking? To resolve these questions, we employed confocal microscopy to image the dynamics of hTHTR1-EGFP fusion proteins. This strategy has proved a powerful approach to monitor the targeting and expression of nutrient transporters and other proteins, because it allows localization with high spatial and temporal resolution in live cells (18Marchant J.S.

Heterologous expression of hTHTR1-EGFP in either mammalian epithelial cell lines (Figs. 3 and 5 A) or the Xenopus oocyte expression system (Fig. 2 A), resulted predominantly in expression of hTHTR1-EGFP fluorescence at the cell surface, as expected for a transporter protein, as well as in cellular processes extending from the plasma membrane and a variety of intracellular structures (see below). Ligation of EGFP to the COOH terminus of hTHTR1 did not impair functionality, as assessed by [3H]thiamine accumulation in both Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2 B), and a stably expressing human duodenal cell line (Fig. 5 C).Regions of hTHTR1 Important for Cellular TargetingThe delivery of proteins to specific cellular compartments depends on the presence of targeting commands embedded as primary sequence, structural conformations, or post-translational processing signals within the protein structure (27Matter K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6825-6833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and/or the transmembrane backbone regions of individual proteins (18Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we show that both NH2-terminal sequence (within amino acids 19–29) as well as determinants within the transmembrane backbone are important in directing the expression and consequent export of hTHTR1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. First, the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic region (amino acids 480–497) was unimportant for plasma membrane targeting, because removal of this region failed to prevent cell surface localization (hTHTR1-(1–479)-EGFP). In contrast, removal of the NH2-terminal sequence (amino acids 1–29) prevented cell surface expression of the truncated protein (hTHTR1-(30–497)-EGFP), which was retained within intracellular membranes (Fig. 4 C). Second, the NH2-terminal sequence alone was not sufficient for cell surface expression, because hTHTR1-(1–240)-EGFP, a construct in which the entire NH2-terminal sequence was preserved, but the polypeptide backbone was truncated after six transmembrane helices, was retained within intracellular membranes. The role of the polypeptide backbone was underscored by the observation that hTHTR1-(19–486) in which both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions were partially truncated, but the integrity of the transmembrane domains preserved, was targeted to the cell surface (Fig. 4, A and F). Further experiments are needed to delimit whether polypeptide backbone integrity per se, or specific determinants downstream of the truncation site, are needed for plasma membrane expression. The important point is that, if COOH determinants exist, they do not function in isolation, because hTHTR1-(241–479) was also defective at export from intracellular membranes. Most likely, plasma membrane targeting is dependent on both NH2-terminal sequence and determinants distributed throughout the hTHTR1 polypeptide backbone.A final important point relates to our knowledge of targeting determinants in other members of the SLC19A gene family. As the protein product of the SLC19A2 gene, hTHTR1 shares significant sequence identity (∼40% (2Dutta B. Huang W. Molero M. Kekuda R. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. J. Biol.

Cohen N. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We recently analyzed the effect of specific domain ablations on hRFC targeting (18Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1477-G1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrated that polypeptide backbone integrity plays a crucial role in the plasma membrane expression of hRFC. This result mimics that observed here with hTHTR1, in that the polypeptide backbone of either transporter (hTHTR1-(19–486)-EGFP or hRFC-(19–466)-EGFP) with minimal flanking sequence is sufficient to direct cell surface expression. One subtle difference with hTHTR-1 is that the NH2-terminal sequence (amino acids 19–29) is more critical for cell surface expression than the corresponding region in hRFC (18Marchant J.S. Subramanian V.S. Parker I. Said H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This may relate to the difference in net positive charge of the NH2-terminal domain of hTHTR1 (“+4”) compared with hRFC (“0”), which may be crucial in directing appropriate protein translocation and folding within the endoplasmic reticulum membranes (34Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19101-19109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overall these results suggest the possible conservation of targeting mechanisms between these closely related cousins within the major facilitator superfamily of transporters (35Goswitz V.C. Brokker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether this homology extends to hTHTR2, the protein product of the recently characterized SLC19A3 gene (36Eudy J.D. Spiegel O. Barber R.C. Wlodarczyk B.J. Talbot J.

Three of these truncations (239, 250, and 259 amino acids (8Diaz G.A. Banikazemi M. Oishi K. Desnick R.J. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)) result in premature termination within a region normally between the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices (10Labay V. Raz T.

Confocal imaging of hTHTR1-(1–240)-EGFP showed that the truncated protein is retained within intracellular membranes (Fig. 4 C), with no visible cell surface expression (Fig. 4 E). Therefore, the three clinically relevant truncations occurring within this same region likely result in abrogation of cell surface expression. Because the four upstream truncations (after amino acids 66, 97, 127, and 162) lack further amino acids (Refs. 7Raz T. Labay V. Baron D. Szargel R. anbinder Y. Barrett T. Rabl W. Viana M.B. Mandel H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33325-33333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Intracellular Trafficking of hTHTR1-EGFPGeneration of a stable hTHTR1-EGFP-expressing duodenal cell line facilitated analysis of hTHTR1-EGFP trafficking as synthesis of hTHTR1-EGFP was ongoing and the population of intracellular fluorescent structures more numerous than with transient transfection. The steady-state distribution of hTHTR1-EGFP was defined by a strong cell surface expression, together with considerable fluorescence within a juxtanuclear pool, most likely the Golgi apparatus. Vesicular motility was critically dependent on an intact microtubular cytoskeleton, as shown by the effects of pharmacological disruption with nocodazole or colchicine, but not γ-lumicolchicine as a negative control (Fig. 7). Furthermore, video-rate confocal measurements of vesicular dynamics (Fig. 6, average moving velocities of ∼1.7 μm/s and run lengths of ∼3 μm) are consistent with microtubule-based transport of different cargos in other cell types (39Trinczek B. Ebneth A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2355-2367PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fletcher L.M. Welsh G.I. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), as well as speeds of microtubule-based motors measured in vitro (41Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). A striking result was the observation of multidirectional vesicular motion, both toward and away from the cell surface, as well as circumferential movements beneath the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). These images suggest that the trafficking and insertion of hTHTR1 into the plasma membrane may be physiologically regulated events, and we are currently investigating mechanisms that may influence the net progression of hTHTR1 transporters toward, and removal from, the cell surface.SummaryThese studies show that, unlike many nutrient transporters, the molecular determinants that dictate hTHTR1 targeting to the cell surface are not located within the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the polypeptide but are dependent on residues within both the NH2-terminal region and the polypeptide backbone. Premature truncation of the polypeptide backbone, as seen in several independent clinical mutations in hTHTR1, causes intracellular retention of the protein. Finally, trafficking of hTHTR1 to the cell surface is critically dependent on intact microtubules but not microfilaments. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble micronutrient that is essential for many cellular functions relating to growth and development. For example, thiamine pyrophosphate (the coenzyme form) is important for normal carbohydrate metabolism and energy production (1Berdanier C.D. Advanced Nutrition Micronutrients.

Thiamine is not synthesized by humans and other mammals and is obtained from dietary sources via absorption into intestinal epithelia. Deficiencies in cellular thiamine accumulation lead to cardiovascular and neurological disorders and are associated with the inherited condition of thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA)1 (1Berdanier C.D.

The enzyme structure shares significant similarity to the α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily, in which the β-strands in both barrels superimpose well.

One zinc ion is coordinated by Cys96, His220, and His250, while the other is loosely chelated by His67, His69, and Cys96. This is the first example of the metal ion coordination by a cysteine residue in the superfamily. Therefore, d-aminoacylase defines a novel subset and is a mononuclear zinc metalloenzyme but containing a binuclear active site. The preferred substrate was modeled into a hydrophobic pocket, revealing the substrate specificity and enzyme catalysis. The 63-residue insertion containing substrate-interacting residues may act as a gate controlling access to the active site, revealing that the substrate binding would induce a closed conformation to sequester the catalysis from solvent. d-Aminoacylase is an attractive candidate for commercial production of d-amino acids through its catalysis in the hydrolysis ofN-acyl-d-amino acids.

N-Acyl-d-amino acid amidohydrolases (d-aminoacylases, EC 3.5.1.14) catalyze the zinc-assisted hydrolysis of N-acyl-d- amino acids to produce the corresponding d-amino acids, which are intermediates in the preparation of pesticides, bioactive peptides, and antibiotics. Recently, d-amino acids have been found in bacteria, plants, and animals, and their physiological functions have received increased attention. Production of l-amino acids by optical resolution using l-aminoacylase immobilized on DEAE-Sephadex has been used in industry. Therefore, production ofd-amino acids using d-aminoacylase has commercial importance. Several d-aminoacylases screened from microorganisms in various soils have been isolated and characterized (1Yang Y.B. Lin C.S. Tseng C.P. Wang Y.J. Tsai Y.C. Appl. Environ.

Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) revealed a common ellipsoidal (βα)8-barrel with conserved metal ligands, four histidines and one aspartate, at the C-terminal ends of strands β1 (HXH), β5 (His), β6 (His), and β8 (Asp), and led to discovery of the α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily. The five metal ligands are strictly conserved and define a subtle but sharp sequence signature in this superfamily. On the basis of the metal centers in the known crystal structures, the superfamily has been divided into two subsets: urease (13Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A.

TheR free value is for a 5% test set (5,056 reflections). The DA1 d-aminoacylase has 483 amino acids, and the current model contains residues 7–480 with clear electron density. The protein is composed of a small β-barrel (residues 7–61 and 425–480) and a catalytic α/β-barrel (residues 62–414) (Fig. 1). There are two insertions in the α/β-barrel: residues 147–165 between the β3 strand and α3-helix, forming a helix and a random coil, and residues 285–347 between β7 and α7, forming two helices and four β strands. The latter 63-residue insertion across the active site is involved in the substrate-mediated conformational change (see below). There are two large loops between β2 and α2 (residues 99–127) and between β8 and β8 (residues 366–398). Structural similarity search by DALI (25Dietmann S. Park J. Notredame C. Heger A. Lappe M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) revealed that the closest structural matches of d-aminoacylase are seven members of the recently identified α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily mentioned above (13Jabri E.

Structural comparison reveals that the β-strands in both the small β barrel and the catalytic α/β-barrel correspond closely, whereas the external helices and surface-exposed loops diverge significantly. Despite the apparent lack of sequence similarity, the eight β-strands (56 structurally equivalent residues) of the α/β-barrels overlay within 1.2–2.0 Å r.m.s. deviations (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, the size of the small β-domain, comprising both the N and the C termini, varies greatly in different structures. The β-strands of the β-domains (48 structurally equivalent residues) overlay within 1.0–1.3 Å r.m.s. deviations (Fig. 2 B). The small β-barrel does not contribute any residues to the active site and appears to play a structural role. Unexpectedly, the active site contains only one tightly bound metal ion (Fig. 3 A). On the basis of the atomic absorption analysis (10Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and the zinc anomalous data, this metal ion is assigned as zinc. The zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated by Cys96 Sγ (2.24 Å), His220 Nδ1 (2.08 Å), His250Nε2 (2.04 Å), and an acetate molecule, ACT1 O2 (2.04 Å), from the crystallization solution. There is another potential metal-binding site, surrounded by His67, His69, Cys96, Asp366, and ACT1, and similar to the metal-binding sites in the α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily (13Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 14Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A small electron density at this site is observed after structural refinement (Fig. 3 A). The electron density at this site becomes much stronger in the crystals soaking with 100 mm zinc acetate. In addition, the zinc content of the purified recombinant DA1d-aminoacylase was measured to be between 1.3–1.5 g·atom per mole of enzyme (10Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, the weak electron density is assigned as zinc, which is tetrahedrally ligated by His67Ne2 (2.01 Å), His69 Nε2 (2.05 Å), Cys96 Sγ (2.19 Å), and ACT1 O1 (2.26 Å), and separated from the tightly bound zinc by 3.1 Å. The crystallographic refinement resulted in an occupancy of 0.25 with B-factor of 19.3 Å2 for the loosely bound zinc ion and an occupancy of 1.0 with B-factor of 7.3 Å2 for the tightly bound zinc. Thus, the DA1 d-aminoacylase binds two zinc ions with widely different affinities. Only the tightly bound zinc is required for the enzyme activity, because the isolated enzyme exhibits significant activity. Addition of extrinsic zinc ions does not enhance the enzyme activity. A large excess of zinc ions even strongly inhibits the enzyme activity (data not shown). Therefore, the DA1d-aminoacylase is a mononuclear enzyme but contains a binuclear active site, bearing an interesting analogy to the β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus (26Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Struct. Fold. Des. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 27Fabiane S.M. Sohi M.K. Wan T. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Mitchell T.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Even though β-lactamases share significant sequence identity (34%) with highly conserved metal ligands, the enzyme from Bacteroides fragilis has a binuclear zinc center with similar metal affinities (K d ∼10 μm), whereas the B. cereus enzyme binds zinc ions with very distinct affinities (K d ∼1 μm and 25 mm, respectively). The crystal structures suggested that the weak metal binding may be due to the local electrostatic environment (26Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Struct. Fold. Des. 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and theB. cereus enzyme functionally behaves as a monozinc enzyme and may be an evolutionary intermediate between the mono- and bi-zinc metallo-β-lactamases (27Fabiane S.M.

To date, there are two subsets in the α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily based on the metal centers with four conserved histidines and one aspartate (Fig. 3 B). In the binuclear subset (13Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 14Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

Biol. 2002; 320: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the more buried metal ion (α site) is coordinated by the first two conserved histidines from the common zinc-binding HXH motif (29Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2715-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the conserved aspartate, and two bridging ligands, whereas the more solvent-exposed metal ion (β site) is chelated by the other two conserved histidines and the bridging ligands, consisting of a carboxylated lysine (or a glutamate) and one water molecule (or a hydroxide ion). On the other hand, in the second subset (18Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 19Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the metal is bound only at the α site ligated by the first three conserved histidines and one water molecule. In d-aminoacylase, one zinc ion binds strongly at the β site, and the other binds weakly at the α site. This is the first example of a cysteine residue (Cys96) that coordinates to a zinc ion in this superfamily (Fig. 3 B). Mutational and atomic absorption spectroscopic studies revealed that this cysteine residue contributes the most toward the interactions with the zinc ions among the ligands, because the mutant C96A shows the least zinc binding affinity (10Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, the unique metal center ofd-aminoacylase defines a novel subset, in which two metal ions bind to the binuclear metal center with different affinities and are bridged by a thiolate ligand (cysteine) instead of a carboxylate ligand (carboxylated lysine or glutamate). Structural superposition demonstrates that the metal centers in the same subset are virtually identical (10Hsu C.S. Lai W.L. Chang W.W. Liaw S.H. Tsai Y.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Abendroth J. Niefind K. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Remarkably, superposition of the metal centers in different subsets,i.e. d-aminoacylse, urease, and cytosine deaminase, reveals that the metal ligands are also at the similar spatial positions, with Cys96 occupying the position of the carboxylated lysine (Fig. 3 B). In cytosine deaminase and adenosine deaminase, the third conserved histidine compensates the missing carboxylated lysine. Approximately two-thirds phosphotriesterase homology proteins such as those from human, mouse, rat, fly, Bacillus, Salmonella, andEscherichia coli, use a glutamate instead of the carboxylated lysine, resulting a larger structural difference at the β4 strand in the α/β-barrel (15; Fig. 2 A). The zinc-zinc distance of 3.1 Å in d-aminoacylase is similar to the nickel-nickel distance of 3.1 Å in the β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)-inhibited Bacillus pasteurii urease (30Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. Ciurli S. Mangani S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 268-273Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but it is significantly shorter than those (3.4–3.8 Å) in the other crystal structures of the binuclear members (13Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 14Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M.

Des. 1999; 7: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A screening of the Cambridge Structural Data base reveals that the bridging thiolate sulfur atoms would shorten the di-metal distance. Therefore, the shorter di-metal distance ind-aminoacylase and in β-ME urease can be considered as an intrinsic property of the metallic core. Two acetate molecules from the crystallization solution are observed in the active site region (Fig. 4 A). The first one (ACT1) ligating the zinc ion(s) may occupy the product acetate-binding site in the hydrolysis ofN-acteyl-d-amino acid. The second one (ACT2) forms extensive interactions with Lys252 Nζ(2.7 Å), Arg377 Nη1 (2.7 Å), Nη2 (3.0 Å), Tyr283 Oη (2.8 Å), and Ser289 N (2.8 Å), suggesting that this acetate molecule occupies the binding position of the substrate carboxylate group. Around this region, there is a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Phe191, Tyr192, Lys252, Met254, Leu298, Tyr344, Met346, and Met347. On the basis of three assumptions, the preferred substrateN-acetyl-d-methionine was modeled into the active site (Fig. 4 B). First, the carboxylate group occupies the position of that of ACT2 because of the extensive interactions mentioned above. Second, the side chain binds at the hydrophobic pocket. And third, according to the structural studies of other α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily members (13Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A.

After modeling, the energy minimization was performed by CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) as the structural refinement. The model of the bound substrate reveals that the carboxylate and the amide oxygen atoms occupy the positions of acetate oxygen atoms as expected. The amide nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with Ser289 O (2.8 Å), and the amide carbon is in close proximity to the predicted water molecule. The side chain packs into the hydrophobic pocket surrounded by Thr290, Phe191, Lys252, Met254, and Met347, in which Leu298, Tyr344, and Met346 constitute the pocket base. The substrate methionine side chain Cε and Sδ have close contacts with Leu298 Cδ1 (3.3 Å), Cδ2 (3.2 Å), Tyr344 Cδ2 (3.4 Å), Thr290Cγ2 (3.4 Å), and Phe191 Cξ(4.2 Å). In particular, Leu298, directly facing toward the substrate, may be important for the substrate specificity, because thed-aminoacylases with glutamate or aspartate preference contain an arginine residue at this position. Thed-aminoacylase structure here seems a closed conformation, because the active-site cavity is almost inaccessible to solvent (Fig. 5). The zinc ions lie in the deepest part of the active site, and the hydrophobic side chain is close to the opening of the pocket. The narrow opening of the cavity is capped by the 63-residue insertion. The 63-residue insertion borders the active site and contains many putative substrate-interacting residues as mentioned above. This domain may act as a gate controlling access to the active site, affecting both substrate access and product release. Particularly, the two antiparallel β-strands (residues 287–293 and 339–346) may act as the fulcrum of the conformational change, because substrate-contacting residues are located in these regions. The closed conformation described here may be due to the interaction between the second acetate ACT2 and Tyr283 and Ser289, sealing the entrance. Then the substrate binding would induce a closed conformation to sequester the reaction complex from solvent. This type of conformational switch upon the substrate binding is also observed in other α/β-barrel amidohydolases, including adenosine deaminase (18Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), cytosine deaminase (19Ireton G.C. McDermott G. Black M.E. Stoddard B.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and urease (30Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. Ciurli S. Mangani S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 268-273Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. Miletti S. Ciurli S. Mangani S. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In these three enzymes, the conformational changes appear to be induced by direct contacts between protein and the bound substrate. In adenosine deaminase and cytosine deaminase, similar flaps are formed by the insertions between the β1-strand and the α1-helix. On the other hand, in urease, the lid is formed from the insertion between β7 and α7, as that in the d-aminoacylase. It is worth noting that the enzyme inhibition mechanism of d-aminoacylase by acetate may be similar to that of urease by β-ME, because in both cases, one inhibitor molecule bridges the metal ions and another molecule induces a closed conformation. In the β-ME-inhibited urease, one β-ME ligates the two nickel ions, and another β-ME forms a mixed disulfide with Cys322 sealing the entrance (30Benini S. Rypniewski W.R. Wilson K.S. Ciurli S. Mangani S. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 268-273Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The strong structural homology of the α/β-barrel amidohydrolases is also reflected in their catalytic mechanisms, in particular, preparation of the active nucleophile for the hydrolytic reaction is very similar (13Jabri E.

The α metal ion functions in activation of the nucleophile water by lowering its pK a, while the β metal ion serves as an electrophilic catalyst to polarize the carbonyl-oxygen bond of the substrate. The highly conserved Asp366 probably acts as a general base to activate the nucleophile water. The proximity of His67 Nδ1 to Asp366Oδ1 (3.2 Å) could facilitate the proton abstraction and donation, and the proximity of His69 Nε2 to ACT1 O1 (3.1 Å), and to Asp366Oδ1 (3.3 Å), might further assist in activating the attacking water molecule and stabilizing the negatively charged intermediate. The crystal structure of d-aminoacylase with the modeled substrate provides the structural basis for the enzyme catalytic mechanism. Together with the similar mechanisms in the α/β-barrel amidohydrolases, we propose a catalytic mechanism ford-aminoacylase in Scheme 1. First, Asp366 abstracts the proton from the water molecule, and the tightly bound zinc ion polarizes the carbonyl-oxygen bond, thus facilitating the nucleophilic attack on the amide carbon atom to form the tetrahedral intermediate. Cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bond is assisted by the simultaneous protonation of the amide nitrogen. The newly formed acetate then ligates the zinc ion. AnN-acetyl-l-methionine substrate can also be modeled into the active site; however, for the l-isomer the interaction between the substrate amide and Ser289 backbone carbonyl would be missing, perhaps resulting in lack of proper orientation of the amide carbon for water attacking, then with thus 100 times lower hydrolysis efficiency than the d-form substrate (2Tsai Y.C. Lin C.S. Tseng T.H. Lee H. Wang Y.J. Enzyme Microbial. Technol. 1992; 14: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In summary, the crystal structure ofd-aminoacylase reveals that the enzyme indeed belongs to the α/β-barrel amidohydrolase superfamily and defines a novel subset. A putative substrate-binding pocket with key residues is identified. The unusual 63-residue large insertion involves in the substrate specific recognition and the active-site entrance switch. On the basis of our structural information, some protein engineering trials such as deletion of the small β-domain and change of the substrate specificity by using mutagenesis are under investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2016211376,"Methylation status of the p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A), p14(ARF) and retinoblastoma (RB) genes was studied using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in 85 human brain tumors of various subtypes and four normal brain samples. These genes play an important role in the control of the cell cycle. Twenty-four out of 85 cases (28%) had at least one of these genes methylated. The frequency of p14(ARF) methylation was 15 out of 85 (18%) cases, and the expression of p14(ARF) in methylated gliomas was significantly lower than in unmethylated gliomas. The incidence of methylation of p15(INK4B), p16(INK4A) and RB gene was 4%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. Samples with p14(ARF) methylation did not have p16(INK4A) methylation even though both genes physically overlap. None of the target genes was methylated in the normal brain samples. In addition, the p53 gene was mutated in 19 out of 85 (22%) samples as determined by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. Thirty out of 85 (35%) brain tumors had either a p53 mutation or methylation of p14(ARF). Also, the p14(ARF) expression in p53 wild-type gliomas was lower than levels in p53 mutated gliomas. This finding is consistent with wild-type p53 being able to autoregulate its levels by down-regulating expression of p14(ARF). In summary, inactivation of the apoptosis pathway that included the p14(ARF) and p53 genes by hypermethylation and mutation, respectively, occurred frequently in human brain tumors. Down-regulation of p14(ARF) in gliomas was associated with hypermethylation of its promoter and the presence of a wild-type p53 in these samples."

The potentiation of AC7 by ethanol is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC). We designed studies to determine which PKC isotype(s) are involved in the potentiation of Gαs-activated AC7 activity by ethanol and to investigate the direct phosphorylation of AC7 by PKC. AC7 was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunits of PKCs.

The potentiation of Gαs-stimulated AC7 activity by either phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate or ethanol, in HEL cells endogenously expressing AC7, was not through the Ca2+-sensitive conventional PKCs. However, the potentiation of AC7 activity by ethanol or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was found to be reduced by the selective inhibitor of PKCδ (rottlerin), a PKCδ-specific inhibitory peptide (δV1-1), and the expression of the dominant negative form of PKCδ. Immunoprecipitation data indicated that PKCδ could bind and directly phosphorylate AC7.

Intracellular signaling via cAMP generates downstream effects that range from changes in the function of ion channels to changes in intracellular energy metabolism to changes in gene transcription (for review see Ref. 1Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Cooper D.M.F. Advances in Second Messenger and Phosphoprotein Research: Adenylyl Cyclases. 32. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1998: 1-21Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the generation of intracellular cAMP is a tightly regulated process that involves the α and βγ subunits of G-proteins, intracellular Ca2+acting independently or in concert with calmodulin, and phosphorylation events that are postulated to involve protein kinase A and protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AC, adenylyl cyclase; AC7, adenylyl cyclase type 7; HEL, human erythroleukemia cells; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney cells; NFDM, nonfat dairy milk; RACK, receptor for activated C-kinase; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; Sf9, Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells; EtOH, ethanol; IP, immunoprecipitation; PAA, protein A-agarose; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild-type; DN, dominant negative 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AC, adenylyl cyclase; AC7, adenylyl cyclase type 7; HEL, human erythroleukemia cells; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney cells; NFDM, nonfat dairy milk; RACK, receptor for activated C-kinase; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; Sf9, Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells; EtOH, ethanol; IP, immunoprecipitation; PAA, protein A-agarose; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild-type; DN, dominant negative (2Houslay M.D. Milligan G.

Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The current evidence indicates that each of the nine adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms differs in its repertoire of regulatory controls (2Houslay M.D. Milligan G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gillman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), and all of the isoforms can be regulated coincidentally by multiple signals to modulate the production of cAMP. It was therefore not entirely unexpected that the activity of the various isoforms of AC were also found to be differentially sensitive to the effect of ethanol (4Yoshimura M. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1995; 19: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that ethanol acutely potentiates Gαs-activated AC activity (5Saito T. Lee J.M. Tabakoff B. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Bode D.C. Molinoff P.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 246: 1040-1047PubMed Google Scholar), and studies with HEK 293 cells transfected with the various isoforms of AC have demonstrated a broad range of AC sensitivity to ethanol. Some isoforms were found to be insensitive to ethanol (types 1, 3, 8a, and 8b), others were moderately sensitive (types 2, 5, 6, 8c, and 9), and Type 7 AC was at least two to three times more sensitive to the stimulatory actions of ethanol in comparison with all other tested ACs (4Yoshimura M. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1995; 19: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Agonist-stimulated AC7 activity in transfected HEK 293 cells can be significantly potentiated by 10–20 mm ethanol (which corresponds to tissue concentrations of 46–92 mg/100 ml ethanol), and the potentiation by ethanol of AC7 activity is not mediated through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity or an adenosine receptor-mediated event (7Yoshimura M. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1999; 23: 1457-1461PubMed Google Scholar). Ethanol has been shown to further potentiate AC activity when AC is activated through a variety of different membrane receptor systems, including dopamine D1a, β-adrenergic, and prostaglandin receptors (4Yoshimura M. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1995; 19: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Saito T. Lee J.M. Tabakoff B. J.

Res. 1999; 23: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the ability of ethanol to potentiate cAMP accumulation is independent of transmitter receptors and is dependent primarily on the AC isoform present in the cell. cAMP signaling has been shown to be important in the behavioral effects of ethanol through studies with Drosophila (9Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and mice (10Dar M.S. Brain Res. 1997; 749: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,11Szabo G. Hoffman P.L. Tabakoff B. Life Sci. 1988; 42: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutations in the components of the cAMP-generating or degrading systems in Drosophila significantly altered the responses of the fly to the intoxicating (incoordinating) effects of ethanol (9Moore M.S. DeZazzo J. Luk A.Y. Tully T. Singh C.M. Heberlein U. Cell. 1998; 93: 997-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A similar relationship between ethanol-induced incoordination and changes in cAMP generating systems was found in both mice and rats (10Dar M.S. Brain Res. 1997; 749: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Meng Z.H. Pennington S.N. Dar M.S. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activation of cAMP generation in the brains of mice, by the use of forskolin, altered the development of tolerance to the sedative effects of ethanol (11Szabo G. Hoffman P.L. Tabakoff B. Life Sci. 1988; 42: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Clinical studies with humans have also linked the cAMP signaling system to behavioral manifestations of physical dependence on ethanol. Alcohol-dependent individuals, even when abstinent for substantive periods of time, have been shown to have lower G-protein-activated AC activity in their platelets than control subjects (13Tabakoff B. Hoffman P.L. Lee J.M. Saito T. Willard B. De Leon-Jones F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). More recently it was found that low platelet AC activity was characteristic of individuals classified as family history positive for alcoholism, regardless of whether the subjects were themselves diagnosed alcoholics (14Menninger J.A. Baron A.E. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1998; 22: 1955-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ratsma J.E. Gunning W.B. Leurs R. Schoffelmeer A.N. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1999; 23: 600-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ethanol has been demonstrated to enhance receptor/G-protein-coupled generation of cAMP in platelets, the depressed AC activity in the platelets of individuals at risk to develop alcoholism may parallel what is occurring in the brain and may contribute to the addiction process (16Nestler E.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that in human erythroleukemia (HEL) platelet precursor cells, which contain a preponderance of AC7 mRNA (17Hellevuo K. Yoshimura M. Kao M. Hoffman P.L. Cooper D.M.F. Tabakoff B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), both ethanol and phorbol esters (PDBu and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) could significantly potentiate AC activity generated in response to the activation of the prostanoid receptor by the agonist PGE1 (8Rabbani M. Nelson E.J. Hoffman P.L. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1999; 23: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This potentiation of AC activity by either ethanol or PDBu could be diminished by PKC inhibitors such as staurosporine and chelerythrine (8Rabbani M. Nelson E.J. Hoffman P.L. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1999; 23: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the current work, we report on a series of studies that determine the PKC isotype(s) involved in the enhancement of Gαs-activated AC7 activity by ethanol, and we investigate the phosphorylation of AC7 by PKC. [2-3H]Adenine was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), staurosporine, chelerythrine, rottlerin, thapsigargin, and Gö 6976 were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Dr. W.-J. Tang (University of Chicago) kindly provided the anti-AC II family antibody, C6C. PGE1 was obtained from the Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Cicaprost was a generous gift from Schering AG (Berlin, Germany). All of the other products were purchased from Sigma. Concentrated solutions of drugs, including PGE1 and cicaprost, were prepared in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO in the assay mixtures was never greater than 0.8%. Control assays were always performed containing the appropriate amounts of Me2SO. Dr. Daria Mochly-Rosen (18.Mochly-Rosen, D., Ron, D., Kauvar, L. M., and Napolitano, E. W. (July 21, 1998) U. S. Patent 5,783,405.Google Scholar) kindly provided the following PKC-derived inhibitory peptides: δV1-1 (δPKC8–16, AFNSYELGS), εV1–2 (εPKC14–21, EAVSLKPT), and a control nonsense octapeptide (LSETKPAV). These peptides were conjugated to aDrosophila antennapedia peptide (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK) to make them more cell permeant. Catalytic subunits of PKC purified from rat brain were prepared by trypsin digestion by Dr. Michael D. Browning (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Dr. Trevor Biden (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia) kindly provided the replication deficient adenovirus (Ad5 DL312) vectors carrying either the wild-type or dominant negative PKCδ. Full-length recombinant human PKCδ and PKCε were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA). A BamHI site was introduced upstream of the initiation codon of the human AC7 cDNA (19Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayashi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) by in vitro mutagenesis using an oligonucleotide, CGTGCCAAGGATCCGGAGGATGCCAG. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A 3.6-kb fragment containing the human AC7 coding sequence was prepared from pBlueScript II SK-containing the AC7 cDNA by digestion with BamHI and XbaI. The fragment was inserted into a pcDNA3.1 His (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector after digestion of this vector with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XbaI. The constructed vector provides an N-terminal fusion of hexahistidine tag and T7 epitope with AC7 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The recombinant baculovirus for AC7 was constructed as follows. cDNA for human AC7 (19Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayashi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the BamHI andBglII sites of an Invitrogen pBlueBacHis2 vector (frame C). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the AC7 plasmid and wild-type viral DNA, and positive recombinant viral plaques were isolated. When expressed in the insect cells, this vector generated a fusion protein including AC7 that contains N-terminal (His)6, T7, and Xpress™ epitopes. The fusion junction was verified by automated sequencing. The control vector was generated from the T7-AC7 vector by creating a stop codon in the multiple cloning site of the vector and the control vector produced only the fusion tag. HEL cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated, charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Gemini-Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA). HEL cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) and used for experiments at a density range of between 0.2 and 0.4 × 106cell/ml. HEK 293 cells were grown in 20 mm HEPES-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C (5% CO2). pcDNA3.1-T7.His-AC7 and the control pcDNA3.1-T7.His vector were transfected in HEK 293 cells using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) while maintaining the cells in the regular growth medium. After incubation with the transfection reagents for 48 h, the cells were maintained in serum containing minimal essential medium for another 24 h prior to harvesting the cells. AC7 was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. The Sf9 cells were cultured in a spinner vessel containing Grace's insect cell medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C (Tissue Culture Core/University of Colorado Cancer Center). Sf9 cells (300 × 106) were then infected with the positive recombinant baculovirus for 60 min in serum-free Grace's insect medium followed by an additional 48 h incubation in Grace's insect medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. AC7-expressing Sf9 cells were identified based on Western blot analysis of total Sf9 cell protein using a monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI). No signals in the molecular mass range of full-length AC7 were detected by the anti-T7 antibody in solubilized protein preparations from control vector-infected Sf9 cells. For the “back-phosphorylation” experiments, T7-tagged AC7-transfected HEK 293 or control transfected HEK 293 cells were pretreated with drugs or other reagents prior to harvesting as indicated in the figure legends and the text. For harvesting, the cells were resuspended in ice-cold membrane lysis buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaF, andCalbiochem Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (l mmAEBSF, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μmbestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A). The cell suspension was sonicated briefly on ice and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was solubilized as described below. For the isolation of HEL or HEK 293 cell membranes in experiments not involving back-phosphorylation, a minimum of 15 × 106cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pelleted cells were resuspended at 5–6 × 106cells/ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, andCalbiochem Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III. The cell suspension was drawn through a 22-gauge syringe 10 times, while the preparation was kept on ice and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Both the pellet (membrane protein) and supernatant (cytosolic protein) were saved. For immunoprecipitation (phosphorylation) experiments and Western blot analysis, the membrane protein was solubilized in 1.0% SDS. The samples were then incubated for 20 min at 80 °C and sonicated briefly. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Membranes from T7-AC7-expressing Sf9 cells or control vector-expressing Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, for 5 min at 4 °C), suspended in 20 ml (per 100 ml of culture pellet) of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (as described above). The samples were freeze-thawed twice (from liquid nitrogen into a 42 °C water bath), and the DNA was sheared by passing the preparation through an 18-gauge needle four times. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 200 mmsucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors, as described above. The suspension was then recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the final pellet was solubilized in 1.0% SDS and stored at −80 °C. For the immunoprecipitation of T7-tagged AC7, all of the steps were carried out at 4 °C, except when noted. In each sample, 150–200 μg of solubilized total Sf9 or HEK 293 cell membrane protein (AC7 and control vector-transfected) in 1% SDS was diluted with the IP buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm methionine, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmNa2-β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitors as described above, and 1.2% Nonidet P-40) to a final SDS concentration of 0.08–0.12% (a minimum 10-fold Nonidet P-40/SDS ratio). The samples were incubated for 5 min with washed (IP buffer) protein A-agarose (PAA) beads (ImmunoPure immobilized protein A; Pierce) at a ratio of 10–20%:80–90% beads to solubilized protein in IP buffer, respectively, to remove material that bound nonspecifically to the beads. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 ×g), and the supernatants were collected and shaken with 6 μg of monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with washed (IP buffer) PAA beads for 1 h. The antigen/antibody/PAA conjugates were pelleted (10,000 × g) and washed once with IP buffer. The beads were then washed twice at 22 °C with phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 2–5 min at 37 °C in 40 μl of phosphorylation buffer including 0.3 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 250 nm of the constitutively active PKC catalytic subunit purified from rat brain (20Lin Y.F. Browning M.D. Dudek E.M. Macdonald R.L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1421-1431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 200 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0. The beads were pelleted and washed two times with IP buffer. The samples were then reduced and alkylated to produce a tight band of AC during the PAGE. The sample was reduced by incubation in 40 mm dithiothreitol at 80 °C for 15 min. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature with 65 mm N-ethylmaleimide, loading dye was added, and the sample was briefly boiled before the PAGE. The precast 8% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels were from Novex/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). After the electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and Kodak X-Omat Blue film was used for the autoradiography. For the phosphorylation by full-length recombinant PKC, T7-tagged AC7-transfected HEK 293 cells or control transfected HEK 293 cells were lysed in ice-cold membrane lysis buffer and a Triton X-100-insoluble plasma membrane fraction (representing a membrane microdomain thought to have characteristics similar to lipid rafts and enriched in signaling molecules) was isolated. This membrane fraction was isolated as described above under “HEK 293, HEL, and Sf9 Cell Membrane Preparations” with the following additional modification; in the final step the non-nuclear cell lysate was centrifuged at 90,000 × g in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 for 60 min at 4 °C. This membrane pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and the T7-tagged AC7 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-T7 monoclonal antibody with the addition of PAA beads (as described above). The immunoprecipitates from T7-AC7 and control transfected HEK 293 cells were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with recombinant PKCδ (0.8 specific activity units) or PKCε (1.3 specific activity units) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; final ATP concentration equaled 40 μm) in phosphorylation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.2 μg/ml diolein, 10 μm PDBu, and 0.02% Triton X-100). The reaction mixture was pelleted to separate the T7-AC7/anti-T7 antibody/PAA immunocomplex from the supernatant containing PKC and [γ-32P]ATP. The pellet was washed with 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Aliquots from both the pelleted fraction and the supernatant were dithiothreitol- andN-ethylmaleimide-treated, boiled in gel loading buffer, and loaded onto an 8% Tris-glycine gel for electrophoretic separation. The gel was dried and then exposed to x-ray autoradiography film. Recombinant purified PKCδ or PKCε (2 μg) was 32P-labeled through autophosphorylation for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; final ATP concentration equaled 40 μm) in phosphorylation buffer. After this reaction, the32P-labeled PKC was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (10%) on ice, and the free 32P was removed with three washes in 95% ice-cold ethanol. 32P-Labeled PKC was resuspended at 100 ng/μl in 50% glycerol buffer (100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 5 mm TCEP adjusted to pH 7.8 with HEPES). The Triton X-100-insoluble plasma membrane fraction (100 μg) from control or AC7-transfected HEK cells was suspended in IP binding buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmmethionine, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mmNa2-β-glycerophosphate, 1.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg/ml γ-globulin free BSA, and protease inhibitors as described above). The membrane protein mixture was then added to washed PAA beads for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the nonspecific binding proteins. The beads were discarded, and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-T7 antibody. The solution containing the T7-AC7·anti-T7 immunocomplex was added to washed PAA beads and incubated for 120 min at 4 °C. The beads containing the immunocomplex were pelleted and washed once in IP binding buffer A to remove residual SDS. The beads were then resuspended in IP binding buffer A, and 100 ng of 32P-PKCδ or ε was added and incubated at 4 °C for 120 min. The beads containing the immunocomplex and bound 32P-PKC were pelleted and washed twice in IP binding buffer A. The supernatant and washes were combined and counted along with the pellets. 32P-PKC binding to PAA beads in the absence of T7 antibody or membrane protein was used for determination of nonspecific binding of 32P-PKC and was subtracted as background from the pelleted samples. For Western blotting, whole cell Sf9, HEK 293 cell lysates, and HEL cell lysates (in 1% SDS) were reduced and alkylated as described under “Immunoprecipitation, phosphorylation, and back-phosphorylation of AC7” prior to gel electrophoresis. Precast 8% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex/Invitrogen) were used to separate the protein bands. After the electrophoresis, the samples were transferred to MSI micronSep nitrocellulose (Osmonics, Westborough, MA) using a Xcell II Blot Module (Novex/Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blots containing Sf9 or HEK 293 cell protein were blocked with 3% nonfat dairy milk (NFDM) in TBS, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in 3% BSA in TBST containing 1:3000 dilution of monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) or a 1:5000 dilution of the C6C anti-AC II family antibody (21Chakrabarti S. Rivera M. Yan S.Z. Tang W.J. Gintzler A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and washed three times with 3% NFDM TBST. The blots were then incubated for 1 h in 5% NFDM-TBST containing 1:30,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and subsequently washed three times with TBST and twice with TBS. The blots containing HEL cell protein were blocked with 5% NFDM-TBST for 1 h at room temperature, quickly rinsed in TBS, and then blotted overnight at 4 °C in 3% NFDM-TBST containing 1:1500 dilution of anti-δPKC antibody, 1:5000 dilution of anti-β-actin antibody, or the other appropriately diluted isoform specific PKC antibodies (PKCβ, 1:750; PKCγ, 1:5000; PKCδ, 1:750; PKCε, 1:2500; PKCθ, 1:750; PKCλ, 1:750; PKCζ, 1:1000; and PKCι, 1:750). The blot was then quickly rinsed with fresh 3% NFDM-TBST and washed three times with 0.1% liquid fish gelatin-TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 22 °C. The blot was then incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 3% NFDM-TBST for 1 h at 22 °C and then washed three times with 0.1% fish gelatin in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at 22 °C. The blots were rinsed in TBS prior to immunoreactive band detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For whole cell cAMP synthesis measurements, HEL cells were preloaded with 2 μCi/ml [2-3H]adenine in HEL culture medium for 6 h at 37 °C as previously described (4Yoshimura M. Tabakoff B. Alcohol Exp. Clin. Res. 1995; 19: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Hellevuo K. Yoshimura M. Mons N. Hoffman P.L. Cooper D.M.F. Tabakoff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11581-11589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, HEL cells were pelleted by centrifugation (200 ×g for 5 min), washed, and resuspended at a cell concentration of 1 × 106/ml in serum-free RPMI 1640, without phenol red, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (assay buffer). Aliquots (0.4 ml) of the cell suspension were added to each well (24-well plates) and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 36 °C before the start of an assay. In experiments that utilized the PKC-derived inhibitory peptides, the assay buffer was modified slightly as described below to prevent premature reduction of the chimeric peptide (the PKC-derived/antennapedia peptides contain a Cys-Cys disulfide bond) prior to entry into the cells. Briefly, HEL cells were extensively washed three times (to remove exogenous glutathione) and resuspended at a cell concentration of 1 × 106/ml in glutathione-free, serum-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.05% BSA. PKC-derived inhibitory peptides were added (final concentration of 2.0 μm) to the cell suspension and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h prior to the start of the experiment. cAMP formation was measured by monitoring the conversion of [3H]ATP to [3H]cAMP. The cells were treated with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (400 μm), for 10 min prior to the addition of agonist. After the addition of agonist (PGE1 or cicaprost), cAMP formation was allowed to continue for 5 min before the reaction was terminated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 10%). Other modulators of AC activity were added at concentrations and time points as described in the text and figure legends. ATP and cAMP were separated by sequential chromatography on Dowex 50 and neutral alumina columns and quantitated using a Beckman LS 6000TA liquid scintillation counter as previously described (4Yoshimura M.

In the present study, we show that mGluR1a activation stimulates the repetitive plasma membrane translocation of each of the conventional and novel, but not atypical, PKC isozymes. However, despite similarities in sequence and cofactor regulation by diacyglycerol and Ca2+, conventional PKCs exhibit isoform-specific oscillation patterns. PKCα and PKCβI display three distinct patterns of activity: 1) agonist-independent oscillations, 2) agonist-stimulated oscillations, and 3) persistent plasma membrane localization in response to mGluR1a activation. In contrast, only agonist-stimulated PKCβII translocation responses are observed in mGluR1a-expressing cells. PKCβI expression also promotes persistent increases in intracellular diacyglycerol concentrations in response to mGluR1a stimulation without affecting PKCβII oscillation patterns in the same cell. PKCβII isoform-specific translocation patterns are regulated by specific amino acid residues localized within the C-terminal PKC V5 domain. Specifically, Asn-625 and Lys-668 localized within the V5 domain of PKCβII cooperatively suppress PKCβI-like response patterns for PKCβII. Thus, redundancy in PKC isoform expression and differential decoding of second messenger response provides a novel mechanism for generating cell type-specific responses to the same signal.

The spatial-temporal patterning of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores contributes to the regulation of a diverse array of cellular responses including insulin secretion, sustained activation of mitochondrial function, and the selective activation of transcription factors required for fine-tuning gene expression during inflammatory immune responses (1Gilon P.

The synchronization of Ca2+ oscillations at the cellular level involves at least two modes of Ca2+ signaling: repetitive baseline Ca2+ spikes and sinusoidal-type Ca2+oscillations (6Thomas A.P.

The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the repetitive baseline plasma membrane translocation of PKC are best characterized for Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). PKCβII and PKCγ oscillations are regulated by mGluR-stimulated oscillations in diacyglycerol (DAG), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3), and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (8Dale L.B.

PKC isoforms are classified into three groups based on structural properties and cofactor requirements and exhibit specific in vivo activity as well as spatial organization within the cell (15Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 16Kanashiro C.A. Khalil R.A. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

The activation and plasma membrane localization of the conventional PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, and γ) is regulated by Ca2+ and DAG, whereas the activity and subcellular localization of the novel PKC isoforms (δ, ε, η, and θ) is regulated by DAG, but not Ca2+ (17Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 18Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The atypical PKCs do not respond to either Ca2+ or DAG (17Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 18Newton A.C. Chem.

Although PKC structure/function has been studied extensively, it is unknown whether PKC subtype-specific differences in Ca2+- and/or DAG-binding affinities contribute to PKC isoform-specific activity and/or spatial-temporal distribution within cells. In the present study, we explore whether mGluR1a-stimulated oscillations in intracellular DAG and/or Ca2+concentrations regulate conventional and novel PKC isoform activity in an identical manner. We find that, although all conventional and novel PKC isoforms oscillate in response to mGluR1a activation, conventional PKC isoforms exhibit isozyme-specific translocation response patterns that we classify as either PKCβI- or PKCβII-like responses. Specifically, we have identified two discrete amino acid residues localized within the V5 domain of PKCβII that function to suppress PKCβI-like responses for PKCβII. Thus, structural differences in the PKC V5 domain allow conventional PKC isoforms to differentially decode and influence receptor-stimulated DAG and Ca2+signals. Consequently, the expression of multiple conventional PKC isozymes in either the same cell or within different cells provides a novel mechanism by which cell type-specific responses to an identical signal may be established. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promegaand New England Biolabs Inc. The pcDNA3.1/Amp expression vector was acquired from Invitrogen. DsRed2-C1, pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C2, and pEGFP-C3 expression vectors were purchased from Clontech. The QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. The human universal Quick-CloneTM cDNA library was obtained from Clontech. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. Gentamicin, minimal essential medium, and 0.05% Trypsin containing 0.5 mm EDTA were acquired from Invitrogen. The calcium indicator, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM, was obtained from Molecular Probes. Quisqualate was from Tocris Cookson Inc. All other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, Fisher Scientific, and VWR. To construct EGFP-tagged PKCα, PKCβI, PKCγ, PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, PKCθ, PKCζ, and PKCι/λ the cDNA for each of the PKC isoforms were first amplified by PCR from the human universal Quick-CloneTM library (Clontech). The PCR products generated were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the appropriate pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C2, and pEGFP-C3 vectors (Clontech). The PKCβI cDNA was also cloned into the BglII-XbaI sites of the vector DsRed2-C1 (Clontech). The construction of EGFP-PKCβII (28Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

PKCα/βII, βII/α, βI/βII, and βII/βI chimeras were constructed by “two-step PCR” as described previously (19Walker S.D. Murray N.R. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the resulting PCR products subcloned into either the pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C3 vector. PKCα and βII point and deletion mutants were constructed using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Sequence integrity of all PCR-generated products was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells used in each of the experiments were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (20Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 157: 684-704Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Following transfection (∼18 h), cells were incubated with fresh medium and allowed to recover 8 h and allowed to grow an additional 18 h before any experimentation. In all experiments, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid cDNA containing FLAG-mGluR1a with and without 1–5 μg of each PKC construct expressed in either pEGFP or DsRed2 expression vectors. Following transfection with plasmid cDNAs encoding EGFP-PKC constructs and mGluR1a, cells were re-seeded on collagen-coated 15-mm glass-cover slips designed for use in a perfusion system (Warner Instrument Corporation). All experiments were conducted at 37 °C, and prior to visualization or additional treatments the cells were perfused with at least 5 ml of HEPES-buffered salt solution (1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 116 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4). Cellular InsP3 and DAG levels were measured indirectly through the use of the EGFP-PLCδ1 PH domain (8Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Confocal-based Ca2+ imaging was performed by preloading cells for 30 min with 10 mm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM prior to receptor activation according to the manufacturer's specifications (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope using Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. Enhanced GFP and Oregon Green 488 BAPTA fluorescence was visualized with excitation at 488 nm and emission 515–540 nm emission filter set. DsRed2 fluorescence was visualized with excitation at 543 nm and emission 590–610 nm filter set. Fluorescent signals were collected sequentially every 6.8–12.5 s using the Zeiss LSM software time scan function. PKC translocation time courses and Ca2+, DAG, and InsP3 responses were recorded as time series of 150–300 confocal images for each experiment. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM-510 physiology analysis software and was defined as the relative change in cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity over time in a 5-μm-diameter region of interest. All time course data were plotted using GraphPad Prism. The statistical significance of the data presented in Fig. 6 was analyzed using a non-parametric SIGN test. Because individual conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ), novel (δ, ε, η, and θ), and atypical (ι/λ and ζ) PKC isoforms may exhibit differences in their receptor-activated translocation profiles, we have examined the translocation response patterns for each PKC isozyme following mGluR1a agonist activation. We find that each of the conventional PKC isoforms displays the capacity to oscillate between the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to mGluR1a activation. Shown in Fig. 1 is an agonist-stimulated oscillatory response pattern that is exhibited by all four conventional PKC isoforms. This agonist-stimulated transient, but repetitive, translocation of enzyme to the plasma membrane is the only response pattern that is observed for PKCβII (PKCβII-like). However, PKCα and PKCβI display additional translocation responses (PKCβI-like) that are never observed for PKCβII. Although some cell to cell variability is observed, PKCβI-like translocation patterns can be categorized into three distinct patterns that are illustrated in Fig. 2. First, GFP-PKCα and GFP-PKCβI exhibit the capacity to oscillate between the cytosol and plasma membrane in the absence of mGluR1a activation (Fig. 2 A). In these cells, mGluR1a agonist activation serves to increase the oscillation frequency of the entire cellular complement of GFP-tagged PKCα and PKCβI (Fig. 2 A). The removal of the agonist results in the return of the oscillation frequency to the pre-agonist-stimulated oscillatory rate (Fig. 2 A,PKCα). These agonist-independent oscillations are only observed following mGluR1a expression, indicating that they occur in response to spontaneous mGluR1a activity. Second, in response to mGluR1a activation, the entire pool of either GFP-PKCα or GFP-PKCβI translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it remains persistently localized (at steady state) until the agonist is removed by perfusion (Fig. 2 B). Third, mGluR1a activation stimulates the translocation of the entire GFP-PKCα and GFP-PKCβI pools to the plasma membrane, and a fraction of the enzyme returns to the cytosol and subsequently oscillates in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 2 C). PKCγ also exhibits very weak PKCβI-like responses (13/49 cells), but unlike what is observed for the other conventional PKC isoforms the most common PKCγ response pattern is a single transient plasma membrane translocation (20/49 cells) (data not shown). For PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII transient translocation responses were rarely observed (< 5% of cells imaged). Taken together, these observations suggest that PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCγ exhibit the capacity to decode subtly different changes in second messenger responses that are not recognized by PKCβII. Alternatively, the expression of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCγ may lead to multiple distinct second messenger responses to mGluR1a activation.Figure 2GFP-PKCα- and GFP-PKCβI-specific response patterns to mGluR1a activation. HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding mGluR1a and either GFP-PKCα or GFP-PKCβI. Shown are GFP-PKCα and GFP-PKCβI response patterns that are not observed for GFP-PKCβII. These responses include the following.

The data are plotted as the relative GFP fluorescence intensity between the cytosol (0) and plasma membrane (1Gilon P. Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22265-22268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a single cell.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Each of the novel PKC isoforms also oscillate in response to mGluR1a activation (Fig. 3). The response for each of the novel PKC isozymes is similar to the third PKCβI-like response pattern outlined above (Fig. 2 C). Following the agonist-dependent translocation of the entire pool of GFP-PKC, a fraction of each of the novel GFP-PKC isoforms remains localized to the plasma membrane, and the remaining enzyme oscillates in the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 3). The atypical PKC (ι/λ and ζ) do not respond to mGluR1a activation (data not shown). Because the conventional PKCs exhibit the greatest behavioral complexity and diversity to mGluR1a activation, we focused subsequent experimentation on the conventional PKC isoforms. It is possible that the expression of either PKCα or PKCβI leads to alterations in the patterning of mGluR1a-stimulated second messenger responses and that this may underlie the multiplicity of PKCβI-like response patterns. To address this possibility, we examined the patterning of red fluorescent protein tagged-PKCβI (DsRed2-PKCβI) responses at the same time as we measured changes in intracellular DAG, InsP3, and Ca2+ concentrations. DAG responses were measured using a GFP-PKCδ C1 domain construct, which translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to increases in intracellular DAG concentrations (9Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that mGluR1a-stimulated GFP-PKCδ C1 domain translocation patterns were synchronized exactly with DsRed2-PKCβI membrane translocation responses (Fig. 4 A). Following mGluR1a activation, the GFP-PKCδ C1 domain either oscillated between the cytosol and plasma membrane in synchrony with DsRed2-PKCβI (Fig. 4 A, upper panel) or accumulated with DsRed2-PKCβI at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). InsP3 responses were measured using a GFP-PLCδ1 PH domain construct, which under basal conditions was localized at the plasma membrane due to its interaction with membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (8Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Following mGluR1a-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis and InsP3 formation the GFP-PLCδ1 PH domain was released from the plasma membrane and redistributed to the cytosol (Fig. 4 B). Identical to what was observed for DAG responses, the GFP-PLCδ1 PH domain either oscillated between the plasma membrane and cytosol at the same frequency at which DsRed2-PKCβI translocated from the cytosol to plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B, upper panel), or the GFP-PLCδ1 PH domain accumulated in the cytosol with the same time course as DsRed2-PKCβI accumulated at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). Thus, the spatial-temporal localization of PKCβI at the plasma membrane was coordinated with alterations in both intracellular DAG and InsP3concentrations. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were measured using the Ca2+ indicator dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM. We found that oscillatory DsRed2-PKCβI responses were synchronized with Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 4 C,upper panel). However, unlike what was observed for DAG and InsP3 responses, Ca2+ oscillations persisted when DsRed2-PKCβI was persistently localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). Taken together, our observations indicate that expression of PKCβI alters the patterning of DAG and InsP3 formation, but not the patterning of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in response to mGluR1a activation. This is different from cells expressing PKCβII where only synchronized oscillatory DAG, InsP3, and Ca2+ responses are observed following mGluR1a activation (data not shown and Ref. 8Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PKCβI and PKCβII isoforms are thought to be regulated in the same manner by DAG (17Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Therefore, if differences in PKCβI versus PKCβII response patterns are solely the consequence of PKCβI expression-dependent alterations in DAG formation or differences in mGluR1a expression levels between cells, GFP-PKCβII should exhibit PKCβI-like translocation patterns in cells co-expressing DsRed2-PKCβI. When co-expressed together in HEK 293 cells, we observe two distinct DsRed2-PKCβI and GFP-PKCβII responses to mGluR1a activation: 1) DsRed2-PKCβI and GFP-PKCβII exhibit synchronized oscillatory plasma membrane translocation responses (Fig. 5 A); and 2) DsRed2-PKCβI accumulates at the plasma membrane, whereas GFP-PKCβII continues to oscillate between the plasma membrane and cytosol (Fig. 5 B). These observations suggest that, although PKCβI expression alters the patterning of mGluR1a-stimulated DAG and InsP3 response patterns, PKCβII is apparently insensitive to PKCβI-induced changes in DAG formation. Moreover, the differences in PKCβIversus PKCβII membrane translocation patterns observed in the same cell indicates that differences in mGluR1a expression levels between cells cannot account for the different PKCβI-like translocation patterns. The patterning of conventional PKC isoform responses to mGluR1a activation are sub-classified as either PKCβI-like (agonist-independent oscillations, agonist-stimulated oscillations, and persistent plasma membrane localization) or PKCβII-like (only agonist-stimulated oscillations). We have used these definitions to characterize the structural determinants underlying differences in conventional PKC isozyme response patterns. PKCβI and PKCβII differ by only 53 amino acids comprising the alternatively spliced V5 domains of the kinases (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the exchange of the last 54 amino acid residues of PKCα with the corresponding residues from PKCβII generates a PKCα/βII 620–673 chimera that displays a PKCβII-like response pattern (Fig. 6 B). Thus, PKC isoform-specific response patterns must be regulated by amino acid residues localized within V5 domains of conventional PKC isoforms. Sequence alignment of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII reveals considerable carboxyl-terminal sequence conservation (Fig. 6 A). The last 13 amino acids of the V5 domain exhibit the greatest sequence disparity (Fig. 6 A). By swapping either the last 13 amino acids of PKCβII for the last 15 amino acid residues of PKCα (PKCβII/α 657–672) or deleting the last 13 amino acid residues from the carboxyl-terminal of PKCβII (PKCβII-S660D), we create PKCβII chimeras with PKCβI-like response patterns (Fig. 6 B). Serial truncation analysis of PKCβII between amino acid residues 660 and 672 reveals that PKCβII-like responses are lost if the final six (PKCβII-L667Δ) but not the final three (PKCβII-E670Δ) PKCβII amino acids are deleted (Fig. 6 C). The deletion of Lys-668–Glu-670 (PKCβII-KPEΔ) from PKCβII also establishes a PKCα-like response pattern for PKCβII (Fig. 6 C). The mutation of Lys-668, Pro-669, and Glu-670 individually to glycine residues reveals that only Lys-668 is required to maintain PKCβII-like responses and to suppress PKCβI-like response patterns (Fig. 6 D). When expressed together in HEK 293 cells, we find that DsRed2-PKCβI and GFP-PKCβII-K668G exhibit identical response patterns to mGluR1a activation (Fig. 7). We found that the establishment of a PKCβII-like response pattern in PKCα required the exchange of the entire PKCβII V5 domain. Furthermore, neither the exchange of the last 13 amino acid residues from PKCβII into PKCα (PKCα/βII 660–673) nor the introduction of the KPE motif into PKCβI established PKCβII-like responses for either PKCα or PKCβI (Fig. 6, B and C). Therefore, there must be additional amino acid residues localized within the PKCβII V5 domain that cooperated with Lys-668 to establish a PKCβII-like response pattern. Sequence alignment of PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII indicated that only 4 amino acid residues were not conserved between PKCβII and either PKCα or PKCβI: Asn-625, His-636, Glu-646, and Arg-649 of PKCβII (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, we mutated each of these residues to the corresponding amino acid residue in PKCα and found that only PKCβII-N625G exhibited PKCα-like behavior patterns (Fig. 6 D). In summary, extensive structure-function analysis identified Asn-625 and Lys-668 as essential amino acid residues within the PKCβII V5 domain required for the establishment of PKCβII translocation responses. The mutation of either residue releases the suppression of PKCα-like response behaviors for PKCβII. In the present study, we show that each of the conventional (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (δ, ε, η, and θ), but not atypical (ζ and ι/λ) PKC isozymes respond to mGluR1a activation by repetitively translocating between the cytosol and plasma membrane. The detailed analysis of conventional PKC isoform translocation responses reveals that PKCα and PKCβI exhibit a variety of unique response patterns to mGluR1a activation that are not observed for PKCβII. Because PKCβI and PKCβII exhibit distinct translocation patterns to the same stimulus, even when expressed in the same cell, it is unlikely these differences can be attributed to differences in mGluR1a expression levels or G protein coupling efficiency. Rather PKCα and/or PKCβI expression alters the patterning of mGluR1a-stimulated second messenger responses. Furthermore, the sensitivity of conventional PKC isozymes to intracellular DAG and Ca2+ concentrations appears to be regulated by residues localized to the V5 domains of the kinases. Thus, we conclude that the spatial-temporal dynamics of mGluR signaling will not only be determined by the identity of the mGluR isoform that is activated but will also be controlled by the PKC isozyme that is decoding and modulating the mGluR1a-generated second messenger signals. As a consequence, the expression of multiple conventional PKC isozymes in either the same cell or within different cells provides a novel mechanism by which cell type-specific responses to an identical signal may be established. Both PKCα and PKCβI exhibit agonist-independent oscillations in cells expressing mGluR1a, and this may be related to the observation that mGluR1a exhibits significant basal activity in the absence of agonist (21Prezeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dale L. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi S. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Intrinsic mGluR1a activity leading to the spontaneous activation of PLC may result in sub-threshold changes in DAG and InsP3 formation. If PKCα and PKCβI exhibit heightened sensitivity to changes in intracellular DAG concentrations as compared with PKCβII, this may be translated into isoform-specific agonist-independent membrane translocation. The crystal structure of the mGluR ligand-binding domain predicts that in the absence of agonist the ligand-binding domain exists in equilibrium between active and inactive conformations (23Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Agonist binding likely stabilizes the active (closed) conformation of the ligand-binding domain at equilibrium, which is then translated as an increase in both the efficacy and frequency of G protein coupling. Similarly, the mutation of an aspartic acid residue at position 854 in the G protein-coupling domain of mGluR1a to an alanine residue creates a receptor that gains the capacity to drive agonist-independent PKCβII oscillations (8Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Conversely, in cells expressing mGluR1b, a mGluR1 splice variant that exhibits reduced spontaneous G protein coupling activity (21Prezeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kaur Dhami G. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Sterne-Marr R. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), PKCα and PKCβI do not exhibit agonist-independent oscillations, but retain the capacity to both oscillate and accumulate at the cell surface in response to mGluR1a activation (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that agonist-independent PKCα and PKCβI oscillations are driven by basal mGluR1a activity. Unlike PKCβII, PKCα and PKCβI exhibit the capacity to be persistently localized at the plasma membrane in response to mGluR1a activation, and this response persists until the cells are perfused with agonist-free medium. Persistent PKCα translocation responses have also been reported previously (25Vallentin A. Prevostel C. Fauquier T. Bonnefont X. Joubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6014-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor activation. Constitutive plasma membrane localization of PKCβII can also be achieved following the mutation of two autophosphorylated amino acid residues, Thr-641 and Ser-660, to alanine residues or by treating cells with PKC inhibitors (8Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Bhattacharya M. Kelvin D.J. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35900-35908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, the autophosphorylation of equivalent residues within the carboxyl-terminal variable domain of PKCα prolongs its activation (29Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which may account in part for the persistent localization of the enzyme at the plasma membrane in response to mGluR activation. However, the persistent localization of PKCα and PKCβI at the plasma membrane cannot be completely explained by PKC subtype-regulated differences in autophosphorylation, because the spatial-temporal dynamics of DAG and InsP3formation are also altered in these cells. One potential explanation for the observed changes in DAG and InsP3 formation in PKCα and PKCβI-expressing cells is that the enzymes participating in the regulation of intracellular DAG levels may serve as PKC isoform-specific substrates and that the V5 domain may control substrate-specificity. Consistent with this idea, the activation of endogenous conventional PKC with thymeleatoxin results in PLCβ3 phosphorylation and attenuation of oxytocin receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositide turnover (31Yue C. Ku C.-Y. Liu M. Simon M.I. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30220-30225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown which conventional PKC isoforms contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of PLC. An alternative explanation may involve the differential ability of conventional PKC isoforms to associate with membrane anchoring proteins due to structural differences in their V5 domains. For example, the association of PKCβII with receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is regulated by three regions within the V5 domain of PKCβII (32Stebbins E.G. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29644-29650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and two of these regions encompass the amino acid residues (Asn-625 and Lys-668) that regulate PKCβII translocation patterns. The relative contributions of PKC autophosphorylation, PLC phosphorylation, and membrane anchoring proteins to the regulation of PKC subtype-specific translocation patterns will require extensive future study. An important observation made in the present study is that PKCβI and PKCβII exhibit distinct activation patterns even when expressed in the same cell. These differences in activity are abolished by either the mutation of Asn-625 or Lys-668 in PKCβII. These two residues appear to cooperate with one another to repress PKCα-like response patterns for PKCβII. This indicates the amino acid composition of the V5 domains of otherwise identical PKC isoforms regulates the relative sensitivity of the enzymes to both changes in intracellular DAG and Ca2+ concentrations. Previously, Keranen and Newton (33Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25959-25967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the PKCβI and PKCβII V5 domains regulate differences in the enzymes Ca2+-dependent affinity for acidic membranes. Thus, the PKCβI-like versusPKCβII-like response patterns may reflect V5 domain-regulated differences in both DAG and Ca2+ affinity. Thus, the periodicity of activation for different conventional PKC isoforms is not only regulated by the duration and strength of DAG and Ca2+ signals, but is also determined by the relative sensitivity of the kinases to alterations in intracellular DAG and Ca2+ concentrations. In summary, we have discovered that homologous PKC isozymes, even when expressed in the same cell, display distinct patterns of activation in response to the same receptor stimulus. This observation is of fundamental importance to our understanding of cell signaling and clearly illustrates that the expression of multiple kinase isoforms in the same cell does not result in redundancy of cellular function. Rather, our results provide concrete evidence that the stimulation of a single receptor subtype, in a single cell, has the potential to activate distinct patterns of PKC isozyme activation, which may be translated into distinct cellular responses. We speculate that this may be particularly important in the developing and adult nervous system where Ca2+ spikes and PKC translocation responses are linked to both synapse formation and synaptic plasticity required for memory and learning (34Spitzer N.C.

Since loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at distal 4p has been observed in about 20–29% of neuroblastomas, we have evaluated deletions in 41 Italian NB samples by LOH analysis at loci mapping to 4p as follows: pter-D4S2936-D4S412-D4S2957-D4S432-D4S3023-D4S431-cen. Our analysis showed allele losses in eight out of 41 samples (19.5%) and allowed the identification of a smallest region of overlapping deletion (SRO) of 3.0 cM, delimited by D4S412 and D4S3023. Two of these tumors with 4p LOH are from patients belonging to a family with recurrent NB. Interestingly the genotyping of this family revealed an identical haplotype that includes the nonrecombinant loci D4S412, D4S2957 and D4S432 shared by all affected children and demonstrated that this haplotype is retained in the two tumors carrying somatic deletions from patients of this family. Furthermore linkage analysis was performed in two NB families and yielded an overall lod-score of 3.0 in the interval including the haplotype. This provides a confirmatory indication that the region delimited by D4S2936 and D4S3023, which also includes the new defined SRO, may harbor NB predisposing gene/s."

https://openalex.org/W2315215611,"We recently reported that 14-3-3sigma is frequently inactivated in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a part of large cell carcinomas. Subsequent studies revealed that the large cell carcinomas could be morphologically categorized as large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC). The present study therefore examines 14-3-3sigma expression in a spectrum of neuroendocrine lung tumors, which had varied p53 status, proliferative activity and clinical aggressiveness. The expression of 14-3-3sigma was decreased in all four categories of the spectrum, (5 out of 5 typical carcinoids, 2 out of 2 atypical carcinoids, 5 out of 7 LCNECs and 15 out of 18 SCLCs). In sharp contrast, the level of 14-3-3sigma expression in 75 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) was the same as that in normal lung tissue, with only one exception. The expression status of neuroendocrine tumors and NSCLCs was not affected by p53 status, but dense promoter hypermethylation of the 14-3-3sigma gene was specifically observed in neuroendocrine tumors, suggesting that methylation plays a regulatory role in 14-3-3sigma expression in vivo as well as in vitro. Furthermore, the expression was not only down-regulated in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, but also in neuroendocrine tumors arising from various other organs, through examination of 123 non-pulmonary tumors. Since various carcinogenic machineries are involved in the neuroendocrine tumors, a reduced expression of 14-3-3sigma might be required for the development of neuroendocrine tumors. Constitutive 14-3-3sigma expression was distributed exclusively in putative stem cells of the normal lung, namely the basal cells of the bronchus, and type II pneumocytes. Notably, 14-3-3sigma expression was up-regulated during the regeneration of type II pneumocytes, suggesting that 14-3-3sigma plays a biological role when a regenerative and/or differentiating drive is activated, facilitating exit from stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022873969,"Supernatant protein factor is a 46-kDa cytosolic protein that stimulates squalene monooxygenase, a downstream enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The mechanism of stimulation is poorly understood, although supernatant protein factor belongs to a family of lipid-binding proteins that includes Sec14p and α-tocopherol transfer protein. Because recombinant human supernatant protein factor purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i> exhibited a relatively weak ability to activate microsomal squalene monooxygenase, we investigated the possibility that cofactors or post-translational modifications were necessary for full activity. Addition of ATP to rat liver cytosol increased supernatant protein factor activity by more than 2-fold and could be prevented by the addition of inhibitors of protein kinases A and C. Incubation of purified recombinant supernatant protein factor with ATP and protein kinases A or Cδ similarly increased activity by more than 2-fold. Addition of protein phosphatase 1γ, a serine/threonine phosphatase, to rat liver cytosol reduced activity by 50%, suggesting that supernatant protein factor is partially phosphorylated <i>in vivo</i>. To determine whether dietary cholesterol influenced the phosphorylation state, cytosols were prepared from livers of rats fed a high fat diet. Although supernatant protein factor activity was reduced by more than one-half, it could not be restored by the addition of ATP or protein kinase Cδ with ATP, suggesting that dietary cholesterol reduced the expression of this protein. Supernatant protein factor thus appears to be regulated both post-translationally through phosphorylation and at the level of expression. Phosphorylation may provide a means for the rapid short term modulation of cholesterol synthesis."
