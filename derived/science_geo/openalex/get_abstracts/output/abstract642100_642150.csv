https://openalex.org/W2982376788,"Superconductivity often occurs close to broken-symmetry parent states and is especially common in doped magnetic insulators. When twisted close to a magic relative orientation angle near 1 degree, bilayer graphene has flat moire superlattice minibands that have emerged as a rich and highly tunable source of strong correlation physics, notably the appearance of superconductivity close to interaction-induced insulating states. Here we report on the fabrication of bilayer graphene devices with exceptionally uniform twist angles. We show that the reduction in twist angle disorder reveals insulating states at all integer occupancies of the four-fold spin/valley degenerate flat conduction and valence bands, i.e. at moire band filling factors nu = 0, +(-) 1, +(-) 2, +(-) 3, and superconductivity below critical temperatures as high as 3 K close to - 2 filling. We also observe three new superconducting domes at much lower temperatures close to the nu = 0 and nu = +(-) 1 insulating states. Interestingly, at nu = +(-) 1 we find states with non-zero Chern numbers. For nu = - 1 the insulating state exhibits a sharp hysteretic resistance enhancement when a perpendicular magnetic field above 3.6 tesla is applied, consistent with a field driven phase transition. Our study shows that symmetry-broken states, interaction driven insulators, and superconducting domes are common across the entire moire flat bands, including near charge neutrality."
https://openalex.org/W2982575320,"Recent reports of local extinctions of arthropod species1, and of massive declines in arthropod biomass2, point to land-use intensification as a major driver of decreasing biodiversity. However, to our knowledge, there are no multisite time series of arthropod occurrences across gradients of land-use intensity with which to confirm causal relationships. Moreover, it remains unclear which land-use types and arthropod groups are affected, and whether the observed declines in biomass and diversity are linked to one another. Here we analyse data from more than 1 million individual arthropods (about 2,700 species), from standardized inventories taken between 2008 and 2017 at 150 grassland and 140 forest sites in 3 regions of Germany. Overall gamma diversity in grasslands and forests decreased over time, indicating loss of species across sites and regions. In annually sampled grasslands, biomass, abundance and number of species declined by 67%, 78% and 34%, respectively. The decline was consistent across trophic levels and mainly affected rare species; its magnitude was independent of local land-use intensity. However, sites embedded in landscapes with a higher cover of agricultural land showed a stronger temporal decline. In 30 forest sites with annual inventories, biomass and species number—but not abundance—decreased by 41% and 36%, respectively. This was supported by analyses of all forest sites sampled in three-year intervals. The decline affected rare and abundant species, and trends differed across trophic levels. Our results show that there are widespread declines in arthropod biomass, abundance and the number of species across trophic levels. Arthropod declines in forests demonstrate that loss is not restricted to open habitats. Our results suggest that major drivers of arthropod decline act at larger spatial scales, and are (at least for grasslands) associated with agriculture at the landscape level. This implies that policies need to address the landscape scale to mitigate the negative effects of land-use practices. Analyses of a dataset of arthropod biomass, abundance and diversity in grassland and forest habitats in Germany for the period 2008–2017 reveal that drivers of arthropod declines act at the landscape level."
https://openalex.org/W2982557070,"The mammalian cortex is a laminar structure containing many areas and cell types that are densely interconnected in complex ways, and for which generalizable principles of organization remain mostly unknown. Here we describe a major expansion of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas resource1, involving around a thousand new tracer experiments in the cortex and its main satellite structure, the thalamus. We used Cre driver lines (mice expressing Cre recombinase) to comprehensively and selectively label brain-wide connections by layer and class of projection neuron. Through observations of axon termination patterns, we have derived a set of generalized anatomical rules to describe corticocortical, thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections. We have built a model to assign connection patterns between areas as either feedforward or feedback, and generated testable predictions of hierarchical positions for individual cortical and thalamic areas and for cortical network modules. Our results show that cell-class-specific connections are organized in a shallow hierarchy within the mouse corticothalamic network."

The vast array of infectious and non-infectious challenges faced by the vertebrates ranging from bacteria and viruses to parasites, toxins, and noxious substances requires distinct immune defense strategies reflected in diversification among effector cells of the adaptive immune system, foremost, CD4 T cells. Distinct effector cell subsets, whose functions are defined by divergent repertoires of cytokines and effector molecules tailored to counter corresponding types of threat, emerge upon activation and differentiation of naive CD4 T cells orchestrated by a set of transcription factors (TFs). The latter include T-bet (Tbx21), GATA3, and RORγt promoting differentiation of interferon (IFN)-γ-producing Th1 cells, interleukin (IL)-4-producing Th2 cells, and IL-17-producing Th17 cells, respectively (Kanno et al., 2012Kanno Y.

USA. 2015; 112: 12782-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting further diversification within cDC2s. However, our understanding of cDC2 heterogeneity and its biological implications has been limited by a lack of knowledge of its transcriptional basis, required for the development of genetic tools to selectively target DC subsets. Here, we sought to explore DC heterogeneity and its transcriptional basis. Using single-cell, “bulk” RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), and specific gene reporter analyses, we systematically characterized all known DC subsets. In an unexpected parallel to innate and adaptive lymphoid cell subsets, we uncovered two overarching cDC2 subsets defined by expression of a distinct set of TFs, including T-bet and RORγt. Acquisition of opposing cDC2 fates accompanied by induction of these TFs in response to environmental cues forms the basis of their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity, conserved across mice and humans. The transcription factor T-bet delineates subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and T helper cells with distinct effector programs, and its expression has also been reported in DCs (Lugo-Villarino et al., 2003Lugo-Villarino G. Maldonado-Lopez R. Possemato R. Penaranda C. Glimcher L.H. T-bet is required for optimal production of IFN-gamma and antigen-specific T cell activation by dendritic cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7749-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To comprehensively analyze T-bet expression across splenic DCs, we utilized a T-bet reporter allele, Tbx21RFP-Cre, which faithfully reports endogenous T-bet protein expression (Levine et al., 2017Levine A.G. Mendoza A. Hemmers S. Moltedo B. Niec R.E. Schizas M. Hoyos B.E. Putintseva E.V. Chaudhry A. Dikiy S. et al.Stability and function of regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet.Nature. 2017; 546: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This revealed that T-bet was uniquely expressed in a subset of CD11b+XCR1– cDC2s in all lymphoid and mucosal tissues examined (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A). Of note, we did not identify T-bet+ cDC2s within the intestinal CD11b+XCR1+ (DP) cDC subset (Figure S1B). T-bet was not expressed in other myeloid cell lineages (Figure S1C). Genetic fate mapping by administration of tamoxifen to Tbx21RFP-CreERT2Rosa26YFP mice revealed that DCs that expressed T-bet at the time of Cre-mediated YFP tagging, retained its expression over their lifespan (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, T-bet-expressing cDC2s represent a stable cell lineage. History of T-bet expression marked by YFP was not detectable in cDC1s (data not shown) indicating that T-bet expression is acquired after DC progenitors commit to cDC2 cell fate. These results suggested that cDC2s may harbor additional subsets defined by expression of alternative TFs.Figure S1Single-Cell Survey Reveals Heterogeneity of cDC2s, Related to Figure 1Show full captionA.

To uncover the full spectrum of DC heterogeneity, we utilized droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile splenic DCs defined as Lin(CD3,CD19,CD90)–Ly6C–CD64–MHCII+CD11c+. Given previous reports of poor Tbx21 transcript detection using such methods (Bernink et al., 2017Bernink J.H. Mjösberg J. Spits H.

Immunol. 2016; 17: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we elected to profile fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) purified RFP(T-bet)+ and RFP(T-bet)– DCs separately (Figure S1D) to enable definitive post hoc identification of T-bet-expressing cells. A total of 4,464 single-cell transcriptomes were generated after pre-processing. Analysis of gene expression was performed on the compiled data from the two populations without consideration of cell-surface markers utilized for sorting. We performed unsupervised graph clustering using Phenograph (Levine et al., 2015Levine J.H. Simonds E.F. Bendall S.C. Davis K.L. Amir A.D. Tadmor M.D. Litvin O. Fienberg H.G. Jager A.

This identified 17 distinct clusters, visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (Figure 1E). Comparison of their transcriptional features with immune cell transcriptome profiles reported by ImmGen Consortium (Miller et al., 2012Miller J.C. Brown B.D. Shay T. Gautier E.L. Jojic V. Cohain A. Pandey G. Leboeuf M. Elpek K.G. Helft J. et al.Immunological Genome ConsortiumDeciphering the transcriptional network of the dendritic cell lineage.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) revealed a contaminating population of Ly6C+ monocytes (cluster 16; Figures S1D and S1E) that were removed from downstream analyses. We established the cell identity of each cluster through the analysis of canonical DC gene expression (Figure 1F), similarity with bulk transcriptomes from Immgen datasets (Figure S1E) and proportion of RFP(T-bet)+ cells for each cluster (Figure 1G). CLEC9A+XCR1+ cDC1s were partitioned across 6 clusters (1, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 13), T-bet+CD11b+SIRPα+ cDC2s were represented by 5 clusters (0, 2, 6, 8, 15) and T-bet–CD11b+SIRPα+ cDC2s by 2 clusters (3 and 10). In agreement with a recent study (Cabeza-Cabrerizo et al., 2019Cabeza-Cabrerizo M. van Blijswijk J. Wienert S. Heim D. Jenkins R.P. Chakravarty P. Rogers N. Frederico B. Acton S. Beerling E. et al.Tissue clonality of dendritic cell subsets and emergency DCpoiesis revealed by multicolor fate mapping of DC progenitors.Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4: eaaw1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we identified proliferating DCs marked by enrichment of genes associated with cell-cycle comprising 19.1% of cDC1s (cluster 4) and 15.7% of cDC2s (clusters 6 and 8; Figure 1H), suggesting that mature splenic DCs are actively dividing in the steady state. After removal of cell-cycle signals, the first principal component of variation which drives the phenotypic diversity in T-bet+ cDC2s comprises genes associated with DC maturation (Cd83, Ccr7), along with increased expression of cytokines and chemokines (Figure S1F). Thus, the clusters of T-bet+ cDC2s likely represent a continuum of discrete states of maturation rather than separate phenotypic entities. Remaining heterogeneity among cDC1 clusters was primarily accounted for by cells in cluster 9, which exhibited a mixed cDC1/cDC2 phenotype and characteristics of “doublets,” potentially arising from phagocytosis. Cluster 14 contained a mixture of T-bet+ and T-bet– cDC2s. Two clusters (11 and 12), lacking both Itgam (CD11b) and Xcr1, did not align with either cDC1s or cDC2s. Cluster 11 cells had a weak cDC2 signature (Figure 1F) while also expressing genes associated with plasmacytoid DCs (Bst1, Il3ra, Siglech, and Irf7) (Figure 1F), reminiscent of recently described circulating human pre-DCs (See et al., 2017See P. Dutertre C.A. Chen J. Günther P. McGovern N. Irac S.E. Gunawan M. Beyer M. Händler K.

Cluster 12 cells were distinguished by high Ccr7 expression and a gene signature that correlated with peripheral lymph node (LN) MHCIIhi “migratory” DCs (Figure S1E; Miller et al., 2012Miller J.C.

Helft J. et al.Immunological Genome ConsortiumDeciphering the transcriptional network of the dendritic cell lineage.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The transcriptional profiles of the clusters identified by scRNA-seq analyses closely resembled those of bulk-sorted T-bet– cDC2s, T-bet+ cDC2s, and cDC1s analyzed using conventional RNA-seq (Figure 1I). To gain further insight into cDC2 heterogeneity, we identified differential gene expression signatures for the individual cDC2 clusters (Figure 2A; Table S1). Shared gene expression among individual T-bet+ cDC2 clusters suggests that these clusters represent a single cellular population with graded gene expression states. Cluster 14, comprising T-bet+ and T-bet– cDC2s, was distinguished by an increased metabolically active state (Figure S2A). The two T-bet– cDC2 clusters (3 and 10) shared expression of Csf1r and Lyz2 and other genes known to be associated with monocytes and macrophages (Figure 2A). Tmem176a and Tmem176b were highly expressed in T-bet– cDC2s (Figure 2A). This observation was particularly intriguing given that expression of these genes is RORγt-dependent and a feature of all RORγt lymphocytes—ILC3s and Th17 cells (Ciofani et al., 2012Ciofani M.

Cytospin analysis of Wright-Giemsa stained sorted cDC2 subsets. To identify discriminative cell surface markers that would best classify cells into T-bet+ cDC2s or T-bet– cDC2s, we combined the earth mover's distance (EMD)-based measure of differential expression with a measure of classification—the area under the ROC curve (AUC) metric—on imputed expression values (McClish, 1989McClish D.K. Analyzing a portion of the ROC curve.Med. Decis. Making. 1989; 9: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Among 64 genes identified (AUC ≥ 0.99, EMD ≥ 4 SD; Figure S2B; Table S2), T-bet+ cDC2s were best defined by the expression of the Notch target Dtx1 indicating that this subset may represent the Notch2-dependent cDC2 subset, previously distinguished by cell surface expression of Esam (Lewis et al., 2011Lewis K.L.

T-bet– cDC2 clusters uniquely expressed CLEC12A and could be further separated based on the expression of several cell surface markers by cluster 10 cells including CLEC10A (CD301a), CD209a, and NKG2D (Klrk1) (Figures 2A and S2C). Cd301b (Mgl2) was exclusively expressed by this cluster (Figure S2D) indicating that Mgl2+ cDC2s, previously reported in the skin and draining LN (Kumamoto et al., 2013Kumamoto Y. Linehan M. Weinstein J.S. Laidlaw B.J. Craft J.E. Iwasaki A.

Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that CLEC12A was exclusively expressed by T-bet– DCs (Figures 2C and 2D). Esam alone was not sufficient to discriminate between T-bet+ and T-bet– DCs (Figures 2C and 2D). In agreement with the scRNA-seq analysis, CLEC10A expression was limited to a subset of (T-bet–/CLEC12A+) cDC2s (Figures 2C and 2D). Further analysis of lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue confirmed that CLEC12A+ and CLEC10A+ cDC2 subsets reside within the T-bet– cDC2 fraction (Figure S2E). Thus, a combination of Esam and CLEC12A could be used to distinguish T-bet+ DCs from T-bet– DCs with CLEC10A further delineating two subsets of T-bet– DCs. Using these newly defined markers we sorted T-bet+, T-bet–CLEC10A+, and T-bet–CLEC10A– cDC2 subsets and assessed their morphology using cytospin. These cell subsets were morphologically indistinguishable with classic cerebriform nuclei typical of DCs (Figure S2F; Inaba et al., 1992Inaba K. Inaba M. Romani N. Aya H. Deguchi M. Ikehara S.

https://openalex.org/W2982548291,"Accumulation of mutant proteins is a major cause of many diseases (collectively called proteopathies), and lowering the level of these proteins can be useful for treatment of these diseases. We hypothesized that compounds that interact with both the autophagosome protein microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3)1 and the disease-causing protein may target the latter for autophagic clearance. Mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) contains an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract and causes Huntington’s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disorder2. Here, using small-molecule-microarray-based screening, we identified four compounds that interact with both LC3 and mHTT, but not with the wild-type HTT protein. Some of these compounds targeted mHTT to autophagosomes, reduced mHTT levels in an allele-selective manner, and rescued disease-relevant phenotypes in cells and in vivo in fly and mouse models of Huntington’s disease. We further show that these compounds interact with the expanded polyQ stretch and could lower the level of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3), another disease-causing protein with an expanded polyQ tract3. This study presents candidate compounds for lowering mHTT and potentially other disease-causing proteins with polyQ expansions, demonstrating the concept of lowering levels of disease-causing proteins using autophagosome-tethering compounds. Compounds that interact with mutant huntingtin and an autophagosomal protein are able to reduce cellular levels of mutant huntingtin by targeting it for autophagic degradation, demonstrating an approach that may have potential for treating proteopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2982036345,"The axoneme of motile cilia is the largest macromolecular machine of eukaryotic cells. In humans, impaired axoneme function causes a range of ciliopathies. Axoneme assembly, structure, and motility require a radially arranged set of doublet microtubules, each decorated in repeating patterns with non-tubulin components. We use single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to visualize and build an atomic model of the repeating structure of a native axonemal doublet microtubule, which reveals the identities, positions, repeat lengths, and interactions of 38 associated proteins, including 33 microtubule inner proteins (MIPs). The structure demonstrates how these proteins establish the unique architecture of doublet microtubules, maintain coherent periodicities along the axoneme, and stabilize the microtubules against the repeated mechanical stress induced by ciliary motility. Our work elucidates the architectural principles that underpin the assembly of this large, repetitive eukaryotic structure and provides a molecular basis for understanding the etiology of human ciliopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2980407838,"Epigenetic aberrations are widespread in cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms and causality remain poorly understood1–3. A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) lack canonical kinase mutations but instead have succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency and global DNA hyper-methylation4,5. Here, we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in genome topology that activate oncogenic programs. To investigate epigenetic alterations systematically, we mapped DNA methylation, CTCF insulators, enhancers, and chromosome topology in KIT-mutant, PDGFRA-mutant and SDH-deficient GISTs. Although these respective subtypes shared similar enhancer landscapes, we identified hundreds of putative insulators where DNA methylation replaced CTCF binding in SDH-deficient GISTs. We focused on a disrupted insulator that normally partitions a core GIST super-enhancer from the FGF4 oncogene. Recurrent loss of this insulator alters locus topology in SDH-deficient GISTs, allowing aberrant physical interaction between enhancer and oncogene. CRISPR-mediated excision of the corresponding CTCF motifs in an SDH-intact GIST model disrupted the boundary between enhancer and oncogene, and strongly upregulated FGF4 expression. We also identified a second recurrent insulator loss event near the KIT oncogene, which is also highly expressed across SDH-deficient GISTs. Finally, we established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from an SDH-deficient GIST that faithfully maintains the epigenetics of the parental tumour, including hypermethylation and insulator defects. This PDX model is highly sensitive to FGF receptor (FGFR) inhibition, and more so to combined FGFR and KIT inhibition, validating the functional significance of the underlying epigenetic lesions. Our study reveals how epigenetic alterations can drive oncogenic programs in the absence of canonical kinase mutations, with implications for mechanistic targeting of aberrant pathways in cancers. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours can be initiated by gain-of-function mutations of the KIT or PDGFRA oncogenes but also by loss of the metabolic complex succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which leads to DNA hypermethylation; this study shows that in SDH-deficient tumours, displacement of CTCF insulators by DNA methylation activates oncogene expression, illustrating how epigenetic alterations can drive oncogenic signalling in the absence of kinase mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2982664504,"Mitochondria are essential regulators of cellular energy and metabolism, and have a crucial role in sustaining the growth and survival of cancer cells. A central function of mitochondria is the synthesis of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, known as mitochondrial bioenergetics. Mitochondria maintain oxidative phosphorylation by creating a membrane potential gradient that is generated by the electron transport chain to drive the synthesis of ATP1. Mitochondria are essential for tumour initiation and maintaining tumour cell growth in cell culture and xenografts2,3. However, our understanding of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer is limited because most studies have been performed in vitro in cell culture models. This highlights a need for in vivo studies to better understand how oxidative metabolism supports tumour growth. Here we measure mitochondrial membrane potential in non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo using a voltage-sensitive, positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer known as 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium (18F-BnTP)4. By using PET imaging of 18F-BnTP, we profile mitochondrial membrane potential in autochthonous mouse models of lung cancer, and find distinct functional mitochondrial heterogeneity within subtypes of lung tumours. The use of 18F-BnTP PET imaging enabled us to functionally profile mitochondrial membrane potential in live tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2989537329,"Information and assurance from healthcare workers (HCWs) is reported by laypeople as a key factor in their decision to get vaccinated. However, previous research has shown that, as in the general population, hesitancy towards vaccines exists among HCWs as well. Previous studies further suggest that HCWs with a higher confidence in vaccinations and vaccine providers are more willing to take the vaccines themselves and to recommend vaccines to patients. In the present study with 2962 Finnish HCWs (doctors, head nurses, nurses, and practical nurses), we explored the associations between HCWs’ vaccination confidence (perceived benefit and safety of vaccines and trust in health professionals), their decisions to accept vaccines for themselves and their children, and their willingness to recommend vaccines to patients. The results showed that although the majority of HCWs had high confidence in vaccinations, a notable share reported low vaccination confidence. Moreover, in line with previous research, HCWs with higher confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines were more likely to accept vaccines for their children and themselves, and to recommend vaccines to their patients. Trust in other health professionals was not directly related to vaccination or recommendation behavior. Confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines was highest among doctors, and increased along with the educational level of the HCWs, suggesting a link between confidence and the degree of medical training. Ensuring high confidence in vaccines among HCWs may be important in maintaining high vaccine uptake in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2982390087,"Antibody class switch recombination (CSR) in B lymphocytes replaces immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (Igh) Cμ constant region exons (CHs) with one of six CHs lying 100–200 kb downstream1. Each CH is flanked upstream by an I promoter and long repetitive switch (S) region1. Cytokines and activators induce activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)2 and I-promoter transcription, with 3′ IgH regulatory region (3′ IgHRR) enhancers controlling the latter via I-promoter competition for long-range 3′ IgHRR interactions3–8. Transcription through donor Sμ and an activated downstream acceptor S-region targets AID-generated deamination lesions at, potentially, any of hundreds of individual S-region deamination motifs9–11. General DNA repair pathways convert these lesions to double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and join an Sμ-upstream DSB-end to an acceptor S-region-downstream DSB-end for deletional CSR12. AID-initiated DSBs at targets spread across activated S regions routinely participate in such deletional CSR joining11. Here we report that chromatin loop extrusion underlies the mechanism11 by which IgH organization in cis promotes deletional CSR. In naive B cells, loop extrusion dynamically juxtaposes 3′ IgHRR enhancers with the 200-kb upstream Sμ to generate a CSR centre (CSRC). In CSR-activated primary B cells, I-promoter transcription activates cohesin loading, leading to generation of dynamic subdomains that directionally align a downstream S region with Sμ for deletional CSR. During constitutive Sα CSR in CH12F3 B lymphoma cells, inversional CSR can be activated by insertion of a CTCF-binding element (CBE)-based impediment in the extrusion path. CBE insertion also inactivates upstream S-region CSR and converts adjacent downstream sequences into an ectopic S region by inhibiting and promoting their dynamic alignment with Sμ in the CSRC, respectively. Our findings suggest that, in a CSRC, dynamically impeded cohesin-mediated loop extrusion juxtaposes proper ends of AID-initiated donor and acceptor S-region DSBs for deletional CSR. Such a mechanism might also contribute to pathogenic DSB joining genome-wide. Chromatin loop extrusion has fundamental mechanistic roles in immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2982312400,"Immunosuppression increases the risk of cancers that are associated with viral infection1. In particular, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin—which has been associated with beta human papillomavirus (β-HPV) infection—is increased by more than 100-fold in immunosuppressed patients2–4. Previous studies have not established a causative role for HPVs in driving the development of skin cancer. Here we show that T cell immunity against commensal papillomaviruses suppresses skin cancer in immunocompetent hosts, and the loss of this immunity—rather than the oncogenic effect of HPVs—causes the markedly increased risk of skin cancer in immunosuppressed patients. To investigate the effects of papillomavirus on carcinogen-driven skin cancer, we colonized several strains of immunocompetent mice with mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1)5. Mice with natural immunity against MmuPV1 after colonization and acquired immunity through the transfer of T cells from immune mice or by MmuPV1 vaccination were protected against skin carcinogenesis induced by chemicals or by ultraviolet radiation in a manner dependent on CD8+ T cells. RNA and DNA in situ hybridization probes for 25 commensal β-HPVs revealed a significant reduction in viral activity and load in human skin cancer compared with the adjacent healthy skin, suggesting a strong immune selection against virus-positive malignant cells. Consistently, E7 peptides from β-HPVs activated CD8+ T cells from unaffected human skin. Our findings reveal a beneficial role for commensal viruses and establish a foundation for immune-based approaches that could block the development of skin cancer by boosting immunity against the commensal HPVs present in all of our skin. A mouse model of papillomavirus infection reveals that skin colonization with commensal papillomaviruses protects the immunocompetent host against chemical- and UV-induced skin cancer through CD8+ T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2982362728,"The human gastrointestinal tract consists of a dense and diverse microbial community, the composition of which is intimately linked to health. Extrinsic factors such as diet and host immunity are insufficient to explain the constituents of this community, and direct interactions between co-resident microorganisms have been implicated as important drivers of microbiome composition. The genomes of bacteria derived from the gut microbiome contain several pathways that mediate contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism1-3. Many members of the Gram-negative order Bacteroidales encode the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which facilitates the delivery of toxic effector proteins into adjacent cells4,5. Here we report the occurrence of acquired interbacterial defence (AID) gene clusters in Bacteroidales species that reside within the human gut microbiome. These clusters encode arrays of immunity genes that protect against T6SS-mediated intra- and inter-species bacterial antagonism. Moreover, the clusters reside on mobile elements, and we show that their transfer is sufficient to confer resistance to toxins in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, we identify and validate the protective capability of a recombinase-associated AID subtype (rAID-1) that is present broadly in Bacteroidales genomes. These rAID-1 gene clusters have a structure suggestive of active gene acquisition and include predicted immunity factors of toxins derived from diverse organisms. Our data suggest that neutralization of contact-dependent interbacterial antagonism by AID systems helps to shape human gut microbiome ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2982570657,"The Fanconi anaemia (FA) pathway repairs DNA damage caused by endogenous and chemotherapy-induced DNA crosslinks, and responds to replication stress1,2. Genetic inactivation of this pathway by mutation of genes encoding FA complementation group (FANC) proteins impairs development, prevents blood production and promotes cancer1,3. The key molecular step in the FA pathway is the monoubiquitination of a pseudosymmetric heterodimer of FANCD2-FANCI4,5 by the FA core complex-a megadalton multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase6,7. Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 then recruits additional protein factors to remove the DNA crosslink or to stabilize the stalled replication fork. A molecular structure of the FA core complex would explain how it acts to maintain genome stability. Here we reconstituted an active, recombinant FA core complex, and used cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to determine its structure. The FA core complex comprises two central dimers of the FANCB and FA-associated protein of 100 kDa (FAAP100) subunits, flanked by two copies of the RING finger subunit, FANCL. These two heterotrimers act as a scaffold to assemble the remaining five subunits, resulting in an extended asymmetric structure. Destabilization of the scaffold would disrupt the entire complex, resulting in a non-functional FA pathway. Thus, the structure provides a mechanistic basis for the low numbers of patients with mutations in FANCB, FANCL and FAAP100. Despite a lack of sequence homology, FANCB and FAAP100 adopt similar structures. The two FANCL subunits are in different conformations at opposite ends of the complex, suggesting that each FANCL has a distinct role. This structural and functional asymmetry of dimeric RING finger domains may be a general feature of E3 ligases. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the FA core complex provides a foundation for a detailed understanding of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and DNA interstrand crosslink repair."
https://openalex.org/W2981803065,"Current approaches to reducing the latent HIV reservoir entail first reactivating virus-containing cells to become visible to the immune system. A critical second step is killing these cells to reduce reservoir size. Endogenous cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) may not be adequate because of cellular exhaustion and the evolution of CTL-resistant viruses. We have designed a universal CAR-T cell platform based on CTLs engineered to bind a variety of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. We show that this platform, convertibleCAR-T cells, effectively kills HIV-infected, but not uninfected, CD4 T cells from blood, tonsil, or spleen and only when armed with anti-HIV antibodies. convertibleCAR-T cells also kill within 48 h more than half of the inducible reservoir found in blood of HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy. The modularity of convertibleCAR-T cell system, which allows multiplexing with several anti-HIV antibodies yielding greater breadth and control, makes it a promising tool for attacking the latent HIV reservoir."

https://openalex.org/W2982457389,"Over the past eight hundred thousand years, glacial–interglacial cycles oscillated with a period of one hundred thousand years (‘100k world’1). Ice core and ocean sediment data have shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide, Antarctic temperature, deep ocean temperature, and global ice volume correlated strongly with each other in the 100k world2–6. Between about 2.8 and 1.2 million years ago, glacial cycles were smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration (‘40k world’7). Proxy data from deep-sea sediments suggest that the variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 40k world was also lower than in the 100k world8–10, but we do not have direct observations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from this period. Here we report the recovery of stratigraphically discontinuous ice more than two million years old from the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, East Antarctica. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in ice core samples older than two million years have been altered by respiration, but some younger samples are pristine. The recovered ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and Antarctic temperature (based on the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratio δDice, a proxy for regional temperature) into the 40k world. All climate properties before eight hundred thousand years ago fall within the envelope of observations from continuous deep Antarctic ice cores that characterize the 100k world. However, the lowest measured carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and Antarctic temperature in the 40k world are well above glacial values from the past eight hundred thousand years. Our results confirm that the amplitudes of glacial–interglacial variations in atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic climate were reduced in the 40k world, and that the transition from the 40k to the 100k world was accompanied by a decline in minimum carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial maxima. Analysis of two-million-year-old ice from Antarctica provides a direct comparison of atmospheric gas levels before and after the shift from glacial cycles of 100 thousand years to 40-thousand-year cycles around one million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2981636487,"Top-down modulation of visual processing is mediated in part by direct prefrontal to visual cortical projections. Here, we show that the mouse cingulate cortex (Cg) regulates visual processing not only through corticocortical neurons projecting to the visual cortex but also through corticotectal neurons projecting subcortically. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation demonstrated a prominent contribution of Cg corticotectal neurons to visually guided behavior, which is mediated by their collateral projections to both the motor-related layers of the superior colliculus (SC) and the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LP, analogous to the primate pulvinar). Whereas the Cg innervates the anterior LP (LPa), the SC innervates the posterior LP (LPp). Activating each stage of the Cg→SC→LPp or the Cg→LPa pathway strongly enhanced visual performance of the mouse and the sensory responses of visual cortical neurons. These results delineate two subcortical pathways by which a subtype of prefrontal pyramidal neurons exerts a powerful top-down influence on visual processing.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiNzUzMzc2MWJlYTk1YzJlZTJiODcxMzhjNzRlM2VjYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4Mzg3MzExfQ.LOfBs3jPlP3r0G-H9r6iBVUxp-TEViV1f91FgcolBF2Lcd_OXNcFDP4qqF8PAIBRl86iCXrm29GycEaVZtbMXnYqaRIYBYM_cMJK_OCIq26cMMQYsAUb7vPmKTe6rtT6K3q22cxuNfILYkxtmIWtFJQKTLGWSvk3MBdvXzJvrzi5tBy0DJLoOmP6ul5TkWEaVTtDwC5iFmWqyM1b2u5bIejQ0YxNKDdY5-FPgEqrSP8nK_MeJ_0-dgCBr1kgiA_o0JLbSBsJOWWQWt04q9f_2utDvA2UEjWbn8YT89TX2I3Gl9iU6PX3D-pju2lNKpS28e1wH4LFa-2OnxEH1yEiFg(mp4, (37.66 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2981763814,"Manual dexterity requires proprioceptive feedback about the state of the hand. To date, study of the neural basis of proprioception in the cortex has focused primarily on reaching movements to the exclusion of hand-specific behaviors such as grasping. To fill this gap, we record both time-varying hand kinematics and neural activity evoked in somatosensory and motor cortices as monkeys grasp a variety of objects. We find that neurons in the somatosensory cortex, as well as in the motor cortex, preferentially track time-varying postures of multi-joint combinations spanning the entire hand. This contrasts with neural responses during reaching movements, which preferentially track time-varying movement kinematics of the arm, such as velocity and speed of the limb, rather than its time-varying postural configuration. These results suggest different representations of arm and hand movements suited to the different functional roles of these two effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2982316861,"Human achievements are often preceded by repeated attempts that initially fail, yet little is known about the mechanisms governing the dynamics of failure. Here, building on the rich literature on innovation, human dynamics and learning, we develop a simple one-parameter model that mimics how successful future attempts build on those past. Analytically solving this model reveals a phase transition that separates dynamics of failure into regions of stagnation or progression, predicting that near the critical threshold, agents who share similar characteristics and learning strategies may experience fundamentally different outcomes following failures. Below the critical point, we see those who explore disjoint opportunities without a pattern of improvement, and above it, those who exploit incremental refinements to systematically advance toward success. The model makes several empirically testable predictions, demonstrating that those who eventually succeed and those who do not may be initially similar, yet are characterized by fundamentally distinct failure dynamics in terms of the efficiency and quality of each subsequent attempt. We collected large-scale data from three disparate domains, tracing repeated attempts by (i) NIH investigators to fund their research, (ii) innovators to successfully exit their startup ventures, and (iii) terrorist organizations to post casualties in violent attacks, finding broadly consistent empirical support across all three domains. Together, our findings unveil identifiable yet previously unknown early signals that allow us to identify failure dynamics that will lead to ultimate victory or defeat. Given the ubiquitous nature of failures and the paucity of quantitative approaches to understand them, these results represent a crucial step toward deeper understanding of the complex dynamics beneath failures, the essential prerequisites for success."
https://openalex.org/W2984014483,"Neurotrophins and their mimetics are potential treatments for hearing disorders because of their trophic effects on spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) whose connections to hair cells may be compromised in many forms of hearing loss. Studies in noise or ototoxin-exposed animals have shown that local delivery of NT-3 or BDNF has beneficial effects on SGNs and hearing. We evaluated several TrkB or TrkC monoclonal antibody agonists and small molecules, along with BDNF and NT-3, in rat cochlea ex vivo models. The TrkB agonists BDNF and a monoclonal antibody, M3, had the greatest effects on SGN survival, neurite outgrowth and branching. In organotypic cochlear explants, BDNF and M3 enhanced synapse formation between SGNs and inner hair cells and restored these connections after excitotoxin-induced synaptopathy. Loss of these synapses has recently been implicated in hidden hearing loss, a condition characterized by difficulty hearing speech in the presence of background noise. The unique profile of M3 revealed here warrants further investigation, and the broad activity profile of BDNF observed underpins its continued development as a hearing loss therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2981659667,"Anatomical and behavioral data suggest that the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (VLO), which exhibits extensive connectivity and supports diverse sensory and cognitive processes, may exert global influence over brain activity. However, this hypothesis has never been tested directly. We applied optogenetic fMRI to drive various elements of VLO circuitry while visualizing the whole-brain response. Surprisingly, driving excitatory thalamocortical projections to VLO at low frequencies (5-10 Hz) evoked widespread, bilateral decreases in brain activity spanning multiple cortical and subcortical structures. This pattern was unique to thalamocortical projections, with direct stimulations of neither VLO nor thalamus eliciting such a response. High-frequency stimulations (25-40 Hz) of thalamocortical projections evoked dramatically different-though still far-reaching-responses, in the form of widespread ipsilateral activation. Importantly, decreases in brain activity evoked by low-frequency thalamocortical input were mediated by GABA and activity in zona incerta. These findings identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying VLO control of brain-wide neural activities."

https://openalex.org/W2982441393,"The centrosome is a cytoplasmic nonenveloped organelle functioning as one of the microtubule-organizing centers and composing a centriole center surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) granules. PCM consists of many centrosomal proteins, including PCM1 and centrosomal protein 131 (CEP131), and helps maintain centrosome stability. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae whose RNA and viral particles are replicated in the cytoplasm. However, how ZIKV interacts with host cell components during its productive infection stage is incompletely understood. Here, using several primate cell lines, we report that ZIKV infection disrupts and disperses the PCM granules. We demonstrate that PCM1- and CEP131-containing granules are dispersed in ZIKV-infected cells, whereas the centrioles remain intact. We found that ZIKV does not significantly alter cellular skeletal proteins, and, hence, these proteins may not be involved in the interaction between ZIKV and centrosomal proteins. Moreover, ZIKV infection decreased PCM1 and CEP131 protein, but not mRNA, levels. We further found that the protease inhibitor MG132 prevents the decrease in PCM1 and CEP131 levels and centriolar satellite dispersion. Therefore, we hypothesized that ZIKV infection induces proteasomal PCM1 and CEP131 degradation and thereby disrupts the PCM granules. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that ZIKV infection increases levels of mind bomb 1 (MIB1), previously demonstrated to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PCM1 and CEP131 and that ZIKV fails to degrade or disperse PCM in MIB1-ko cells. Our results imply that ZIKV infection activates MIB1-mediated ubiquitination that degrades PCM1 and CEP131, leading to PCM granule dispersion."
https://openalex.org/W2982321558,"ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is an ATP synthase-interacting protein that suppresses the hydrolysis activity of ATP synthase. In this study, we observed that the expression of IF1 was up-regulated in response to electrical pulse stimulation of skeletal muscle cells and in exercized mice and healthy men. IF1 stimulates glucose uptake via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells and primary cultured myoblasts. Reactive oxygen species and Rac family small GTPase 1 (Rac1) function in the upstream and downstream of AMPK, respectively, in IF1-mediated glucose uptake. In diabetic animal models, the administration of recombinant IF1 improved glucose tolerance and down-regulated blood glucose level. In addition, IF1 inhibits ATP hydrolysis by β-F1-ATPase in plasma membrane, thereby increasing extracellular ATP and activating the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, ultimately leading to glucose uptake. Thus, we suggest that IF1 is a novel myokine and propose a mechanism by which AMPK and Akt contribute independently to IF1-mediated improvement of glucose tolerance impairment. These results demonstrate the importance of IF1 as a potential antidiabetic agent.-Lee, H. J., Moon, J., Chung, I., Chung, J. H., Park, C., Lee, J. O., Han, J. A., Kang, M. J., Yoo, E.

https://openalex.org/W2982645678,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability worldwide. It arises when the blood flow to the brain is severely impaired, causing brain infarction. The current therapies for ischemic stroke are tissue plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy, which re-establishes blood circulation to the brain but offers no neuroprotective effects. Excitotoxicity, particularly through the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), has been heavily implicated in the pathophysiology of brain infarction resulting from ischemic stroke. Here we investigated the interaction between NMDAR and metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) as a novel target to develop potential neuroprotective agents for ischemic stroke. Through coimmunoprecipitation and affinity binding assay, we revealed that the interaction is mediated through 2 distinct sites on the mGluR1 C terminus. We then found that the disruption of mGluR1-GluN2A subunit of NMDAR (GluN2A) protected the primary mouse hippocampal neurons against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and reversed the NMDAR-mediated regulation of ERK1/2 in rat hippocampal slices. The same protection was also observed in an animal model of ischemic stroke, alleviating brain infarction and yielding better motor recovery. These findings confirmed the existence of a receptor-receptor interaction between NMDAR and mGluR1, implicating this interconnection as a potential treatment target site for ischemic stroke.-Lai, T.

https://openalex.org/W2982364696,"The lipid aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) is a highly reactive protein crosslinker derived from peroxidation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and generated together with 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). Lipid peroxidation product-mediated crosslinking of proteins in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) causes HDL dysfunction and contributes to atherogenesis. Although HNE is relatively well-studied, the role of ONE in atherosclerosis and in modifying HDL is unknown. Here, we found that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) had significantly higher ONE-ketoamide (lysine) adducts in HDL (54.6 ± 33.8 pmol/mg) than healthy controls (15.3 ± 5.6 pmol/mg). ONE crosslinked apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) on HDL at a concentration of > 3 mol ONE per 10 mol apoA-I (0.3 eq), which was 100-fold lower than HNE, but comparable to the potent protein crosslinker isolevuglandin. ONE-modified HDL partially inhibited HDL's ability to protect against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) gene expression in murine macrophages. At 3 eq, ONE dramatically decreased apoA-I exchange from HDL, from ∼46.5 to ∼18.4% (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, ONE modification of HDL or apoA-I did not alter macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that Lys-12, Lys-23, Lys-96, and Lys-226 in apoA-I are modified by ONE ketoamide adducts. Compared with other dicarbonyl scavengers, pentylpyridoxamine (PPM) most efficaciously blocked ONE-induced protein crosslinking in HDL and also prevented HDL dysfunction in an in vitro model of inflammation. Our findings show that ONE-HDL adducts cause HDL dysfunction and are elevated in individuals with FH who have severe hypercholesterolemia."
https://openalex.org/W2982568949,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by macrophage-driven synovitis. Macrophages promote synovial health but become inflammatory when their regulatory functions are overwhelmed. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) are a rich source of macrophage progenitors used for treating chronic inflammation and produce essential molecules for cartilage metabolism. This study investigated the response to autologous BMNC injection in normal and inflamed joints. Synovitis was induced in both radiocarpal joints of 6 horses. After 8 h, 1 inflamed radiocarpal and 1 normal tarsocrural joint received BMNC injection. Contralateral joints were injected with saline. Synovial fluid was collected at 24, 96, and 144 h for cytology, cytokine quantification, and flow cytometry. At 144 h, horses were euthanatized, joints were evaluated, and synovium was harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. Four days after BMNC treatment, inflamed joints had 24% higher macrophage counts with 10% more IL-10+ cells than saline-treated controls. BMNC-treated joints showed gross and analytical improvements in synovial fluid and synovial membrane, with increasing regulatory macrophages and synovial fluid IL-10 concentrations compared with saline-treated controls. BMNC-treated joints were comparable to healthy joints histologically, which remained abnormal in saline-treated controls. Autologous BMNCs are readily available, regulate synovitis through macrophage-associated effects, and can benefit thousands of patients with OA.-Menarim, B. C., Gillis, K.

https://openalex.org/W2989231430,"Hibernation consists of extended durations of torpor interrupted by periodic arousals. The ‘dehydration hypothesis’ proposes that hibernating mammals arouse to replenish water lost through evaporation during torpor. Arousals are energetically expensive, and increased arousal frequency can alter survival throughout hibernation. Yet we lack a means to assess the effect of evaporative water loss (EWL), determined by animal physiology and hibernation microclimate, on torpor bout duration and subsequent survival. White-nose syndrome (WNS), a devastating disease impacting hibernating bats, causes increased frequency of arousals during hibernation and EWL has been hypothesized to contribute to this increased arousal frequency. WNS is caused by a fungus, which grows well in humid hibernaculum environments and damages wing tissue important for water conservation. Here, we integrated the effect of EWL on torpor expression in a hibernation energetics model, including the effects of fungal infection, to determine the link between EWL and survival. We collected field data for Myotis lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from WNS, to gather parameters for the model. In saturating conditions, we predicted healthy bats experience minimal mortality. Infected bats, however, suffer high fungal growth in highly saturated environments, leading to exhaustion of fat stores before spring. Our results suggest that host adaptation to humid environments leads to increased arousal frequency from infection, which drives mortality across hibernaculum conditions. Our modified hibernation model provides a tool to assess the interplay between host physiology, hibernaculum microclimate, and diseases such as WNS on winter survival."
https://openalex.org/W2982309821,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored sperm hyaluronidases (Hyals), sperm adhesion molecule 1 (SPAM1) and HYAL5, have long been believed to assist in sperm penetration through the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC), but their role in mammalian fertilization remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that mouse sperm devoid of either Spam1 or Hyal5 are still capable of penetrating the COC and that the loss of either Spam1 or Hyal5 alone does not cause male infertility in mice. In the present study, we found that Spam1/Hyal5 double knockout (dKO) mice produced significantly fewer offspring compared with wild-type (WT) mice, and this was due to defective COC dispersal. A comparative analysis between WT and Spam1/Hyal5 dKO epididymal sperm revealed that the absence of these 2 sperm Hyals resulted in a marked accumulation of sperm on the outside of the COC. This impaired sperm activity is likely due to the deficiency in the sperm Hyals, even though other somatic Hyals are expressed normally in the dKO mice. The fertilization ability of the Spam1/Hyal5 dKO sperm was restored by adding purified human sperm Hyal to the in vitro fertilization medium. Our results suggest that Hyal deficiency in sperm may be a significant risk factor for male sterility.-Park, S., Kim, Y.-H., Jeong, P.-S., Park, C., Lee, J.-W., Kim, J.-S., Wee, G., Song, B.-S., Park, B.-J., Kim, S.-H., Sim, B.-W., Kim, S.-U., Triggs-Raine, B., Baba, T., Lee, S.-R., Kim, E.

https://openalex.org/W2984431747,"Al Wajh Bank in the northern Red Sea contains an extensive coral reef system that potentially supports a novel fish community. The large (1500km2) and shallow (< 40m depth) lagoon experiences greater temperature and salinity fluctuations, as well as higher turbidity, than most other Red Sea reefs. Since these conditions often influence coral community structure and introduce physiological challenges to its resident organisms, changes in reef-associated fishes are expected. We present critical baseline data on fish biodiversity and benthic composition for the Al Wajh Bank. Underwater visual census of conspicuous fishes and standardized collections of cryptobenthic fishes were combined to provide a comprehensive assessment of these fish communities. We documented 153 fish species and operational taxonomic units, including undescribed species, within 24 families on reefs largely dominated by hard coral and soft sediment (39% and 32% respectively). The families Pomacentridae and Gobiidae contributed the most towards fish diversity and abundance. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances among sampled sites suggest a distinctive fish community within the lagoon, and coefficients of variation for each species show high variation in their distribution across the lagoon. Species accumulation curves predict that additional sampling would document many more species throughout Al Wajh. Our findings provide the most extensive biodiversity survey of fishes from this region to date and record the condition of the reef prior to major coastal development planned to occur in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2982388172,"Adiponectin is secreted by adipose tissue and promotes insulin sensitivity. Low circulating adiponectin is associated with increased risk for preterm labor, but the influence of adiponectin on uterine myometrial physiology is unknown. We hypothesized that adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) decrease myometrial contractility via AMPK to promote uterine quiescence in pregnancy. Using quantitative RT‐PCR, we found that nonpregnant or pregnant human and mouse myometrium express AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNAs. We confirmed AdipoR2 protein expression in human and mouse myometrium, with increased abundance in late mouse pregnancy. Both recombinant adiponectin and a pharmacologic AdipoR agonist, AdipoRon, potently inhibited uterine myometrial strip contractions in physiologic organ bath. The relaxation was independent of contractile stimulus (oxytocin, KCl, U46619). AdipoR agonists increased AMPK phosphorylation in pregnant mouse myometrium, and the direct AMPK activator A769662 also relaxed myometrial strips. However, the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (compound C) blocked AMPK phosphorylation but did not abolish relaxation with either AdipoRon or A769662. In summary, adiponectin inhibits myometrial contractility consistent with the possibility that it is a previously unrecognized link between maternal metabolism and pregnancy maintenance. We also identify a separate role for AMPK regulating myometrial contractions that may influence labor onset.—Vyas, V., Guerra, D. D., Bok, R., Powell, T., Jansson, T., Hurt, K. J.

https://openalex.org/W2988867646,"Over the past two decades, a growing cadre of US states has legalized the drug commonly known as “marijuana.” But even as more states legalize the drug, proponents of reform have begun to shun the term “marijuana” in favor of the term “cannabis.” Arguing that the “M” word has been tainted and may thus dampen public support for legalization, policy advocates have championed “cannabis” as an alternative and more neutral name for the drug. Importantly, however, no one has tested whether calling the drug “cannabis” as opposed to “marijuana” actually has any effect on public opinion. Using an original survey experiment, we examine whether framing the drug as “marijuana” as opposed to “cannabis” shapes public attitudes across a range of related topics: support for legalization of the drug, moral acceptance of its use, tolerance of activities involving the drug, perceptions of the drug’s harms, and stereotypes of its users. Throughout each of our tests, we find no evidence to suggest that the public distinguishes between the terms “marijuana” and “cannabis.” We conclude with implications of our findings for debates over marijuana/cannabis policy and for framing in policy discourse more generally."

We have recently shown 30‐d exposure to increased inspired CO 2 (InCO 2 ) leads to a steady‐state ventilation that exceeds the level predicted by the sustained acidosis and the acute CO 2 /H + chemoreflex, suggesting plasticity within respiratory control centers. Based on data showing brainstem changes in aminergic and inflammatory signaling during carotid body denervation‐induced hypercapnia, we hypothesized chronic hypercapnia per se will lead to similar changes. We found that: 1 ) increased InCO 2 increased IL‐1β in the medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column, and cuneate nucleus after 24 h, but not after 30 d of hypercapnia; 2 ) the number of serotonergic and total neurons were reduced within the MR and ventrolateral medulla following 30 d of increased InCO 2 ; 3 ) markers of tryptophan metabolism were altered following 24 h, but not 30 d of InCO 2 ; and 4 ) there were few changes in brainstem amine levels following 24 h or 30 d of increased InCO 2 . We conclude that these changes may contribute to initiating or maintaining respiratory neuroplasticity during chronic hypercapnia but alone do not account for ventilatory acclimatization to chronic increased InCO 2 .—Burgraff, N.

Serum-free media for CHO-K1 cells require putrescine supplementation, because these cells lack the first enzyme of the polyamine production pathway, arginase. On the basis of this phenotype, we developed an arginase-based selection system. We transfected CHO-K1 cells with a bicistronic vector co-expressing GFP and arginase and selected cells in media devoid of l-ornithine and putrescine, resulting in mixed populations stably expressing GFP. Moreover, single clones in these selective media stably expressed GFP for a total of 42 generations. Using this polyamine starvation method, we next generated recombinant CHO-K1 cells co-expressing arginase and human erythropoietin (hEPO), which also displayed stable expression and healthy growth.

Development of CHO producer cell lines is mainly based on two selection markers: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme required for nucleotide metabolism, and glutamine synthetase (GS), essential for intracellular glutamine production (4Costa A.R.

In both systems, selection occurs in the absence of a vital supplement (thymidine and hypoxanthine for DHFR-deficient cells and glutamine for the GS system), preventing the growth of nontransfected populations. Compared with DHFR selection, the GS system can be equally used to derive parental cells lacking GS activity (such as NS0 myeloma or SP2 hybridoma cell lines) or expressing glutamine synthetase (such as CHO cells), in which case methionine sulfoximine (MSX) selection pressure is applied. However, more stringent selection achieved with GS knockout CHO cells have been reported to double mAb bulk culture productivity compared with parental CHO-K1 (5Fan L. Kadura I. Krebs L.E.

In both cases, highly producing populations are generated by increasing the stringency of the selection process with either methotrexate (MTX), a DHFR inhibitor, or MSX, a GS inhibitor, thus inducing transgene co-amplification. However, several rounds of incrementing MTX concentrations are usually required, resulting in a 5–6-month selecting process (6Jayapal K.P. Wlaschin K.F. Hu W.S. Yap M.C.S.

To note, increased mutation rates have been reported from the long amplification process involving mutagenic chemicals, resulting in occasions in variations in the amino acid sequence of the desired product (7Guo D.

Further investigation of polyamine metabolism has resulted from the generation of knockout cell lines and use of enzyme inhibitors (such as α-difluoromethylornithine and 5′-{[(Z)-4-amino-2-butenyl]methylamino}-5′-deoxyadenosine), exposing the vital role of these polycations for healthy cell proliferation (21Pohjanpelto P.

Based on the polyamine dependence phenotype of CHO cells and because of the limitations still remaining for efficient generation of stable cell lines, we aimed to develop an alternative cytotoxic-free selection system for producer cell lines. During the development of a serum-free medium for CHO cells (SFM-F12) (25Capella Roca B. Alarcón Miguez A. Keenan J. Suda S. Barron N. O’Gorman D. Doolan P. Clynes M. Zinc supplementation increases protein titer of recombinant CHO cells.Cytotechnology. 2019; 71 (31396753): 915-92410.1007/s10616-019-00334-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), reduction of putrescine supplementation to less than 200 μg/liter was observed to have a dramatic negative effect on cell growth, resulting in a consistent drop on viability to less than 55% at concentrations lower than 100 μg/liter. In SFM-F12 with increased putrescine supplementation up to 200 μg/liter, a substantial negative effect in viable cell density (VCD) and viabilities was still observed (Fig. S1). Intracellular putrescine production requires the conversion of arginine to l-ornithine, which is then decarboxylated to generate putrescine. To assess which of the two reactions was causing the putrescine-dependent phenotype observed, CHO-K1 cells were cultured for fourteen passages in three conditions: (i) SFM-F12 medium lacking putrescine, (ii) SFM-F12 medium supplemented with l-ornithine (10 μm), and (iii) SFM-F12 control medium (containing 1.08 mg/liter putrescine). Because of the presence of traces of putrescine (81 μg/liter) in the DMEM-F12 formulation (basal media for SFM-F12 medium), a SFM-F10 medium (based in DMEM-F10 medium (1:1 v/v) with 0 μg/liter putrescine) was developed and tested under the same conditions as SFM-F12 to compare effects of medium fully depleted of putrescine. In SFM-F12 (Fig. 1, a, c, and e), CHO-K1 cells were observed to display a similar growth profile in both l-ornithine and putrescine supplemented media with consistent viabilities (87–95%) maintained among the four passages. In contrast, cultures in nonsupplemented SFM-F12 (Fig. 1e) displayed negligible growth. Similar to the SFM-F12 results, SFM-F10 l-ornithine and putrescine supplemented cultures displayed similar profiles, with growth observed at each passage and viabilities increased from P2 to P4 (Fig. 1, b and d). Zero growth was observed in CHO-K1 cells in SFM-F10 nonsupplemented medium, with viability decreasing to 15% by P2 (Fig. 1f). It is noteworthy that CHO-K1 cells were grown in SFM-F12 medium supplemented with putrescine prior to the start of the SFM-F10 test, with no previous adaptation to SFM-F10 medium. This may explain the similar growth profiles observed in all three SFM-F10 testing media at P1 and P2 (Fig. 1, b, d, and f). In 1982, Hölttä et al. (19Hölttä E. Pohjanpelto P. Polyamine dependence of Chinese hamster ovary cells in serum-free culture is due to deficient arginase activity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721 (7159597): 321-32710.1016/0167-4889(82)90085-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported a lack of arginase activity in a CHO-K1 cell line in serum-free conditions, resulting in a polyamine-dependent phenotype. In accordance with their findings, it was hypothesized that a lack of arginase expression could be also occurring in our parental cell line. Based on that and, to exploit this phenotype, we designed a selection system for CHO-K1 producer cell lines. As a proof of concept, a commercial arginase-expressing vector, pcDNA3.1-mArg (Addgene), was first transfected and selected in media lacking putrescine (NoP) compared with media with putrescine (P). A negative control, consisting of WT untransfected cells, was also included. CHO-K1 cells transfected and selected in SFM-F12 medium lacking putrescine resumed cellular growth by passage 6 (day 20), finally reaching VCD and viability profiles similar to the parental control cells in putrescine-containing media by passage 8 (day 26) (Fig. 2, a and b). Correspondingly, an increase in arginase activity was also detected in the transfected and selected cultures (NoP-Arg) from P5 (Fig. 2c). In contrast, expected minimal arginase activity levels were detected in parental cells, with a cessation of growth in media without putrescine (NoP-Neg) from passage 2 (day 9) and viabilities of 60–69% observed until the end of the culture. Phenotypic characterization of the selected mixed populations (NoP-Arg) over a 7-day culture period revealed almost identical VCD and viability profiles as parental cells in SFM-F12 medium with putrescine (Fig. S2). After having demonstrated the ability to select CHO-K1 cells transfected with an arginase expressing vector in media lacking putrescine, the next step was to determine whether the system could be applied to the selection of cells expressing a gene of interest. To achieve this aim, GFP was selected for initial tests because of the ease traceability during the transfection process. A bicistronic vector expressing GFP and arginase linked by an IRES and under the control of a CMV promoter was designed for the purposes of this experiment (Fig. S3). In SFM-F12 medium, healthy mixed populations were successfully obtained by passage 8, recovering VCD and viability profiles similar to the parental control cells (Fig. 3, a and b). GFP expression was first detected at passage 7, with 14.5% GFP-expressing cells observed in mixed population 1, 2.9% in mixed population 2, and 8.1% in mixed population 3. Interestingly, the GFP-expressing population was observed to increase over each passage, reaching an average of 27.2% cells by the end of the experiment (P12) (Fig. 3c). In contrast and as expected from previous results, the VCD and viability of the untransfected cultures in SFM-F12 medium without putrescine (NoP-Neg) dropped by passage 2, displaying an average VCD of 0.3–0.6 × 106cells/ml and viabilities between 57 and 64% until the end of the culture (NoP-Neg). Variability in the viability of the three replicates for the negative control was observed by the end of the experiment (P11 and P12), where replicate 2 and 3 displayed viabilities of 44–49%, but 79% viable cells were detected in replicate 1. Interestingly, selection performed in parallel in putrescine-depleted SFM-F10 medium displayed similar profiles to those performed in SFM-F12, with recovery of mixed populations observed at P8 (Fig. S4, a and b). In this case, a higher percentage of GFP-expressing populations were recovered (reaching on average up to 70% by P9), which may be related to the increased stringency of this medium (Fig. S4c). It is noteworthy that mixed population 2 was observed to unstably express GFP from P6 to P10, displaying a dramatic drop in the percentage of GFP-expressing cells by P11, finally resulting in cellular death (P12). Hence, the large error bars displayed at P10 and P11. Although SFM-F10 medium was observed to outperform SFM-F12 selective medium in terms of percentage of GFP-expressing populations obtained, differences in the composition of both media resulted in maximal viabilities of 80–85% in control parental cells cultured in SFM-F10 medium (P-T, P-Neg) (Fig. S4b), whereas viabilities over 90% were consistently observed in SFM-F12 medium. For this reason, further testing was performed only on SFM-F12 medium. To assess the stability of the GFP-expressing populations generated, seven clones were isolated and placed in SFM-F12 medium lacking putrescine to monitor their growth (VCD), viability, and GFP expression in terms of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and at a mRNA level (relative quantification, RQ) for a total of 42 generations (14 passages). Consistent growth and healthy viabilities were displayed over the 42 generations (Fig. 4, a and b). Clones 7 and 16 were observed as low producers, whereas clone 12 displayed remarkably increased MFI levels. Nevertheless, GFP expression was detected throughout the 42 generations, with an increase in MFI levels relative to passage 1 observed in all clones except clone 11 (Fig. 4c). Stable expression was also confirmed at a transcriptional level (Fig. 5). Because of the design of the expression vector, almost identical GFP and arginase RQ profiles were observed. Interestingly, from passage 4 (12 generations), an increase in the RQ of both GFP and arginase were observed with all clones except clone 11. This effect might be related to the transference of clones from putrescine-containing medium (during single-cell cloning) to SFM-F12 medium depleted of putrescine, i.e. increased stringency of selection.Figure 5Long-term stable GFP and arginase mRNA expression of isolated GFP-expressing clones in selective medium.

The Gapdh endogenous gene was used to standardize the results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm whether the selection system designed would support the generation and preferential survival of clones expressing pharmaceutically relevant therapeutics, a bicistronic vector expressing human erythropoietin (hEPO) was designed and transfected into CHO-K1 cells; cultures were then plated in selective medium (putrescine-free). Successful mixed populations were selected by passage 9, as observed for the detection of hEPO (0.26 mg/liter) and the recovery of VCD and healthy viabilities (Fig. 6). Clones were isolated and seven of them were randomly selected to assess stability in selective medium for a total of 42 generations (14 passages). Stable titer expression was confirmed over the 42 generations (Fig. 7c). Assessment of hEPO and arginase mRNA expression relative to passage 2 was performed on three phenotypically divergent clones: clone 4 (low producer but fast growing), clone 10 (high producer but moderate growth), and clone 18 (medium producer with moderate growth). Both clones 10 and 18 were found to be stable, displaying levels of expression similar to those in passage 2 for at least 36 generations (P12) (Fig. 8). In contrast, the low producer clone 4 displayed a 20% decrease on hEPO mRNA expression at 18 generations (P6), dropping to less than 50% relative to the expression at passage 2 by passage 8. Nonetheless, both hEPO and arginase expression were detected over the 42 generations (P14) (Fig. 7).Figure 7Long-term growth and stable expression of isolated hEPO-expressing clones in selective medium. a–c, VCD (a), viability (b), and hEPO titer (mg/liter, c) of seven hEPO-expressing clones isolated by limited dilution growing in selective medium (SFM-F12 without putrescine) for 14 passages (42 generations).

CHO-K1 (K1) parental cells were also assessed as control. The Gapdh endogenous gene was used to standardize the results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the application of this selection system may be limited to CHO-K1 cells, several mammalian cell lines (HEK293, SP2, BHK21, Vero, BxPC-3, Capan-2, MiaPaca-2, and PANC-1), including three CHO cell lines, CHO-DP12, CHO-S, and DUXB11, were assessed for arginase activity (Fig. 9). Neither BHK21 nor any of the CHO cell lines tested displayed arginase activity, indicating that the system may be applicable to several parental CHO cell lines. Conversely, the HEK293, Vero lines and the pancreatic BxPC-3 and MiaPaca-2 cell lines displayed arginase activity levels similar to the pcDNA3.1-Arg transfected CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2c), making these parental cell lines unsuitable for the system. Finally, low levels of activity were observed in SP2, Capan-2, and PANC-1. Whether this activity is low enough to allow application of the arginase-based selection system requires further investigation. Because of the vital role played by polyamines in the culture of CHO cell lines in serum-free media (19Hölttä E. Pohjanpelto P. Polyamine dependence of Chinese hamster ovary cells in serum-free culture is due to deficient arginase activity.Biochim. Biophys.

To address whether clones generated following our polyamine-starvation method would maintain expression in nonselective conditions, clone 4, 10, and 18 were adapted to SFM-F12 medium containing putrescine as well as two commercially available formulations of undisclosed composition: a serum-free medium, CHO-S SFM-II (Gibco), and a chemically defined medium, BalanCD Growth A (Irvine). Clones cultured in SFM-F12 and BalanCD media displayed constant VCD and viability profiles (Fig. 10). In contrast, SFM-II medium was less supportive of healthy cultures, resulting in a decrease in growth from passage 2 (six generations) in two of the clones, reaching consistent VCDs by passage 6 (2.3 × 106cells/ml, clone 4) and passage 5 (1.5 × 106cells/ml clone 10). Moreover, in this medium, the viability of clone 10 dropped to 70% by passage 6 and to 60% in clone 18 by passage 7. Stable hEPO expression was observed in BalanCD and SFM-F12 media for clone 10 (up to P9, 27 generations), whereas decreased (23–30% lower) hEPO titers were displayed by passage 8 in clone 18 and clone 4 (40–30% lower) by passage 9 (Fig. 10). In SFM-II medium, both clone 10 and 18 performed similarly to the other two media. However, clone 4 was less stable, with hEPO titer dropping by 60% at passage 6 but maintaining this level until the end of the culture. To further characterize the capabilities of the system, all three clones were each cultured in both commercial media and SFM-F12 with putrescine for a total of 7 days to allow for high hEPO and, consequently, arginase expression. Healthy growth and hEPO expression was supported at different levels in all media tested, indicating that an i"

Water shortage, resulting from either drought or salinity, leads to slow growth and loss of wheat yield. In order to predict new genes responsive to the drought and salt stresses in wheat, 6,717 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), expressed in drought and salinity stress conditions were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The downloaded ESTs were clustered and assembled into 354 contigs; 14 transcription factor families in 29 contigs were identified. In addition, 119 contigs were organized in five enzyme classes. Biological functions were obtained for only 324 of the 354 contigs using gene ontology. In addition, using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, 191 metabolic pathways were identified. The remaining contigs were used for further analysis and the search for new genes responsive to drought and salt stresses. These contigs were mapped on the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium RefSeq v1.0 assembly, the most complete version of the reference sequence of the bread wheat variety Chinese Spring. They were found to have from one to three locations on the subgenomes A, B, and D. Full-length gene sequences were designed for these contigs, which were further validated using promoter analysis. These predicted genes may have applications in molecular breeding programs and wheat drought and salinity research."
https://openalex.org/W2986385529,"The impact of individual differences on performance monitoring and psychopathology is a question of active debate. Personality traits associated with psychopathology may be related to poor internal performance monitoring (as measured by the error-related negativity [ERN]) but intact external performance monitoring (as measured by the reward positivity [RewP]), suggesting that there are underlying neural differences between internal and external performance monitoring processes. We tested the relationships between individual difference measures of perfectionism, locus of control, and ERN, error-positivity (Pe), and RewP component difference amplitude in a healthy undergraduate sample. A total of 128 participants (69 female, M(SD)age = 20.6(2.0) years) completed two tasks: a modified version of the Eriksen Flanker and a doors gambling task along with the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism scale, the Rotter Locus of Control scale, and the Levenson Multidimensional Locus of Control scale to quantify perfectionism and locus of control traits, respectively. Linear regressions adjusting for age and gender showed that neither ΔERN nor ΔRewP amplitude were significantly moderated by perfectionism or locus of control scores. Findings suggest that, in psychiatrically-healthy individuals, there is not a strong link between perfectionism, locus of control, and ERN or RewP amplitude. Future research on individual difference measures in people with psychopathology may provide further insight into how these personality traits affect performance monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2989156064,"African horse sickness (AHS) is a disease of equids that results in a non-tariff barrier to the trade of live equids from affected countries. AHS is endemic in South Africa except for a controlled area in the Western Cape Province (WCP) where sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the past 2 decades. There is potential that the presence of zebra populations, thought to be the natural reservoir hosts for AHS, in the WCP could maintain AHS virus circulation in the area and act as a year-round source of infection for horses. However, it remains unclear whether the epidemiology or the ecological conditions present in the WCP would enable persistent circulation of AHS in the local zebra populations. Here we developed a hybrid deterministic-stochastic vector-host compartmental model of AHS transmission in plains zebra (Equus quagga), where host populations are age- and sex-structured and for which population and AHS transmission dynamics are modulated by rainfall and temperature conditions. Using this model, we showed that populations of plains zebra present in the WCP are not sufficiently large for AHS introduction events to become endemic and that coastal populations of zebra need to be >2500 individuals for AHS to persist >2 years, even if zebras are infectious for more than 50 days. AHS cannot become endemic in the coastal population of the WCP unless the zebra population involves at least 50,000 individuals. Finally, inland populations of plains zebra in the WCP may represent a risk for AHS to persist but would require populations of at least 500 zebras or show unrealistic duration of infectiousness for AHS introduction events to become endemic. Our results provide evidence that the risk of AHS persistence from a single introduction event in a given plains zebra population in the WCP is extremely low and it is unlikely to represent a long-term source of infection for local horses."
https://openalex.org/W2984721322,"Insights into the morphology of nanoclusters would facilitate the design of nano-devices with improved optical, electrical, and magnetic responses. We have utilized optical gradient forces for the directed self-assembly of colloidal clusters using high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses to delineate their structure and dynamics. We have ratified our experiments with theoretical models derived from the Langevin equation and defined the valid ranges of applicability. Our femtosecond optical tweezer-based technique characterizes the in-situ formation of hierarchical self-assembled clusters of homomers as well as heteromers by analyzing the back focal plane displacement signal. This technique is able to efficiently distinguish between nano-particles in heterogeneous clusters and is in accordance with our theory. Herein, we report results from our technique, and also develop a model to describe the mechanism of such processes where corner frequency changes. We show how the corner frequency changes enables us to recognize the structure and dynamics of the coagulation of colloidal homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters in condensed media over a broad range of nanoparticle sizes. The methods described here are advantageous, as the backscatter position-sensitive detection probes the in-situ self-assembly process while other light scattering approaches are leveraged for the characterization of isolated clusters."

Persons injured 17-28 years ago, treated with either physiotherapy (ACLPT, n = 23) or reconstruction and physiotherapy (ACLR, n = 28) and asymptomatic controls (CTRL, n = 22) performed a drop jump test, while kinematics were registered by motion capture. We analysed the Preparation phase (from maximal knee extension during flight until 50 ms post-touchdown) followed by an Action phase (until maximal knee flexion post-touchdown). Range of knee motion (RoM), and the length of each phase (Duration) were computed. The finite knee helical axis was analysed for momentary intervals of ~15° of knee motion by its intersection (ΔAP position) and inclination (ΔAP Inclination) with the knee's Anterior-Posterior (AP) axis. Static knee laxity (KT100) and self-reported knee function (Lysholm score) were also assessed. The results showed that both phases were shorter for the ACL groups compared to controls (CTRL-ACLR: Duration 35±8 ms, p = 0.000, CTRL-ACLPT: 33±9 ms, p = 0.000) and involved less knee flexion (CTRL-ACLR: RoM 6.6±1.9°, p = 0.002, CTRL-ACLR: 7.5 ±2.0°, p = 0.001). Low RoM and Duration correlated significantly with worse knee function according to Lysholm and higher knee laxity according to KT-1000. Three finite helical axes were analysed. The ΔAP position for the first axis was most anterior in ACLPT compared to ACLR (ΔAP position -1, ACLPT-ACLR: 13±3 mm, p = 0.004), with correlations to KT-1000 (rho 0.316, p = 0.008), while the ΔAP inclination for the third axis was smaller in the ACLPT group compared to controls (ΔAP inclination -3 ACLPT-CTRL: -13±5°, p = 0.004) and showed a significant side difference in ACL injured groups during Action (Injured-Non-injured: 8±2.7°, p = 0.006). Small ΔAP inclination -3 correlated with low Lysholm (rho 0.391, p = 0.002) and high KT-1000 (rho -0.450, p = 0.001). Conclusions Compensatory movement strategies seem to be used to protect the injured knee during landing. A decreased ΔAP inclination in injured knees during Action suggests that the dynamic knee control may remain compromised even long after injury."
https://openalex.org/W2984269548,"Whether evolutionary history is mostly contingent or deterministic has been given much focus in the field of evolutionary biology. Studies addressing this issue have been conducted theoretically, based on models, and experimentally, based on microcosms. It has been argued that the shape of the adaptive landscape and mutation rate are major determinants of replicated phenotypic evolution. In the present study, to incorporate the effects of phenotypic plasticity, we constructed a model using tree-like organisms. In this model, the basic rules used to develop trees are genetically determined, but tree shape (described by the number and aspect ratio of the branches) is determined by both genetic components and plasticity. The results of the simulation show that the tree shapes become more deterministic under higher mutation rates. However, the tree shape became most contingent and diverse at the lower mutation rate. In this situation, the variances of the genetically determinant characters were low, but the variance of the tree shape is rather high, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity results in this contingency and diversity of tree shape. The present findings suggest that plasticity cannot be ignored as a factor that increases contingency and diversity of evolutionary outcomes."
