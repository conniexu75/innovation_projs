https://openalex.org/W2008261126,"IL-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) cleaves pro-IL-1 beta to generate mature IL-1 beta. ICE is homologous to other proteins that have been implicated in apoptosis, including CED-3 and Nedd-2/lch-1. We generated ICE-deficient mice and observed that they are overtly normal but have a major defect in the production of mature IL-1 beta after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. IL-1 alpha production is also impaired. ICE-deficient mice are resistant to endotoxic shock. Thymocytes and macrophages from the ICE-deficient animals undergo apoptosis normally. ICE therefore plays a dominant role in the generation of mature IL-1 beta, a previously unsuspected role in production of IL-1 alpha, but has no autonomous function in apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2052651806,"Skeletal muscle differentiation entails the coordination of muscle-specific gene expression and terminal withdrawal from the cell cycle. This cell cycle arrest in the G0 phase requires the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). The function of Rb is negatively regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), which are controlled by Cdk inhibitors. Expression of MyoD, a skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional regulator, activated the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p21 during differentiation of murine myocytes and in nonmyogenic cells. MyoD-mediated induction of p21 did not require the tumor suppressor protein p53 and correlated with cell cycle withdrawal. Thus, MyoD may induce terminal cell cycle arrest during skeletal muscle differentiation by increasing the expression of p21."
https://openalex.org/W2017091696,"Terminal differentiation is coupled to withdrawal from the cell cycle. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p21Cip1 is transcriptionally regulated by p53 and can induce growth arrest. CKIs are therefore potential mediators of developmental control of cell proliferation. The expression pattern of mouse p21 correlated with terminal differentiation of multiple cell lineages including skeletal muscle, cartilage, skin, and nasal epithelium in a p53-independent manner. Although the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD is sufficient to activate p21 expression in 10T1/2 cells, p21 was expressed in myogenic cells of mice lacking the genes encoding MyoD and myogenin, demonstrating that p21 expression does not require these transcription factors. The p21 protein may function during development as an inducible growth inhibitor that contributes to cell cycle exit and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2133074755,"The cytoplasmic C-terminus of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is essential for B lymphocyte growth transformation and is now shown to interact with a novel human protein (LMP1-associated protein 1 [LAP1]). LAP1 is homologous to a murine protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), implicated in growth signaling from the p80 TNFR. A second novel protein (EBI6), induced by EBV infection, is the human homolog of a second murine TNFR-associated protein (TRAF1). LMP1 expression causes LAP1 and EBI6 to localize to LMP1 clusters in lymphoblast plasma membranes, and LMP1 coimmunoprecipitates with these proteins. LAP1 binds to the p80 TNFR, CD40, and the lymphotoxin-beta receptor, while EBI6 associates with the p80 TNFR. The interaction of LMP1 with these TNFR family-associated proteins is further evidence for their role in signaling and links LMP1-mediated transformation to signal transduction from the TNFR family."
https://openalex.org/W1995111407,"The silent mating loci and chromosomal regions adjacent to telomeres of S. cerevisiae have features similar to heterochromatin of more complex eukaryotes. Transcriptional repression at these sites depends on the silent information regulators SIR3 and SIR4 as well as histones H3 and H4. We show here that the SIR3 and SIR4 proteins interact with specific silencing domains of the H3 and H4 N-termini in vitro. Certain mutations in these factors, which affect their silencing functions in vivo, also disrupt their interactions in vitro. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies against RAP1 and SIR3 demonstrate that the H3 and H4 N-termini are required for the association of SIR3 with telomeric chromatin and the perinuclear positioning of yeast telomeres. Based on these interactions, we propose a model for heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing in yeast, which may serve as a paradigm for other eukaryotic organisms as well."
https://openalex.org/W2063960864,"Sympathetic neurons in culture die by apoptosis when deprived of nerve growth factor (NGF). We used this model of programmed cell death to study the mechanisms that mediate neuronal apoptosis. Cultured sympathetic neurons were injected with copper/zinc superoxide dismutase protein (SOD) or with an expression vector containing an SOD cDNA. In both cases apoptosis was delayed when the neurons were deprived of NGF. The delay was similar to that seen when a bcl-2 expression vector was injected. SOD, injected 8 hr after NGF deprivation, provided no protection, indicating that superoxide production may occur early in response to trophic factor deprivation. We have demonstrated, with a redox-sensitive dye, an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that peaked at 3 hr after sympathetic neurons were deprived of NGF. If NGF was added back to the culture medium after the period of peak ROS generation, apoptosis was completely prevented, suggesting that ROS production serves as an early signal, rather than a toxic agent, to mediate apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068842251,"We have developed a generalized approach, using two hybrid interactions, to isolate Ha-Ras effector loop mutations that separate the ability of Ha-Ras to interact with different downstream effectors. These mutations attenuate or eliminate Ha-ras(G12V) transformation of mammalian cells, but retain complementary activity, as demonstrated by synergistic induction of foci of growth-transformed cells, and by the ability to activate different downstream components. The transformation defect of Ha-ras(G12V, E37G) is rescued by a mutant, raf1, that restores interaction. These results indicate that multiple cellular components, including Raf1, are activated by Ha-Ras and contribute to Ha-Ras-induced mammalian cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2046351190,"Aging in S. cerevisiae is exemplified by the fixed number of cell divisions that mother cells undergo (termed their life span). We have exploited a correlation between life span and stress resistance to identify mutations in four genes that extend life span. One of these, SIR4, encodes a component of the silencing apparatus at HM loci and telomeres. The sir4-42 mutation extends life span by more than 30% and is semidominant. Our findings suggest that sir4-42 extends life span by preventing recruitment of the SIR proteins to HM loci and telomeres, thereby increasing their concentration at other chromosomal regions. Maintaining silencing at these other regions may be critical in preventing aging. Consistent with this view, expression of only the carboxyl terminus of SIR4 interferes with silencing at HM loci and telomeres, which also extends life span. Possible links among silencing, telomere maintenance, and aging in other organisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2028841673,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) deficiency causes severe hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in humans and in gene-targeted mice. Although the majority of apoE in plasma is of hepatic origin, apoE is synthesized by a variety of cell types, including macrophages. Because macrophages derive from hematopoietic cells, bone marrow transplantation was used to examine the potential of apoE synthesized by bone marrow-derived cells to correct the hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis caused by apoE deficiency. After transplantation of bone marrow from mice with the normal apoE gene into apoE-deficient mice, apoE was detected in serum and promoted clearance of lipoproteins and normalization of serum cholesterol levels. ApoE-deficient mice given transplants of normal bone marrow showed virtually complete protection from diet-induced atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2024529445,"Neurons exhibit a wide range of properties in addition to postsynaptic potential (PSP) summation and spike generation. Although other neuronal properties such as paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and slow PSPs are well characterized, their role in information processing remains unclear. It is possible that these properties contribute to temporal processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds, a range relevant to most complex sensory processing. A continuous-time neural network model based on integrate-and-fire elements that incorporate PPF and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was developed here. The time constants of the PPF and IPSPs were estimated from empirical data and were identical and constant for all elements in the circuit. When these elements were incorporated into a circuit inspired by neocortical connectivity, the network was able to discriminate different temporal patterns. Generalization emerged spontaneously. These results demonstrate that known time-dependent neuronal properties enable a network to transform temporal information into a spatial code in a self-organizing mannerâ€”that is, with no need to assume a spectrum of time delays or to custom-design the circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2123185585,"GAP-43 has been termed a ""growth"" or ""plasticity"" protein because it is expressed at high levels in neuronal growth cones during development and during axonal regeneration. By homologous recombination, we generated mice lacking GAP-43. The mice die in the early postnatal period. GAP-43-deficient retinal axons remain trapped in the chiasm for 6 days, unable to navigate past this midline decision point. Over the subsequent weeks of life, most GAP-43-deficient axons do enter the appropriate tracts, and the adult CNS is grossly normal. There is no evidence for interference with nerve growth rate, and cultured neurons extend neurites and growth cones in a fashion indistinguishable from controls. Thus, the GAP-43 protein is not essential for axonal outgrowth or growth cone formation per se, but is required at certain decision points, such as the optic chiasm. This is compatible with the hypothesis that GAP-43 serves to amplify pathfinding signals from the growth cone."
https://openalex.org/W2103695168,"Identifying mutations that cause specific osteochondrodysplasias will provide novel insights into the function of genes that are essential for skeletal morphogenesis. We report here that an autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome, characterized by mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, osteoarthritis, and sensorineural hearing loss, but no eye involvement, is caused by a splice donor site mutation resulting in ""in-frame"" exon skipping within the COL11A2 gene, encoding the alpha 2(XI) chain of the quantitatively minor fibrillar collagen XI. We also show that an autosomal recessive disorder with similar, but more severe, characteristics is linked to the COL11A2 locus and is caused by a glycine to arginine substitution in alpha 2(XI) collagen. The results suggest that mutations in collagen XI genes are associated with a spectrum of abnormalities in human skeletal development and support the conclusion of others, based on studies of murine chondrodysplasia, that collagen XI is essential for skeletal morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999131239,"Recent biochemical and genetic studies indicate that in addition to the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2, other B cell components are required for lymphoid-restricted, octamer site-mediated immunoglobulin gene promoter activity. Using a genetic screen in yeast, we have isolated B cell-derived cDNAs encoding Oct-binding factor 1 (OBF-1), a novel protein that specifically associates with Oct-1 and Oct-2. Biochemical studies demonstrate that OBF-1 has no intrinsic DNA-binding activity and recognizes the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2, but not those of Oct-4 and Oct-6. The OBF-1 mRNA is expressed in a highly cell-specific manner, being most abundant in B cells and essentially absent in most of the other cells or tissues tested. Furthermore, expression of OBF-1 in HeLa cells selectively stimulates the activity of a natural immunoglobulin promoter in an octamer site-dependent manner. Thus, OBF-1 has all the properties expected for a B cell-specific transcriptional coactivator protein."
https://openalex.org/W2061189653,"Uptake and release of Ca2+ from isolated liver nuclei were studied with fluorescent probes. We show with the help of digital imaging and confocal microscopy that the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe Fura 2 is concentrated in or around the nuclear envelope and that the distribution of Fura 2 fluorescence is similar to that of an endoplasmic reticulum marker. The previously demonstrated ATP-dependent uptake of Ca2+ into isolated nuclei and release of the accumulated Ca2+ by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) are therefore due to transport of Ca2+ into and out of the nuclear envelope and not the nucleoplasm. Dextrans labeled with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators (calcium-Green 1 and Fura 2) are distributed uniformly in the nucleoplasm and can be used to show that changes in the external Ca2+ concentration produce rapid changes in the nucleoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Nevertheless, IP3 and cyclic ADP-ribose evoke transient intranuclear Ca2+ elevations. The release from the Ca2+ stores in or around the nuclear envelope appears to be directed into the nucleoplasm from where it can diffuse out through the permeable nuclear pore complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2094434974,"Mice that are homozygous for the autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia (cho) mutation die at birth with abnormalities in cartilage of limbs, ribs, mandible, and trachea. Limb bones of newborn cho/cho mice are wider at the metaphyses than normal bones and only about half the normal length. By linkage analysis, the cho gene and the gene encoding the alpha 1 (XI) chain of cartilage collagen XI were mapped to the same region of chromosome 3. Deletion of a cytidine residue about 570 nt downstream of the translation initiation codon in cho alpha 1 (XI) mRNA causes a reading frame shift and introduces a premature stop codon. The data demonstrate that collagen XI is essential for normal formation of cartilage collagen fibrils and the cohesive properties of cartilage. The results also suggest that the normal differentiation and spatial organization of growth plate chondrocytes is critially dependent on the presence of type XI collagen in cartilage extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2073706728,"Morphological, biochemical, and membrane capacitance measurements were used to study the role of cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) in exocytosis. Fluorescence and electron microscopy of resting chromaffin cells revealed a cortical actin network that excluded secretory vesicles from the subplasmalemmal area. Phorbol ester (PMA) treatment disrupted cortical F-actin and increased both the number of vesicles within the 0-50 nm subplasmalemmal zone and the initial rate of stimulated catecholamine release. In PMA-pretreated cells, membrane capacitance studies showed an increased number of vesicles fusing with the plasmalemma during the first two depolarizations of a train. PMA did not affect voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx. The total number of vesicles fused with the plasma membrane correlated well with the number of vesicles occupying the 0-50 nm cortical zone. Therefore, cortical F-actin disassembly allows translocation of vesicles to the plasmalemma in preparation for exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2028517758,"SH-PTP2, the vertebrate homolog of Drosophila corkscrew, associates with several activated growth factor receptors, but its biological function is unknown. We assayed the effects of injection of wild-type and mutant SH-PTP2 RNAs on Xenopus embryogenesis. An internal phosphatase domain deletion (delta P) acts as a dominant negative mutant, causing severe posterior truncations. This phenotype is rescued by SH-PTP2, but not by the closely related SH-PTP1. In ectodermal explants, delta P blocks fibroblast growth factor (FGF)- and activin-mediated induction of mesoderm and FGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Our results indicate that SH-PTP2 is required for early vertebrate development, acting as a positive component in FGF signaling downstream of the FGF receptor and upstream of MAP kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2145714841,"The Drosophila hedgehog (hh) gene encodes a secreted protein involved in organizing growth and patterning in many developmental processes. Hh appears to act by inducing the localized expression of at least two other signaling molecules, decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg), which then govern cell proliferation and patterning in surrounding tissue. Here, we demonstrate that cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is essential during limb development to prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression. We also show that a constitutively active form of PKA can prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression, but does not interfere with their normal induction by hh. We propose that the basal activity of PKA imposes a block on the transcription of dpp and wg and that hh exerts its organizing influence by alleviating this block."
https://openalex.org/W2041970325,"Reduced protein kinase A (PKA) activity in anterior imaginal disc cells leads to cell-autonomous induction of decapentaplegic (dpp), wingless (wg), and patched (ptc) transcription that is independent of hedgehog (hh) gene activity. The resulting nonautonomous adult wing and leg pattern duplications are largely due to induced dpp and wg expression and resemble phenotypes elicited by ectopic hh expression. Inhibition of PKA in anterior cells close to the posterior compartment can substitute for hh activity to promote growth of imaginal discs, whereas overexpression of PKA can counteract transcriptional induction of ptc by hh in these cells. PKA therefore appears to be an integral component of the mechanism by which hh regulates the expression of key patterning molecules in imaginal discs."
https://openalex.org/W2077455094,"The HIV-1 matrix (MA) protein contains two subcellular localization signals with opposing effects. A myristoylated N-terminus governs particle assembly at the plasma membrane, and a nucleophilic motif facilitates import of the viral preintegration complex into the nucleus of nondividing cells. Here, we show that myristoylation acts as the MA dominant targeting signal in HIV-1 producer cells. During virus assembly, a subset of MA is phosphorylated on the C-terminal tyrosine by a virion-associated cellular protein kinase. Tyrosine-phosphorylated MA is then preferentially transported to the nucleus of target cells. An MA tyrosine mutant virus grows normally in dividing cells, but is blocked for nuclear import in terminally differentiated macrophages. MA tyrosine phosphorylation thus reveals the karyophilic properties of this protein within the HIV-1 preintegration complex, thereby playing a critical role for infection of nondividing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993116214,"Recognition by natural killer (NK) cells of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on target cells inhibits NK-mediated lysis. Here, inhibition of NK clones by HLA-B*2705 molecules mutated at single amino acids in the peptide binding site varied among HLA-B*2705-specific NK clones. In addition, a subset of such NK clones was inhibited by only one of several self peptides loaded onto HLA-B*2705 molecules expressed in peptide transporter-deficient cells, showing that recognition was peptide-specific. These data demonstrate that specific self peptides, complexed with MHC class I, provide protection from NK-mediated lysis."
https://openalex.org/W2036463521,"Analysis of interspecies matings between S. typhimurium and E. coli indicates that the genetic barrier that separates these (and perhaps many other) related species is primarily recombinational. The structural component of this barrier is genomic sequence divergence. The mismatch repair enzymes act as potent inhibitors of interspecies recombination, whereas the SOS system acts as an inducible positive regulator. Interspecies mating triggers a RecBC-dependent SOS response in female bacteria that increases recombination mainly through overproduction of the RecA protein. Mismatch repair acts to reduce the mutation rate and recombination between similar sequences, whereas SOS acts to increase both. These opposing activities allow mismatch repair and SOS systems to determine both the rate of accumulation of sequence divergence and the extent of genetic isolation, which are the key components of the speciation process."
https://openalex.org/W2053303814,"We investigated the transmembrane topology of the GluR3 subunit that was translated in rabbit reticulocytes supplemented with microsomal membranes. A prolactin reporter epitope was fused to GluR3 at six locations, bracketing each of the proposed transmembrane domains. The sidedness of the epitope in the microsomal membrane was then assessed by proteinase K sensitivity. The N terminus and the entire region between M3 and M4 was extracellular, and the C terminus was intracellular by this method. Four native N-linked glycosylation sites in the amino terminus and one introduced site between M3 and M4 were utilized, confirming the extracellular location of these regions. Epitopes inserted upstream and downstream of M2 were protease sensitive and thus intracellular. Our results support a topological model for glutamate receptor subunits that consists of three transmembrane domains, M1, M3, and M4, and another domain, the proposed channel-lining M2, which forms a reentrant membrane segment with both ends facing the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1995139743,"The Drosophila period protein (PER) is a predominantly nuclear protein and a likely component of a circadian clock. PER is required for daily oscillations in the transcription of its own gene and thus participates in a circadian feedback loop. In this study, key pacemaker neurons of the Drosophila brain were examined to determine whether the subcellular distribution of PER changes with the time of day. Indeed, PER was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm for several hours before entering the nucleus during a narrow time window. Three long-period mutations (perL) cause a delay in the timing of nuclear translocation and a further delay at elevated temperature. The data indicate that regulation of PER nuclear entry is critical for circadian oscillations by providing a necessary temporal delay between PER synthesis and its effect on transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2070107376,"Localized expression of decapentaplegic (dpp) is required for proper development of the Drosophila imaginal discs. Using genetic mosaics, we show that in the anterior compartment of appendage discs and anterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc, cells that lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity ectopically express dpp. Pka- cells can influence the fate of neighboring cells to reorganize anterior patterns in appendages and trigger ectopic morphogenetic furrows in the developing retina. This organizing activity of Pka mutant cells depends on dpp activity. Our findings suggest that PKA is a component of a signaling pathway that represses dpp expression and that hh antagonizes this pathway to maintain dpp expression at the anterior-posterior compartment border and in the morphogenetic furrow."
https://openalex.org/W2041428293,"The amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease contain, in addition to the beta protein (A beta), lesser amounts of other proteins including the protease inhibitor alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT). We have recently shown that ACT acts as a pathological chaperone, binding to the beta protein and strongly promoting its polymerization into amyloid filaments in vitro. The data of this paper show that ACT synthesis is induced in cultured human astrocytes by IL-1, a lymphokine whose expression is strongly up-regulated in microglial cells in affected areas of Alzheimer's disease brain. Furthermore, unfractionated glial cultures containing both astrocytes and microglia from human cortex (which develops amyloid in Alzheimer's disease) spontaneously express IL-1 and ACT as they reach confluence. In contrast, confluent mixed glial cultures similarly prepared from human cerebellum or brain stem, or from rat brain-tissues not prone to amyloid formation-do not express ACT unless supplemented with exogenous IL-1. The same regional difference in IL-1 expression by microglia is seen in vivo in Alzheimer's disease. These results indicate that the IL-1-induced expression of ACT may help direct the region-specific production of mature amyloid filaments in the Alzheimer brain."
https://openalex.org/W2038036955,"Bradykinin (BK) is a peptide mediator released in inflammation that potently excites sympathetic neurons. We have studied the mechanism of this excitation in dissociated rat sympathetic neurons and found that at low nanomolar (EC50 = 0.9 nM) concentrations, BK inhibited the M-type K+ current IK(M). Studies with the selective antagonist Hoe140 revealed that this effect was mediated via the B2 receptor subtype, and mRNA encoding this receptor was identified in these neurons by RT-PCR. IK(M) inhibition was unaffected by Pertussis toxin or microinjection of antibodies to G alpha o but was selectively inhibited by microinjection of antibodies to G alpha q/11. Thus, BK is the most potent M current inhibitor yet described in mammalian neurons, and BK inhibition of M current is mediated by a G protein pathway similar to that activated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2039162112,"Structural specialization of the postsynaptic skeletal muscle membrane is in part mediated by the motor neuron-induced transcriptional regulation of synaptic muscle nuclei. ARIA, a factor that stimulates production of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), is a candidate signaling molecule for such regulation. Here we examine the transynaptic inducing potential of this polypeptide factor. ARIA immunoreactivity is detectable at synaptic sites in vivo. In vitro, recombinant heregulin beta 1 (rHRG beta 1), the human homolog of ARIA, induces expression of the AChR epsilon gene, the subunit most sensitive to synaptic input. The inducing property of rHRG beta 1 is demonstrated most dramatically in primary muscle cultures from transgenic mice bearing an epsilon promoter-nuclear lacZ reporter transgene. Transient transfection experiments using the Sol 8 muscle cell line indicate that sequences that confer responsiveness to ARIA are located within a 150 bp epsilon subunit promoter region and are E box-independent. These results suggest that ARIA performs a vital role by directing spatially restricted gene expression at the neuromuscular junction."
https://openalex.org/W2091932525,"The phyllopod (phyl) gene regulates the fates of a subset of cells in the developing Drosophila eye; in the absence of phyl function, the R1, R6, and R7 photoreceptors are transformed into additional cone cells, whereas ectopic phyl expression in the cone cell precursors transforms these cells into additional R7 cells. Within this group of cells, phyl expression thus mimics activation of the Raf pathway in its ability to induce photoreceptor rather than cone cell development. Furthermore, the transformation of cone cells into R7 cells in response to Raf activation is both accompanied by and dependent upon ectopic phyl expression. phyl thus represents a possible target gene of the Raf pathway during eye development, controlling the fates of a novel subset of photoreceptors."

https://openalex.org/W2067843068,Molecular biological studies of the mammalian inner ear have been limited by the relatively small size of the sensory endorgans contained within. The saccular otolithic organ in teleostian fish is structurally similar to its mammalian counterpart but can contain an order of magnitude more sensory cells. The prospect of the evolutionary conservation of proteins utilized in the vertebrate inner ear and the relative abundance of teleostian saccular sensory tissue made this an attractive system for molecular biological studies. A complementary DNA obtained by differential screening of a saccular complementary DNA library was identified that encodes an inner ear-specific collagen molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2003598888,"Expression of the structurally and functionally distinct min K channel in Xenopus oocytes results in voltage-dependent potassium currents that activate with a characteristic slow time course. Application of a membrane-impermeable chemical cross-linking agent to oocytes expressing min K decreased the time-dependent current, increased its rate of activation, and induced persistently activated inward and outward potassium currents. These effects required membrane depolarization, demonstrating use dependence. Persistently activated channels retained potassium selectivity and sensitivity to block by clofilium and barium. These results suggest that a major conformational change occurs during min K channel gating, which can be stabilized by chemical cross-linking, and are consistent with a model in which min K channels activate by voltage-dependent subunit aggregation."
