https://openalex.org/W2943109925,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is capable of inducing a storm of proinflammatory cytokines. In this study, we show that the SARS-CoV open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) accessory protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)-mediated ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC). SARS-CoV and its ORF3a protein were found to be potent activators of pro-IL-1β gene transcription and protein maturation, the 2 signals required for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ORF3a induced pro-IL-1β transcription through activation of NF-κB, which was mediated by TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination and processing of p105. ORF3a-induced elevation of IL-1β secretion was independent of its ion channel activity or absent in melanoma 2 but required NLRP3, ASC, and TRAF3. ORF3a interacted with TRAF3 and ASC, colocalized with them in discrete punctate structures in the cytoplasm, and facilitated ASC speck formation. TRAF3-dependent K63-linked ubiquitination of ASC was more pronounced in SARS-CoV-infected cells or when ORF3a was expressed. Taken together, our findings reveal a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV ORF3a protein activates NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination of p105 and ASC.-Siu, K.-L., Yuen, K.-S., Castaño-Rodriguez, C., Ye, Z.-W., Yeung, M.-L., Fung, S.-Y., Yuan, S., Chan, C.-P., Yuen, K.-Y., Enjuanes, L., Jin, D.-Y. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination of ASC."
https://openalex.org/W2949512190,"Non-recurrent deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are currently the best at modeling core object recognition, a behavior that is supported by the densely recurrent primate ventral stream, culminating in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. If recurrence is critical to this behavior, then primates should outperform feedforward-only deep CNNs for images that require additional recurrent processing beyond the feedforward IT response. Here we first used behavioral methods to discover hundreds of these ‘challenge’ images. Second, using large-scale electrophysiology, we observed that behaviorally sufficient object identity solutions emerged ~30 ms later in the IT cortex for challenge images compared with primate performance-matched ‘control’ images. Third, these behaviorally critical late-phase IT response patterns were poorly predicted by feedforward deep CNN activations. Notably, very-deep CNNs and shallower recurrent CNNs better predicted these late IT responses, suggesting that there is a functional equivalence between additional nonlinear transformations and recurrence. Beyond arguing that recurrent circuits are critical for rapid object identification, our results provide strong constraints for future recurrent model development. Using model- and primate behavior-driven image selection with large-scale electrophysiology in monkeys performing core recognition tasks, Kar et al. provide evidence that automatically engaged recurrent circuits are critical for rapid object identification."

We identified 122 candidate regions with 204 genes under selection during chickpea breeding. Our data suggest the Eastern Mediterranean as the primary center of origin and migration route of chickpea from the Mediterranean/Fertile Crescent to Central Asia, and probably in parallel from Central Asia to East Africa (Ethiopia) and South Asia (India). Genome-wide association studies identified 262 markers and several candidate genes for 13 traits. Our study establishes a foundation for large-scale characterization of germplasm and population genomics, and a resource for trait dissection, accelerating genetic gains in future chickpea breeding. The authors performed whole-genome resequencing of 429 chickpea lines sampled from 45 countries. They identified 122 candidate regions (204 genes) under selection during chickpea breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2940591955,"Modulating T cell homeostatic mechanisms with checkpoint blockade can efficiently promote endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses1-11. However, many patients still do not benefit from checkpoint blockade12, highlighting the need for targeting of alternative immune pathways13. Glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR) is an attractive target for immunotherapy, owing to its capacity to promote effector T cell (Teff) functions14,15 and hamper regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression16-20. On the basis of the potent preclinical anti-tumor activity of agonist anti-GITR antibodies, reported by us and others16,21,22, we initiated the first in-human phase 1 trial of GITR agonism with the anti-GITR antibody TRX518 ( NCT01239134 ). Here, we report the safety profile and immune effects of TRX518 monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer and provide mechanistic preclinical evidence to rationally combine GITR agonism with checkpoint blockade in future clinical trials. We demonstrate that TRX518 reduces circulating and intratumoral Treg cells to similar extents, providing an easily assessable biomarker of anti-GITR activity. Despite Treg reductions and increased Teff:Treg ratios, substantial clinical responses were not seen. Similarly, in mice with advanced tumors, GITR agonism was not sufficient to activate cytolytic T cells due to persistent exhaustion. We demonstrate that T cell reinvigoration with PD-1 blockade can overcome resistance of advanced tumors to anti-GITR monotherapy. These findings led us to start investigating TRX518 with PD-1 pathway blockade in patients with advanced refractory tumors ( NCT02628574 )."
https://openalex.org/W2942648114,"There is increasing evidence for a cerebellar contribution to cognitive processing, but the specific input pathways conveying this information remain unclear. We probed the role of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells in generating and evaluating predictions about associations between motor actions, sensory stimuli and reward. We trained mice to perform a visuomotor integration task to receive a reward and interleaved cued and random rewards between task trials. Using two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels probe recordings of Purkinje cell activity, we show that climbing fibers signal reward expectation, delivery and omission. These signals map onto cerebellar microzones, with reward delivery activating some microzones and suppressing others, and with reward omission activating both reward-activated and reward-suppressed microzones. Moreover, responses to predictable rewards are progressively suppressed during learning. Our findings elucidate a specific input pathway for cerebellar contributions to reward signaling and provide a mechanistic link between cerebellar activity and the creation and evaluation of predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2943426208,"Acute kidney injury is a common complication of rhabdomyolysis. A better understanding of this syndrome may be useful to identify novel therapeutic targets because there is no specific treatment so far. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated nonapoptotic cell death that is involved in renal injury. In this study, we investigated whether ferroptosis is associated with rhabdomyolysis-mediated renal damage, and we studied the therapeutic effect of curcumin, a powerful antioxidant with renoprotective properties. Induction of rhabdomyolysis in mice increased serum creatinine levels, endothelial damage, inflammatory chemokines, and cytokine expression, alteration of redox balance (increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defenses), and tubular cell death. Treatment with curcumin initiated before or after rhabdomyolysis induction ameliorated all these pathologic and molecular alterations. Although apoptosis or receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3-mediated necroptosis were activated in rhabdomyolysis, our results suggest a key role of ferroptosis. Thus, treatment with ferrostatin 1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, improved renal function in glycerol-injected mice, whereas no beneficial effects were observed with the pan-caspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone or in RIPK3-deficient mice. In cultured renal tubular cells, myoglobin (Mb) induced ferroptosis-sensitive cell death that was also inhibited by curcumin. Mechanistic in vitro studies showed that curcumin reduced Mb-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB axis and activating the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase 1. Our findings are the first to demonstrate the involvement of ferroptosis in rhabdomyolysis-associated renal damage and its sensitivity to curcumin treatment. Therefore, curcumin may be a potential therapeutic approach for patients with this syndrome.-Guerrero-Hue, M., García-Caballero, C., Palomino-Antolín, A., Rubio-Navarro, A., Vázquez-Carballo, C., Herencia, C., Martín-Sanchez, D., Farré-Alins, V., Egea, J., Cannata, P., Praga, M., Ortiz, A., Egido, J., Sanz, A.

https://openalex.org/W2943518292,"Memory is coded by patterns of neural activity in distinct circuits. Therefore, it should be possible to reverse engineer a memory by artificially creating these patterns of activity in the absence of a sensory experience. In olfactory conditioning, an odor conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US; for example, a footshock), and the resulting CS-US association guides future behavior. Here we replaced the odor CS with optogenetic stimulation of a specific olfactory glomerulus and the US with optogenetic stimulation of distinct inputs into the ventral tegmental area that mediate either aversion or reward. In doing so, we created a fully artificial memory in mice. Similarly to a natural memory, this artificial memory depended on CS-US contingency during training, and the conditioned response was specific to the CS and reflected the US valence. Moreover, both real and implanted memories engaged overlapping brain circuits and depended on basolateral amygdala activity for expression."
https://openalex.org/W3104059953,"Powerful relativistic jets are one of the main ways in which accreting black holes provide kinetic feedback to their surroundings. Jets launched from or redirected by the accretion flow that powers them are expected to be affected by the dynamics of the flow, which for accreting stellar-mass black holes has shown evidence for precession1 due to frame-dragging effects that occur when the black-hole spin axis is misaligned with the orbital plane of its companion star2. Recently, theoretical simulations have suggested that the jets can exert an additional torque on the accretion flow3, although the interplay between the dynamics of the accretion flow and the launching of the jets is not yet understood. Here we report a rapidly changing jet orientation-on a time scale of minutes to hours-in the black-hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni, detected with very-long-baseline interferometry during the peak of its 2015 outburst. We show that this changing jet orientation can be modelled as the Lense-Thirring precession of a vertically extended slim disk that arises from the super-Eddington accretion rate4. Our findings suggest that the dynamics of the precessing inner accretion disk could play a role in either directly launching or redirecting the jets within the inner few hundred gravitational radii. Similar dynamics should be expected in any strongly accreting black hole whose spin is misaligned with the inflowing gas, both affecting the observational characteristics of the jets and distributing the black-hole feedback more uniformly over the surrounding environment5,6."
https://openalex.org/W2941312336,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays important roles as a signaling lipid in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. S1P signals via a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (S1P1–5) and intracellular targets. Here, we report on photoswitchable analogs of S1P and its precursor sphingosine, respectively termed PhotoS1P and PhotoSph. PhotoS1P enables optical control of S1P1–3, shown through electrophysiology and Ca2+ mobilization assays. We evaluated PhotoS1P in vivo, where it reversibly controlled S1P3-dependent pain hypersensitivity in mice. The hypersensitivity induced by PhotoS1P is comparable to that induced by S1P. PhotoS1P is uniquely suited for the study of S1P biology in cultured cells and in vivo because it exhibits prolonged metabolic stability compared to the rapidly metabolized S1P. Using lipid mass spectrometry analysis, we constructed a metabolic map of PhotoS1P and PhotoSph. The formation of these photoswitchable lipids was found to be light dependent, providing a novel approach to optically probe sphingolipid biology. A photoswitchable analog of spingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) that allows for modulation of the action of this bioactive lipid exhibits prolonged metabolic stability compared to S1P, activates S1P receptors in cells and mediates nociception in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2941470233,"The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual decision-making and categorization, but whether its activity plays a causal role remains controversial. Here we examined the population dynamics of PPC activity during an auditory-guided decision task in mice. We found that silencing of PPC activity impaired several aspects of decision-making. First, categorization of new, but not well-learned, stimuli was impaired. Second, re-categorization of previously experienced stimuli based on newly learned categories was also impaired. Third, the bias on behavioral choices created by preceding trials significantly increased. In vivo two-photon imaging of PPC activity during stimulus categorization revealed differential dynamics in representations of new stimuli and learned categories, consistent with rapid incorporation of new sensory information during categorization. At the circuit level, inactivation of PPC axonal projections to the auditory cortex also significantly reduced categorization performance. Thus, PPC circuits play a causal role in decision-making during stimulus categorization."
https://openalex.org/W2943041747,"Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been reported as associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to investigate the characteristics of mucosa-associated E. coli and the clinical significance of AIEC in Korean IBD patients. E. coli strains were isolated from the mucosal tissues of 18 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients, 24 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 9 healthy controls (HC). Adhesion, invasion, and survival assays were performed to evaluate phenotypic features of E. coli isolates and to identify AIEC. The presence of virulence genes and cytokine expression were examined using PCR. In addition, data on IBD-related hospitalization were collected. A total of 59 E. coli strains were isolated (25 from CD, 27 from UC, and 7 from HC). The average levels of adhesion, invasion, and survival were higher in E. coli strains from IBD patients than those from HC (adhesion: 1.65 vs. 0.71, p = 0.046; invasion: 1.68 vs. 0.52, p = 0.039; survival: 519.55 vs. 47.55, p = 0.363). Prevalence of AIEC in HC, CD and UC patients was 22.2%, 38.9% and 37.5%, respectively. E. coli isolates from IBD patients had various virulence genes and were associated with increased expression of TNF-α and IL-17. IBD-related hospitalization within 3 years was 18.8% in patients with AIEC and 11.5% in patients without AIEC. E. coli strains from IBD patients showed high levels of adhesion, invasion, and survival. AIEC strains were identified in both CD and UC patients at a similar rate. AIEC may be associated with sustaining inflammation in the pre-existing inflammatory mucosa."
https://openalex.org/W2943631148,"Cell growth is controlled by a lysosomal signalling complex containing Rag small GTPases and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase. Here, we carried out a microscopy-based genome-wide human short interfering RNA screen and discovered a lysosome-localized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-like protein, GPR137B, that interacts with Rag GTPases, increases Rag localization and activity, and thereby regulates mTORC1 translocation and activity. High GPR137B expression can recruit and activate mTORC1 in the absence of amino acids. Furthermore, GPR137B also regulates the dissociation of activated Rag from lysosomes, suggesting that GPR137B controls a cycle of Rag activation and dissociation from lysosomes. GPR137B-knockout cells exhibited defective autophagy and an expanded lysosome compartment, similar to Rag-knockout cells. Like zebrafish RagA mutants, GPR137B-mutant zebrafish had upregulated TFEB target gene expression and an expanded lysosome compartment in microglia. Thus, GPR137B is a GPCR-like lysosomal regulatory protein that controls dynamic Rag and mTORC1 localization and activity as well as lysosome morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2951371721,"Introduction Disrespect and abuse of women during childbirth is one of the deterring factors to skilled childbirth utilization, especially in low and middle-income countries. Objective The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of women’s disrespect and abuse during childbirth in public health facilities in Arba Minch town, south Ethiopia. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed at all public health institutions in Arba Minch town, south Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling method was used to include 281 women who had given birth at public health institutions between January 01 and February 28, 2017. Data were collected through face to face interview by four data collectors and they were supervised by the principal investigator during the entire period of data collection. A semi-structured pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Epi info version 7.1.2.0 and SPSS version 24 were used to enter and analyze the data, respectively. Results The overall prevalence of non-respectful care was 98.9%. The women’s right to information and informed consent was the most frequently violated right with a prevalence of 92.5% (95% CI: 90.9, 94.1) followed by non-dignified care (36.7, 95% CI: 34.9, 38.5), physical abuse (29.5%, 95% CI: 24.2, 34.8), discrimination (18.1%, 95% CI: 13.6, 22.6), non-confidential care (17.1%, 95% CI: 12.7, 21.5) and abandonment of care (4.3%, 95% CI: 3.1, 5.5). Rural residence, giving birth in the hospital, having no or low educational status and giving birth by cesarean route were factors significantly associated with specific women’s rights violations. Conclusions and recommendations The prevalence of women’s disrespect and abuse during childbirth at the health care facilities in this study area is very high. Therefore, health managers need to work hard to tackle the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2952393966,"The human complement component, C5a, binds two different seven-transmembrane receptors termed C5aR1 and C5aR2. C5aR1 is a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor that couples to the Gαi subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins and β-arrestins (βarrs) following C5a stimulation. Peptide fragments derived from the C terminus of C5a can still interact with the receptor, albeit with lower affinity, and can act as agonists or antagonists. However, whether such fragments might display ligand bias at C5aR1 remains unexplored. Here, we compare C5a and a modified C-terminal fragment of C5a, C5apep, in terms of G-protein coupling, βarr recruitment, endocytosis, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation at the human C5aR1. We discover that C5apep acts as a full agonist for Gαi coupling as measured by cAMP response and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, but it displays partial agonism for βarr recruitment and receptor endocytosis. Interestingly, C5apep exhibits full-agonist efficacy with respect to inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-6 secretion in human macrophages, but its ability to induce human neutrophil migration is substantially lower compared with C5a, although both these responses are sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment. Taken together, our data reveal that compared with C5a, C5apep exerts partial efficacy for βarr recruitment, receptor trafficking, and neutrophil migration. Our findings therefore uncover functional bias at C5aR1 and also provide a framework that can potentially be extended to chemokine receptors, which also typically interact with chemokines through a biphasic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2943171367,"Several important Gram-negative bacterial pathogens possess surface capsular layers composed of hypervariable long-chain polysaccharides linked via a conserved 3-deoxy-β-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (β-Kdo) oligosaccharide to a phosphatidylglycerol residue. The pathway for synthesis of the terminal glycolipid was elucidated by determining the structures of reaction intermediates. In Escherichia coli, KpsS transfers a single Kdo residue to phosphatidylglycerol; this primer is extended using a single enzyme (KpsC), possessing two cytidine 5′-monophosphate (CMP)-Kdo-dependent glycosyltransferase catalytic centers with different linkage specificities. The structure of the N-terminal β-(2→4) Kdo transferase from KpsC reveals two α/β domains, supplemented by several helices. The N-terminal Rossmann-like domain, typically responsible for acceptor binding, is severely reduced in size compared with canonical GT-B folds in glycosyltransferases. The similar structure of the C-terminal β-(2→7) Kdo transferase indicates a past gene duplication event. Both Kdo transferases have a narrow active site tunnel, lined with key residues shared with GT99 β-Kdo transferases. This enzyme provides the prototype for the GT107 family. Reconstitution of β-Kdo-based capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and crystallographic analysis of KpsC, a glycosyltransferase with two active sites for β-Kdo-glycolipid primer extension, reveal a new glycosyltransferase structural family."
https://openalex.org/W2943667280,"Depression is increasingly recognized as an inflammatory disease, with inflammatory crosstalk in the brain contributing its pathogenesis. Life stresses may up-regulate inflammatory processes and promote depression. Although cytokines are central to stress-related immune responses, their contribution to stress-induced depression remains unclear. Here, we used unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) to induce depression-like behaviors in mice, as assessed through a suite of behavioral tests. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1)-related molecular networks responsible for depression-like behaviors were assessed through intrahippocampal microinjection of lenti-CXCL1, the antidepressant fluoxetine, the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) inhibitor SB265610, and the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) inhibitor AR-A014418. Modulation of apoptosis-related pathways and neuronal plasticity were assessed via quantification of cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression. CXCL1/CXCL2 expression was correlated with depression-like behaviors in response to chronic stress or antidepressant treatment in the UCMS depression model. Intrahippocampal microinjection of lenti-CXCL1 increased depression-like behaviors, activated GSK3β, increased apoptosis pathways, suppressed CREB activation, and decreased BDNF. Administration of the selective GSK3β inhibitor AR-A014418 abolished the effects of lenti-CXCL1, and the CXCR2 inhibitor SB265610 prevented chronic stress-induced depression-like behaviors, inhibited GSK3β activity, blocked apoptosis pathways, and restored BDNF expression. The CXCL1/CXCR2 axis appears to play a critical role in stress-induced depression, and CXCR2 is a potential novel therapeutic target for patients with depression.-Chai, H.-H., Fu, X.-C., Ma, L., Sun, H.-T., Chen, G.-Z., Song, M.-Y., Chen, W.-X., Chen, Y.-S., Tan, M.-X., Guo, Y.-W., Li, S.-P.

https://openalex.org/W2943744509,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects >30 million individuals worldwide. However, no genetic mutation from human patients with AF has been linked to inflammation. Here, we show that AF-associated human variant p.Ile138Thr in natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) encoding the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) causes inflammation, fibroblast activation, atrial fibrosis, and AF in knock-in (KI) rats. Variant p.Ile138Thr inhibits the interaction between ANP and its receptor natriuretic peptide receptor A and reduces intracellular cGMP levels. RNA sequencing and follow-up analyses showed that mutant ANP (mANP) activates multiple innate immunity pathways, including TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-1β signaling. mANP induces differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to myofibroblasts and promotes CF proliferation and fibrosis. These results suggest that NPPA variant p.Ile138Thr causes AF by activating TNF-α, NF-κB, and IL-1β signaling, inflammation, and fibrosis. Multiple computational programs suggest that p.Ile138Thr is damaging or deleterious. Based on the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Standards and Guidelines, p.Ile138Thr can be classified as a likely pathogenic variant. Variant p.Ile138Thr was found only in Asian people in the Genome Aggregation Database and Exome Aggregation Consortium database at an averaged frequency of 0.026%. An estimated 1.15 million Asian people carry the variant and might be at risk of AF. The KI rats may provide an inflammation-based, genetic animal model for AF valuable for testing anti-inflammation or other therapies for AF.-Cheng, C., Liu, H., Tan, C., Tong, D., Zhao, Y., Liu, X., Si, W., Wang, L., Liang, L., Li, J., Wang, C., Chen, Q., Du, Y., Wang, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2942675270,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health concern worldwide. Georgia is among the countries with a high burden of HCV infection. People who inject drugs (PWID) have the highest burden of infection in Georgia. In 2015, the Government of Georgia, with partners’ support, initiated one of the world’s first Hepatitis C Elimination Programs. Despite notable progress, challenges to achieving targets persist. This qualitative study is aimed to better understand some of the barriers and facilitators to HCV testing and treatment services for PWID to inform HCV treatment policies and practices. The study instrument examined social, structural, and individual factors influencing HCV testing and treatment practices. We started with key informant interviews to guide the study instrument development and compare the study findings against health care planners’ and health care providers’ views. Forty PWID with various HCV testing and treatment experiences were recruited through the snowball method. The study found that along with structural factors such as political commitment, co-financing of diagnostic and monitoring tests, and friendly clinic environments, knowledge about HCV infection and elimination program benefits, and support from family and peers also play facilitating roles in accessing testing and treatment services. On the other hand, inability to co-pay for diagnostic tests, fear of side effects associated with treatment, poor knowledge about HCV infection, and lack of social support hampered testing and treatment practices among PWID. Findings from this study are important for increasing the effectiveness of this unique program that targets a population at high risk of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2943221586,"Akt substrate of 160 kDa (also called AS160 or TBC1D4) is a Rab GTPase activating protein and key regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake which is expressed by multiple tissues, including skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue (WAT) and the heart. This study introduces a novel rat AS160-knockout (AS160-KO) model that was created using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We compared male AS160-KO versus wildtype (WT) rats for numerous metabolism-related endpoints. Body mass, body composition, energy expenditure and physical activity did not differ between genotypes. Oral glucose intolerance was detected in AS160-KO versus WT rats (P<0.005). A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HEC) revealed insulin resistance for glucose infusion rate (P<0.05) with unaltered hepatic glucose production in AS160-KO versus WT rats. Genotype-effects on glucose uptake during the HEC: 1) was significantly lower in epitrochlearis (P<0.01) and extensor digitorum longus (P<0.05) of AS160-KO versus WT rats, and tended to be lower for AS160-KO versus WT rats in the soleus (P<0.06) and gastrocnemius (P<0.08); 2) tended to be greater for AS160-KO versus WT rats in white adipose tissue (P = 0.09); and 3) was significantly greater in the heart (P<0.005) of AS160-KO versus WT rats. GLUT4 protein abundance was significantly lower for AS160-KO versus WT rats in each tissue analyzed (P<0.01–0.001) except the gastrocnemius. Ex vivo insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly lower (P<0.001) for AS160-KO versus WT rats in isolated epitrochlearis or soleus. Insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation (in vivo or ex vivo) did not differ between genotypes for any tissue tested. Ex vivo AICAR-stimulated glucose uptake by isolated epitrochlearis was significantly lower for AS160-KO versus WT rats (P<0.01) without genotype-induced alteration in AMP-activated protein phosphorylation. This unique AS160-KO rat model, which elucidated striking genotype-related modifications in glucoregulation, will enable future research aimed at understanding AS160’s roles in numerous physiological processes in response to various interventions (e.g., diet and/or exercise)."
https://openalex.org/W2943477488,"We have recently shown in rats that adolescent cocaine exposure induces prolonged modifications on synapses in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which might contribute to long-term behavioral outcomes in adulthood. In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying adolescent cocaine exposure-related psychiatric problems in adulthood, especially focusing on the alterations of GABAergic transmission in prelimbic cortex (PrL), 1 subregion of mPFC. Consistent with a previous study, adolescent cocaine-exposed mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in their adulthood. In the same mice models, depression-like behaviors increased as well, but the conditioned place preference formed normally. In parallel, activities of pyramidal neurons at layer V of PrL were reduced after adolescent cocaine exposure, accompanied by an increase in the percentage of symmetric synapses in PrL of adult mice. Additionally, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents rather than miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents were increased on these pyramidal neurons, and increased levels of GABA were found in adult PrL. The molecules in the GABAergic system in adult PrL were also changed by adolescent cocaine use, as indicated by increased glutamate decarboxylase 67kDa, GAB AA-αl, and decreased GABA transporter 1. In the same mice, some regulators to GABAergic transmission such as neuregulin l/ErbB4 signals were heightened as well. Collectively, these findings revealed that adolescent cocaine exposure results in permanent enhancement of GABAergic transmission on pyramidal neurons in PrL, which subsequently attenuate the activities of these neurons and ultimately contributes to the development of psychiatric disorders in later life.—Shi, P., Nie, J., Liu, H., Li, Y., Lu, X., Shen, X., Ge, F., Yuan, T.-F., Guan, X.

https://openalex.org/W2942730519,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of natural biopolyesters that resemble petroleum-derived plastics in terms of physical properties but are less harmful biologically to the environment and humans. Most of the current PHA producers are heterotrophs, which require expensive feeding materials and thus contribute to the high price of PHAs. Marine photosynthetic bacteria are promising alternative microbial cell factories for cost-effective, carbon neutral and sustainable production of PHAs. In this study, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, a marine photosynthetic purple nonsulfur bacterium with a high metabolic versatility, was evaluated for cell growth and PHA production under the influence of various media components found in previous studies. We evaluated iron, using ferric citrate, as another essential factor for cell growth and efficient PHA production and confirmed that PHA production in R. sulfidophilum was growth-associated under microaerobic and photoheterotrophic conditions. In fact, a subtle amount of iron (1 to 2 μM) was sufficient to promote rapid cell growth and biomass accumulation, as well as a high PHA volumetric productivity during the logarithmic phase. However, an excess amount of iron did not enhance the growth rate or PHA productivity. Thus, we successfully confirmed that an optimum concentration of iron, an essential nutrient, promotes cell growth in R. sulfidophilum and also enhances PHA utilization."

Lately, microalgal research has been strongly stimulated by economic potential expected in biofuels, wastewater treatment, and high-value products. Similar to bacteria and other microorganisms, most work so far has been performed on the level of suspensions which typically contain millions of algal cells per millilitre. The thus obtained macroscopic parameters average cells, which may be in various phases of their cell cycle or even, in the case of microbial consortia, cells of different species. This averaging may obscure essential features which may be needed for the correct understanding and interpretation of investigated processes. In contrast to these conventional macroscopic cultivation and measuring tools, microfluidic single-cell cultivation systems represent an excellent alternative to study individual cells or a small number of mutually interacting cells in a well-defined environment. A novel microfluidic photobioreactor was developed and successfully tested by the photoautotrophic cultivation of Chlorella sorokiniana. The reported microbioreactor facilitates automated long-term cultivation of algae with controlled temperature and with an illumination adjustable over a wide range of photon flux densities. Chemical composition of the medium in the microbioreactor can be stabilised or modulated rapidly to study the response of individual cells. Furthermore, the algae are cultivated in one focal plane and separate chambers, enabling single-cell level investigation of over 100 microcolonies in parallel. The developed platform can be used for systematic growth studies, medium screening, species interaction studies, and the thorough investigation of light-dependent growth kinetics."

Experimental colitis was induced in AQP4 knockout (AQP4-/-) CD-1 mice and AQP4 wild-type (AQP4wt) mice by oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Experimental colitis was clinically established. Compared with AQP4wt mice, AQP4-/- mice showed increased tolerance to DSS-induced experimental colitis, including lesser degree of weight loss, diarrhea and bleeding, lower disease activity index scores, longer colon lengths, and lesser histologic scores. DSS-treated AQP4-/- mice had lower serum levels of IL-6 and TNF, higher IL-10 level, and lesser inflammatory cell infiltration. DSS-treated AQP4-/- mice also had lower immunostaining of NF-κB p65 as well as nuclear levels of p65 and phosphorylated p65. Sequencing of 16S rRNA indicated that DSS-treated AQP4-/- mice maintained intestinal microbial diversity and had higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios and greater relative abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae species. These results suggested for the first time that AQP4 deficiency alleviates experimental colitis in mice. Our study helps to understand the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases, and blocking AQP4 may represent a novel therapeutic approach for ulcerative colitis.-Wang, L., Tang, H., Wang, C., Hu, Y., Wang, S., Shen, L.

https://openalex.org/W2949619838,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released from almost all cell types, which play roles in cell-cell communication. Recent studies have suggested that microenvironmental crosstalk mediated by exosomes is an important factor in the escape of tumour cells from the anti-tumour immune system in human haematopoietic malignancies. Here, we conducted comprehensive analysis of the miRNA and protein profiles within the exosomes released from four canine lymphoid tumour cell lines as a model of human lymphoid tumours. The results showed that the major miRNAs and proteins extracted from the exosomes were similar among the four cell lines. However, the miRNA profiles differed among the exosomes of each cell line, which corresponded to the expression patterns of the parent cells. In the comparison of the amounts of miRNAs and proteins among the cell lines, those of three miRNAs (miR-151, miR-8908a-3p, and miR-486) and CD82 protein differed between exosomes derived from vincristine-sensitive and resistant cell lines. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the biological functions of the exosomal contents in the microenvironmental crosstalk of lymphoid tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2949239287,"Gestational protein restriction was associated with low birth weight, hypertension and higher prevalence of cardiac disorders in adults. Several mechanisms, including epigenetics, could be related with the cardiovascular phenotype on protein-restricted offspring. Thus, we investigated the morphological cardiac effects of gestational protein restriction and left ventricle miRNAs and target genes expression pattern in both 12-day and 16-week old gestational protein-restricted male offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were allocated into two groups, according to protein supply during pregnancy: NP (normal protein diet- 17%) or LP (low protein diet—6%). Dams on the gestational protein-restricted diet had lower body weight gain and higher food intake. Gestational protein-restricted offspring had low birth weight, followed by rapidly body weight recovery, hypertension, and increased myocytes cross-sectional area and collagen fraction at 16-week old age. At 12-days old, miR-184, miR-192, miR-376c, miR-380-3p, miR-380-5p, miR-451, and miR-582-3p had increased expression, and miR-547 and miR-743a had decreased expression in the gestational protein-restricted left ventricle. At 16-week old, let-7b, miR-125a-3p, miR-142-3p, miR-182 and miR-188-5p had increased expression and let-7g, miR-107, miR-127, miR-181a, miR-181c, miR-184, miR-324-5p, miR-383, miR-423-5p and miR-484 had decreased expression in gestational protein-restricted left ventricle. Target predicted gene expression analysis showed higher expression of Dnmt3a, Oxct1, Rictor and Trps1 and lower expression of Bbs1 and Calml3 in 12-day old protein-restricted offspring. 16-week old protein-restricted offspring had higher expression of Adrbk1, Bbs1, Dnmt3a, Gpr22, Inppl1, and Oxct1 genes. In conclusion, gestational protein restriction was related to offspring low birth weight, increased systolic blood pressure and morphological heart alterations that could be related to early heart miRNA expression changes that perpetuate into adulthood and which are associated with the regulation of essential genes involved in cardiovascular development, heart morphology, function, and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2949979033,"2,2'-diselenyldibenzoic acid (DSBA) is a chemical probe produced to explore the pharmacological properties of diphenyldiselenide-derived agents with seleno-hormetic activity undergoing preclinical development. The present study was designed to verify in vivo the drug’s properties and to determine mechanistically how these may mediate the protection of tissues against stress conditions, exemplified by ionizing radiation induced damage in mouse bone marrow. In murine bone marrow hematopoietic cells, the drug initiated the activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor resulting in enhanced expression of downstream stress response genes. This type of response was confirmed in human liver cells and included enhanced expression of glutathione S-transferases (GST), important in the metabolism and pharmacological function of seleno-compounds. In C57 BL/6 mice, DSBA prevented the suppression of bone marrow hematopoietic cells caused by ionizing radiation exposure. Such in vivo prevention effects were associated with Nrf2 pathway activation in both bone marrow cells and liver tissue. These findings demonstrated for the first time the pharmacological properties of DSBA in vivo, suggesting a practical application for this type of Se-hormetic molecules as a radioprotective and/or prevention agents in cancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2942591952,"Mitochondrial metabolic plasticity is a key adaptive mechanism in response to changes in cellular metabolic demand. Changes in mitochondrial metabolic efficiency have been linked to pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and obesity. The ubiquitously expressed DJ-1 (Parkinsonism-associated deglycase) is known as a Parkinson's disease gene and an oncogene. The pleiotropic functions of DJ-1 include reactive oxygen species scavenging, RNA binding, chaperone activity, endocytosis, and modulation of major signaling pathways involved in cell survival and metabolism. Nevertheless, how these functions are linked to the role of DJ-1 in mitochondrial plasticity is not fully understood. In this study, we describe an interaction between DJ-1 and 14-3-3β that regulates the localization of DJ-1, in a hypoxia-dependent manner, either to the cytosol or to mitochondria. This interaction acts as a modulator of mitochondrial metabolic efficiency and a switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Modulation of this novel molecular mechanism of mitochondrial metabolic efficiency is potentially involved in the neuroprotective function of DJ-1 as well as its role in proliferation of cancer cells.-Weinert, M., Millet, A., Jonas, E. A., Alavian, K. N. The mitochondrial metabolic function of DJ-1 is modulated by 14-3-3β."
https://openalex.org/W2942903931,"Empathy is a key notion in the study of sociality. A phenomenological perspective on empathy as intersubjective understanding offers a common ground for multiple dimensions. Corresponding to the dichotomy between perceptual and cognitive levels, two constructs can be distinguished: vicariously experiencing and intuitively understanding others’ emotions. We developed and validated a new questionnaire for the assessment of individual differences in empathy. In a first study (N = 921), we created a questionnaire measuring empathy consisting of a pool of 75 items. Exploratory factor analysis suggested to retain two factors (“Intuitive Understanding” and “Vicarious Experience”), whereas a 30-item version of the questionnaire had satisfactory psychometric properties. In a second study (N = 504), we administered the 30-items questionnaire and several concurrent/divergent measures. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor structure best represented its latent factor structure. The results show that our questionnaire could be considered a reliable and valid measure of empathy with internal consistencies of 0.93 and 0.95 for Vicarious Experience and Intuitive Intuitive Understanding, respectively. Whereas our questionnaire mostly showed the expected convergence with existing scales of empathy, the correlations also suggest that it adds valuable new information to the assessment of empathy. The two-factor structure suggests that the perceptual (vicarious) experience and the basic (non-effortful) cognitive awareness of others’ emotions can be assessed as distinct constructs. This bidimensional structure that distinguishes between the perceptual experience and the basic cognitive awareness of others’ emotional states connects theoretical, empirical, and clinical data from psychology and neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2943010312,"Climate change and infectious disease by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are major drivers of amphibian extinctions, but the potential interactions of these two factors are not fully understood. Temperature is known to influence (1) the infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence of Bd; (2) host-parasite dynamics, especially when both hosts and parasites are ectothermic organisms exhibiting thermal sensitivities that may or may not differ; and (3) amphibian vulnerability to extinction depending on their heat tolerance, which may decrease with infection. Thus, in a global warming scenario, with rising temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, amphibians infected by Bd could be expected to be more vulnerable if temperatures approach their critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, it is also possible that predicted high temperatures could clear the Bd infection, thus enhancing amphibian survival. We tested these hypotheses by measuring CTmax values of Bd-infected and Bd-free aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial toadlets/juveniles of the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) and examining whether exposure of A. obstetricans individuals to peak temperatures reaching their CTmax clears them from Bd infection. We show that (1) Bd has a wide thermal tolerance range; (2) Bd is capable of altering the thermal physiology of A. obstetricans, which is stage-dependent, lowering CTmax in tadpoles but not in toadlets; and (3) Bd infection is not cleared after exposure of tadpoles or toadlets to CTmax. Living under climatic change with rising temperatures, the effect of Bd infection might tip the balance and lead some already threatened amphibian communities towards extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2943396508,"A potential role of haptoglobin in arterial restructuring has been suggested, and our previous study demonstrated that prohaptoglobin, the precursor of haptoglobin, stimulates endothelial angiogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the angiogenic effects of prohaptoglobin are still unclear. Here, we investigated angiogenic signaling induced by prohaptoglobin using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Prohaptoglobin upregulated the expression of placental growth factor (PlGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, and VEGF receptor 1 and 2, and also induced cell migration and tube network formation. PlGF knockdown attenuated these angiogenic effects of prohaptoglobin. Furthermore, a transcription factor profiling assay indicated that Smad is involved in PlGF expression in response to prohaptoglobin. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression and Smad1/5 phosphorylation were also induced by prohaptoglobin treatment. Blockade of TGF-β1 signaling using the TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor LY2109761 or Smad1/5 siRNA reduced the prohaptoglobin-induced PlGF expression and in vitro tube formation. Knockdown of the TGF-β receptor ALK1, but not ALK5, with a specific siRNA blocked the Smad1/5 phosphorylation and PlGF expression induced by prohaptoglobin. These findings suggest that the angiogenic effects of prohaptoglobin are dependent on PlGF and mediated via a TGF-β1-ALK1-Smad1/5–PlGF/VEGFR1–VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2942827515,"Blueberry is a kind of new rising popular perennial fruit with high healthful quality. It is of utmost importance to develop new blueberry varieties for different climatic zones to satisfy the demand of people in the world. Molecular marker assisted breeding is believed to be an ideal method for the development of new blueberry varieties for its shorter breeding cycle than the conventional breeding. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers are widely used molecular tools for marker assisted breeding, which could be detected at large scale by the transcriptome sequencing. Here, we sequenced the leaves transcriptome of 19 rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei Reade), 13 southern highbush (Vaccinium. corymbosum L × native southern Vaccinium Spp) and 22 cultivars of northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L) by using next generation sequencing technologies. A total of 80.825 Gb clean data with an average of about 12.525 million reads per cultivar were obtained. We assembled 58,968, 55,973 and 53,887 unigenes by using the clean data from rabbiteye, southern highbush and northern highbush blueberry cultivars, respectively. Among these unigenes, 3599, 3495 and 3513 unigenes were detected as candidate resistance genes in three blueberry crops. Moreover, we identified more than 8756, 9020, and 9198 SSR markers from these unigenes, and 7665, 4861, 13,063 SNPs from the annotated single copy unigenes, respectively. The results will be helpful for the molecular genetics and association analysis of blueberry and the basic molecular information of pest and disease resistance of blueberry, and would also offer huge number of molecular tools for the marker assisted breeding to produce blueberry cultivars with different adaptive characteristics."

Furthermore, the immunologic effects of the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc (MVC), despite approval for clinical use, have not yet been well evaluated for their potential effects on cytotoxic T-cell responses. In this study, we characterized the development and function of CCR5+CD8+ T cells in rhesus macaques with or without Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. We also investigated the effects of the CCR5 antagonist MVC on functional CCR5+CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro. The data show that CCR5+CD8+ T cells have an effector memory phenotype and increase with age in systemic and mucosal lymphoid tissues as a heterogeneous population of polyfunctional CD8 T cells. In addition, CCR5 is highly expressed on SIV gag-specific (CM9+) CD8+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques, yet CCR5+CD8+ T cells are significantly reduced in mucosal lymphoid tissues with disease progression. Furthermore, in vitro MVC treatment reduced activation and cytokine secretion of CD8+ T cells via a CCR5-independent pathway. These findings suggest that surface CCR5 protein plays an important role in differentiation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Although MVC may be helpful in reducing chronic inflammation and activation, it may also inhibit virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus optimal use of CCR5 antagonists either alone or in combination with other drugs should be defined by further investigation.-Wang, X., Russell-Lodrigue, K. E., Ratterree, M. S., Veazey, R.

Data gathered by the Swarm satellites are used to present the utility of our system. Our objective is to provide a streamlined method to analyze electromagnetic data over a region and investigate the relationship of precursory signals to seismic events. The process follows three distinct stages: data extraction, data pre-processing and anomaly detection. The first stage consists of the region selection and data extraction. The second stage consists of four different pre-processing methods that address the data sparsity problem and the cause of artificial anomalies. The last stage is the Anomaly Detection (AD) of the Swarm satellite data, over the investigated region. The different methods that are implemented are known to perform well in the field of AD. Following the presentation of our system, a case study is described where the seismic event of 6.2 Mw is in Ludian, China and occurred on 3rd August 2014. The event is used to present the usefulness of our approach and pinpoint some critical problems regarding satellite data that were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2943299082,"Autophagy promotes cancer cell survival in response to p53 activation by the anticancer agent Nutlin-3a (Nutlin). We reported previously that Nutlin kills MDM2-amplified cancer cells and that this killing is associated with an inhibition of glucose metabolism, reduced α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) levels, and reduced autophagy. In the current report, using SJSA1, U2OS, A549, and MHM cells, we found that Nutlin alters histone methylation in an MDM2 proto-oncogene–dependent manner and that this, in turn, regulates autophagy-related gene (ATG) expression and cell death. In MDM2-amplified cells, Nutlin increased histone (H) 3 lysine (K) 9 and K36 trimethylation (me3) coincident with reduced autophagy and increased apoptosis. Blocking histone methylation restored autophagy and rescued these cells from Nutlin-induced killing. In MDM2-nonamplified cells, H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels were either reduced or not changed by the Nutlin treatment, and this coincided with increased autophagy and cell survival. Blocking histone demethylation reduced autophagy and sensitized these cells to Nutlin-induced killing. Further experiments suggested that MDM2 amplification increases histone methylation in Nutlin-treated cells by causing depletion of the histone demethylase Jumonji domain-containing protein 2B (JMJD2B). Finally, JMJD2B knockdown or inhibition increased H3K9/K36me3 levels, decreased ATG gene expression and autophagy, and sensitized MDM2-nonamplified cells to apoptosis.

The outcome of p53 activation (survival versus senescence/apoptosis) is believed to depend in part on the level of stress. In addition to these canonical functions, p53 also has noncanonical functions that include its ability to regulate autophagy (5Maiuri M.C. Galluzzi L. Morselli E. Kepp O. Malik S.A. Kroemer G.

A first step in autophagy is formation of phagophore membranes. This step is promoted by an autophagy initiating complex that includes the proteins ULK1 and ULK2. Subsequent steps are mediated in large part by the products of various autophagy-related genes (ATGs). These steps include elongation of phagophore membranes, capture of cargo (organelles, misfolded proteins, etc.) by phagophore membranes, conversion of phagophore membranes into autophagosomes, fusion of cargo-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes, and degradation of cargo in these autophagolysosomes by lysosomal enzymes. Autophagy occurs at low levels normally but is stimulated in response to metabolic stresses such as low nutrient levels. The degradation products of autophagy can be used to generate and maintain the levels of key nutrients and metabolites needed for survival. Autophagy in this case allows survival until the metabolic stress caused by low nutrient levels can be resolved. p53 has been reported to both promote and inhibit autophagy (6Levine B.

Glycolytic metabolites are linked to histone modification that can regulate gene expression. Notably, α-KG is a metabolic intermediate of glucose. Recently we found that Nutlin suppresses α-KG and autophagy in MDM2-amplified cells while increasing α-KG and autophagy in MDM2-nonamplified cells (18Duan L. Perez R.E. Maki C.G.

Importantly, α-KG is an activating cofactor for JMJD family histone lysine demethylases (19Lu C. Thompson C.B.

These enzymes can regulate gene expression by altering the histone methylation status at gene promoters (20Kooistra S.M. Helin K.

Histone methylation can regulate autophagy at gene expression levels. For example, Artal-Martinez de Narvajas et al. (22Artal-Martinez de Narvajas A. Gomez T.S. Zhang J.S. Mann A.O. Taoda Y.

Histone methylations H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 are found in LC3, ATG4b, and p62 gene promoters (23Biga P.R. Latimer M.N. Froehlich J.M. Gabillard J.C. Seiliez I. Distribution of H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 along autophagy-related genes highly expressed in starved zebrafish myotubes.Biol. Open. 2017; 6 (29025701): 1720-172510.1242/bio.029090Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The JMJD2 (Jumonji C domain containing histone demethylase 2) family of proteins selectively demethylate H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Among the JMJD2 family, JMJD2B is a p53 target gene (24Castellini L. Moon E.J. Razorenova O.V. Krieg A.J. von Eyben R. Giaccia A.J. KDM4B/JMJD2B is a p53 target gene that modulates the amplitude of p53 response after DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28073943): 3674-369210.1093/nar/gkw1281PubMed Google Scholar). We envisioned that JMJD2B could be induced by Nutlin-mediated activation of p53 and then regulate histone methylation to affect ATG gene expression and autophagy. In the current report, we found JMJD2B-mediated histone demethylation promotes ATG gene expression, autophagy, and survival in MDM2-nonamplified cells treated with Nutlin. We also found that JMJD2B is depleted in MDM2-amplified cells treated with Nutlin in a manner that appears to be MDM2-dependent. The depletion of JMJD2B leads to increased histone methylation, reduced ATG gene expression and autophagy, and increased killing in MDM2-amplified cells. We previously showed glycolysis and α-KG can protect cells against Nutlin-induced apoptosis by in some way maintaining expression of ATG genes required for autophagy (12Duan L. Perez R.E.

Thompson C.B. Metabolic regulation of epigenetics.Cell Metab. 2012; 16 (22768835): 9-1710.1016/j.cmet.2012.06.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated JMJD histone demethylases could promote autophagy by regulating histone methylation and ATG gene expression (22Artal-Martinez de Narvajas A. Gomez T.S. Zhang J.S. Mann A.O. Taoda Y. Gorman J.A. Herreros-Villanueva M. Gress T.M. Ellenrieder V. Bujanda L. Kim D.H. Kozikowski A.P. Koenig A. Billadeau D.D. Epigenetic regulation of autophagy by the methyltransferase G9a.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33 (23918802): 3983-399310.1128/MCB.00813-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To begin to test this possibility, two MDM2-amplified cell lines (MHM and SJSA1) (17Duan L. Perez R.E. Chen L. Blatter L.A. Maki C.G. p53 promotes AKT and SP1-dependent metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway that inhibits apoptosis in response to Nutlin-3a.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 10 (29190376): 331-34010.1093/jmcb/mjx051Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and two MDM2-nonamplified cell lines (A549 and U2OS) were treated with Nutlin and the level of histone H3 lysine methylation determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, H3K9me2/3 and H3K36me3 levels were decreased in Nutlin-treated A549 cells and unaffected in Nutlin-treated U2OS cells. In contrast, H3K9me2/3 and H3K36me3 levels were increased in Nutlin-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells. H3K4me3 levels were unaffected by Nutlin in all cells. H3K27me3 was barely detectable in U2OS, MHM, and SJSA1 cells compared with that in A549 cells. The results indicate H3K9me2/3 and H3K36me3 are increased in MDM2-amplified MHM and SJSA1 cells that are sensitive to Nutlin-induced apoptosis and either decreased or maintained in MDM2-nonamplified A549 and U2OS cells that are resistant to this apoptosis (17Duan L. Perez R.E. Chen L. Blatter L.A. Maki C.G. p53 promotes AKT and SP1-dependent metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway that inhibits apoptosis in response to Nutlin-3a.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 10 (29190376): 331-34010.1093/jmcb/mjx051Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Next we asked if increased histone methylation contributes to apoptosis. For this, apoptosis was monitored in MHM and SJSA1 cells co-treated with Nutlin and the pan-histone methylation inhibitor DZnep or IOX-1, a pan-inhibitor of JMJD2 histone demethylases. Co-treatment with DZnep blocked the increase in histone methylation seen in Nutlin-treated MHM cells (Fig. 1B) and reduced apoptosis in Nutlin-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, IOX-1 caused a slight increase in apoptosis in Nutlin-treated cells (Fig. 1C). These findings suggested that increased histone methylation contributes to Nutlin-induced apoptosis. To examine this further, we treated A549 and U2OS cells with Nutlin and IOX-1 and monitored histone methylation and apoptosis. Co-treatment with Nutlin and IOX-1 increased or maintained histone methylation in Nutlin-treated A549 and U2OS cells (Fig. 1, D and E) and sensitized these cells to apoptosis (Fig. 1F). Together, the results support the idea that increasing histone methylation sensitizes cells to Nutlin-induced apoptosis. We next wished to ask if histone methylation regulates apoptosis in Nutlin-treated cells by affecting autophagy, because previous studies showed histone methylation can repress expression of LC3 and other autophagy genes (22Artal-Martinez de Narvajas A. Gomez T.S. Zhang J.S. Mann A.O. Taoda Y. Gorman J.A. Herreros-Villanueva M. Gress T.M. Ellenrieder V. Bujanda L. Kim D.H. Kozikowski A.P. Koenig A. Billadeau D.D. Epigenetic regulation of autophagy by the methyltransferase G9a.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33 (23918802): 3983-399310.1128/MCB.00813-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To examine this, we used autophagy flux as a measure of autophagy in Nutlin-treated cells. LC3-II is an autophagy protein that is degraded in autophagolysosomes. Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) blocks autophagic degradation, including degradation of LC3-II. Thus, the extent to which LC3-II accumulates in BafA1-treated cells indicates the rate at which autophagic degradation is occurring, or autophagy “flux.” We first monitored LC3-II accumulation in MDM2-amplified MHM and SJSA1 cells treated with BafA1. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, LC3-II accumulated in BafA1-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells, indicating autophagic degradation was occurring. LC3-II accumulated to a lesser extent in MHM and SJSA1 cells treated with BafA1 plus Nutlin versus cells treated with BafA1 alone (Fig. 2, A and C). This is consistent with our previous study (12Duan L. Perez R.E. Davaadelger B. Dedkova E.N. Blatter L.A. Maki C.G. p53-regulated autophagy is controlled by glycolysis and determines cell fate.Oncotarget. 2015; 6 (26337205): 23135-2315610.18632/oncotarget.5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and indicates Nutlin inhibits autophagy flux in these cells. Importantly, LC3-II accumulated to a greater extent in cells co-treated with BafA1 plus Nutlin and DZNep compared with cells treated with BafA1 plus DZNep only (Fig. 2, A and C). This indicates Nutlin treatment promotes autophagy flux when histone methylation is inhibited by DZnep. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) is a fluorescent marker of intact autophagolysosomes, and MDC labeling is a common measure of autophagy (26Vázquez C.L. Colombo M.I. Assays to assess autophagy induction and fusion of autophagic vacuoles with a degradative compartment, using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and DQ-BSA.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 452 (19200877): 85-9510.1016/S0076-6879(08)03606-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We monitored MDC labeling of autophagic vesicles in MHM and SJSA1 cells treated with Nutlin alone or Nutlin plus DZnep. As shown in Fig. 2, B and D, MDC labeling was reduced in Nutlin-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells, consistent with reduced autophagy. However, Nutlin increased MDC labeling when histone methylation was inhibited by co-treatment with DZnep. Altogether, the results indicate decreasing histone methylation can restore or increase autophagy in Nutlin-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells. We next asked if increasing histone methylation by IOX1 treatment could reduce autophagy flux and MDC labeling in MDM2-nonamplified A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 2E, LC3-II accumulated to a greater extent in A549 cells co-treated with Nutlin plus BafA1 compared with cells treated with BafA1 alone (Fig. 2E). This is consistent with our previous studies and indicates Nutlin can increase autophagy flux in these cells. However, LC3-II accumulated to a lesser extent in cells co-treated with BafA1 plus Nutlin and IOX1 compared with cells treated with BafA1 plus Nutlin alone (Fig. 2E). This result suggests increasing histone methylation by IOX-1 treatment reduces autophagy flux. As shown in Fig. 2F, MDC labeling was increased by Nutlin treatment in A549 cells, and this effect was blocked by IOX1 (Fig. 2F). In total, these results suggest increasing histone methylation in Nutlin-treated A549 cells reduces autophagy. The above results suggest histone methylation, specifically H3K9/K36me3, is differentially regulated in MDM2-amplified (MHM and SJSA1) cells versus MDM2-nonamplified (A549 and U2OS) cells and plays a repressive role in autophagy. JMJD2 family proteins promote demethylation of H3K9/K36me3, and JMJD2B is a p53 target gene (24Castellini L. Moon E.J. Razorenova O.V. Krieg A.J. von Eyben R. Giaccia A.J. KDM4B/JMJD2B is a p53 target gene that modulates the amplitude of p53 response after DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28073943): 3674-369210.1093/nar/gkw1281PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zheng H. Chen L. Pledger W.J. Fang J. Chen J. p53 promotes repair of heterochromatin DNA by regulating JMJD2b and SUV39H1 expression.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23376847): 734-74410.1038/onc.2013.6Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We speculated JMJD2B may regulate histone methylation and autophagy in response to p53 activation by Nutlin. To test this possibility, we first monitored JMJD2B gene and protein expression in Nutlin-treated MHM, SJSA1, A549, and U2OS cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, JMJD2B mRNA levels were increased in all four cell lines treated with Nutlin. In U2OS and A549 cells, JMJD2B protein was also increased in response to Nutlin (Fig. 3B), consistent with the mRNA increase. However, JMJD2B protein was markedly decreased in Nutlin-treated MHM and SJSA1 cells (Fig. 3B). Notably, MDM2 levels were highly induced in MHM/SJSA1 cells compared with that in A549/U2OS cells (Fig. 3B). Co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored JMJD2B protein levels in MHM and SJSA1 cells treated with Nutlin (Fig. 3C), at least partially, but only slightly increased JMJD2B protein levels in U2OS and A549 cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest the decrease in JMJD2B protein levels in MDM2-amplified MHM/SJSA1 cells is because of increased protein degradation. Results in Fig. 3 suggested that reduced levels of JMJD2B may cause increased histone methylation and, subsequently, reduced autophagy and increased death in MDM2-amplified cells treated with Nutlin. If this were true, we reasoned knockdown of JMJD2B would also increase histone methylation in MDM2-nonamplified cells treated with Nutlin, and this would coincide with reduced autophagy and increased cell death. To test this, A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA or JMJD2B siRNA and then treated with vehicle or Nutlin. As shown in Fig. 4A, H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 levels were increased in JMJD2B knockdown cells treated with Nutlin but not in control cells. Immunoblotting confirmed JMJD2B levels were depleted by the JMJD2B siRNA. We again used LC3 accumulation in BafA1-treated cells as a measure of autophagy flux. As shown in Fig. 4, B and D, LC3-II accumulated to a greater extent in control A549 and U2OS cells treated with Nutlin plus BafA1 compared with BafA1 alone, indicating Nutlin promotes autophagy flux in these cells. However, this effect was lost when JMJD2B was depleted by siRNA. Similarly, Nutlin-treatment increased MDC labeling in control A549 and U2OS cells but not in cells where JMJD2B was depleted by siRNA (Fig. 4, C and E). These results indicate that depletion of JMJD2B blocks or reduces autophagy in Nutlin-treated A549 and U2OS cells. Finally, we monitored apoptosis (% sub-G1 cells) in response to Nutlin in either control A549 and U2OS cells or cells in which JMJD2B was depleted by siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4, C and E, Nutlin promoted apoptosis only in cells where JMJD2B was depleted but not in control cells. These results support a role for JMJD2B in suppressing histone methylation to maintain or increase autophagy and survival in MDM2-nonamplified cells treated with Nutlin. MDM2 is an ubiquitin E3-ligase that can bind and promote the degradation of p53 and other proteins. The finding that JMJD2B was depleted in MDM2-amplified cells treated with Nutlin but not in MDM2-nonamplified cells raised the possibility that MDM2 may bind and promote JMJD2B degradation in these cells. We carried out co-immunoprecipitation studies in SJSA1 cells to ask if MDM2 and JMJD2B can bind each other. In first experiments, to avoid JMJD2B degradation, cells were treated with Nutlin for only 6 h. This treatment length increases MDM2 levels but does not yet cause depletion of JMJD2B. As shown in Fig. 5A, JMJD2B co-immunoprecipitated with MDM2 in SJSA1 cells treated with Nutlin for 6 h. We carried out similar experiments in which SJSA1 cells were treated with Nutlin for 24 h followed by treatment with MG132 for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 5B, JMJD2B levels were reduced with 24-h Nutlin treatment but restored by MG132. Further, MDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with JMJD2B in SJSA1 cells treated with Nutlin for 24 h and subsequently treated with MG132 (Fig. 5B). The results demonstrate"

The purpose of this study was to identify steatosis-driven biomarkers as a predisposition to severe liver damage and delayed recovery following ischemia reperfusion injury. Wistar rats were fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet for up to three weeks to achieve severe macrosteatosis (>90%). Animals underwent diet withdrawal to control chow and/or underwent ischemia reperfusion and partial hepatectomy injury (I/R-PHx) and reperfused out to 7 days on control chow. For animals with severe macrosteatosis, hepatic levels of IL-33 decreased while Cyclin D1 levels increased in the absence of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. Animals with high levels of nuclear Cyclin D1 prior to I/R-PHx either did not survive or had persistent macrosteatosis after 7 days on control chow. Survival 7 days after I/R-PHx fell to 57% which correlated with increased Cyclin D1 and decreased liver IL-33 levels. In the absence of I/R-PHx, withdrawing the MCD diet normalized IL-33, Cyclin D1 levels, and I/R-PHx survival back to baseline. In transplanted grafts with macrosteatosis, higher Cyclin D1 mRNA expression was observed. Shifts in Cyclin D1 and IL-33 expression may identify severely macrosteatotic livers with increased failure risk if subjected to I/R injury. Clinical validation of the panel in donor grafts with macrosteatosis revealed increased Cyclin D1 expression corresponding to delayed graft function. This pre-surgical biomarker panel may identify the subset of livers with increased susceptibility to PNF."
https://openalex.org/W2943578600,"The asparaginyl hydroxylase, Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), is a cellular dioxygenase. Originally identified as oxygen sensor in the cellular response to hypoxia, where FIH acts as a repressor of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor alpha (HIF-α) proteins through asparaginyl hydroxylation, FIH also hydroxylates many proteins that contain ankyrin repeat domains (ARDs). Given FIH's promiscuity and the unclear functional effects of ARD hydroxylation, the biological relevance of HIF-α and ARD hydroxylation remains uncertain. Here, we have employed evolutionary and enzymatic analyses of FIH, and both HIF-α and ARD-containing substrates, in a broad range of metazoa to better understand their conservation and functional importance. Utilising Tribolium castaneum and Acropora millepora, we provide evidence that FIH from both species are able to hydroxylate HIF-α proteins, supporting conservation of this function beyond vertebrates. We further demonstrate that T. castaneum and A. millepora FIH homologs can also hydroxylate specific ARD proteins. Significantly, FIH is also conserved in several species with inefficiently-targeted or absent HIF, supporting the hypothesis of important HIF-independent functions for FIH. Overall, these data show that while oxygen-dependent HIF-α hydroxylation by FIH is highly conserved in many species, HIF-independent roles for FIH have evolved in others."
https://openalex.org/W2943401880,"Protein self-assembling is studied under the light of the Biological Membrane model. To this purpose we define a simplified formulation of hydrophobic interaction energy in analogy with electrostatic energy stored in an electric dipole. Self-assembly is considered to be the result of the balanced influence of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, limited by steric hindrance as a consequence of the relative proximity of their components. Our analysis predicts the type of interaction that drives an assembly. We study the growth of both electrostatic and hydrophobic energies stored by a protein system as it self-assembles. Each type of assembly is studied by using two examples, PDBid 2OM3 (hydrophobic) and PDBid 3ZEE (electrostatic). Other systems are presented to show the application of our procedure. We also study the relative orientation of the monomers constituting the first dimer of a protein assembly to check whether their relative position provides the optimal interaction energy (energy minimum). It is shown that the inherent orientation of the dimers corresponds to the optimum energy (energy minimum) of assembly compatible with steric limitations. These results confirm and refine our Biological Membrane model of protein self-assembly valid for all open and closed systems."
https://openalex.org/W2952969131,"Uridylate insertion/deletion RNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei is a complex system that is not found in humans, so there is interest in targeting this system for drug development. This system uses hundreds of small non-coding guide RNAs (gRNAs) to modify the mitochondrial mRNA transcriptome. This process occurs in holo-editosomes that assemble several macromolecular trans factors around mRNA including the RNA-free RNA editing core complex (RECC) and auxiliary ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms of editing remain obscure. The enzymatic accessory RNP complex, termed the REH2C, includes mRNA substrates and products, the multi-domain 240 kDa RNA Editing Helicase 2 (REH2) and an intriguing 8-zinc finger protein termed REH2-Associated Factor 1 (H2F1). Both of these proteins are essential in editing. REH2 is a member of the DExH/RHA subfamily of RNA helicases with a conserved C-terminus that includes a regulatory OB-fold domain. In trypanosomes, H2F1 recruits REH2 to the editing apparatus, and H2F1 downregulation causes REH2 fragmentation. Our systematic mutagenesis dissected determinants in REH2 and H2F1 for the assembly of REH2C, the stability of REH2, and the RNA-mediated association of REH2C with other editing trans factors. We identified functional OB-fold amino acids in eukaryotic DExH/RHA helicases that are conserved in REH2 and that impact the assembly and interactions of REH2C. H2F1 upregulation stabilized REH2 in vivo. Mutation of the core cysteines or basic amino acids in individual zinc fingers affected the stabilizing property of H2F1 but not its interactions with other examined editing components. This result suggests that most, if not all, fingers may contribute to REH2 stabilization. Finally, a recombinant REH2 (240 kDa) established that the full-length protein is a bona fide RNA helicase with ATP-dependent unwinding activity. REH2 is the only DExH/RHA-type helicase in kinetoplastid holo-editosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2942824036,"The purpose of this study was to determine the estimated mutation age and conservation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with physical activity (PA) in humans. All human SNPs found to be significantly associated with PA levels in the literature were cross-referenced with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing Project to find estimated African-American (AA) and European-American (EA) mutation age. As a secondary measure of mutation age, SNPs were searched for in Hawk's mutation age prediction database which utilizes linkage equilibrium. To determine conservation among hominids, all SNPs were searched in the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser, which contains Neanderthal and chimpanzee reference genomes. Six of the 104 SNPs associated with PA regulation were exon-located missense variants found in IFNAR2, PPARGC1A, PML, CTBP2, IL5RA, and APOE genes. The remaining 98 SNPs were located in non-protein coding regions. Average AA and EA estimated mutation age of the exon-located SNPs were 478.4 ± 327.5 kya and 542.1 ± 369.4 kya, respectively. There were four selective sweeps (suggestive of strong positive selection) of SNPs in humans when compared to Neanderthal or chimpanzee genomes. Exon-located PA candidate SNPs are older than the hypothesized emergence of anatomically modern humans. However, 95% of PA associated SNPs are found in intron and intergenic location. Across all SNPs, there seems to be a high level of conservation of alleles between humans, Neanderthals, and chimpanzees. However, the presence of four selective sweeps suggests there were selection pressures or drift unique to Homo sapiens that influenced the development of mutations associated with PA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2943430616,"As many countries are now seeking to protect their own markets rather than indulge in global trade, this paper examines whether this type of de-globalization behavior has been having any effect on international investment relationships through a systematic analysis of international investment network (IIN) in 127 economies from 2005 to 2016. Unlike previous studies that only analyzed portfolio investment data, the bilateral international investment data were estimated using a matrix-based iteration approach, and the IIN established using complex network theory. Using bilateral international investment data made the results more reliable and somewhat closer to reality. To analyze the structural properties and evolution of the IIN, complex network indicators including a new one named node similarity were developed. The node similarity is defined as the proportion of common relationships of the current economy between two successive years which is useful to reveal the dynamics of the IIN. This paper finds that there are heterogenous and hierarchal properties in the IIN, several economies had a wide range of international investment partners, while most others had only a small range of investment partners and were more likely to form tight groups within the network. The economies in the IIN were tending towards smaller but closer communities, a new trend of regional financial cooperation was developing. The IIN is divided into more communities over time while the top active and central economies often locate in different communities. These findings imply that the structure of the IIN is changing geographically during the de-globalization rather than independent with regions. The regional cooperation has made positive effect on the international investment. The governments should ensure that they continue to support liberal financial policies and to promote better regional financial cooperation."

To assess the intraoperative change of base excess (BE) and chloride in serum after treatment with either a balanced gelatine/electrolyte solution or a non-balanced gelatine/electrolyte solution, a prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blind, dual centre phase III study was conducted in two tertiary care university hospitals in Germany.40 patients of both sexes, aged 18 to 90 years, who were scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgery with assumed intraoperative volume requirement of at least 15 mL/kg body weight gelatine solution were included. Administration of study drug was performed intravenously according to patients need. The trigger for volume replacement was a central venous pressure (CVP) minus positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) <10 mmHg (CVP <10 mmHg). The crystalloid:colloid ratio was 1:1 intra- and postoperatively. The targets for volume replacement were a CVP between 10 and 14 mmHg minus PEEP after treatment with vasoactive agent and mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg.The primary endpoints, intraoperative changes of base excess -2.59 ± 2.25 (median: -2.65) mmol/L (balanced group) and -4.79 ± 2.38 (median: -4.70) mmol/L (non-balanced group)) or serum chloride 2.4 ± 1.9 (median: 3.0) mmol/L and 5.2 ± 3.1 (median: 5.0) mmol/L were significantly different (p = 0.0117 and p = 0.0045, respectively). In both groups (each n = 20) the investigational product administration in terms of volume and infusion rate was comparable throughout the course of the study, i.e. before, during and after surgery.Balanced gelatine solution 4% combined with a balanced electrolyte solution demonstrated significant smaller impact on blood gas analytic parameters in the primary endpoints BE and serum chloride when compared to a non-balanced gelatine solution 4% combined with NaCl 0.9%. No marked treatment differences were observed with respect to haemodynamics, coagulation and renal function.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01515397) and clinicaltrialsregister.eu, EudraCT number 2010-018524-58."
https://openalex.org/W2941403033,"Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is a glycoprotein secreted by skeletal muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. Previous studies showed that serum FSTL1 concentrations were increased in acute coronary syndrome and chronic heart failure. The aim of this study was to assess the associations among plasma FSTL1 concentration, clinical parameters, and whether FSTL1 concentration could predict cardiovascular events in patients with elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).A consecutive series of 410 patients who underwent elective PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES) were enrolled between August 2004 and December 2006 at Juntendo University hospital. We measured plasma FSTL1 levels prior to elective PCI and assessed the association among FSTL1 levels, clinical parameters, and occurrence of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. FSTL1 concentration was positively correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), serum creatinine, and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (all P < 0.01). After excluding patients with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min and hsCRP ≥ 0.2 mg/dL, the remaining 214 were followed for a median of 5.1 years. Twenty (9.3%) patients experienced MACCE. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis estimated an FSTL1 cutoff of 41.1 ng/mL to predict MACCE occurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis found a higher MACCE rate in patients with high (≥ 41.1 ng/mL) than with low (< 41.1 ng/mL) FSTL1 (P < 0.01). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis found that high FSTL1 was an independent predictor of MACCE (hazard ratio 4.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.45-20.07, P < 0.01).High plasma FSTL1 may be a predictor of cardiovascular events in patients who underwent elective PCI with DES, especially with preserved renal function and low hsCRP."
https://openalex.org/W2943044673,"Besides endangering human health, air pollution has profound effects on individuals’ cognition, emotions, and behavior. Previous studies have found that air pollution could increase self-oriented lies. We summarized two explanations for this phenomenon: (1) air pollution makes people less likely to regard lies as unethical, and (2) air pollution makes people more likely to approach materials rewards. The present study mainly measured three kinds of lies—self-convenience, other-convenience, and other-material lies—to investigate these two explanations. Participants were asked to imagine living in either a polluted or a clean situation in two online studies and one laboratory study. The results showed that air pollution did not influence self-convenience lies (Studies 1 and 2), and clean air increased both other-convenience and other-material lies (Studies 2 and 3). According to these results, both explanations are supported. The theoretical implications of the present study are discussed."
