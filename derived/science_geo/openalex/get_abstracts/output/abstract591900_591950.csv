https://openalex.org/W2741508285,"Most human epithelial tumors harbor numerous alterations, making it difficult to predict which genes are required for tumor survival. To systematically identify cancer dependencies, we analyzed 501 genome-scale loss-of-function screens performed in diverse human cancer cell lines. We developed DEMETER, an analytical framework that segregates on- from off-target effects of RNAi. 769 genes were differentially required in subsets of these cell lines at a threshold of six SDs from the mean. We found predictive models for 426 dependencies (55%) by nonlinear regression modeling considering 66,646 molecular features. Many dependencies fall into a limited number of classes, and unexpectedly, in 82% of models, the top biomarkers were expression based. We demonstrated the basis behind one such predictive model linking hypermethylation of the UBB ubiquitin gene to a dependency on UBC. Together, these observations provide a foundation for a cancer dependency map that facilitates the prioritization of therapeutic targets."

Chemotherapy failure is the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the contribution of gut microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer. We found that Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient clinicopathological characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and functional studies demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the autophagy pathway and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, microRNAs, and autophagy to clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal cancer chemoresistance. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical management and may ameliorate colorectal cancer patient outcomes."

But they can suffer from low biocompatibility and poor matching of the mechanical properties with the tissues. Li et al. combined an adhesive surface with a flexible matrix to develop an adhesive that has the right level of stick but moves with the surrounding tissues. The adhesive is effective in the presence of blood and thus might work during wound repair. Science , this issue p. 378"

Compaction starts with the DNA wrapping around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, but it is unclear how these further compress into mitotic chromosomes. Ou et al. describe a DNA-labeling method that allows them to visualize chromatin organization in human cells (see the Perspective by Larson and Misteli). They show that chromatin forms flexible chains with diameters between 5 and 24 nm. In mitotic chromosomes, chains bend back on themselves to pack at high density, whereas during interphase, the chromatin chains are more extended. Science , this issue p. eaag0025 ; see also p. 354"

https://openalex.org/W2739511077,"Elucidation of the mutational landscape of human cancer has progressed rapidly and been accompanied by the development of therapeutics targeting mutant oncogenes. However, a comprehensive mapping of cancer dependencies has lagged behind and the discovery of therapeutic targets for counteracting tumor suppressor gene loss is needed. To identify vulnerabilities relevant to specific cancer subtypes, we conducted a large-scale RNAi screen in which viability effects of mRNA knockdown were assessed for 7,837 genes using an average of 20 shRNAs per gene in 398 cancer cell lines. We describe findings of this screen, outlining the classes of cancer dependency genes and their relationships to genetic, expression, and lineage features. In addition, we describe robust gene-interaction networks recapitulating both protein complexes and functional cooperation among complexes and pathways. This dataset along with a web portal is provided to the community to assist in the discovery and translation of new therapeutic approaches for cancer."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is heritable. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have mapped >65 genomic loci for CAD, with most residing in non-coding sequence (CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium et al., 2013Deloukas P. Kanoni S. Willenborg C.

The diversity of cell types potentially involved in CAD pathogenesis (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and cells of the adaptive immune system) complicates functional determination of the underlying causal mechanisms. As a result, successful translation of SNP associations into causal genes and biologic pathways has been confined to a small subset of GWAS loci in CAD (Bauer et al., 2015Bauer R.C. Tohyama J. Cui J.

The identification of causal genes for CAD has relied on connecting a variant with genetic expression differences, which is now broadly available through the GTEx consortium (GTEx Consortium, 2013GTEx ConsortiumThe Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.Nat.

Though disease-associated loci are often named by the closest gene to the variant, or the gene with the strongest eQTL, neither can identify a causal gene with certainty. Here we focus on a genomic locus associated with CAD and four other vascular disorders.

The associated variants at 6p24 lie within the third intron of the gene encoding phosphatase and actin regulatory protein 1 (PHACTR1), nominating PHACTR1 as the effector gene given its physical proximity. In support of this hypothesis, an association exists between risk genotype and PHACTR1 expression in arterial samples (Aguet et al., 2016Aguet F. Brown A.A. Castel S. Davis J.R. Mohammadi P.

Despite these data, the causal gene at the 6p24 locus remains uncertain. Furthermore, the mechanism that links the causal variant to gene expression at this locus is not known. To dissect how the 6p24 locus affects vascular disease risk, we utilized genetic and epigenomic approaches to identify the causal variant in the locus, the gene(s) regulated by the variant, and the mechanism by which the DNA variant affects the gene. CAD GWASs have identified association between a group of variants in linkage disequilibrium at 6p24 and several diseases. Sequencing at the locus in a French-Canadian cohort has prioritized an intronic variant in this region (Beaudoin et al., 2015Beaudoin M. Gupta R.M. Won H.-H. Lo K.S. Do R. Henderson C.A. Lavoie-St-Amour C. Langlois S. Rivas D. Lehoux S. et al.Myocardial Infarction-Associated SNP at 6p24 Interferes With MEF2 Binding and Associates With PHACTR1 Expression Levels in Human Coronary Arteries.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2015; 35: 1472-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We conducted genetic fine mapping using the data from the CARDIOGRAMplusC4D Consortium (194,427 individuals), and we imputed SNP associations from the 1000 Genomes Project (Figure 1A). Imputation-based fine mapping combines summary level data from the large-scale CARDIOGRAMplusC4D analysis with linkage disequilibrium estimation from a reference set of similar ancestry. This approach can refine the association signal at a previously identified locus (Yang et al., 2012Yang J. Ferreira T. Morris A.P. Medland S.E. Madden P.A. Heath A.C. Martin N.G. Montgomery G.W. Weedon M.N. Loos R.J. et al.Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) ConsortiumDIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) ConsortiumConditional and joint multiple-SNP analysis of GWAS summary statistics identifies additional variants influencing complex traits.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The strongest association was for a single variant, rs9349379, with an association of 1.81 × 10−42 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14), far exceeding the association signal for the next most highly associated SNP, rs78145402 (OR = 1.08, 4.69 × 10−17). We next conducted a conditional analysis at the 6p24 locus to determine if there exists an association independent of the sentinel SNP. This conditional analysis, after adjusting for rs9349379, showed no evidence of a second independent CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) association at this locus (Figure S1). The Probabilistic Identification of Causal SNPs (PICS) algorithm (Farh et al., 2015Farh K.K.-H. Marson A. Zhu J. Kleinewietfeld M. Housley W.J. Beik S. Shoresh N. Whitton H. Ryan R.J.H. Shishkin A.A. et al.Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants.Nature. 2015; 518: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) also identifies rs9349379 as the causal SNP, given the haplotype structure at the locus, with greater than 99% probability (Table S1). Thus, statistical evidence prioritizes rs9349379 as a likely causal SNP for the multiple vascular disease associations at this locus. Phenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) enable unbiased assessment of the relationship between a given variant and a broad range of human disease phenotypes. This approach is particularly useful for a variant, such as rs9349379, with known impact on several diseases. We conducted a PheWAS for this variant in the UK Biobank using individual-level data from 112,338 individuals of European ancestry. The UK Biobank PheWAS confirmed the previously published associations for CAD and migraine headache (Figure 1B; CAD p = 1.16 × 10−11; migraine p = 0.000717). The pattern of association is striking as the minor allele at rs9349379 (G, 36% frequency) leads to increased risk for CAD and coronary calcification but decreased risk for four conditions (migraine headache, cervical artery dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension). Analysis for association between rs9349379 and cardiovascular risk factors confirmed the previously reported association with systolic blood pressure, but no relationship with lipid concentrations, weight, diabetes, or other related measures (Figure S1B, data obtained from analysis of multiple studies listed in Table S3). There was no significant association of rs9349379 with any other diseases in the UK Biobank PheWAS (Figure S1C). Given the association of rs9349379 with vascular phenotypes, we next determined its relationship with relevant sub-phenotypes. First, in the UK Biobank, we investigated whether the rs9349379 genotype was associated with a measure of arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness index was measured in the upper extremity using a digital sensor attached to the participant’s digit. In 38,817 participants of European ancestry, the G allele at rs9349379 was associated with decreased arterial stiffness index, with β = −0.077 (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.034, −0.119), p = 0.0004. Second, we used data from a meta-analysis conducted by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium to quantify the effect of rs9349379 on endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Flow-mediated vasodilation is a standardized assay of endothelial cell function evoked following brief occlusion of the brachial artery (Corretti et al., 2002Corretti M.C. Anderson T.J. Benjamin E.J. Celermajer D. Charbonneau F. Creager M.A. Deanfield J. Drexler H. Gerhard-Herman M. Herrington D. et al.International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task ForceGuidelines for the ultrasound assessment of endothelial-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery: a report of the International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 39: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3905) Google Scholar). Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation was measured in 16,662 participants using ultrasound-guided measurement of brachial artery diameter before and immediately following brief occlusion of the vessel by suprasystolic inflation of a blood pressure cuff. The G allele at rs9349379 was associated with decreased flow-mediated vasodilation (β = −0.1209 [95% CI: −0.5535, −0.6188], p = 0.004). Flow-mediated vasodilation is provoked by shear stress on the endothelium and subsequent dilation in response to vasoactive peptides generated by endothelial cells (Sorensen et al., 1995Sorensen K.E. Celermajer D.S. Spiegelhalter D.J. Georgakopoulos D. Robinson J. Thomas O. Deanfield J.E. Non-invasive measurement of human endothelium dependent arterial responses: accuracy and reproducibility.Br. Heart J. 1995; 74: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In aggregate, these genetic data suggest a role for rs9349379 in human endothelial cell function, and our subsequent experiments prioritized the use of endothelial cells to characterize underlying mechanisms. Non-coding variants often affect gene expression by altering the function of enhancer elements, which can control cell-type-specific gene expression programs. Prior studies have used overlap with enhancer elements to prioritize a cell or tissue type for functional analysis of GWAS loci (Farh et al., 2015Farh K.K.-H. Marson A. Zhu J. Kleinewietfeld M. Housley W.J. Beik S. Shoresh N. Whitton H. Ryan R.J.H.

In pursuit of a tissue or cell in which rs9349379 has relevant regulatory function, we examined the occupancy of a histone mark associated with enhancer activity (H3K27Ac) at the locus in all tissues and cell types annotated in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012ENCODE Project ConsortiumAn integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11030) Google Scholar). However, there was no detectable H3K27Ac signal at this locus in these datasets (Figure 2A). Notably, vascular tissues were not included in the ENCODE catalog of chromatin states. The newly released ENCODE phase 3 data, however, includes four aortic artery samples. In these aortic samples, a strong enhancer signal overlies rs9349379 (Figure 2B), spanning 1 kb. Of these aorta samples, two were homozygous major (A/A) at rs9349379, one heterozygous (A/G), and one homozygous minor (G/G). All four demonstrate robust H3K27 acetylation at rs9349379 (Figure S2). These data suggest a gene regulatory function exists at this locus in vascular tissue.Figure S2Related to Figure 2Show full captionH3K27Ac ChIP-seq of 6p24 locus shows regulatory element at rs9349379 (∗) in 4 separate Aorta samples.

First two samples from A/A individuals at rs9349379, followed by G/G and A/G. To determine the target gene of the regulatory element at rs9349379, we performed genome-editing experiments in pluripotent stem cells, and we differentiated these cells into two vascular cell types: endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). First, we deleted an 88-bp region at rs9349379 in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line using CRISPR/Cas9 with flanking single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (Figure 3A). High-efficiency sgRNAs were designed, constructed, and tested for nuclease activity as previously described (Peters et al., 2013Peters D.T. Cowan C.A. Musunuru K. Genome Editing in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells. StemBook, 2013Google Scholar). The highest efficiency sgRNAs were nucleofected into iPSCs, and three clones with a bi-allelic 88-bp deletion (Δ88) were generated from a total of 384 screened clones (Figure S3A). These clones, along with three unedited wild-type clones that had also been exposed to the CRISPR/Cas9 complex, were expanded and differentiated into ECs and VSMCs as previously described (Patsch et al., 2015Patsch C.

Expression of five other genes in the 1-Mb region surrounding rs9349379, including PHACTR1, did not differ significantly for either cell type. There was no differential gene expression between wild-type (WT) and Δ88 iPSCs differentiated to a non-vascular cell type, neural crest progenitor cells (Figure S3B). Though EDN1 expression was differentially regulated in both ECs and VSMCs, there was a 50-fold higher expression in ECs (Figure S3C). We therefore focused further experiments to characterize cis regulation by rs9349379 in ECs. To determine if the cis regulation of EDN1 by the 6p24 regulatory element was present in a different pluripotent cell line, we edited an embryonic stem cell (ESC) line as well. ESC-derived ECs confirmed the regulatory effect, and Δ88 ESC-ECs demonstrated higher expression compared with WT ESC-ECs (Figure 3C; p = 0.0004). In ECs, EDN1 is dynamically upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli (Yoshizumi et al., 1990Yoshizumi M. Kurihara H. Morita T. Yamashita T. Oh-hashi Y. Sugiyama T. Takaku F. Yanagisawa M. Masaki T. Yazaki Y. Interleukin 1 increases the production of endothelin-1 by cultured endothelial cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We incubated the WT and Δ88 iPSC-derived ECs with interleukin-1α (IL-1α), a potent inflammatory stimulus that induces EDN1 expression. Stimulation with IL-1α increased EDN1 expression both in WT and Δ88 ECs at the mRNA (Figure 3D; p = 0.005) and protein levels (Figure 3E; p = 0.0004). These data demonstrate that deletion of a small region of apparent regulatory DNA at rs9349379 results in increased EDN1 expression and endothelin-1 (ET-1) protein production in ECs and to a lesser extent in VSMCs. To determine if the effect on EDN1 gene expression is specifically mediated by a genotype at rs9349379, we generated isogenic stem cell lines that were either homozygous major (A/A) or homozygous minor (G/G). Homologous recombination (HR) with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing proved to be inefficient, due to a lack of high-efficiency sgRNAs in this AT-rich region of the genome and an inability to inactivate the sgRNA once HR successfully occurred. We tested several approaches to improve the efficiency of HR, including use of multiple sgRNAs in the locus, SCR7 inhibitors (Maruyama et al., 2015Maruyama T. Dougan S.K. Truttmann M.C. Bilate A.M.

The only successful approach required two rounds of genome editing: first to generate a cell line with protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites at the SNP with HR and second to generate the allelic series (Paquet et al., 2016Paquet D. Kwart D. Chen A. Sproul A. Jacob S. Teo S. Olsen K.M. Gregg A. Noggle S. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Using this approach, 15% of clones had the appropriate genotype with no additional edits beyond the 1-bp change (Figure S4C). Three clones from each genotype (A/A and G/G) were selected for expansion and differentiation to ESC-ECs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was conducted on the six samples to identify cis- and trans-regulatory effects of rs9349379. A total of 173,259 transcripts were analyzed. We found 279 differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) transcripts, with clustering of samples according to rs9349379 genotype as expected (Figure 4B). The majority of these differentially expressed transcripts had log2 fold changes <1.5 (243/279, 87%; Figure S4D). Gene set enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed strong enrichment for blood vessel development (FDR = 1.64 × 10−10), vasculature development (FDR = 2.98 × 10−10), and blood vessel morphogenesis (FDR = 2.21 × 1"

High-affinity arrestin binding requires receptor phosphorylation, often at the receptor’s C-terminal tail.

Phosphorylation was detected at rhodopsin C-terminal tail residues T336 and S338. These two phospho-residues, together with E341, form an extensive network of electrostatic interactions with three positively charged pockets in arrestin in a mode that resembles binding of the phosphorylated vasopressin-2 receptor tail to β-arrestin-1.

Based on these observations, we derived and validated a set of phosphorylation codes that serve as a common mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of arrestins by GPCRs. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of membrane receptors that mediate transmembrane signaling through G proteins and arrestins (Pierce et al., 2002Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Seven-transmembrane receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, Shukla et al., 2011Shukla A.K. Xiao K. Lefkowitz R.J. Emerging paradigms of β-arrestin-dependent seven transmembrane receptor signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 457-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In response to stimuli, GPCRs activate G proteins to regulate the generation of second messengers, which then modulate downstream signaling effectors. To turn off the response, GPCR kinases (GRKs) are recruited to phosphorylate the GPCRs and prepare them for arrestin binding that blocks G protein-mediated signaling and directs the receptors to internalization (Pitcher et al., 1998Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. G protein-coupled receptor kinases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Upon binding to GPCRs, arrestins also serve as signaling scaffolds to initiate alternative pathways independent of G proteins. Thus, arrestin binding to receptors is a pivotal event that orchestrates the GPCR signaling network (Gurevich and Gurevich, 2013Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Structural determinants of arrestin functions.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 118: 57-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Arrestin recruitment by a GPCR is thought to be initiated by the interaction between inactive arrestin and phosphorylated receptor C-tail, which displaces arrestin’s C-tail and converts the inactive arrestin into a pre-activated state for high affinity GPCR binding (Gurevich and Gurevich, 2006bGurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. The structural basis of arrestin-mediated regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 465-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Our understanding of how arrestins are recruited by activated GPCRs has been enhanced by recent structural studies (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A.

Electron microscopy analysis of β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in complex with β-arrestin-1 revealed a dynamic equilibrium of two states: one is the fully-engaged state with arrestin bound to the central cavity of the receptor 7TM helix bundle, and the other is a partially-engaged state with arrestin bound only to the receptor C-terminal tail (Shukla et al., 2014Shukla A.K.

Oleskie A.N. et al.Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2014; 512: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of phosphorylated vasopressin-2 receptor (V2R) tail bound to β-arrestin-1 provided a basis for arrestin activation induced by the phosphorylated receptor tail and the conformation of the activated arrestin, which closely resembles the activated state of visual arrestin (Kim et al., 2013Kim Y.J. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. Scheerer P. Choe H.W. Sommer M.E.

A recent XFEL crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to activated visual arrestin revealed a near-atomic resolution interaction of arrestin with the receptor’s 7TM helix bundle (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin was unresolved in that structure. Thus, how arrestin fully engages with a phosphorylated receptor remains an unanswered fundamental question in GPCR signaling. Here, we report a structure of rhodopsin-arrestin complex with additional structural features including the phosphorylated rhodopsin C-terminal tail bound to the N-terminal domain of arrestin. The phosphorhodopsin-arrestin interface displays an extended intermolecular β sheet together with an extensive network of electrostatic interactions formed between positive residues at the N-terminal domain of arrestin and the phosphorylated C-tail of rhodopsin. These structural features were extensively validated by biochemical and biophysical experiments and computer modeling to provide a basis for understanding phosphorylation-mediated arrestin recruitment by GPCRs. The original XFEL crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin was solved by serial femtosecond crystallography (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O.

Data. 2016; 3: 160021Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using the recently released 0.6.2 version of CrystFEL (White et al., 2016White T.A. Mariani V. Brehm W. Yefanov O. Barty A. Beyerlein K.R. Chervinskii F. Galli L. Gati C. Nakane T. et al.Recent developments in CrystFEL.J. Appl. Cryst. 2016; 49: 680-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we reprocessed diffraction images of 22,462 micro-crystals collected at the CXI beamline of the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National Laboratory, which yielded 22% more reflections than those used for the original structure. The reprocessed data were of higher quality with better Pearson correlation coefficient (CC∗) and overall signal-to-noise ratio (Tables S1 and S2). The resolution of the new dataset was improved from 3.8 Å to 3.6 Å along the a∗ and b∗ axes and from 3.3 Å to 3.0 Å along the c∗ axis. The crystals were pseudo-merohedrally twinned in P212121 space group with a twin fraction of 0.5 based on L-test analysis (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The structure was refined with twin law (k, h, -l) to Rwork and Rfree of 23.4% and 27.2%, respectively, with excellent geometry (Table S3). The overall structure and the newly resolved elements are well supported by electron density maps (Figure S1). The crystal structure contains four T4 lysozyme (T4L)-rhodopsin-arrestin fusion complexes as presented in our previous model (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), denoted as A, B, C and D, respectively (Figure 1). The four rhodopsin-arrestin complexes in each asymmetric unit adopt nearly identical structures with root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of Cα atoms among four complexes between 0.5 and 0.7 Å, in agreement with the previous structure in the modeled regions (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Importantly, we observed electron density for the membrane-touching loop of arrestin (C-edge loop) from residues 340–342 (Figure S1C). Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that C-edge loops of arrestins function as membrane anchors, whose engagement with membrane is required for GPCR binding by arrestins (Lally et al., 2017Lally C.C. Bauer B. Selent J. Sommer M.E. C-edge loops of arrestin function as a membrane anchor.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14258Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also observed electron density for poly N-acetyl-D-glucosamine at the N15 glycosylation site of each rhodopsin molecule (Figure S1D) and most of the rhodopsin C-terminal tail (residues 330–343) including two phosphate groups at T336 and S338 (Figures 1, 2, S1E, and S1F). These structural elements were missing in our previous model (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), indicating that the reprocessed data have improved the structure and revealed additional structural features that are important to rhodopsin-arrestin interaction.Figure 2Interface between Rhodopsin C-Terminal Tail and Arrestin N-Terminal DomainShow full caption(A) The interface between rhodopsin C-tail and arrestin N-terminal domain with the rhodopsin C-tail covered with a 2mFo-DFc density map contoured at 1 σ.

Labeled are the rhodopsin C-tail residues involved in the charge interaction network. See also Figures S1 and S2 and Table S3. The most important new feature of the structure is the rhodopsin C-terminal tail that serves as an interface for arrestin recruitment (Figure 2). While all four complexes in the structure are similar, we focus on molecule A because it has the best electron density for phosphorylated T336 and S338, which are critical for arrestin binding (Figures 1 and 2). Of the resolved rhodopsin C-tail, the C-terminal portion from K339 to T342 adopts a β strand that forms an extended intermolecular β sheet with β strand I, from V12 to K16, of the N-terminal domain of arrestin (Figure 2). Residues N-terminal to the C-tail β strand of rhodopsin, D330–S338, form an extended stretch that interacts with arrestin and connects the β strand to helix 8 through a flexible linker region (K325–G329) that is disordered in the crystal structure. Of this region, residues D330–A333 make a turn that is positioned alongside the turn between the β strands I and II of arrestin, with its D330 and E332 electrostatically associated with R19, K167, and K168 of arrestin (Figure 2C). The conformation and position of residues D330–S335 are slightly different among the four complexes in the crystal structure, indicating the dynamic nature of this region. In contrast, the β strand (K339–T342) of the rhodopsin C-tail adopts the same structure in all four complexes (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating its stability and its role as one of the anchor points for rhodopsin-arrestin interaction. While the rhodopsin C-tail contains six serine or threonine residues, mass spectrometry analysis detected phosphate groups at S334, T336, and S338 in our protein samples (Figure S2). In our crystal structure, however, we observed the phosphate group at S338 in all four rhodopsin molecules and at T336 only in molecules A and B. The phosphate group at S334 was not observed in the structure, possibly due to a high disorder in this part of the C-terminal tail (Figure 2). The interaction between rhodopsin and arrestin is primarily maintained by the formation of the intermolecular anti-parallel β sheet between the rhodopsin C-tail β strand and β strand I of arrestin (Figures 1 and 2) and further stabilized by an extensive electrostatic interaction network between the phosphorylated T336 and S338 and the negatively charged residue E341 of rhodopsin and three positively charged pockets on the arrestin surface denoted as A, B, and C (Figure 2D). The three positively charged pockets are formed by three groups of basic residues: K16, R19, and R172 (pocket A), K16, R30, and K301 (pocket B), and K15 and K111 (pocket C), which accommodate phosphate groups at T336 and S338, and the negatively charged E341, respectively, of the rhodopsin C-tail (Figures 2B–2D). In addition, there is another electrostatic interaction interface between negatively charged rhodopsin residues D330, E332, and potentially phosphorylated S334 and a positively charged patch on arrestin formed by R19, K167, and K168 at the tips of the two β sheets of the N-terminal domain of arrestin (Figures 2B and 2D). It is interesting to note that the total number of positive charges on this arrestin N-terminal surface is nine (Figure 2C), which is equivalent to eight or ten total negative charges of the phosphate groups and acidic amino acid residues at the interface (depending on the phosphorylation of S334, detected by mass spectrometry but not observed in our crystal structure), indicating an overall electrostatic balance at this rhodopsin-arrestin interface (Figure 2D). To validate the structure of the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin in the complex, we performed double electron–electron resonance (DEER) experiments, which are widely used to determine the distances between spin-labeled residues in protein complexes (Altenbach et al., 2008Altenbach C. Kusnetzow A.K. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Hubbell W.L. High-resolution distance mapping in rhodopsin reveals the pattern of helix movement due to activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). We determined the distances from rhodopsin C-tail residues 335, 337, and 342 to arrestin residues 106 or 107, which are located at arrestin helix I. Figure 3 shows the distances from residues 335 and 337 of rhodopsin to residue 107 of arrestin (Figures 3A and 3B) and the distances between residue 342 of rhodopsin and residues 106 and 107 of arrestin (Figures 3C and 3D). These DEER distances are in agreement with those of the structural model, indicating the correct positioning of the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin in the crystal structure. We further validated the rhodopsin C-tail-arrestin interface by site-specific disulfide cross-linking through engineering cysteine pairs across the interface (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). A total of 13 cysteine mutants of arrestin together with 7 cysteine mutants of rhodopsin were expressed. A total of 63 co-expression combinations were tested and monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting, and the results are summarized in Figure S3A. Examples show that rhodopsin E332 strongly cross-linked with R19, K167, and K168 of arrestin (Figure 4A), as E332 faces toward these positively charged residues, while D331 of rhodopsin weakly cross-linked, because it faces away from the arrestin surface, with longer distances and unfavorable geometry to form crosslinking with these arrestin residues (Figure 4A). Rhodopsin residues A333, S334, and A335 cross-linked with only R19, and T336 cross-linked with both K16 and R19 of arrestin, indicating that all these residues are in close proximity to R19, while T336 is closer to K16 than A333, S334, and A335 (Figures 4B and 4C). Rhodopsin E341 cross-linked with K111 on helix I, but did not cross-link with residues on β strand I of arrestin, probably due to unfavorable geometry (Figure 4C). Collectively these cross-linking data support the positioning of the rhodopsin C-tail in the crystal structure.Figure 4Validation of the Interface between Rhodopsin C-Tail and Arrestin by Disulfide Cross-LinkingShow full captionCrystal structures showing interface residues (left), and western blots showing disulfide cross-linking data (right).

The interface revealed by the crystal structure was also confirmed by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX), which probes the dynamics of protein-protein interaction in solution (West et al., 2013West G.M.

Compared to the free pre-activated arrestin, the binding of rhodopsin protects arrestin against hydrogen-deuterium exchange in several regions (Figure S3B). Notably, the arrestin regions protected from hydrogen-deuterium exchange include the N-terminal β strands (residues 11–52 and 115–120) and helix I (residues 104–110) (Figure S3B). The protection of these structural elements in the arrestin N-domain could not be explained by our previous structure that lacks the rhodopsin C-tail (Kang et al., 2015Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W. et al.Crystal structure of rhodopsin bound to arrestin by femtosecond X-ray laser.Nature. 2015; 523: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but it is consistent with the structure we report here, in which these arrestin regions are stabilized by binding to the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin (Figure S3C). We further analyzed the conformational stability within the β sheet formed by the rhodopsin C-terminal tail and the arrestin N terminus by performing two independent, three microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Throughout both simulations, the charged interaction network connecting the phosphorylated T336 and S338 and the negatively charged E341 of rhodopsin with the positively charged arrestin residues comprising pockets A, B, and C was well maintained with average interaction frequencies upward of 80% for most crystallographic contacts (Figures 5A, 5B, and S4A). Overall, the RMSDs of pT336, pS338, and E341 generally remained within 3.0 Å of their crystallographic positions, consistent with maintenance of the interwoven ionic network, while residues D330 and S334 located N-terminally to pT336 exhibited a number of metastable states whose RMSDs reached values upward of 19 Å (Figure 5C). This differential stability of the C-tail was further characterized by the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of the C-tail alpha carbons around their average simulation positions. By defining an RMSF cut-off of 1.7 Å, both simulations suggest a key interaction range comprising C-tail residues A335–E341 (Figures 5D and 5E). Subsequent comparison of average simulation B-factors calculated from RMSF to the XFEL room temperature structure B-factors exhibits a remarkable agreement of stability within the key interactions mediated by the C-tail residues A335–E341 (Figure S4B).Figure S4Interaction Network and Range between the Rhodopsin C-Tail and Arrestin, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Detailed analysis of the bonding network between pT336, pS338 and E341 and key residues comprising arrestin’s three phosphate binding pockets for both simulations.

Phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of arrestins is a common feature for GPCRs (Lefkowitz and Shenoy, 2005Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K.

The structure of the phosphorylated rhodopsin-arrestin complex, together with the previous structure of β-arrestin-1 in complex with phosphorylated V2R C-tail peptide (Shukla et al., 2013Shukla A.K. Manglik A. Kruse A.C. Xiao K. Reis R.I. Tseng W.C. Staus D.P. Hilger D. Uysal S. Huang L.Y. et al.Structure of active β-arrestin-1 bound to a G-protein-coupled receptor phosphopeptide.Nature. 2013; 497: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), provides mechanistic insights into phosphorylation-dependent arrestin recruitment by GPCRs. Superposition of the V2R-β-arrestin-1 structure (PDB: 4JQI) with our rhodopsin-arrestin complex structure reveals a noticeable similarity between the β strand of V2R (residues 360–365) and the C-terminal β strand (residues 338–343) of rhodopsin (Figures 6A and 6B). The phosphorylated residues S357 and T360 of the V2R C-tail are nearly superposable with the phosphorylated T336 and S338 of rhodopsin C-tail (Figure 6B). In addition, the ionic interaction between the phosphorylated S363 of V2R and K107 of β-arrestin-1 is comparable to the interaction of rhodopsin E341 with K111 of visual arrestin (Figures 6B and S5A). The V2R residues N-terminal to the phosphorylated S357, however, are located differently compared to those preceeding T336 in rhodopsin. The V2R residues N-terminal to phosphorylated S357 are positioned close to a location corresponding to the middle loop and the finger loop of β-arrestin-1 (Figures 6B and S5A). As revealed by electron microscopic studies of β2AR-V2R C-tail chimeric receptor in complex with β-arrestin-1, arrestin can bind either to the central cytoplasmic cavity of the receptor TM bundle in a fully engaged state or to the receptor’s C-terminal tail in a partially tail-engaged state (Shukla et al., 2014Shukla A.K. Westfield G.H. Xiao K. Reis R.I. Huang L.Y. Tripathi-Shukla P. Qian J. Li S. Blanc A. Oleskie A.N. et al.Visualization of arrestin recruitment by a G-protein-coupled receptor.Nature. 2014; 512: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The position of those V2R residues would clash with the corresponding residues in the finger loop of visual arrestin in the fully engaged state, thus the structure of β-arrestin-1 in complex with the phosphorylated V2R C-tail likely represents a tail-engaged state, whereas the structure of the phosphorylated rhodopsin-arrestin complex represents the fully engaged state.Figure S5Receptor C-Tail-Arrestin Interfaces Are Conserved, Related to Figure 6Show full caption(A) Binding of V2R C-tail (magenta) to the β-arrestin N-terminal surface (PDB code: 4JQI).

Secretion is necessary for the delivery of antimicrobial proteins that kill pathogenic bacteria. Bel et al. show that when intestinal epithelial cells sense an invading bacterial pathogen, they “reroute” the antimicrobial protein lysozyme through an alternative autophagy-based secretion pathway (see the Perspective by Kaser and Blumberg). This ensures lysozyme delivery to the gut lumen, which protects against further bacterial invasion. Secretory autophagy was triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress and required signals from type 3 innate lymphoid cells. Thus, the innate immune response to gut pathogens co-opts autophagy in intestinal immune defense. Science , this issue p. 1047 ; see also p. 976"

https://openalex.org/W2740447116,"Interferon-α (IFNα) signaling is essential for antiviral response via induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Through a non-biased high-throughput RNAi screening of 711 known epigenetic modifiers in cellular models of IFNα-mediated inhibition of HBV replication, we identified methyltransferase SETD2 as a critical amplifier of IFNα-mediated antiviral immunity. Conditional knockout mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Setd2 exhibit enhanced HBV infection. Mechanistically, SETD2 directly mediates STAT1 methylation on lysine 525 via its methyltransferase activity, which reinforces IFN-activated STAT1 phosphorylation and antiviral cellular response. In addition, SETD2 selectively catalyzes the tri-methylation of H3K36 on promoters of some ISGs such as ISG15, leading to gene activation. Our study identifies STAT1 methylation on K525 catalyzed by the methyltransferase SETD2 as an essential signaling event for IFNα-dependent antiviral immunity and indicates potential of SETD2 in controlling viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2739980119,"Many processes can cause the same nucleotide change in a genome, making the identification of the mechanisms causing mutations a difficult challenge. Here, we show that clustered mutations provide a more precise fingerprint of mutagenic processes. Of nine clustered mutation signatures identified from >1,000 tumor genomes, three relate to variable APOBEC activity and three are associated with tobacco smoking. An additional signature matches the spectrum of translesion DNA polymerase eta (POLH). In lymphoid cells, these mutations target promoters, consistent with AID-initiated somatic hypermutation. In solid tumors, however, they are associated with UV exposure and alcohol consumption and target the H3K36me3 chromatin of active genes in a mismatch repair (MMR)-dependent manner. These regions normally have a low mutation rate because error-free MMR also targets H3K36me3 chromatin. Carcinogens and error-prone repair therefore redistribute mutations to the more important regions of the genome, contributing a substantial mutation load in many tumors, including driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2741274392,"Lin et al. find that stress-induced p38 MAPK activation leads to cytoplasmic relocation of the Hippo pathway nuclear transcription factor TEAD. TEAD relocation causes inhibition of YAP activity and suppresses YAP-driven cancer cell growth. The Hippo pathway controls organ size and tissue homeostasis, with deregulation leading to cancer. The core Hippo components in mammals are composed of the upstream serine/threonine kinases Mst1/2, MAPK4Ks and Lats1/2. Inactivation of these upstream kinases leads to dephosphorylation, stabilization, nuclear translocation and thus activation of the major functional transducers of the Hippo pathway, YAP and its paralogue TAZ1,2. YAP/TAZ are transcription co-activators that regulate gene expression primarily through interaction with the TEA domain DNA-binding family of transcription factors (TEAD)3. The current paradigm for regulation of this pathway centres on phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of YAP/TAZ through a complex network of upstream components2. However, unlike other transcription factors, such as SMAD, NF-κB, NFAT and STAT, the regulation of TEAD nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has been largely overlooked. In the present study, we show that environmental stress promotes TEAD cytoplasmic translocation via p38 MAPK in a Hippo-independent manner. Importantly, stress-induced TEAD inhibition predominates YAP-activating signals and selectively suppresses YAP-driven cancer cell growth. Our data reveal a mechanism governing TEAD nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and show that TEAD localization is a critical determinant of Hippo signalling output."

Working in yeast, Kostova et al. elucidated the role of this process. CAT-tailing is a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the degradation of partially synthesized proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2740359753,"Saliva is a key factor that contributes to the high efficiency of wound healing in the oral mucosa. This is not only attributed to physical cues but also to the presence of specific peptides in the saliva, such as histatins. Histatin-1 is a 38 aa antimicrobial peptide, highly enriched in human saliva, which has been previously reported to promote the migration of oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro However, the participation of histatin-1 in other crucial events required for wound healing, such as angiogenesis, is unknown. Here we demonstrate that histatin-1 promotes angiogenesis, as shown in vivo, using the chick chorioallantoic membrane model, and by an in vitro tube formation assay, using both human primary cultured endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the EA.hy926 cell line. Specifically, histatin-1 promoted endothelial cell adhesion and spreading onto fibronectin, as well as endothelial cell migration in the wound closure and Boyden chamber assays. These actions required the activation of the Ras and Rab interactor 2 (RIN2)/Rab5/Rac1 signaling axis, as histatin-1 increased the recruitment of RIN2, a Rab5-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to early endosomes, leading to sequential Rab5/Rac1 activation. Accordingly, interfering with either Rab5 or Rac1 activities prevented histatin-1-dependent endothelial cell migration. Finally, by immunodepletion assays, we showed that salivary histatin-1 is required for the promigratory effects of saliva on endothelial cells. In conclusion, we report that salivary histatin-1 is a novel proangiogenic factor that may contribute to oral wound healing.-Torres, P., Díaz, J., Arce, M., Silva, P., Mendoza, P., Lois, P., Molina-Berríos, A., Owen, G.

Because only the substrate specificities of the enzyme from S. mobaraensis and homologous enzymes are known, a bio-orthogonal conjugation approach (e.g. simultaneous labeling of a biomolecule using two or more different label substrates and two or more transglutaminase species) is currently not possible. This work describes the biochemistry, substrate identification, and crystal structure of an active, highly compact (26-kDa) MTG from Kutzneria albida (KalbTG) unrelated to any other MTG. The recombinant production of KalbTG in Escherichia coli in the presence of its natural inhibitor NH4+ enabled the high-throughput screening of substrate peptides via peptide array (13Forsström B. Axnäs B.B. Stengele K.P. Bühler J. Albert T.J. Richmond T.A. Hu F.J. Nilsson P. Hudson E.P. Rockberg J. Uhlen M. Proteome-wide epitope mapping of antibodies using ultra-dense peptide arrays.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2014; 13: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Specificity of this novel transglutaminase for the array-determined substrate sequences is demonstrated by efficient incorporation of labels into engineered target molecules and the poor or undetectable turnover of the enzyme with substrates recognized by conventional MTGs. The high activity and low molecular mass of KalbTG signifies a key advantage for mass production and enzymatic labeling purposes. Together, these properties make KalbTG highly attractive for a broad range of applications, including the versatile, cost-effective, and site-specific conjugation of biomolecules with various label molecules (e.g. production of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates or chemiluminescent antibodies for in vitro diagnostic purposes). Using the amino acid sequence of S. mobaraensis protein–glutamine γ-glutamyltransferase as a query, a search for homologs of this enzyme was performed. This yielded the hypothetical gene product KALB_7456 from bacteria K. albida DSM 43870, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium that was sequenced in 2014 (14Rebets Y. Tokovenko B. Lushchyk I. Rückert C. Zaburannyi N. Bechthold A. Kalinowski J. Luzhetskyy A.

Comparing the primary structures of the S. mobaraensis and K. albida gene products showed 30% similarity with a distinct conservation of active site residues (supplemental Fig. 1A), indicating that the structure and function of this enzyme may be preserved. The K. albida gene product is significantly smaller than MTG, amounting to a calculated molecular mass of 30.1 kDa and a molecular mass of 26.4 kDa in the active form. Because MTG is produced as inactive proenzyme and processed by extracellular proteases, such as dispase, to yield the 38-kDa active form (15Katsuya S. Noriki N. Masao M.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we assumed a similar activation mechanism for the hypothetical K. albida microbial transglutaminase and used the ProP 1.0 server to analyze the probability for signal and propeptide sequences in the N-terminal region of the protein (supplemental Fig. 1B). VAAPTPR↓AP was the only predicted propeptide cleavage site, which corresponds fairly well with the dispase site SAGPSFR↓AP in MTG but putatively has no dispase reactivity because Phe is a required residue in the dispase recognition motif (17Zotzel J. Pasternack R. Pelzer C. Ziegert D. Mainusch M. Fuchsbauer H.L. Activated transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis is processed by a tripeptidyl aminopeptidase in the final step.Eur. J.

Additionally, a signal peptide is predicted by the ProP 1.0 server with a high-probability cleavage site, GLPTLIA↓TT. However, this sequence bears no resemblance to the significantly longer MTG presequence or other known signal peptides. To rapidly screen expression conditions for the hypothetical transglutaminase KalbTG, we inserted the synthetic gene into multiple expression vectors designed for the soluble cytosolic or periplasmic expression in E. coli using the fragment exchange system (19Geertsma E.R. Dutzler R. A versatile and efficient high-throughput cloning tool for structural biology.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3272-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Initial screening in the 5-ml scale provided clear evidence that proteins with the anticipated electrophoretic mobility of full-length KalbTG fusions were expressed and that a fusion with tandem SlyD chaperones as described previously (20Scholz C. Schaarschmidt P. Engel A.M. Andres H. Schmitt U. Faatz E. Balbach J. Schmid F.X. Functional solubilization of aggregation-prone HIV envelope proteins by covalent fusion with chaperone modules.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) yielded the highest amount of soluble protein among all of the constructs tested (data not shown). By suppressing the toxic cross-linking activity of elevated KalbTG concentrations with the addition of ammonium salts, the production process was adaptable to a 10-liter fermenter scale. Purification by standard methods (Q-Sepharose, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) yielded several hundred mg of a highly pure enzyme preparation. The purified and activated enzyme remained stable at 4 °C and over multiple freeze–thaw cycles, with the melting point determined at 48.9 °C using dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) (supplemental Fig. 2). We confirmed that both the SlyD-fused and the mature KalbTG possess basic microbial transglutaminase activity of at least 1.65 units/mg by assaying it with the Zediras MTG-ANiTA kit (M001, compared with 4.30 units/mg by the MTG supplied with the kit and a 0.07-unit/mg blank value with BSA). Next, we searched for specific recognition motifs by assaying KalbTG with the NimbleGen peptide array technology. The turnover of the transamidation reaction between 1.4 million unique 5-mer peptides and biotinylated amine donor N-(biotinyl)cadaverine used as a substitute for a Lys substrate was quantified via fluorescence measurement of CyTM5–streptavidin binding. A control experiment with only CyTM5–streptavidin did not show any significant binding due to the fact that all potential streptavidin binders were removed from the 5-mer array design. The experiments were performed on two arrays in parallel, and the sequences of the peptides with the highest turnovers were determined (Fig. 1, A and B). The 9 best peptides were resynthesized and tested for KalbTG activity in a stand-alone glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH)-coupled assay (supplemental Table 1). The assay was specifically optimized for the analysis of potential high-affinity peptides and utilizes the ammonia released in the transglutaminase reaction as a substrate in the GLDH-catalyzed and NADH-dependent reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate (21Oteng-Pabi S.K. Keillor J.W. Continuous enzyme-coupled assay for microbial transglutaminase activity.Anal. Biochem. 2013; 441: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This confirmed YRYRQ and RYRQR as the best 5-mer substrates (KalbTG Q-tag), with turnover rates of 3.52 ± 0.08 pmol of NADH/s and 3.60 ± 0.12 pmol of NADH/s, respectively. Lys-containing substrate YKYRQ exhibited the highest rates in the GLDH assay (4.00 ± 0.18 pmol/s NADH) but showed a relatively low turnover on the peptide array. We suspect that this may be an artifact caused by Lys cross-reactivity in solution and thus omitted this motif in further analysis. Surprisingly, no activity could be detected with the well-known MTG recognition motif MLAQGS (22Kamiya N. Doi S. Tanaka Y. Ichinose H. Goto M.

Error bars, S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A second round of maturation on the array yielded APRYRQRAA as the best 9-mer substrate, which was then resynthesized as biotinylated peptide to act as acyl donor for the discovery of optimized Lys recognition motifs (KalbTG K-tag) back on the 5-mer peptide array (Fig. 1C). Again, six of the best Lys peptides from the array were resynthesized and tested in the GLDH-coupled assay, now using a peptide containing the optimized Gln recognition sequence YRYRQ as acyl donor (supplemental Table 1). The highest turnover (4.47 ± 0.16 pmol NADH/s) in the GLDH assay was observed with the sequence RYESK. Because the peptide array can deliver readout for a comprehensive set of 5-mer peptides at once, a single data set each suffices to evaluate how enzymes differ in substrate specificity. The top KalbTG Gln substrates (Fig. 2A) can thus be found in the midfield of the signal distribution on the array performed with MTG (Fig. 2B), and, vice versa, the best-performing MTG Gln substrates (Fig. 2C) exhibit only signal close to background level on the KalbTG array (Fig. 2D and supplemental Table 1). To confirm that the two transglutaminase enzymes have orthogonal Gln substrate preferences and to quantify the amount of cross-reactivity, we determined the kinetics of both enzymes in the presence of varying concentrations of Z-GGGYRYRQGGGG and Z-GGGDYALQGGGG substrate peptides (Fig. 2E). MTG exhibited similar Km values in the 0.6–0.9 mm range for both substrates, whereas kcat was significantly higher with the preferred DYALQ substrate (1.39 s−1 versus 0.93 s−1 with YRYRQ), resulting in catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of 1.64 × 103 and 1.44 × 103 m−1 s−1, respectively (Table 1). Compared with the engineered MTG enzyme from Zedira, KalbTG appears to have a lower substrate binding efficiency (Km of 2 mm) but higher turnover (kcat of 1.92 s−1), leading to kcat/Km of 0.89 × 103 m−1 s−1. KalbTG appeared to be completely unreactive toward MTG substrate Z-GGGDYALQGGGG; thus, no kinetic parameters could be determined.Table 1KalbTG/MTG cross-reactivity and kinetic parametersParametersMTG DYALQMTG YRYRQKalbTG DYALQKalbTG YRYRQVmax (pmol/s)3722NDaND, not detectable.74Km (μm)847644ND2151kcat (s−1)1.390.93ND1.92kcat/Km (m−1 s−1)16401440ND890a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Next, we applied the array and in-solution data to perform site-specific labeling on protein substrates. The molecular chaperone SlyD is an ideal scaffold for labeling approaches because epitope-containing loops can be grafted onto the FKBP-type domain, which optimally presents them to binders or enzymes (23Andres H. Duefel H. Gerg M. Kowalewsky F. Scholz C. Schraeml M. An antibody specifically binding to insulin-like growth factor-1.August 11, 2012Google Scholar). We produced a chimeric protein consisting of the Thermus thermophilus FKBP-type domain and the KalbTG recognition sequence RYRQR. Labeling with a 10-fold excess of KalbTG K-tag-Cy3 and a substrate/enzyme ratio of 72:1 afforded ∼70% yield of a labeled protein species after 15 min (Fig. 3A). This yield remained constant over a time course of 60 min. The molecular mass shift from 13 to 19 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE, corresponding exactly to the incorporation of a single 6-kDa label molecule. An identically constructed FKBP-type domain, containing the MTG sequence DYALQ instead of RYRQR, showed no incorporation of label when incubated with KalbTG (Fig. 3A), signifying that the reaction is limited to the site of the KalbTG recognition motif and that none of the five other glutamines intrinsic to the FKBP-type domain are recognized. We furthermore assayed the pH dependence of the labeling reaction at pH 6.2, 6.8, 7.4, 8.0, 8.5, and 9 (Fig. 3B). The highest labeling efficiency after 15 min was found at pH 7.4, with activity trailing off at pH ≥8.5. These findings correspond well to the published pH preferences of MTG (15Katsuya S. Noriki N. Masao M. Some characteristics of a microbial protein cross-linking enzyme: transglutaminase.in: Macromolecular Interactions in Food Technology. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C1996: 271-280Google Scholar). We used the high sequence specificity of KalbTG to conjugate a 6-kDa KalbTG K-tag-Cy3 label to the YRYRQ site of a 7-kDa substrate peptide comprising both the KalbTG and MTG Gln motifs. The reaction was run for 30 min to saturate the YRYRQ site. Analysis by SDS-PAGE confirmed that the label was integrated at a single site (Fig. 3C, lane 2). The subsequent incubation for 15 min with MTG and a 6-kDa MTG K-tag-Cy5 label in the same reaction vessel resulted in the formation of a dually labeled conjugate in high yield, with nearly all single-labeled species having visibly been converted to dually labeled (Fig. 3C, lane 3). As an example for labeling of antibodies for use in therapeutic and immunodiagnostic applications, we inserted the KalbTG Q-tag to the heavy chain C terminus of the IgG used in the Elecsys TSH electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. IgG biotinylation via KalbTG was assessed by complex formation with fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (SA-FLUO). Successful complexation (IgG-Bi–SA-FLUO and IgG-Bi–SA-FLUO–Bi-IgG) is observed as a fluorescent double peak in the elution profile of an analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4C). As a control, the same IgG modified C-terminally with the MTG Q-tag LLQGA published by Rinat-Pfizer Inc. (7Strop P. Versatility of microbial transglutaminase.Bioconjug. Chem. 2014; 25: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was biotinylated via MTG. It exhibited a similar pattern in the SA-FLUO analytics (Fig. 4A); however, compared with the KalbTG experiment, a higher excess of biotin label and higher enzyme/IgG ratio was needed to achieve this result. When incubated with KalbTG, the LLQGA-tagged IgG showed no SA-FLUO complex formation. Instead, a single absorbance peak of the unmodified IgG was observed (Fig. 4B). When further reducing the biotin label excess, it became apparent that incorporating the array-discovered KalbTG K-tag peptide in the biotin label adds another level of specificity to the reaction; IgG was almost completely covalently modified when using a 5-fold molar excess (equaling 2.5-fold excess/tagged heavy chain) of K-tag-biotin label (Fig. 4D), whereas only partial modification was observed when using a commercially available biotin-dPEG(23)-NH2 label in 5-fold excess (Fig. 4E). Presumably, a significant portion of the Q-tag glutamine side chain is hydrolyzed by the transglutaminase in the absence of a suitable amine donor. The degrees of IgG biotin modification were confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Finally, the viability of biotin-modified IgG was tested in the Elecsys TSH (sandwich) assay. The chemically biotinylated capturing antibody in the R1 compartment of the original reagent pack was replaced with the IgG biotinylated via MTG or KalbTG. Both antibodies performed comparably to the original antibody of the commercial assay (Fig. 4F). To gain further insight into how the small KalbTG sequence can fold into such an efficient MTG and whether the substrate specificity as determined by the peptide array can be explained, we determined the crystal structure of KalbTG to a resolution of 1.9 Å. Superposition of KalbTG with its next closest homolog, the MTG from S. mobaraensis (24Kashiwagi T. Yokoyama K. Ishikawa K. Ono K. Ejima D. Matsui H. Suzuki E. Crystal structure of microbial transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium mobaraense.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44252-44260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), shows a similar disc-shaped core structure (root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å) of a central β-sheet with flanking α-helices and a surface depression forming the active site cleft. However, KalbTG is more compact, having much shorter surface loops (Fig. 5A). In fact, KalbTG is the smallest MTG reported to date, even smaller by 2 kDa than the structurally unrelated Bacillus subtilis TG (25Fernandes C.G. Plácido D. Lousa D. Brito J.A. Isidro A. Soares C.M. Pohl J. Carrondo M.A. Archer M. Henriques A.O. Structural and functional characterization of an ancient bacterial transglutaminase sheds light on the minimal requirements for protein cross-linking.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 5723-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)(PDB entry 4P8I; 245 amino acids, 28.3 kDa), showing that the same degree of structural economy for MTGs can be reached by convergent evolution. Thermophilic proteins often have short surface loops, which reduce the entropy of the protein, and this property might also contribute to the high affinity of KalbTG. The catalytic Cys-Asp-His triad of KalbTG is located at the bottom of the active site groove (Fig. 5A). The groove is wide enough to be covered by a kinked helical propeptide in the unprocessed enzyme (Fig. 5B), similar to what has been observed with the S. mobaraensis MTG zymogen (26Yang M.T. Chang C.H. Wang J.M. Wu T.K. Wang Y.K. Chang C.Y. Li T.T. Crystal structure and inhibition studies of transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraense.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7301-7307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), indicating that a similar zymogenic mechanism may be present in KalbTG. Strong difference electron density extending from Cγ of the catalytic Cys-82 (supplemental Fig. 3) showed that this residue is modified by a thiol-reactive compound, the origin of which is unknown. The electron density allows tracing of four atoms, and these were tentatively modeled as a β-mercaptoethanol disulfide adduct of Cys-82. The isosteric cysteamine or a larger compound that is disordered beyond the fourth atom cannot be excluded. A modified Cys in the active site of MTGs is also apparent when inspecting the electron density maps for Cys-110 in S. mobaraensis (PDB entry 3IU0), Cys-116 in B. subtilis (PDB entry 4PA5; modeled as cysteamine adduct in chain A), and Cys-302 in Streptococcus suis (PDB entry 4XZ7; adduct not modeled for one molecule in the asymmetric unit and as a string of wat"

However, progress toward higher resolution is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the photons on resonance, with the remainder contributing to an off-resonant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical motion of a resonant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-resonant spectral intensity onto the resonance. As a consequence, the resonant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-resonant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray resonances."

In the current study we investigate the role of the matricellular protein, transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI), which is induced in various forms of heart disease. Additionally, we sought to understand whether TGFBI is functionally redundant to its closely related family member periostin, which is also induced in the diseased heart. Surgical models of myocardial infarction and cardiac pressure overload were used in mice with genetic loss of Postn and/or Tgfbi to examine the roles of these genes during the fibrotic response. Additionally, cardiac-specific TGFBI transgenic mice were generated and analyzed. We observed that deletion of Tgfbi did not alter cardiac disease after myocardial infarction in contrast to greater ventricular wall rupture in Postn gene-deleted mice. Moreover, Tgfbi and Postn double gene-deleted mice showed a similar post-myocardial infarction disease phenotype as Postn-deleted mice. Over-expression of TGFBI in the hearts of mice had a similar effect as previously shown in mice with periostin over-expression. Thus, TGFBI and periostin act similarly in the heart in affecting fibrosis and disease responsiveness, although TGFBI is not seemingly necessary in the heart after myocardial infarction injury and is fully compensated by the more prominently expressed effector periostin."

To identify the potential transcriptional effects that mediate this susceptibility, we have performed RNA sequencing analysis on adult hearts from mice that were exposed to diesel exhaust in utero and that have subsequently undergone transverse aortic constriction. We identified 3 target genes, Mir133a-2, Ptprf, and Pamr1, which demonstrate dysregulation after exposure and aortic constriction. Examination of expression patterns in human heart tissues indicates a correlation between expression and heart failure. We subsequently assessed DNA methylation modifications at these candidate loci in neonatal cultured cardiac myocytes after in utero exposure to diesel exhaust and found that the promoter for Mir133a-2 is differentially methylated. These target genes in the heart are the first genes to be identified that likely play an important role in mediating adult sensitivity to heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2741177865,"India's dependence on a climate sensitive sector like agriculture makes it highly vulnerable to its impacts. However, agriculture is highly heterogeneous across the country owing to regional disparities in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It is essential to know and quantify the possible impacts of changes in climate on crop yield for successful agricultural management and planning at a local scale. The Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM-ES) was employed to generate regional climate projections for the study area using the Regional Climate Model (RCM) RegCM4.4. The dynamics in potential impacts at the sub-district level were evaluated using the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCPs). The aim of this study was to simulate the crop yield under a plausible change in climate for the coastal areas of South India through the end of this century. The crop simulation model, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 4.5, was used to understand the plausible impacts on the major crop yields of rice, groundnuts, and sugarcane under the RCP 4.5 trajectory. The findings reveal that under the RCP 4.5 scenario there will be decreases in the major C3 and C4 crop yields in the study area. This would affect not only the local food security, but the livelihood security as well. This necessitates timely planning to achieve sustainable crop productivity and livelihood security.

https://openalex.org/W2741734206,"Background Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and considered the third most prevalent mycobacterial disease in humans. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus, understanding the diversity of bacteria, termed the microbiome, in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. However, adequately studying the human microbiome in a clinical setting can prove difficult when investigating a neglected tropical skin disease due to its rarity and the setting. Methodology/Principal findings Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples. Although no significant differences in diversity were found between BU and non-BU lesions, the former were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds and the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes. With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria that were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests that BU may lead to changes in the skin bacterial community within the lesions. However, in order to determine if such changes hold true across all BU cases and are either a cause or consequence of a specific wound environment, further microbiome studies are necessary. Such skin microbiome analysis requires large sample sizes and lesions from the same body site in many patients, both of which can be difficult for a rare disease. Our study proposes a pipeline for such studies and highlights several drawbacks that must be considered if microbiome analysis is to be utilized for neglected tropical diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2742129564,"The present study aims to experimentally investigate heat transfer performance of rectangular and semicircular tubes in the presence of Ag / water nanofluids. The nanoparticles of Ag (silver) were used in seven different volume concentrations of 0.03%, 0.07%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 1% and 2%. The experiment was conducted in relatively low Reynolds numbers of 301 to 740. A heater with the power of 200 W was used to keep the outer surface of the tubes under a constant heat flux condition. In addition, the rectangular tube has been designed within the same length as the semicircular one and also within the same hydraulic diameter. Moreover, the average nanoparticles size was 20 nm. The outcome results of the present empirical work indicate that, for all the examined Reynolds numbers, the semicircular tube has higher convective heat transfer coefficient for all the utilized volume concentrations of Ag nanoparticles. The possible reasons behind this advantage are discussed through the present work mainly by taking the boundary effect on Brownian motions into account. Coming to this point that the conventional design for cooling system of photovoltaic cells is a heat sink with the rectangular graves, it is discussed that using a semicircular design may have the advantage over the rectangular one in convective heat transfer coefficient enhancement and hence a better cooling performance for these solar cells."

https://openalex.org/W2739892912,"The prediction of gene functions is crucial for a large number of different life science areas. Faster high throughput sequencing techniques generate more and larger datasets. The manual annotation by classical wet-lab experiments is not suitable for these large amounts of data. We showed earlier that the automatic sequence pattern-based BrEPS protocol, based on manually curated sequences, can be used for the prediction of enzymatic functions of genes. The growing sequence databases provide the opportunity for more reliable patterns, but are also a challenge for the implementation of automatic protocols. We reimplemented and optimized the BrEPS pattern generation to be applicable for larger datasets in an acceptable timescale. Primary improvement of the new BrEPS protocol is the enhanced data selection step. Manually curated annotations from Swiss-Prot are used as reliable source for function prediction of enzymes observed on protein level. The pool of sequences is extended by highly similar sequences from TrEMBL and SwissProt. This allows us to restrict the selection of Swiss-Prot entries, without losing the diversity of sequences needed to generate significant patterns. Additionally, a supporting pattern type was introduced by extending the patterns at semi-conserved positions with highly similar amino acids. Extended patterns have an increased complexity, increasing the chance to match more sequences, without losing the essential structural information of the pattern. To enhance the usability of the database, we introduced enzyme function prediction based on consensus EC numbers and IUBMB enzyme nomenclature. BrEPS is part of the Braunschweig Enzyme Database (BRENDA) and is available on a completely redesigned website and as download. The database can be downloaded and used with the BrEPScmd command line tool for large scale sequence analysis. The BrEPS website and downloads for the database creation tool, command line tool and database are freely accessible at http://breps.tu-bs.de."

Removal of sub-TAD CTCF sites adjacent to the α-globin enhancers is now shown to result in inappropriate activation of neighbouring genes. Intra-TAD enhancer insulation might be broadly important for tissue specificity of enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2740137483,"Although it is not yet possible to replace in vivo animal testing completely, the need for a more efficient method for toxicity testing, such as an in vitro cell-based assay, has been widely acknowledged. Previous studies have focused on mRNAs as biomarkers; however, recent studies have revealed that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are also efficient novel biomarkers for toxicity testing. Here, we used deep sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) to identify novel RNA biomarkers, including ncRNAs, that exhibited a substantial response to general chemical toxicity from nine chemicals, and to benzene toxicity specifically. The nine chemicals are listed in the Japan Pollutant Release and Transfer Register as class I designated chemical substances. We used undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as a simplified cell-based toxicity assay. RNA-seq revealed that many mRNAs and ncRNAs responded substantially to the chemical compounds in mESCs. This finding indicates that ncRNAs can be used as novel RNA biomarkers for chemical safety screening."

Now, his latest venture aims to monitor and predict health and disease to promote scientific through a variety of measurements in a proposed 100,000-person wellness project: whole genome sequences; blood, saliva, urine, and stool samples taken every 3 months to measure hundreds of proteins and metabolites; and physical activity and sleep monitoring. A recently published study of Hood9s 108-person pilot project collecting these data discovered something wrong in nearly every participant, such as low vitamin D levels or prediabetes. Monthly coaching helped improve some people9s health during the study, prompting Hood to help launch a company called Arivale, which offers similar tracking, analysis, and coaching for a first-year subscription fee of $3499. But several doctors and scientists are unimpressed with the results. Some argue that standard medical checkups could detect many of health issues identified in the study, and others say it is simply too early to know how these data should be used clinically."

https://openalex.org/W2739644990,"Large conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels are essential regulators of membrane excitability in a wide variety of cells and tissues. An important mechanism of modulation of BKCa channel activity is its association with auxiliary subunits. In smooth muscle cells, the most predominant regulatory subunit of BKCa channels is the β1-subunit. We have previously described that BKCa channels with distinctive N-terminal ends (starting with the amino acid sequence MDAL, MSSN or MANG) are differentially modulated by the β1-subunit, but not by the β2. Here we extended our studies to understand how the distinct N-terminal regions differentially modulate channel activity by β-subunits. We recorded inside-out single-channel currents from HEK293T cells co-expressing the BKCa containing three N-terminal sequences with two β1-β2 chimeric constructs containing the extracellular loop of β1 or β2, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of β2 or β1, respectively. Both β chimeric constructs induced leftward shifts of voltage-activation curves of channels starting with MANG and MDAL, in the presence of 10 or 100 μM intracellular Ca2+. However, MSSN showed no shift of the voltage-activation, at the same Ca2+ concentrations. The presence of the extracellular loop of β1 in the chimera resembled results seen with the full β1 subunit, suggesting that the extracellular region of β1 might be responsible for the lack of modulation observed in MSSN. We further studied a poly-serine stretch present in the N-terminal region of MSSN and observed that the voltage-activation curves of BKCa channels either containing or lacking this poly-serine stretch were leftward shifted by β1-subunit in a similar way. Overall, our results provide further insights into the mechanism of modulation of the different N-terminal regions of the BKCa channel by β-subunits and highlight the extension of this region of the channel as a form of modulation of channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2739844268,"Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the standard of care for Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias. However the eradication of leukemia initiating cells remains a challenge. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the cytokine microenvironment may play a role in BCR-ABL mediated leukemogenesis and in imatinib resistance. Gene expression analyses of BCR-ABL positive ALL long-term cultured cells revealed strong reduction of SOCS mRNA expression after imatinib treatment, thereby demonstrating a strong inhibition of cytokine signaling. In this study we employed SOCS1-a strong inhibitor of cytokine signaling-as a tool to terminate external cytokine signals in BCR-ABL transformed cells in vitro and in vivo. In colony formation assays with primary bone marrow cells, expression of SOCS1 decreased colony numbers under pro-proliferative cytokines, while it conferred growth resistance to anti-proliferative cytokines. Importantly, co-expression of SOCS1 with BCR-ABL led to the development of a MPD phenotype with a prolonged disease latency compared to BCR-ABL alone in a murine bone marrow transplantation model. Interestingly, SOCS1 co-expression protected 20% of mice from MPD development. In summary, we conclude that under pro-proliferative cytokine stimulation at the onset of myeloproliferative diseases SOCS1 acts as a tumor suppressor, while under anti-proliferative conditions it exerts oncogenic function. Therefore SOCS1 can promote opposing functions depending on the cytokine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2740577413,"The head of France9s National Research Agency (ANR), the country9s main science funding body, suddenly stepped down last week after more than year of power struggles within the agency, which had led to the dismissal of staff scientists and resignations by members of evaluation panels. Michael Matlosz, U.S.-born chemical engineer who headed ANR since 2014, handed in his letter of resignation on 18 July, according to statement from France9s research ministry, which oversees ANR. The statement offered little explanation but said Matlosz agreed that the agency needed a new impetus. Matlosz, who did not respond to questions from Science, has now been asked to write report on public funding mechanisms in France."
https://openalex.org/W2741161050,"Science funding agencies are under pressure. The number of grant applications is going up in almost every country and field, whereas budgets are mostly flat or shrinking. That means reviewers and agency staff are spending more time on reviewing grants, while success rates are dropping to demoralizing lows. At a meeting in Amsterdam in late June, representatives of funding agencies commiserated and explored new ways to reduce application pressure and reviewer fatigue, while safeguarding or improving the quality of reviews. They agreed that funders could benefit from research into their own practices—which has been rare until now—and resolved to collaborate and share their experiences on an online platform."
https://openalex.org/W2741317577,"A moment of truth has arrived for a grand experiment to create a world-class research university in the Andes. Last month, Yachay Tech University, a nascent institution in rural northern Ecuador backed with an estimated $1 billion in government funding, fired six scientists in leadership positions, including Chancellor Catherine Rigsby, a geologist recruited from East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. Ecuador9s struggling economy may have played some role; Yachay Tech in a statement said that the terminations were part of an austerity plan meant to trim $2 million in expenses. But the ousted academics say they are victims of shifting national priorities and a personality conflict with Yachay Tech9s new rector, the university9s top position."
