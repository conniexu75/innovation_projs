https://openalex.org/W4290989128,"Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide1. Although advances have been made in acute treatment, an incomplete understanding of remodelling processes has limited the effectiveness of therapies to reduce late-stage mortality2. Here we generate an integrative high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction using single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic profiling of multiple physiological zones at distinct time points in myocardium from patients with myocardial infarction and controls. Multi-modal data integration enabled us to evaluate cardiac cell-type compositions at increased resolution, yielding insights into changes of the cardiac transcriptome and epigenome through the identification of distinct tissue structures of injury, repair and remodelling. We identified and validated disease-specific cardiac cell states of major cell types and analysed them in their spatial context, evaluating their dependency on other cell types. Our data elucidate the molecular principles of human myocardial tissue organization, recapitulating a gradual cardiomyocyte and myeloid continuum following ischaemic injury. In sum, our study provides an integrative molecular map of human myocardial infarction, represents an essential reference for the field and paves the way for advanced mechanistic and therapeutic studies of cardiac disease. A time-resolved high-resolution map of human cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction, integrating single-cell transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility and spatial transcriptomic data, provides a valuable resource for the field."
https://openalex.org/W4224263489,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) permits comprehensive cancer genome analyses, revealing mutational signatures, imprints of DNA damage, and repair processes that have arisen in each patient’s cancer. We performed mutational signature analyses on 12,222 whole-genome–sequenced tumor-normal matched pairs from patients recruited via the UK National Health Service (NHS). We contrasted our results with two independent cancer WGS datasets—from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and the Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF)—involving 18,640 whole-genome–sequenced cancers in total. Our analyses add 40 single and 18 double substitution signatures to the current mutational signature tally. We show for each organ that cancers have a limited number of common signatures and a long tail of rare signatures, and we provide a practical solution for applying this concept of common versus rare signatures to future analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4291019543,"Abstract Defining the transition from benign to malignant tissue is fundamental to improving early diagnosis of cancer 1 . Here we use a systematic approach to study spatial genome integrity in situ and describe previously unidentified clonal relationships. We used spatially resolved transcriptomics 2 to infer spatial copy number variations in &gt;120,000 regions across multiple organs, in benign and malignant tissues. We demonstrate that genome-wide copy number variation reveals distinct clonal patterns within tumours and in nearby benign tissue using an organ-wide approach focused on the prostate. Our results suggest a model for how genomic instability arises in histologically benign tissue that may represent early events in cancer evolution. We highlight the power of capturing the molecular and spatial continuums in a tissue context and challenge the rationale for treatment paradigms, including focal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4290997217,"Soft magnetic materials (SMMs) serve in electrical applications and sustainable energy supply, allowing magnetic flux variation in response to changes in applied magnetic field, at low energy loss1. The electrification of transport, households and manufacturing leads to an increase in energy consumption owing to hysteresis losses2. Therefore, minimizing coercivity, which scales these losses, is crucial3. Yet meeting this target alone is not enough: SMMs in electrical engines must withstand severe mechanical loads; that is, the alloys need high strength and ductility4. This is a fundamental design challenge, as most methods that enhance strength introduce stress fields that can pin magnetic domains, thus increasing coercivity and hysteresis losses5. Here we introduce an approach to overcome this dilemma. We have designed a Fe-Co-Ni-Ta-Al multicomponent alloy (MCA) with ferromagnetic matrix and paramagnetic coherent nanoparticles (about 91 nm in size and around 55% volume fraction). They impede dislocation motion, enhancing strength and ductility. Their small size, low coherency stress and small magnetostatic energy create an interaction volume below the magnetic domain wall width, leading to minimal domain wall pinning, thus maintaining the soft magnetic properties. The alloy has a tensile strength of 1,336 MPa at 54% tensile elongation, extremely low coercivity of 78 A m-1 (less than 1 Oe), moderate saturation magnetization of 100 A m2 kg-1 and high electrical resistivity of 103 μΩ cm."
https://openalex.org/W4291020693,"Cyclic nucleotide signalling is a key component of antiviral defence in all domains of life. Viral detection activates a nucleotide cyclase to generate a second messenger, resulting in activation of effector proteins. This is exemplified by the metazoan cGAS-STING innate immunity pathway1, which originated in bacteria2. These defence systems require a sensor domain to bind the cyclic nucleotide and are often coupled with an effector domain that, when activated, causes cell death by destroying essential biomolecules3. One example is the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which degrades the essential cofactor NAD+ when activated in response to infection in plants and bacteria2,4,5 or during programmed nerve cell death6. Here we show that a bacterial antiviral defence system generates a cyclic tri-adenylate that binds to a TIR-SAVED effector, acting as the 'glue' to allow assembly of an extended superhelical solenoid structure. Adjacent TIR subunits interact to organize and complete a composite active site, allowing NAD+ degradation. Activation requires extended filament formation, both in vitro and in vivo. Our study highlights an example of large-scale molecular assembly controlled by cyclic nucleotides and reveals key details of the mechanism of TIR enzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W4291020837,"Compared with their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, low-dimensional metal halide perovskites (2D and quasi-2D; B2An−1MnX3n+1, such as B = R-NH3+, A = HC(NH2)2+, Cs+; M = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−) with periodic inorganic–organic structures have shown promising stability and hysteresis-free electrical performance1–6. However, their unique multiple-quantum-well structure limits the device efficiencies because of the grain boundaries and randomly oriented quantum wells in polycrystals7. In single crystals, the carrier transport through the thickness direction is hindered by the layered insulating organic spacers8. Furthermore, the strong quantum confinement from the organic spacers limits the generation and transport of free carriers9,10. Also, lead-free metal halide perovskites have been developed but their device performance is limited by their low crystallinity and structural instability11. Here we report a low-dimensional metal halide perovskite BA2MAn−1SnnI3n+1 (BA, butylammonium; MA, methylammonium; n = 1, 3, 5) superlattice by chemical epitaxy. The inorganic slabs are aligned vertical to the substrate and interconnected in a criss-cross 2D network parallel to the substrate, leading to efficient carrier transport in three dimensions. A lattice-mismatched substrate compresses the organic spacers, which weakens the quantum confinement. The performance of a superlattice solar cell has been certified under the quasi-steady state, showing a stable 12.36% photoelectric conversion efficiency. Moreover, an intraband exciton relaxation process may have yielded an unusually high open-circuit voltage (VOC). Fabrication of a low-dimensional metal halide perovskite superlattice by chemical epitaxy is reported, with a criss-cross two-dimensional network parallel to the substrate, leading to efficient carrier transport in three dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W4292027119,"The productivity of rainforests growing on highly weathered tropical soils is expected to be limited by phosphorus availability1. Yet, controlled fertilization experiments have been unable to demonstrate a dominant role for phosphorus in controlling tropical forest net primary productivity. Recent syntheses have demonstrated that responses to nitrogen addition are as large as to phosphorus2, and adaptations to low phosphorus availability appear to enable net primary productivity to be maintained across major soil phosphorus gradients3. Thus, the extent to which phosphorus availability limits tropical forest productivity is highly uncertain. The majority of the Amazonia, however, is characterized by soils that are more depleted in phosphorus than those in which most tropical fertilization experiments have taken place2. Thus, we established a phosphorus, nitrogen and base cation addition experiment in an old growth Amazon rainforest, with a low soil phosphorus content that is representative of approximately 60% of the Amazon basin. Here we show that net primary productivity increased exclusively with phosphorus addition. After 2 years, strong responses were observed in fine root (+29%) and canopy productivity (+19%), but not stem growth. The direct evidence of phosphorus limitation of net primary productivity suggests that phosphorus availability may restrict Amazon forest responses to CO2 fertilization4, with major implications for future carbon sequestration and forest resilience to climate change."

https://openalex.org/W4291020776,"In many disciplines, states that emerge in open systems far from equilibrium are determined by a few global parameters1,2. These states can often mimic thermodynamic equilibrium, a classic example being the oscillation threshold of a laser3 that resembles a phase transition in condensed matter. However, many classes of states cannot form spontaneously in dissipative systems, and this is the case for cavity solitons2 that generally need to be induced by external perturbations, as in the case of optical memories4,5. In the past decade, these highly localized states have enabled important advancements in microresonator-based optical frequency combs6,7. However, the very advantages that make cavity solitons attractive for memories-their inability to form spontaneously from noise-have created fundamental challenges. As sources, microcombs require spontaneous and reliable initiation into a desired state that is intrinsically robust8-20. Here we show that the slow non-linearities of a free-running microresonator-filtered fibre laser21 can transform temporal cavity solitons into the system's dominant attractor. This phenomenon leads to reliable self-starting oscillation of microcavity solitons that are naturally robust to perturbations, recovering spontaneously even after complete disruption. These emerge repeatably and controllably into a large region of the global system parameter space in which specific states, highly stable over long timeframes, can be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W4291020684,"Divergent density of states offers the unique opportunity to explore a wide variety of correlated electron physics. In the thinnest limit, this has been predicted and verified in the ultra-flat bands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, the band touching points of few-layer rhombohedral graphite, and the lightly doped rhombohedral trilayer graphene. The simpler and seemingly better understood Bernal bilayer graphene is also susceptible to orbital magnetism-driven phases at charge neutrality, such as layer antiferromagnet and quantum anomalous Hall octet. Here we report the discovery of a cascade of novel correlated phases in the vicinity of electric-field-controlled Lifshitz transitions and van Hove singularities in trigonally warped bilayer graphene. We provide compelling evidence for the observation of Stoner ferromagnets - half and quarter metals. More prominently, we identify signatures consistent with a topologically nontrivial Wigner-Hall crystal at zero magnetic field and its transition to a trivial Wigner crystal, as well as two correlated metals whose behavior deviates from standard Fermi liquids. Our results in this reproducible, tunable, simple system opens a new chapter for studying strongly correlated electrons."
https://openalex.org/W4290989173,"The lymphocyte genome is prone to many threats, including programmed mutation during differentiation1, antigen-driven proliferation and residency in diverse microenvironments. Here, after developing protocols for expansion of single-cell lymphocyte cultures, we sequenced whole genomes from 717 normal naive and memory B and T cells and haematopoietic stem cells. All lymphocyte subsets carried more point mutations and structural variants than haematopoietic stem cells, with higher burdens in memory cells than in naive cells, and with T cells accumulating mutations at a higher rate throughout life. Off-target effects of immunological diversification accounted for approximately half of the additional differentiation-associated mutations in lymphocytes. Memory B cells acquired, on average, 18 off-target mutations genome-wide for every on-target IGHV mutation during the germinal centre reaction. Structural variation was 16-fold higher in lymphocytes than in stem cells, with around 15% of deletions being attributable to off-target recombinase-activating gene activity. DNA damage from ultraviolet light exposure and other sporadic mutational processes generated hundreds to thousands of mutations in some memory cells. The mutation burden and signatures of normal B cells were broadly similar to those seen in many B-cell cancers, suggesting that malignant transformation of lymphocytes arises from the same mutational processes that are active across normal ontogeny. The mutational landscape of normal lymphocytes chronicles the off-target effects of programmed genome engineering during immunological diversification and the consequences of differentiation, proliferation and residency in diverse microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W4292027215,"As the climate changes, warmer spring temperatures are causing earlier leaf-out1–3 and commencement of CO2 uptake1,3 in temperate deciduous forests, resulting in a tendency towards increased growing season length3 and annual CO2 uptake1,3–7. However, less is known about how spring temperatures affect tree stem growth8,9, which sequesters carbon in wood that has a long residence time in the ecosystem10,11. Here we show that warmer spring temperatures shifted stem diameter growth of deciduous trees earlier but had no consistent effect on peak growing season length, maximum growth rates, or annual growth, using dendrometer band measurements from 440 trees across two forests. The latter finding was confirmed on the centennial scale by 207 tree-ring chronologies from 108 forests across eastern North America, where annual ring width was far more sensitive to temperatures during the peak growing season than in the spring. These findings imply that any extra CO2 uptake in years with warmer spring temperatures4,5 does not significantly contribute to increased sequestration in long-lived woody stem biomass. Rather, contradicting projections from global carbon cycle models1,12, our empirical results imply that warming spring temperatures are unlikely to increase woody productivity enough to strengthen the long-term CO2 sink of temperate deciduous forests. Warmer spring temperatures affect the timing of stem diameter growth of temperate deciduous trees but have little effect on annual growth."
https://openalex.org/W4291020412,"Abstract Somatic hotspot mutations and structural amplifications and fusions that affect fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (encoded by FGFR2 ) occur in multiple types of cancer 1 . However, clinical responses to FGFR inhibitors have remained variable 1–9 , emphasizing the need to better understand which FGFR2 alterations are oncogenic and therapeutically targetable. Here we apply transposon-based screening 10,11 and tumour modelling in mice 12,13 , and find that the truncation of exon 18 (E18) of Fgfr2 is a potent driver mutation. Human oncogenomic datasets revealed a diverse set of FGFR2 alterations, including rearrangements, E1–E17 partial amplifications, and E18 nonsense and frameshift mutations, each causing the transcription of E18-truncated FGFR2 ( FGFR2 ΔE18 ). Functional in vitro and in vivo examination of a compendium of FGFR2 ΔE18 and full-length variants pinpointed FGFR2 -E18 truncation as single-driver alteration in cancer. By contrast, the oncogenic competence of FGFR2 full-length amplifications depended on a distinct landscape of cooperating driver genes. This suggests that genomic alterations that generate stable FGFR2 ΔE18 variants are actionable therapeutic targets, which we confirmed in preclinical mouse and human tumour models, and in a clinical trial. We propose that cancers containing any FGFR2 variant with a truncated E18 should be considered for FGFR-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4290988925,"Abstract Unprecedented modern rates of warming are expected to advance boreal forest into Arctic tundra 1 , thereby reducing albedo 2–4 , altering carbon cycling 4 and further changing climate 1–4 , yet the patterns and processes of this biome shift remain unclear 5 . Climate warming, required for previous boreal advances 6–17 , is not sufficient by itself for modern range expansion of conifers forming forest–tundra ecotones 5,12–15,17–20 . No high-latitude population of conifers, the dominant North American Arctic treeline taxon, has previously been documented 5 advancing at rates following the last glacial maximum (LGM) 6–8 . Here we describe a population of white spruce ( Picea glauca ) advancing at post-LGM rates 7 across an Arctic basin distant from established treelines and provide evidence of mechanisms sustaining the advance. The population doubles each decade, with exponential radial growth in the main stems of individual trees correlating positively with July air temperature. Lateral branches in adults and terminal leaders in large juveniles grow almost twice as fast as those at established treelines. We conclude that surpassing temperature thresholds 1,6–17 , together with winter winds facilitating long-distance dispersal, deeper snowpack and increased soil nutrient availability promoting recruitment and growth, provides sufficient conditions for boreal forest advance. These observations enable forecast modelling with important insights into the environmental conditions converting tundra into forest."

The evolution of sufficiently descriptive genetic toolkits probably triggered the explosion of complex multicellular life and patterning 3,4 . Synthetic biology aims to engineer multicellular systems for practical applications and to serve as a build-to-understand methodology for natural systems 5–8 . However, our ability to engineer multicellular interface patterns 2,9 is still very limited, as synthetic cell–cell adhesion toolkits and suitable patterning algorithms are underdeveloped 5,7,10–13 . Here we introduce a synthetic cell–cell adhesin logic with swarming bacteria and establish the precise engineering, predictive modelling and algorithmic programming of multicellular interface patterns. We demonstrate interface generation through a swarming adhesion mechanism, quantitative control over interface geometry and adhesion-mediated analogues of developmental organizers and morphogen fields. Using tiling and four-colour-mapping concepts, we identify algorithms for creating universal target patterns. This synthetic 4-bit adhesion logic advances practical applications such as human-readable molecular diagnostics, spatial fluid control on biological surfaces and programmable self-growing materials 5–8,14 .

https://openalex.org/W4291020429,"Topological gauge theories describe the low-energy properties of certain strongly correlated quantum systems through effective weakly interacting models1,2. A prime example is the Chern–Simons theory of fractional quantum Hall states, where anyonic excitations emerge from the coupling between weakly interacting matter particles and a density-dependent gauge field3. Although in traditional solid-state platforms such gauge theories are only convenient theoretical constructions, engineered quantum systems enable their direct implementation and provide a fertile playground to investigate their phenomenology without the need for strong interactions4. Here, we report the quantum simulation of a topological gauge theory by realizing a one-dimensional reduction of the Chern–Simons theory (the chiral BF theory5–7) in a Bose–Einstein condensate. Using the local conservation laws of the theory, we eliminate the gauge degrees of freedom in favour of chiral matter interactions8–11, which we engineer by synthesizing optically dressed atomic states with momentum-dependent scattering properties. This allows us to reveal the key properties of the chiral BF theory: the formation of chiral solitons and the emergence of an electric field generated by the system itself. Our results expand the scope of quantum simulation to topological gauge theories and open a route to the implementation of analogous gauge theories in higher dimensions12. An optically coupled Bose–Einstein condensate of potassium atoms is used to engineer chiral interactions and perform the quantum simulation of a one-dimensional reduction of the topological Chern–Simons gauge theory."

https://openalex.org/W4291282656,"Watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus ) is one of the most popular fruit crops. However, Fusarium wilt (FW) is a serious soil-borne disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON) that severely limits the development of the watermelon industry. Trichoderma spp. is an important plant anti-pathogen biocontrol agent. The results of our previous study indicated that Trichoderma asperellum M45a ( T . asperellum M45a) could control FW by enhancing the relative abundance of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the rhizosphere of watermelon. However, there are few studies on its mechanism in the pathogen resistance of watermelon. Therefore, transcriptome sequencing of T . asperellum M45a-treated watermelon roots combined with metabolome sequencing of the rhizosphere soil was performed with greenhouse pot experiments. The results demonstrated that T . asperellum M45a could stably colonize roots and significantly increase the resistance-related enzymatic activities (e.g., lignin, cinnamic acid, peroxidase and peroxidase ) of watermelon. Moreover, the expression of defense-related genes such as MYB and PAL in watermelon roots significantly improved with the inoculation of T . asperellum M45a. In addition, KEGG pathway analysis showed that a large number of differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in phenylpropane metabolic pathways, which may be related to lignin and cinnamic acid synthesis, thus further inducing the immune response to resist FON. Furthermore, metabolic analysis indicated that four differential metabolic pathways were enriched in M45a-treated soil, including six upregulated compounds and one down-regulated compound. Among them, galactinol and urea were significantly positively correlated with Trichoderma . Hence, this study provides insight into the biocontrol mechanism of T . asperellum M45a to resist soil-borne diseases, which can guide its industrial application."
https://openalex.org/W4291007612,"Objective The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of deliberative vs. intuitive thinking styles on forensic judgments of legal professionals. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) that low deliberative thinking would be related to judgmental biases (b) that lawyers would report a greater tendency and preference toward deliberative thinking in comparison to students and make more rational judgments. Method Ninety-one lawyers and 120 undergraduate students, who served as controls, were asked to read a criminal case depicting sexual harassment (SH) and judge victim and offender blame, whether the case constitutes SH, and the damage for the victim. Results Deliberative thinking of lawyers was higher than students, and higher than their intuitive thinking style, supporting the more rational blame attributions of the former. In addition, higher deliberative thinking was related to a stronger perception of the event as SH. Nevertheless, all the participants were more inclined to perceive the case as SH when the victim was a woman instead of a man. Conclusions The results suggest that gender stereotypes and bias may persist despite high deliberative thinking and may even be manifested through deliberative thinking processes. Awareness of legal professionals of these biases as well as the development of more objective tools which will help make the judging process less subjective—will ensure more accurate assessment of victims, offenders, and cases."

The MANA Dashboard includes 31 indicators across four different domains such as leadership and governance; preventative policies and legislations; health system response programs; and monitoring This progress assessment was conducted between 2019 and 2020 for all 21 PICTs. The data were analyzed and compared with the baseline status (2018) report and presented across four different domains of the MANA dashboard.This progress assessment found that PICTs overall have made advancements in a number of areas, particularly the establishment of a national multi-sectoral NCD taskforce; implementation of referenced approaches to restrict trans-fat in the food supply in national documents; and fiscal measures to affect access and availability to less healthy foods and drinks. However, the strengths of actions varied across PICTs, and most are categorised as low strengths. Measures which had the most limited progress in implementation include policy and legislation that restrict alcohol advertising; tobacco industry interference; marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children; and marketing for breast milk substitutes.This progress assessment further highlights that while PICTs continue to make progress, NCD policy and legislation gaps still exist, both in terms of weaknesses of existing measures and areas that have had little attention to-date. These require urgent actions to scale up NCD related policies and legislation at regional and national level."
https://openalex.org/W4291019041,"Particle accelerators and storage rings have been transformative instruments of discovery, and, for many applications, innovations in particle-beam cooling have been a principal driver of that success1. Stochastic cooling (SC), one of the most important conceptual and technological advances in this area2-6, cools a beam through granular sampling and correction of its phase-space structure, thus bearing resemblance to a 'Maxwell's demon'. The extension of SC from the microwave regime up to optical frequencies and bandwidths has long been pursued, as it could increase the achievable cooling rates by three to four orders of magnitude and provide a powerful tool for future accelerators. First proposed nearly 30 years ago, optical stochastic cooling (OSC) replaces the conventional microwave elements of SC with optical-frequency analogues and is, in principle, compatible with any species of charged-particle beam7,8. Here we describe a demonstration of OSC in a proof-of-principle experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory's Integrable Optics Test Accelerator9,10. The experiment used 100-MeV electrons and a non-amplified configuration of OSC with a radiation wavelength of 950 nm, and achieved strong, simultaneous cooling of the beam in all degrees of freedom. This realization of SC at optical frequencies serves as a foundation for more advanced experiments with high-gain optical amplification, and advances opportunities for future operational OSC systems with potential benefit to a broad user community in the accelerator-based sciences."
https://openalex.org/W4291019254,"Determining trophic habits of predator communities is essential to measure interspecific interactions and response to environmental fluctuations. South American fur seals, Arctocephalus australis (SAFS) and sea lions Otaria byronia (SASL), coexist along the coasts of Peru. Recently, ocean warming events (2014-2017) that can decrease and impoverish prey biomass have occurred in the Peruvian Humboldt Current System. In this context, our aim was to assess the effect of warming events on long-term inter- and intra-specific niche segregation. We collected whisker from SAFS (55 females and 21 males) and SASL (14 females and 22 males) in Punta San Juan, Peru. We used δ13C and δ15N values serially archived in otariid whiskers to construct a monthly time series for 2005-2019. From the same period we used sea level anomaly records to determine shifts in the predominant oceanographic conditions using a change point analysis. Ellipse areas (SIBER) estimated niche width of species-sex groups and their overlap. We detected a shift in the environmental conditions marking two distinct periods (P1: January 2005-October 2013; P2: November 2013-December 2019). Reduction in δ15N in all groups during P2 suggests impoverished baseline values with bottom-up effects, a shift towards consuming lower trophic level prey, or both. Reduced overlap between all groups in P2 lends support of a more redundant assemblage during the colder P1 to a more trophically segregated assemblage during warmer P2. SASL females show the largest variation in response to the warming scenario (P2), reducing both ellipse area and δ15N mean values. Plasticity to adapt to changing environments and feeding on a more available food source without fishing pressure can be more advantageous for female SASL, albeit temporary trophic bottom-up effects. This helps explain larger population size of SASL in Peru, in contrast to the smaller and declining SAFS population."

To grade the content of videos, a usefulness score with seven elements was developed. Each element was given a score of 0 or 1. Statistical tests were run by using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) at a 5% significance level. The videos received a mean of 181198.5 views with a mean duration of 686.1 seconds. The mean number of ""likes"" was 1047.8. Almost half of the videos covered content related to molar teeth. Most videos were provided by health care professionals with almost 50% uploaded from India. The mean usefulness score was 4.29 (range: 1-7) and the most discussed elements were description, instruments used, access cavity demonstration, and evaluation criteria. About a quarter of the videos were classified as good, while 46.3% as moderate and 29.3% as poor. Among the content usefulness categories, no difference was found in the video demographics (p>0.05) except ""days since upload"" (p = 0.018) in which good quality videos were found to have the highest median. Moreover, although insignificant, good videos were found to have the longest duration and lowest number of views, likes, and viewing rate.

https://openalex.org/W4291235312,"We investigated the cumulative effects of predation by piscivorous colonial waterbirds on the survival of multiple salmonid ( Oncorhynchus spp.) populations listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) and determined what proportion of all sources of fish mortality (1 –survival) were due to birds in the Columbia River basin, USA. Anadromous juvenile salmonids (smolts) were exposed to predation by Caspian terns ( Hydroprogne caspia ), double-crested cormorants ( Nannopterum auritum ), California gulls ( Larus californicus ), and ring-billed gulls ( L . delawarensis ), birds known to consume both live and dead fish. Avian consumption and survival probabilities (proportion of available fish consumed or alive) were estimated for steelhead trout ( O . mykiss ), yearling Chinook salmon ( O . tshawytscha ), sub-yearling Chinook salmon, and sockeye salmon ( O . nerka ) during out-migration from the lower Snake River to the Pacific Ocean during an 11-year study period (2008–2018). Results indicated that probabilities of avian consumption varied greatly across salmonid populations, bird species, colony location, river reach, and year. Cumulative consumption probabilities (consumption by birds from all colonies combined) were consistently the highest for steelhead, with annual estimates ranging from 0.22 (95% credible interval = 0.20–0.26) to 0.51 (0.43–0.60) of available smolts. The cumulative effects of avian consumption were significantly lower for yearling and sub-yearling Chinook salmon, with consumption probabilities ranging annually from 0.04 (0.02–0.07) to 0.10 (0.07–0.15) and from 0.06 (0.3–0.09) to 0.15 (0.10–0.23), respectively. Avian consumption probabilities for sockeye salmon smolts was generally higher than for Chinook salmon smolts, but lower than for steelhead smolts, ranging annually from 0.08 (0.03–0.22) to 0.25 (0.14–0.44). Although annual consumption probabilities for birds from certain colonies were more than 0.20 of available smolts, probabilities from other colonies were less than 0.01 of available smolts, indicating that not all colonies of birds posed a substantial risk to smolt mortality. Consumption probabilities were lowest for small colonies and for colonies located a considerable distance from the Snake and Columbia rivers. Total mortality attributed to avian consumption was relatively small for Chinook salmon (less than 10%) but was the single greatest source of mortality for steelhead (greater than 50%) in all years evaluated. Results suggest that the potential benefits to salmonid populations of managing birds to reduce smolt mortality would vary widely depending on the salmonid population, the species of bird, and the size and location of the breeding colony."
https://openalex.org/W4291283607,"Studies leveraging gene-environment (GxE) interactions within Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have prompted the emergence of two similar methodologies: MR-GxE and MR-GENIUS. Such methods are attractive in allowing for pleiotropic bias to be corrected when using individual instruments. Specifically, MR-GxE requires an interaction to be explicitly identified, while MR-GENIUS does not. We critically examine the assumptions of MR-GxE and MR-GENIUS in the absence of a pre-defined covariate, and propose sensitivity analyses to evaluate their performance. Finally, we explore the effect of body mass index (BMI) upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank, finding evidence of a positive effect of BMI on SBP. We find both approaches share similar assumptions, though differences between the approaches lend themselves to differing research settings. Where a suitable gene-by-covariate interaction is observed MR-GxE can produce unbiased causal effect estimates. MR-GENIUS can circumvent the need to identify interactions, but as a consequence relies on either the MR-GxE assumptions holding globally, or additional information with respect to the distribution of pleiotropic effects in the absence of an explicitly defined interaction covariate."
https://openalex.org/W4290973931,"Viability of saliva samples stored for longer than 28 days has not been reported in the literature. The COVID-19 pandemic has spawned new research evaluating various sample types, thus large biobanks have been started. Residual saliva samples from university student surveillance testing were retested on SalivaDirect and compared with original RT-PCR (cycle threshold values) and quantitative antigen values for each month in storage. We conclude that saliva samples stored at -80°C are still viable in detecting SARS-CoV-2 after 12 months of storage, establishing the validity of these samples for future testing."

However, there is no universally comparable way to assess single-cell measurement quality. Here, we show how information theory can be used to assess and compare single-cell measurement quality in bits, which provides a universally comparable metric for information content. We anticipate that the experimental and theoretical approaches we show here will generally enable comparisons of quality between any single-cell measurement methods."
https://openalex.org/W4291001343,"This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the cross-sectional area of the dural sac (DCSA) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). This study included 270 Japanese participants from a community health check-up in 2016. Overactive bladder (OAB) was diagnosed during the assessment of LUTS. The smallest DCSA of each participant was defined as the minimum DCSA (mDCSA). The cutoff size of the mDCSA in OAB was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for OAB, and a scoring system was developed for estimating these. The prevalence of OAB was 11.1%. Age and low back pain visual analogue scale (LBP VAS) scores were significantly higher, and the mean mDCSA was significantly lower in participants with OAB than in those without. The cutoff size of mDCSA in OAB was 69 mm 2 . There were significant correlations between OAB and age, LBP VAS score, and mDCSA&lt;70 mm 2 . Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) should be considered a cause of LUTS when mDCSA is &lt;69 mm 2 . Assessing the mDCSA with age and LBP VAS score was more valuable in detecting LUTS in LSS than the mDCSA alone."
https://openalex.org/W4291001360,"Obesity is frequently debated as a factor associated with increased postoperative complications. Specifically, upper airway surgeries for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common comorbidity among obese patients, may be complicated by obesity's impact on intraoperative ventilation. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the association of various degrees of obesity with postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for OSA.The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement database between 2015 and 2019 was used to create a sample of patients diagnosed with OSA who underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tracheotomy, and surgeries at the base of tongue, maxilla, palate, or nose/turbinate. Inverse probability-weighted logistic regression and unadjusted multivariable logistic regression were used to compare outcomes of non-obese and obesity class 1, class 2, and class 3 groups (World Health Organization classification). Primary outcome was a composite of 30-day readmissions, reoperations, and/or postoperative complications, and a secondary outcome was all-cause same-day hospital admission.There were 1929 airway surgeries identified. The inverse probability-weighted regression comparing class 1, class 2, and class 3 obesity groups to non-obese patients showed no association between obesity and composite outcome and no association between obesity and hospital admission (all p-values > 0.05).These results do not provide evidence that obesity is associated with poorer outcomes or hospital admission surrounding upper airway surgery for OSA. While these data points towards the safety of upper airway surgery in obese patients with OSA, larger prospective studies will aid in elucidating the impact of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4291007860,"Background We report the first study to estimate the socioeconomic gap in period life expectancy (LE) and life years spent with and without complications in a national cohort of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Methods This retrospective cohort study used linked healthcare records from SCI-Diabetes, the population-based diabetes register of Scotland. We studied all individuals aged 50 and older with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes who were alive and residing in Scotland on 1 January 2013 (N = 8591). We used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2016 as an area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation. For each individual, we constructed a history of transitions by capturing whether individuals developed retinopathy/maculopathy, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic foot, or died throughout the study period, which lasted until 31 December 2018. Using parametric multistate survival models, we estimated total and state-specific LE at an attained age of 50. Results At age 50, remaining LE was 22.2 years (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 21.6 − 22.8) for males and 25.1 years (95% CI: 24.4 − 25.9) for females. Remaining LE at age 50 was around 8 years lower among the most deprived SIMD quintile when compared with the least deprived SIMD quintile: 18.7 years (95% CI: 17.5 − 19.9) vs. 26.3 years (95% CI: 24.5 − 28.1) among males, and 21.2 years (95% CI: 19.7 − 22.7) vs. 29.3 years (95% CI: 27.5 − 31.1) among females. The gap in life years spent without complications was around 5 years between the most and the least deprived SIMD quintile: 4.9 years (95% CI: 3.6 − 6.1) vs. 9.3 years (95% CI: 7.5 − 11.1) among males, and 5.3 years (95% CI: 3.7 − 6.9) vs. 10.3 years (95% CI: 8.3 − 12.3) among females. SIMD differences in transition rates decreased marginally when controlling for time-updated information on risk factors such as HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, or smoking. Conclusions In addition to societal interventions, tailored support to reduce the impact of diabetes is needed for individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds, including access to innovations in management of diabetes and the prevention of complications."
https://openalex.org/W4291019303,"(1) To investigate the relative importance of convenience (consultation frequency and injection frequency) against treatment outcomes (visual and anatomical outcomes) and out-of-pocket medical costs via a discrete choice experiment (DCE), and (2) to investigate how patient characteristics affect patient treatment preferences.Eligibility criteria were: (1) receiving a neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) diagnosis; (2) receiving anti-VEGF treatment; (3) being ≥21 years old, and (4) being able to speak and understand English/Mandarin. Patients were presented with eight choice tasks and asked to choose between their current treatment and two hypothetical treatments that varied by six attributes: number of clinic visits in a year, number of injections in a year, vision quality, control of swelling in retina, drug labelling and out-of-pocket cost.This analysis involved 180 patients. Based on latent class logistic regressions, vision quality was the most important attribute (34%) followed by cost (24%). The frequency of total clinic visits (15%) was the third most-important attribute, closely followed by labelling (12%) and control of retina swelling (11%). Injection frequency was the least important attribute (4%).Vision quality was the most important attribute followed by the out-of-pocket costs. Given the same outcomes, patients preferred treatment regimens which require fewer total clinic visits. In comparison, injection frequency alone did not influence patient preferences. With increasing treatment options for nAMD, understanding patients' preferences can help clinicians in selecting agents and treatment regimen most preferred for each patient, which may lead to improved long-term adherence and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4291019739,"Lifting tasks, among manual material handling activities, are those mainly associated with low back pain. In recent years, several instrumental-based tools were developed to quantitatively assess the biomechanical risk during lifting activities. In this study, parameters related to balance and extracted from the Centre of Pressure (CoP) data series are studied in fatiguing frequency-dependent lifting activities to: i) explore the possibility of classifying people with LBP and asymptomatic people during the execution of task; ii) examine the assessment of the risk levels associated with repetitive lifting activities, iii) enhance current understanding of postural control strategies during lifting tasks. Data were recorded from 14 asymptomatic participants and 7 participants with low back pain. The participants performed lifting tasks in three different lifting conditions (with increasing lifting frequency and risk levels) and kinetic and surface electromyography (sEMG) data were acquired. Kinetic data were used to calculated the CoP and parameters extracted from the latter show a discriminant capacity for the groups and the risk levels. Furthermore, sEMG parameters show a trend compatible with myoelectric manifestations of muscular fatigue. Correlation results between sEMG and CoP velocity parameters revealed a positive correlation between amplitude sEMG parameters and CoP velocity in both groups and a negative correlation between frequency sEMG parameters and CoP velocity. The current findings suggest that it is possible to quantitatively assess the risk level when monitoring fatiguing lifting tasks by using CoP parameters as well as identify different motor strategies between people with and without LBP."
https://openalex.org/W4291020581,"Objective Emerging evidences suggest that the trans-neural propagation of phosphorylated 43-kDa transactive response DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) contributes to neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether Network Diffusion Model (NDM), a biophysical model of spread of pathology via the brain connectome, could capture the severity and progression of neurodegeneration (atrophy) in ALS. Methods We measured degeneration in limb-onset ALS patients (n = 14 at baseline, 12 at 6-months, and 9 at 12 months) and controls (n = 12 at baseline) using FreeSurfer analysis on the structural T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The NDM was simulated on the canonical structural connectome from the IIT Human Brain Atlas. To determine whether NDM could predict the atrophy pattern in ALS, the accumulation of pathology modelled by NDM was correlated against atrophy measured using MRI. In order to investigate whether network spread on the brain connectome derived from healthy individuals were significant findings, we compared our findings against network spread simulated on random networks. Results The cross-sectional analyses revealed that the network diffusion seeded from the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis) significantly predicts the atrophy pattern in ALS compared to controls. Whereas, atrophy over time with-in the ALS group was best predicted by seeding the network diffusion process from the inferior temporal gyrus at 6-month and caudal middle frontal gyrus at 12-month. Network spread simulated on the random networks showed that the findings using healthy brain connectomes are significantly different from null models. Interpretation Our findings suggest the involvement of extra-motor regions in seeding the spread of pathology in ALS. Importantly, NDM was able to recapitulate the dynamics of pathological progression in ALS. Understanding the spatial shifts in the seeds of degeneration over time can potentially inform further research in the design of disease modifying therapeutic interventions in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W4291020968,"Evolutionary theories of disease avoidance propose that humans have a set of universal psychological processes to detect environmental cues indicative of infectious disease. These processes then initiate cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses that function to limit contact with harmful pathogens. Here, we study the conditions under which people exhibit behavioral avoidance of others with a contagious illness or a physical injury (i.e., a broken leg), and the potential mechanisms that underlie this behavior. Across three studies, participants were given the option of sitting at one of two workstations previously occupied by two confederates, one of whom either showed visible symptoms of a cold (contagion condition), wore a lower-leg orthopedic boot and used crutches (broken leg condition), or showed no signs of illness or physical injury (control). We found strong evidence that adults explicitly avoid contact with individuals who show symptoms of a contagious illness. Further, we provide some evidence that adults also avoid individuals with a physical injury, but that this behavior might be driven by implicit, unconscious processes. The findings are discussed in terms of implications for the healthy avoidance of contagion, and the risk for potential stigmatization of non-contagious groups."
https://openalex.org/W4291001361,"This protocol is a practical guide for preparing acute coronal slices from the midbrain of young adult mice for electrophysiology experiments. It describes two different sets of solutions with their respective incubation strategies and two alternative procedures for brain extraction: decapitation under terminal isoflurane anaesthesia and intracardial perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid under terminal isoflurane anaesthesia. Slices can be prepared from wild-type mice as well as from mice that have been genetically modified or transfected with viral constructs to label subsets of cells. The preparation can be used to investigate the electrophysiological properties of midbrain neurons in combination with pharmacology, opto- and chemogenetic manipulations, and calcium imaging; which can be followed by morphological reconstruction, immunohistochemistry, or single-cell transcriptomics. The protocol also provides a detailed list of materials and reagents including the design for a low-cost and easy to assemble 3D printed slice recovery chamber, general advice for troubleshooting common issues leading to suboptimal slice quality, and some suggestions to ensure good maintenance of a patch-clamp rig."
https://openalex.org/W4291001372,"Patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD) occasionally complain of difficulties in conversation. A conversation is a type of communication between the speaker and listener, and several elements are required for a conversation to take place. However, it is unclear which of those elements affect communication in patients with RHD. Therefore, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with right hemispheric damage due to acute cerebral infarction, within 1 week of onset. To evaluate patients’ conversational abilities, we used a structured conversation task, namely, the “Hallym Conversation and Pragmatics Protocol”. The topics of conversation were “family”, “leisure”, and “other/friends”. The conversation characteristics were classified according to three indices: the “conversational participation index”, “topic manipulation index”, and “conversational breakdown index”. Patients with RHD were compared with 11 age-, sex-, and years of education-matched healthy adults. The most common site of damage in the patients with RHD was the periventricular white matter. There was no significant difference in performance between the two groups according to the conversation participation index and in the discontinuance rate assessed with the conversational breakdown index. However, patients with RHD showed a lower topic maintenance rate and higher topic initiation and topic switching rates, according to the topic manipulation index. Therefore, we explored the characteristics of impaired conversation abilities in patients with RHD by assessing their ability to converse and manage topics during structured conversations, and found difficulties with pragmatics and communication discourse in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4291006663,"Depression is one of the significant mental health issues affecting all age groups globally. While it has been widely recognized to be one of the major disease burdens in populations, complexities in definitive diagnosis present a major challenge. Usually, trained psychologists utilize conventional methods including individualized interview assessment and manually administered PHQ-8 scoring. However, heterogeneity in symptomatic presentations, which span somatic to affective complaints, impart substantial subjectivity in its diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy is further compounded by the cross-sectional nature of sporadic assessment methods during physician-office visits, especially since depressive symptoms/severity may evolve over time. With widespread acceptance of smart wearable devices and smartphones, passive monitoring of depression traits using behavioral signals such as speech presents a unique opportunity as companion diagnostics to assist the trained clinicians in objective assessment over time. Therefore, we propose a framework for automated depression classification leveraging alterations in speech patterns in the well documented and extensively studied DAIC-WOZ depression dataset. This novel tensor-based approach requires a substantially simpler implementation architecture and extracts discriminative features for depression recognition with high f1 score and accuracy. We posit that such algorithms, which use significantly less compute load would allow effective onboard deployment in wearables for improve diagnostics accuracy and real-time monitoring of depressive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4291007334,"Background Laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has achieved rapid progress over the last decade. However, it is still challenging to apply laparoscopy to lesions located in segments I, VII, VIII, and IVa and the hepatic hilar region due to difficulty operating around complex anatomical structures. In this study, we applied three-dimensional printing (3DP) and indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging technology to complex laparoscopic hepatectomy (CLH) to explore the effects and value of the modified procedure. Materials and methods From January 2019 to January 2021, 54 patients with complex hepatobiliary diseases underwent LH at our center. Clinical data were collected from these patients and retrospectively analyzed. Results A total of 30 patients underwent CLH using the conventional approach, whereas 24 cases received CLH with 3DP technology and ICG fluorescent navigation. Preoperative data were compared between the two groups. In the 3DP group, we modified the surgical strategy of four patients (4/24, 16.7%) due to real-time intraoperative navigation with 3DP and ICG fluorescent imaging technology. We did not modify the surgical strategy for any patient in the non-3DP group ( P = 0.02). There were no significant differences between the non-3DP and 3DP groups regarding operating time (297.7±104.1 min vs. 328.8±110.9 min, P = 0.15), estimated blood loss (400±263.8 ml vs. 345.8±356.1 ml, P = 0.52), rate of conversion to laparotomy (3/30 vs. 2/24, P = 0.79), or pathological outcomes including the incidence of microscopical R0 margins (28/30 vs. 24/24, P = 0.57). Additionally, there were no significant differences in postoperative complications or recovery conditions between the two groups. No instances of 30- or 90-day mortality were observed. Conclusion The optimal surgical strategy for CLH can be chosen with the help of 3DP technology and ICG fluorescent navigation. This modified procedure is both safe and effective, but without improvement of intraoperative and short-term outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4291007868,"Background Meconium-related ileus in very low birth weight infants can lead to increased morbidity or mortality and prolonged hospitalization without prompt diagnosis and treatment. This study primarily aimed to identify the incidence of and factors associated with meconium-related ileus and secondarily sought to investigate clinical and growth outcomes after water-soluble contrast media (Gastrografin) enema. Methods We retrospectively reviewed medical records of very low birth weight infants born between February 2009 and March 2019 in the neonatal intensive care unit of a single medical center. Perinatal factors, clinical outcomes, and growth outcomes were compared between the group with meconium-related ileus that received Gastrografin enema and the control group. Results Twenty-four (6.9%) patients were diagnosed with meconium-related ileus among 347 very low birth weight infants. All achieved successful evacuation of meconium with an average of 2.8 (range: 1–8) Gastrografin enema attempts without procedure-related complications. Initiation of Gastrografin enema was performed at mean 7.0 days (range: 2–16) after birth. Incidences of moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia were higher and the duration of mechanical ventilation and need for oxygen were longer in the meconium-related ileus group ( P = 0.039, 0.046, 0.048, respectively). Meconium-related ileus infants took more time to start enteral feeding and the nothing per oral time was longer (P = 0.001 and 0.018, respectively). However, time to achieve full enteral feeding and Z-scores for weight and height at 37 weeks and at 6 months corrected age did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions Gastrografin enema in very low birth weight infants with meconium-related ileus was an effective and safe medical management. Following Gastrografin enema, very low birth weight infants with meconium-related ileus achieved similar subsequent feeding progress and similar growth levels as the control groups without meconium-related ileus."
https://openalex.org/W4291007869,"There are evidence that obese-resistant animals are more physically active, due to a higher rate of lipid oxidation. Efficiency in such pathways can favor greater spontaneous physical activity and, consequently, less body fat deposition. The aim of study was characterizing the nutritional profile and spontaneous physical activity in the condition of Resistance to Obesity (OR). Wistar rats were randomized into standard diet (SD; n = 50) and high-fat diet (HFD; n = 50) groups, after obesity induction, were redistributed into Control (C), False-control (FC), Propensity to obesity (OP) and OR, and then spontaneous physical activity was evaluated. Analyzed parameters: body mass (BM), epididymal (EF), retroperitoneal (RF), visceral (VF) and respective summations (∑), adiposity index (AI), nutritional, morphological, biochemical and metabolic parameters and protein quantification. The comparison of the groups was performed by ANOVA one or two factors, with 5% significance adopted. OP and FC presented high final MC values compared to C and OR. OR had lower EF, RF, VF, ∑ and IA compared to OP. OR had similar values to C and higher HDL than FC and OP. In GTT, OR and C presented similar values and both were lower than OP in the 30 minutes. OP promoted higher values than C for glycemic AUC. OR had higher PPARγ content than C and OP, as well as levels similar to C for leptin and insulin. Spontaneous physical activity did not differ between groups. The results were not enough to show that OR animals have greater lipid oxidative capacity, as well as greater spontaneous physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W4291020944,"Background The association between elevated serum uric acid (UA) levels and the risk of developing colonic diverticulosis has not yet been investigated. Thus, this cross-sectional study aimed to examine this correlation in individuals from Taiwan. Methods From Jan. 1, 2010, to Dec. 31, 2016., approximately 5,605 patients (aged &gt;20 years) from Tri-Service General Hospital who met the inclusion criteria according to colonoscopy and laboratory test findings were included in this research. The correlation between serum UA levels and colonic diverticulosis was investigated via regression analyses. Results Participants with elevated serum UA levels were at a higher risk of colonic diverticulosis. The area under the curve for serum UA levels was significantly higher in women than in men (0.651 [95% confidence interval: 0.596–0.707] vs. 0.55 [0.507–0.593]). There were specific trends in female-specific indicators for colonic diverticulosis across increasing quartiles of serum UA levels. Conclusions Patients with elevated serum UA levels should be cautious regarding the development of colonic diverticulosis disorder in female. Moreover, prospective studies may provide additional information on the relationship between elevated serum UA levels and colonic diverticulosis."
https://openalex.org/W4291021062,"Human stapedius muscle (SM) can be directly and safely accessed via retrofacial approach, opening new approaches to directly measure the electrically evoked stapedius reflex threshold (eSRT). The measurement of the SM activity via direct surgical access represents a potential tool for objective eSRT fitting of cochlear implants (CI), increasing the benefit experienced by the CI users and leading to new perspectives in the development of smart implantable neurostimulators. 3D middle-ear reconstructions created after manual segmentation and related SM accessibility metrics were evaluated before the CI surgery for 16 candidates with assessed stapedius reflex. Retrofacial approach to access the SM was performed after facial recess exposure. In cases of poor exposition of SM, the access was performed anteriorly to the FN via drilling of the pyramidal eminence (PE). The total access rate of the SM via both the retrofacial and anterior approach of the FN was 100%. In 81.2% of cases (13/16), the retrofacial approach allowed to access the SM on previously categorized well exposed (8/8), partially exposed (4/5), and wholly concealed (1/3) SM with respect to FN. Following intraoperative evaluation in the remaining 18.8% (3/16), the SM was accessed anteriorly via drilling of the PE. Exposure of SM with respect to the FN and the sigmoid sinus’s prominence was a predictor for the suitable surgical approach. The retrofacial approach offers feasible and reproducible access to the SM belly, opening direct access to electromyographic sensing of the eSRT. Surgical planner tools can quantitatively assist pre-surgical assessment."
