https://openalex.org/W2001929110,"Three partial skeletons of a large pterosaur have been found in the latest Cretaceous nonmarine rock of West Texas. This flying reptile had thin, elongate, perhaps toothless jaws and a long neck similar to Pterodaustro and Pterodactylus. With an estimated wingspan of 15.5 meters, it is undoutbtedly the largest flying creature presently known."

https://openalex.org/W2006060736,"Geological investigations, archeological studies, and radiocarbon dates indicate a similarity of events around Hudson Bay, commencing at the time Hudson Bay Basin was freed of glacier ice. The sea that then spread around Hudson Bay 7000 to 8000 years ago is here named ""Tyrrell Sea."" The subsequent rate of land emergence decreased exponentially."
https://openalex.org/W1976081236,A procedure is described which causes an observer to see a negative afterimage of a visual field without seeing the field itself. This phenomenon is shown to be closely related to ordinary afterimages and to temporal visual masking.
https://openalex.org/W2039248140,"The use of colloidal silica as a standard for fluorescence efficiency measurements is proposed. Its advantages over glycogen as a standard are availability, purity, and stability. Absolute fluorescence yields are reported for a number of stubstiances and compared with values in the literatUre."

https://openalex.org/W1969410305,"The exposure of mosquito larvae (Aedes aegypti L.) to LC(50) concentrations of DDT for various periods of time resulted in a selective increase in the alanine level of a DDT-resistant strain after 4 to 8 hours' contact with the insecticide, whereas the concentration of this amino acid in a susceptible strain remained comparatively low."

https://openalex.org/W2094255518,Two scientists from California have used their technical ingenuity to make a significant improvement in golf ball. They have invented a ball that resists hooking or slicing. They used a principle from Newtonian physics that might be called the spinning dumbbell rule. Two rigidly connected weights tend to spin around only one axis at a time-like a baton. In this new ball dimples cover 50% of surface confined to a band around equator with poles smooth and with weight slightly concentrated in poles. In tests Happy Non-Hooker achieved more than 90% of distance of a conventional ball while reducing slicing by 75% to 80%.
