The demonstration of two populations of clones, wild-type clones with normal enzyme activity and mutant clones unable to incorporate (3)H-guanine, is evidence that the locus for hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyl transferase on one of the X chromosomes is inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1546769209,"Abstract The experiments reported here suggest that Escherichia coli ribonuclease II, an exonuclease, hydrolyzes a given polyribonucleotide chain to completion before releasing a small, resistant oligonucleotide and initiating hydrolysis of another chain. Investigation of the products of hydrolysis of oligo- and polyribonucleotides indicates that enzymatic degradation starts at that end of the chain bearing a 3'-hydroxyl group. The enzyme shows a strong preference for long polymers as substrates, although oligonucleotides are hydrolyzed if present at sufficiently high concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2021274076,Immunofluorescent and radioautographic studies demonstrate that ovalbumin and avidin are cell-specific proteins synthesized by different epithelial cells in the chick oviduct mucosa. The mechanism of the selective induction of ovalbumin synthesis by estrogen and of avidin synthesis by progesterone may be through stimulation of specific target cells by these hormones.

https://openalex.org/W1957493953,"Abstract Biosynthetic l-threonine deaminase (l-threonine hydrolyase, deaminating; EC 4.2.1.16) has been purified approximately 250-fold from crude extracts of nutritionally derepressed Salmonella typhimurium. Sedimentation of the enzyme in the ultracentrifuge results in a single, sharp, symmetrical peak in the schlieren pattern. The purification procedure is capable of removing the radioactivity from a crude extract containing label in all the proteins except native threonine deaminase. The deaminase reaction shows homotropic interaction only in the presence of l-isoleucine; high ionic strength or low valine concentrations remove these interactions. The pure enzyme is effectively inhibited by l-isoleucine. The pH optimum of the deaminase reaction is 9 to 10; the pH curve is shifted to higher values in the presence of l-isoleucine. The activity of the purified enzyme is independent of added pyridoxal phosphate. The cofactor is resolved by dialysis against tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride buffer at pH 8.0. Pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate are capable of reactivating the enzyme. The activity of the purified enzyme is independent of divalent cations, but NH4+, K+, Li+, and Na+ show about 20% stimulation of enzyme activity. The enzyme has two absorption maxima (280 and 420 mµ). The removal of pyridoxal phosphate from the enzyme is accompanied by the loss of the 420 mµ absorption. The enzyme contains 0.99 mole of pyridoxal phosphate per 100,000 g of protein. The minimum molecular weight computed on the basis of pyridoxal phosphate content and sedimentation coefficient is 200,000."

https://openalex.org/W1494548428,"Abstract Crystalline preparations of Clostridium botulinum type A toxin were fractionated on DEAE-cellulose columns with Tris-HCl buffers at pH 8.0. The isolated toxic fraction was free of hemagglutinating activity and contained 5 times the specific activity of the crystalline toxin. The second fraction was a powerful hemagglutinin but was only feebly toxic; it emerged from the column as one or more peaks, under different elution conditions. By rechromatography and immunological tests, the toxicity of the second fraction was shown to be due to contamination with traces of the toxic fraction. By several criteria, the toxic and hemagglutinating components appeared to be at least two different proteins. Most of the information obtainable from the ultracentrifugal analysis of these substances was also obtained by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column and with much smaller protein concentrations. At physiological pH, the toxic fraction had a molecular weight of 150,000 and a Stokes radius of 48 A; these dimensions were in agreement with those established in vivo by other investigators. The hemagglutinin appeared to exist in three forms of aggregation with molecular weights of 290,000, 500,000, and 900,000."

Analysis of streptomycin sensitivity of the reconstituted particles has shown that the alteration induced by the resistance mutation resides in the core proteins, and not in the RNA or in the split proteins of the 30S particles."
https://openalex.org/W1540716961,"Abstract The mechanism of the conversion of deoxythymidine diphosphate d-glucose to deoxythymidine diphosphate 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose has been examined with the use of a purified deoxythymidine diphosphate d-glucose oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli. When deoxythymidine diphosphate d-glucose-4d was the substrate, deuterium was transferred quantitatively to carbon atom 6 of the 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. The transfer of hydrogen was shown to be intramolecular. When deoxythymidine diphosphate d-glucose was converted to deoxythymidine diphosphate 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose in deuterium oxide, 1 atom of deuterium was incorporated at carbon atom 5 of 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. Similar results were obtained in the conversion of cytidine diphosphate d-glucose to cytidine diphosphate 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose by cytidine diphosphate glucose oxidoreductase from Salmonella typhimurium. A mechanism to account for these observations is described."

https://openalex.org/W2090815947,"EVIDENCE is accumulating that in some mammalian species there may be a direct effect of short chain fatty acids on the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. Thus it has been shown that octanoate causes a marked release of insulin from slices of rat pancreas1. Furthermore, butyrate was found to evoke a rapid and sustained elevation of serum insulin when infused into adult sheep2. These results contrast with the lack of effect on insulin secretion when longer chain fatty acids, such as palmitate, are incubated with pancreas slices3."

https://openalex.org/W1545777246,"Abstract Cell-free extracts from Escherichia coli cleave the thioether linkage of S-ribosylhomocysteine and generate free homocysteine. Homocysteine was quantitatively recovered from reaction mixtures by ion exchange chromatography on Amberlite CG-120 resin. Free ribose was not a product of this cleavage; however, a compound initially derived from the ribose moiety of S-ribosylhomocysteine has been isolated by chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 resin but has not been fully characterized. A 15-fold purification of the cleavage enzyme has been achieved by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, and ethyl alcohol precipitation. The thioether linkage of S-adenosylhomocysteine also was cleaved by crude cell-free extracts of E. coli. However, the ratio of specific activities, obtained with S-ribosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine as substrates during the purification procedure, showed the necessity for cleavage of the glycosyl bond of S-adenosylhomocysteine prior to cleavage of the thioether linkage. The pH optimum for stability of the S-ribosylhomocysteine cleavage enzyme is 7.6 with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, and the Michaelis constant is 1.94 x 10-3 m for S-ribosylhomocysteine."

This nephritis appears to be the first autoimmune disease induced by antigens that are not organ-specific. By clinical and immunopathologic criteria, this nephritis appears identical to the nephritis induced in sheep by human glomerular basement membrane and greatly resembles certain nephritides of man, in particular, the nephritis in Goodpasture's disease."

The protein, in 6 m guanidine HCl and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, dissociates into polypeptide chains of molecular weight 48,500. Tryptic peptide analysis implies that the four component chains of the native enzyme are of identical amino acid sequence. l-Isoleucine and l-valine, which are allosteric effectors of this enzyme, have no effect on the sedimentation properties and do not produce detectable changes in the optical rotatory dispersion curve of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483755983,"Cells of Staphylococcus aureus have been shown to accumulate maltose, sucrose, α-methylglucoside, lactose, and isopropylthiogalactoside as phosphate derivatives. In the case of lactose, sucrose, and this galactoside there was 1 mole of phosphate per mole of carbohydrate accumulated. Lactose phosphate cannot be taken up into the cells, and in counterflow experiments with lactose, α-methylglucoside, and maltose, the carbohydrate flowing from the cells was nonphosphorylated. The pleiotropic car mutants of Staphylococcus cannot phosphorylate or accumulate carbohydrates. It appears that staphylococci may employ a phosphorylation mechanism to accumulate carbohydrates which is similar to that found in Escherichia coli by Kundig, Ghosh, and Roseman."

https://openalex.org/W1559722376,"Abstract In this paper, glycine uptake by isolated membrane preparations of Escherichia coli W (W+) and the d-serine-resistant mutant (WS) is examined in detail. Glycine uptake by W+ membrane preparations is dependent on pH and on the presence of Mg++ and an energy source. In W+ membranes, glycine is first taken up into an exchangeable pool, from which it is subsequently removed as the incubation proceeds. The exchangeable pool is built up within 30 sec and remains constant with time, although glycine uptake by the membranes continues. Glycine uptake into the exchangeable pool of W+ membranes is independent of temperature. Uptake and exchange in W+ membranes are specific for glycine, dl-alanine, dl-serine, and dl-threonine. Membrane preparations from the WS mutant are unable to catalyze either the uptake of glycine or the exchange of glycine between the incubation medium and the pool. Glycine uptake by W+ membranes is inhibited 50 to 70% by anaerobiosis, incubation at 0°, or incubation in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, NaN3, KAsO4, KCN, iodoacetamide, and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate. No inhibition is oberved with NaF, sodium Amytal, hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, antimycin A, Chloromycetin, or ouabain. Although glycine uptake at 30 min is inhibited by the conditions listed above, there is no diminution of glycine uptake when measured at 30 sec. Under none of the conditions studied is the uptake (at either 30 sec or 30 min) decreased to the values found with WS membranes at 37° or 0°. W+ membranes incubated at 37° convert about 94% of the glycine carbon taken up into compounds that have the properties of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. Under all of the conditions studied, the concentration of glycine in the intramembranal pool approximates that of the incubation medium. Incubation at 0° or in the presence of dinitrophenol or iodoacetamide inhibits the conversion of glycine to phospholipids, and the amount of glycine in the intramembranal pool is increased above that found for uninhibited (control) preparations. WS membranes convert significant amounts of glycine to phospholipids, but the concentration of glycine in the intramembranal pool is only 10 to 20% of that in the external pool. When the external glycine concentration is raised so that the rate of glycine uptake by WS membranes is comparable to the rate exhibited by W+ membranes, the WS membranes convert as much glycine to phospholipids as do W+ membranes, but the concentration of glycine in the intramembranal pool remains only 10 to 20% of that in the external pool. Hydroxylamine almost quantitatively inhibits the conversion of glycine to phospholipids, and in the presence of this inhibitor the WS membranes manifest the same defect."

https://openalex.org/W1487237005,"Abstract These experiments were designed to investigate the defect in amino acid uptake in a d-serine-resistant mutant (WS) of Escherichia coli W that is deficient in the uptake of glycine. Under conditions in which there is insignificant metabolism of glycine (i.e. 0° under nitrogen), the wild type took up significant amounts of glycine, whereas the WS mutant did not equilibrate with the external glycine pool. The initial rate of glycine uptake by the wild type as a function of the external glycine concentration was nonlinear, increasing rapidly from 1.3 x 10-5 m to 2.6 x 10-4 m and decreasing at concentrations above 2.6 x 10-4 m. The WS mutant took up glycine at an initial rate which was 3- to 4-fold less than that of the wild type. The defect could not be attributed to an increased exit process in the WS mutant. Although the WS mutant was able to take up glycine from low external concentrations to the same extent as the wild type, it did so at a much slower rate. Membrane preparations from the wild type cells were found to take up glycine, and membrane preparations from the WS mutant were found to exhibit the defect in glycine uptake. It is concluded that the defect manifested by this d-serine-resistant mutant of E. coli is in the passage of glycine through the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2022033647,"Skin grafts were rotated 180 degrees in frog tadpoles. After metamorphosis, cutaneous reflexes were tested, and the receptive fields of cutaneous nerves were mapped electrophysiologically. Accurately localized limb movements were elicited by mechanical stimulation of normal skin, or of dorsal skin reimplanted on the back after 180-degree rotation. Reflexes misdirected to the original site of the stimulated skin were elicited from dorsoventrally inverted grafts, but not from anteroposteriorly inverted grafts. In most cases, the local nerves supplied the grafts, and each nerve entered the skin within its own receptive field. This observation eliminated the possibility that misdirected reflexes were due to selective regrowth of cutaneous nerves. We concluded that cutaneous nerves formed central synaptic associations which were specified by their new terminal connections with grafted skin."
https://openalex.org/W1488288050,"Abstract The binding of aminoacyl transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) to ribosomes in the presence of corresponding messenger RNA (specific binding) is compared with that in the absence of messenger RNA (nonspecific binding). Specific binding is much more sensitive to tetracycline than nonspecific binding, and the former is similar to, but not identical with, the latter in its response to changes in Mg++ concentration. On the other hand, trypsin treatment of ribosomes abolishes both nonspecific and specific binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomes in a parallel fashion, indicating that ribosomal proteins are involved in the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA in general. Aminoacyl-tRNA bound in the absence of messenger RNA can be partially, but not totally, chased from ribosomes by the addition of messenger RNA which does not contain the code word for the amino acid. For this removal of aminoacyl-tRNA by unrelated messenger RNA, unbound, specific aminoacyl-tRNA coded for by the messenger must be present. Thus, the removal is an exchange reaction with the incoming specific aminoacyl-tRNA, and the addition of messenger alone in the absence of incoming specific aminoacyl-tRNA does not remove the nonspecifically bound aminoacyl-tRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1495588265,"Abstract Homopolydeoxynucleotides containing pyrimidine bases, and random copolydeoxynucleotides of purines and pyrimidines or pyrimidines only, have been found to stimulate directly the incorporation of amino acids into acid-insoluble material in a neomycin-modified, cell-free system from Escherichia coli. In contrast, homopolydeoxynucleotides and random copolydeoxynucleotides containing only purine bases show no messenger activity in this system. Purine-containing triplets are read when the copolymer has a purine to pyrimidine ratio of 1:1, but not when this ratio is 2:1. The extent of amino acid incorporation with the active polydeoxynucleotide messengers is similar to that obtained with the ribose analogues, and the amino acids incorporated under the direction of the polyribo- and polydeoxyribonucleotide analogues are identical. No misreading of polydeoxynucleotide templates has been observed."

https://openalex.org/W2005236765,Mitotic recombination within the β-galactosidase gene was followed in F′ merodiploids grown in the presence and absence of inducer. Inducer inhibited recombination when the two mutations in the merodiploid were nonpolar but had no effect when the mutations were strongly polar. These results are interpreted to mean that transcription inhibits intragenic mitotic recombination and that strongly polar mutations inhibit transcription.
