Self-assembling processes are common throughout nature and technology. They involve components from the molecular (crystals) to the planetary (weather systems) scale and many different kinds of interactions. The concept of self-assembly is used increasingly in many disciplines, with a different flavor and emphasis in each."

By controlling nanorod length, we can change the distance on which electrons are transported directly through the thin film device. Tuning the band gap by altering the nanorod radius enabled us to optimize the overlap between the absorption spectrum of the cell and the solar emission spectrum. A photovoltaic device consisting of 7-nanometer by 60-nanometer CdSe nanorods and the conjugated polymer poly-3(hexylthiophene) was assembled from solution with an external quantum efficiency of over 54% and a monochromatic power conversion efficiency of 6.9% under 0.1 milliwatt per square centimeter illumination at 515 nanometers. Under Air Mass (A.M.) 1.5 Global solar conditions, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of 1.7%."

https://openalex.org/W2108813293,"Blood lymphocyte numbers, essential for the development of efficient immune responses, are maintained by recirculation through secondary lymphoid organs. We show that lymphocyte trafficking is altered by the lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and by a phosphoryl metabolite of the immunosuppressive agent FTY720. Both species were high-affinity agonists of at least four of the five S1P receptors. These agonists produce lymphopenia in blood and thoracic duct lymph by sequestration of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, but not spleen. S1P receptor agonists induced emptying of lymphoid sinuses by retention of lymphocytes on the abluminal side of sinus-lining endothelium and inhibition of egress into lymph. Inhibition of lymphocyte recirculation by activation of S1P receptors may result in therapeutically useful immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2094248448,"To begin to understand the genetic architecture of natural variation in gene expression, we carried out genetic linkage analysis of genomewide expression patterns in a cross between a laboratory strain and a wild strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Over 1500 genes were differentially expressed between the parent strains. Expression levels of 570 genes were linked to one or more different loci, with most expression levels showing complex inheritance patterns. The loci detected by linkage fell largely into two categories: cis-acting modulators of single genes and trans-acting modulators of many genes. We found eight such trans-acting loci, each affecting the expression of a group of 7 to 94 genes of related function."
https://openalex.org/W2045389096,"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) mimic estrogen action in certain tissues while opposing it in others. The therapeutic effectiveness of SERMs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene in breast cancer depends on their antiestrogenic activity. In the uterus, however, tamoxifen is estrogenic. Here, we show that both tamoxifen and raloxifene induce the recruitment of corepressors to target gene promoters in mammary cells. In endometrial cells, tamoxifen, but not raloxifene, acts like estrogen by stimulating the recruitment of coactivators to a subset of genes. The estrogen-like activity of tamoxifen in the uterus requires a high level of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) expression. Thus cell type- and promoter-specific differences in coregulator recruitment determine the cellular response to SERMs."

https://openalex.org/W2102005838,"Self-assembly of polymeric supramolecules is a powerful tool for producing functional materials that combine several properties and may respond to external conditions. We illustrate the concept using a comb-shaped architecture. Examples include the hexagonal self-organization of conjugated conducting polymers and the polarized luminance in solid-state films of rodlike polymers obtained by removing the hydrogen-bonded side chains from the aligned thermotropic smectic phase. Hierarchically structured materials obtained by applying different self-organization and recognition principles and directed assembly form a basis for tunable nanoporous materials, smart membranes, preparation of nano-objects, and anisotropic properties, such as proton conductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2088926897,"Primary human cells in culture invariably stop dividing and enter a state of growth arrest called replicative senescence. This transition is induced by programmed telomere shortening, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we report that overexpression of TRF2, a telomeric DNA binding protein, increased the rate of telomere shortening in primary cells without accelerating senescence. TRF2 reduced the senescence setpoint, defined as telomere length at senescence, from 7 to 4 kilobases. TRF2 protected critically short telomeres from fusion and repressed chromosome-end fusions in presenescent cultures, which explains the ability of TRF2 to delay senescence. Thus, replicative senescence is induced by a change in the protected status of shortened telomeres rather than by a complete loss of telomeric DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2047196913,"Fluorescent-sandwich immunoassays on microarrays hold appeal for proteomics studies, because equipment and antibodies are readily available, and assays are simple, scalable, and reproducible. The achievement of adequate sensitivity and specificity, however, requires a general method of immunoassay amplification. We describe coupling of isothermal rolling-circle amplification (RCA) to universal antibodies for this purpose. A total of 75 cytokines were measured simultaneously on glass arrays with signal amplification by RCA with high specificity, femtomolar sensitivity, 3 log quantitative range, and economy of sample consumption. A 51-feature RCA cytokine glass array was used to measure secretion from human dendritic cells (DCs) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). As expected, LPS induced rapid secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1beta, interleukin (IL)-8, and interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10. We found that eotaxin-2 and I-309 were induced by LPS; in addition, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), soluble interleukin 6 receptor (sIL-6R), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) were induced by TNF-alpha treatment. Because microarrays can accommodate approximately 1,000 sandwich immunoassays of this type, a relatively small number of RCA microarrays seem to offer a tractable approach for proteomic surveys."

Comparing classical and quantum Monte Carlo annealing protocols on the random two-dimensional Ising model we confirm the superiority of quantum annealing relative to classical annealing. We also propose a theory of quantum annealing, based on a cascade of Landau-Zener tunneling events. For both classical and quantum annealing, the residual energy after annealing is inversely proportional to a power of the logarithm of the annealing time, but the quantum case has a larger power which makes it faster"

https://openalex.org/W2029225125,"The small guanosine triphosphatase Ran is loaded with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the chromatin-bound guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 and releases import cargoes in the nucleus during interphase. In mitosis, Ran-GTP promotes spindle assembly around chromosomes by locally discharging cargoes that regulate microtubule dynamics and organization. We used fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors to visualize gradients of Ran-GTP and liberated cargoes around chromosomes in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. Both gradients were required to assemble and maintain spindle structure. During interphase, Ran-GTP was highly enriched in the nucleoplasm, and a steep concentration difference between nuclear and cytoplasmic Ran-GTP was established, providing evidence for a Ran-GTP gradient surrounding chromosomes throughout the cell cycle."

Leptin-deficient Lepob/Lepob mice develop obesity and those obesity-related syndromes. Increased lipogenesis in both liver and adipose tissue of these mice has been suggested. We have previously shown that the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipogenesis in vivo. To explore the possible involvement of SREBP-1 in the pathogenesis of obesity and its related syndromes, we generated mice deficient in both leptin and SREBP-1. In doubly mutant Lepob/ob × Srebp-1 −/− mice, fatty livers were markedly attenuated, but obesity and insulin resistance remained persistent. The mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase were proportional to triglyceride accumulation in liver. In contrast, the mRNA abundance of SREBP-1 and lipogenic enzymes in the adipose tissue of Lepob/Lepob mice was profoundly decreased despite sustained fat, which could explain why the SREBP-1 disruption had little effect on obesity.

The livers of Lepob/ob mice have an increase in triglyceride content, probably due to the increased lipogenesis paralleled by elevated mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of several lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase (5Herberg L.

SREBP-1a and -1c are transcribed from the same gene, each by a distinct promoter, and the predominant SREBP-1 isoform in liver and adipose tissue is SREBP-1c. Whereas SREBP-2 is relatively selective in transcriptionally activating cholesterol biosynthetic genes, SREBP-1c has a greater role in regulating fatty acid synthesis than cholesterol synthesis (12Shimano H.

Thus, the role of SREBP-1 in the regulation of lipogenesis has been established (15Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K.

Moreover, SREBP-1 now appears to be positioned as a general mediator in the transcriptional action of insulin (20Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 21Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 14191-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been reported that both SREBP-1c mRNA and its active nuclear protein are increased in Lepob/ob mouse livers (23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It is pathophysiologically intriguing and of clinical relevance to evaluate the possible involvement of SREBP-1 in the development of obesity and its related syndromes, since SREBP-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in these pathological states. These considerations prompted us to investigate the effects of SREBP-1 deletion on the phenotype of Lepob/obmouse by targeted gene disruption.DISCUSSIONThe current study clearly demonstrates that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the development of fatty livers in Lepob/ob mice. The disruption of SREBP-1 caused a significant reduction in hepatic expression of a battery of lipogenic genes and prevented fatty livers in Lepob/ob mice, indicating that SREBP-1 controls triglyceride accumulation in the liver by regulating the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes. These data are in accordance with previous reports that the overexpression of SREBP-1 induced lipogenic enzymes and resulted in fatty livers in several mouse models including SREBP-1a and -1c transgenic mice (12Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar,23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). It can be concluded, therefore, that SREBP-1 is a key transcription factor that nutritionally regulates hepatic gene expression of lipogenic enzymes and triglyceride deposition in the liver.The observations from adipose tissue showed a remarkable contrast to those from liver. We demonstrated from the comparison of wild-type and Lepob/ob mice that the mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes and adipose tissue mass were not correlated, suggesting that lipogenesis in adipose tissue is not the primary cause of obesity in Lepob/ob mice. The lower expression of SREBP-1 and lipogenic enzymes in the Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue as compared with those in wild-type has also been described elsewhere as a part of the microarray analysis (30Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nadler S.T. Stoehr J.P. Schueler K.L. Tanimoto G. Yandell B.S. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11371-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The difference was more pronounced in our experiments that were performed in a refed state (Fig. 5). It has been shown by enzymatic assay experiments that lipogenesis in Lepob/obmouse adipose tissue is elevated in the early dynamic phase until 7–8 weeks of age and thereafter suppressed in the late static phase when insulin resistance becomes evident (32Hems D.A. Rath E.A. Verrinder T.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Kaplan M.L. Leveille G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E101-E107PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, hepatic lipogenesis in Lepob/obmice remains consistently higher than in wild-type animals. Therefore, lipogenesis is not likely to be important in the sustained hypertrophy of adipocytes in older Lepob/ob mice. These results can be explained by the fact that adipose mass is related not only to de novo fatty acid synthesis but also to fatty acid intake mediated through lipoprotein lipase (34Weinstock P.H. Levak-Frank S. Hudgins L.C. Radner H. Friedman J.M. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In our data, the expression of lipoprotein lipase was not affected by SREBP-1 absence, which could be another reason for sustained obesity in the doubly mutant mice. Adipocyte hypertrophy can be also influenced by lipolysis through the action of hormone-sensitive lipase (35Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).We conclude from these results that the inherent suppression of SREBP-1 in Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue was the primary cause of the ineffectiveness of SREBP-1 disruption on obesity. Another factor that might explain the phenotypic discrepancy between liver and adipose tissue in the Lepob/ob ×Srebp-1 −/− mice is the different contribution of SREBP-1 to the regulation of lipogenesis in the two organs (15Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar); the disruption of SREBP-1 strongly suppressed the refeeding responses of lipogenic enzymes in the liver, whereas their expression was less influenced by SREBP-1 levels in the adipose tissue. It is possible that there are other specific transcription factors that regulate lipogenesis in adipocytes and that SREBP-1 contribution is of minor importance in this tissue (15Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that the adipose tissue of older Lepob/ob mice could not respond fully to the refeeding manipulation, whereas the livers responded normally at least with respect to lipogenesis. Given that the refeeding response of lipogenesis highly depends upon insulin action, it could be said that hyperinsulinemia in Lepob/ob mice could overcome insulin resistance to lipogenesis in the liver but could not in the adipose tissue. This is consistent with previous reports that the adipose tissue was more affected in an insulin-resistant state of Lepob/ob mice than the liver where lipid synthesis remained sensitive to insulin stimulation throughout life (6Bray G.A. York D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 719-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).It has been reported that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia even in lean subjects with normal glucose tolerance (36Lee J.H. Rhee P.L. Lee J.K. Lee K.T. Kim J.J. Koh K.C. Paik S.W. Rhee J.C. Choi K.W. Korean J. Intern. Med. 1998; 13: 12-14PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty liver disease and insulin resistance in these patients might represent an initial stage of the metabolic syndrome X (37Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Marchesini G. Brizi M. Morselli-Labate A.M. Bianchi G. Bugianesi E. McCullough A.J. Forlani G. Melchionda N. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 450-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). In this study, we were able to segregate fatty liver disease from insulin resistance syndromes by the disruption of SREBP-1, an indication that excess triglyceride accumulation in the liver is not a cause but rather the result of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.In summary, we demonstrated that the absence of SREBP-1 attenuated fatty livers but not obesity or insulin resistance in Lepob/ob mice. It was revealed that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression and triglyceride accumulation in the liver. The ineffectiveness of SREBP-1 disruption on obesity presumably resulted from the decreased expression of SREBP-1 in Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue. The data also suggested that lipogenesis is not a determinant of obesity in Lepob/obmice. Obesity is the most common nutritional problem in the United States, affecting ∼33% of adults (1Kuczmarski R.J. Flegal K.M. Campbell S.M. Johnson C.L. J. Am. Med.

The livers of Lepob/ob mice have an increase in triglyceride content, probably due to the increased lipogenesis paralleled by elevated mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of several lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and ATP citrate lyase (5Herberg L.

SREBP-1a and -1c are transcribed from the same gene, each by a distinct promoter, and the predominant SREBP-1 isoform in liver and adipose tissue is SREBP-1c. Whereas SREBP-2 is relatively selective in transcriptionally activating cholesterol biosynthetic genes, SREBP-1c has a greater role in regulating fatty acid synthesis than cholesterol synthesis (12Shimano H.

Moreover, SREBP-1 now appears to be positioned as a general mediator in the transcriptional action of insulin (20Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30028-30032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It is pathophysiologically intriguing and of clinical relevance to evaluate the possible involvement of SREBP-1 in the development of obesity and its related syndromes, since SREBP-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in these pathological states. These considerations prompted us to investigate the effects of SREBP-1 deletion on the phenotype of Lepob/obmouse by targeted gene disruption. DISCUSSIONThe current study clearly demonstrates that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the development of fatty livers in Lepob/ob mice. The disruption of SREBP-1 caused a significant reduction in hepatic expression of a battery of lipogenic genes and prevented fatty livers in Lepob/ob mice, indicating that SREBP-1 controls triglyceride accumulation in the liver by regulating the expression levels of lipogenic enzymes. These data are in accordance with previous reports that the overexpression of SREBP-1 induced lipogenic enzymes and resulted in fatty livers in several mouse models including SREBP-1a and -1c transgenic mice (12Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar,23Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). It can be concluded, therefore, that SREBP-1 is a key transcription factor that nutritionally regulates hepatic gene expression of lipogenic enzymes and triglyceride deposition in the liver.The observations from adipose tissue showed a remarkable contrast to those from liver. We demonstrated from the comparison of wild-type and Lepob/ob mice that the mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes and adipose tissue mass were not correlated, suggesting that lipogenesis in adipose tissue is not the primary cause of obesity in Lepob/ob mice. The lower expression of SREBP-1 and lipogenic enzymes in the Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue as compared with those in wild-type has also been described elsewhere as a part of the microarray analysis (30Soukas A. Cohen P. Socci N.D. Friedman J.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 963-980PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nadler S.T. Stoehr J.P. Schueler K.L. Tanimoto G. Yandell B.S. Attie A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11371-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The difference was more pronounced in our experiments that were performed in a refed state (Fig. 5). It has been shown by enzymatic assay experiments that lipogenesis in Lepob/obmouse adipose tissue is elevated in the early dynamic phase until 7–8 weeks of age and thereafter suppressed in the late static phase when insulin resistance becomes evident (32Hems D.A. Rath E.A. Verrinder T.R. Biochem. J. 1975; 150: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Kaplan M.L. Leveille G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E101-E107PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, hepatic lipogenesis in Lepob/obmice remains consistently higher than in wild-type animals. Therefore, lipogenesis is not likely to be important in the sustained hypertrophy of adipocytes in older Lepob/ob mice. These results can be explained by the fact that adipose mass is related not only to de novo fatty acid synthesis but also to fatty acid intake mediated through lipoprotein lipase (34Weinstock P.H. Levak-Frank S. Hudgins L.C. Radner H. Friedman J.M. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In our data, the expression of lipoprotein lipase was not affected by SREBP-1 absence, which could be another reason for sustained obesity in the doubly mutant mice. Adipocyte hypertrophy can be also influenced by lipolysis through the action of hormone-sensitive lipase (35Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).We conclude from these results that the inherent suppression of SREBP-1 in Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue was the primary cause of the ineffectiveness of SREBP-1 disruption on obesity. Another factor that might explain the phenotypic discrepancy between liver and adipose tissue in the Lepob/ob ×Srebp-1 −/− mice is the different contribution of SREBP-1 to the regulation of lipogenesis in the two organs (15Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar); the disruption of SREBP-1 strongly suppressed the refeeding responses of lipogenic enzymes in the liver, whereas their expression was less influenced by SREBP-1 levels in the adipose tissue. It is possible that there are other specific transcription factors that regulate lipogenesis in adipocytes and that SREBP-1 contribution is of minor importance in this tissue (15Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

Given that the refeeding response of lipogenesis highly depends upon insulin action, it could be said that hyperinsulinemia in Lepob/ob mice could overcome insulin resistance to lipogenesis in the liver but could not in the adipose tissue. This is consistent with previous reports that the adipose tissue was more affected in an insulin-resistant state of Lepob/ob mice than the liver where lipid synthesis remained sensitive to insulin stimulation throughout life (6Bray G.A. York D.A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 719-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).It has been reported that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia even in lean subjects with normal glucose tolerance (36Lee J.H.

It was revealed that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression and triglyceride accumulation in the liver. The ineffectiveness of SREBP-1 disruption on obesity presumably resulted from the decreased expression of SREBP-1 in Lepob/ob mouse adipose tissue.

A simple model is described, in which repeated phase separation events during wall biogenesis are assumed to produce self-similar silica patterns in smaller and smaller scales. On the basis of this single assumption, the apparently complex patterns found in the valves of the diatom genus Coscinodiscus can be predicted.

In our experiment, a single input photon stimulates the emission of additional photons from a source on the basis of parametric down-conversion. This leads to the production of quantum clones with near-optimal fidelity. We also demonstrate universality of the copying procedure by showing that the same fidelity is achieved for arbitrary input states."

Comparatively, these enzymes hydrolyze starch and pullulan inefficiently. These enzyme activities are distinguished from those of typical smaller α-amylases, e.g. TAKA amylase A ofAspergillus oryzae, which virtually cannot hydrolyze CDs. The three groups of enzymes contain ∼130 residues at the N terminus that are absent in the smaller α-amylases. The central and C-terminal regions of these enzymes exhibit a noticeable sequence homology to the entire sequence of the smaller α-amylases. The central region contains three critical catalytic residues that are invariant throughout α-amylase family members. Therefore, the N-terminal region had been speculated to contribute primarily to their catalytic property. The crystal structure of MAase from a Thermusspecies (ThMA) (2Kim J.-S. Cha S.-S. Kim H.-J. Kim T.-J., Ha, N.-C., Oh, S.-T. Cho H.-S. Cho M.-J. Kim M.-J. Lee H.-S. Kim J.-W. Choi K.Y. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26279-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) revealed that the N-terminal domain, together with the central (α/β)8-barrel domain, is involved in domain-swapped homodimer formation. The interaction between the N-terminal domain of one molecule and the central domain of the other molecule shapes a narrow and deep active-site groove, which is distinctively different from the wide and shallow active-site groove of the smaller α-amylases. The width of the active-site cleft of ThMA appears to be optimal for binding CDs, but not for binding the linear substrates starch and pullulan. Many enzymes denoted as CDase have been isolated from various microbial sources, including Bacillus coagulans (3Kitahata S. Taniguchi M. Beltran S.D. Sugimoto T. Okada S. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1983; 47: 1441-1447Crossref Google Scholar), Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum 39E (4Podkovyrov S.M. Zeikus J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5400-5405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Flavobacterium sp. (5Bender H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 39: 714-719Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Bacillus sphaericus E-244 (6Oguma T. Kikuchi M. Mizusawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1036: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We isolated and cloned a CDase gene from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. I-5. Like ThMA, the enzyme hydrolyzes β-CD 13 times faster than it hydrolyzes starch and is able to degrade acarbose, a potent pseudo-tetrasaccharide inhibitor of glucosidases (7Kim M.-J. Lee S.-B. Lee H.-S. Lee S.Y. Baek J.-S. Kim D. Moon T.-W. Robyt J.F. Park K.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We designated it as CDase on the basis of its about two times higher specific activity of hydrolyzing β-CD compared with ThMA and the highest sequence homology (59% sequence identity) to CDase from B. sphaericus(gi 1168855). We sought to find a structural basis, if any, for distinguishing CDase from MAase. Herein, we report the structure of CDase fromBacillus sp. I-5 (referred to as CDase hereafter) along with structure-inspired biochemical studies. The enzyme forms a dodecamer that is a hexamer of the dimeric form observed for ThMA and other related enzymes. We demonstrate that the formation of the supramolecular assembly results in an ∼10-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared with the dimeric unit of the enzyme. In addition, we determined the structure of an active-site mutant of ThMA in complex with β-CD, which led to the identification of Trp47 as an important residue in imparting the preference of the enzyme for β-CD over starch. The two structures and the recently reported structure of NPase (8Hondoh H. Kuriki T. Matsuura Y. First Symposium on the α-Amylase Family, September 30–October 4, Smolenice Castle, Smolenice, Slovakia. ASCO Art & Science, Bratislava, Slovakia2001: 48Google Scholar) provide enough information that CDase, NPase, and MAase are similar enough to be classified under the same name. Gene cloning and overproduction of CDase were carried out as described (9Kim T.-J. Shin J.-H., Oh, J.-H. Kim M.-J. Lee S.-B. Ryu S. Kwon K. Kim J.-W. Choi E.-H. Robyt J.F. Park K.-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli MC1061 cells carrying the CDase gene on plasmid pUC18 were grown in a 5-liter fermentor jar and harvested at a late log phase. Purification of the protein required fractionation by ammonium sulfate precipitation and the use of a Q-Sepharose column (Sigma), a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and a DEAE-8HR column (Waters). The CDase crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion from droplets containing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) plus 2 μl of precipitant solution containing 50% polyethylene glycol 200 and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.0), which were equilibrated against 1 ml of the same precipitant solution at 22 °C. The crystals belonged to the space group F23 and contained two molecules of CDase in the asymmetric unit. The E357L mutant ThMA gene was constructed by the site-directed mutagenesis method using a Muta-gene in vitromutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The vector construction resulted in the mutant enzyme fused to a His6 tag at the N terminus. The purification and crystallization of the mutant enzyme were carried out as reported previously for the wild-type enzyme (2Kim J.-S. Cha S.-S. Kim H.-J. Kim T.-J., Ha, N.-C., Oh, S.-T. Cho H.-S. Cho M.-J. Kim M.-J. Lee H.-S. Kim J.-W. Choi K.Y. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26279-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). E. coliBL21(DE3) cells carrying the mutant ThMA gene on the pUC119 plasmid were grown in flasks. The enzyme was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc.) and a Q-Sepharose column. The crystals of the mutant enzyme were isomorphous to those of the wild-type enzyme. They belonged to the space group P61and contained two molecules of ThMA in the asymmetric unit. The crystals were soaked in the precipitant solution containing 5 mm β-CD for 36 h before data collection. The x-ray diffraction data for CDase were collected from a flash-cooled crystal using synchrotron radiation. The cryoprotectant solution was the same as the precipitant solution. Despite the large size of the crystals (typically 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm), maximum resolution of the data was 3.2 Å, which can be attributed to the large size of the unit cell (see Table I). Data reduction, merging, and scaling were accomplished with the program HKL (10Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). By checking the data at the twin server (11Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), we found that the crystal was merohedrally twinned with a twin fraction of 0.4288 and the twin operator (k,−h,l). The data were detwinned according to the algorithm described by Yeates (11Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), removing the twin component in all reflections. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with the CCP4 version of AmoRe (12Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using the monomeric structure of ThMA (Protein Data Bank code 1SMA) as a search model. The resulting model was refined in conjunction with model rebuilding using the programs CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), respectively. The 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained until the last refinement. From the beginning of the refinement, 5% of total reflections from the native data set were set aside for monitoringRfree values. The final model containing 1166 amino acids were refined to an R value of 21.4% and anRfree value of 25.6% at 3.2-Å resolution.Table IStructure determination and crystallographic statisticsCDaseThMA · β-CDSourceBL6B1 (PAL)CuKαWavelength (Å)1.00001.5418Resolution range (Å)20.0 to 3.220.0 to 3.3Total/unique reflections671,314/51,030271,781/32,689Rsym(%)1-aRsym = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs.6.3 (17.8)10.7 (26.0)Completeness (%)90.8 (85.8)89.3 (81.4)Space groupF23P61Cell parameters (Å)a =b = c = 334.61a = b = 119.09, c = 270.20No. of refined protein atoms19,1649656R-factor1-bR-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ − ‖Fc∥/Σ‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ and ‖Fc‖ are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively./Rfree1-cRfree was calculated with 5% of the data.21.4/25.619.2/24.3r.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.00550.0079Angles1.226 °1.481 °Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored region60.276.6Additionally allowed region35.321.5Generously allowed region4.11.7Disallowed region0.50.31-a Rsym = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs.1-b R-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ − ‖Fc∥/Σ‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ and ‖Fc‖ are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.1-c Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data. Open table in a new tab The diffraction data for the ThMA·β-CD complex were collected with a crystal mounted on a capillary tube at room temperature on a Rigaku Raxis IV++ area detector system with a CuKαx-ray generated by rotating the anode generator operated at 100 mA and 50 kV. A short exposure time was employed to collect rather complete data at the sacrifice of the resolution due to a rapid radiation-decay of the crystal. When data were collected with a cryostream-cooled crystal mounted on a loop, the large unit cell dimensions of the crystal (see Table I) and difficulties in crystal alignment caused too many overlaps of the reflections. The structure of the complex was solved by direct refinement of the structure of wild-type ThMA (Protein Data Bank code 1SMA) against the diffraction data using the program CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The bound β-CD was placed into the fairly strong donut-shaped electron density. The statistics for the diffraction data and the final refined structures are given in Table I. The copper-bicinchoninate method was employed to measure the concentration of reducing sugars produced from the reaction of CDase or ThMA with β-CD (Sigma) or soluble starch (Showa Chemical Inc.) as a substrate (15Fox J.D. Robyt J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The mixture of enzyme and substrate was not agitated during the reaction, except for brief mixing at the start of the reaction. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of maltose equivalent. Size-exclusion column chromatography was employed to separate the dodecameric, dimer, and monomeric forms of CDase at different pH values. To investigate the association of the enzyme into a dodecamer, the enzyme solution was incubated in universal buffer (14.3 mm citric acid, 14.3 mm KH2PO4, 14.3 mmboric acid, and 14.3 mm diethylbarbituric acid) for 3 days at pH 6.0 and then transferred to the buffer solution with an adjusted pH of 7.0 at 4 °C. At appropriate time intervals, an aliquot of this solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. The dissociation of the enzyme was similarly investigated with a pH shift from 7.0 to 6.0. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements for CDase were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a four-hole rotor with standard six-channel cells at a rotor speed of 5000 rpm. The absorbanceversus radius distributions of the protein were recorded at 280 nm and evaluated using the nonlinear regression method of the SigmaPlot software (SPSS Inc.). The monomeric structure of CDase contains a distinct N-terminal domain in addition to a central (α/β)8-barrel domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal (residues 1–123) and C-terminal (residues 505–583) domains are composed exclusively of β-strands (Fig.1a). Two molecules of CDase form a domain-swapped dimer in which the N-terminal domain of one molecule is involved in extensive interactions with the (α/β)8-barrel domain of the adjacent molecule (Fig.1b), as is observed in the structure of ThMA, which is dimeric in both solution and crystals (2Kim J.-S. Cha S.-S. Kim H.-J. Kim T.-J., Ha, N.-C., Oh, S.-T. Cho H.-S. Cho M.-J. Kim M.-J. Lee H.-S. Kim J.-W. Choi K.Y. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26279-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the dimeric structures, the C-terminal domain is distinctively separated from the active-site groove and is not involved in main chain-to-main chain hydrogen bonds with either the N-terminal or (α/β)8-barrel domain. Instead, the interface between the C-terminal and (α/β)8-barrel domains consists predominantly of hydrophobic residues. We noticed that a mutant CDase lacking the C-terminal domain was expressed as an insoluble protein in E. coli, probably due to the exposure of an otherwise shielded hydrophobic surface. The C-terminal domain is found in the structures of all α-amylase family enzymes. Binding of raw starch is known to be the functional role of this domain in some amylases such as cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (16Ohdan K. Kuriki T. Takata H. Okada S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and barley α-amylase (17Sogaard M. Kadziola A. Haser R. Svensson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22480-22484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Tibbot B.K. Wong D.W. Robertson G.H. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In all the known structures of α-amylase family enzymes in complex with an oligosaccharide at the active site, the bound sugar molecule is not in contact with the C-terminal domain; and therefore, it plays no direct role in the hydrolysis of substrate. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain is critically involved in the supramolecular assembly of CDase as described below. The crystal packing of CDase revealed an assembly composed of six copies of the dimeric units (Fig.1b). The dimeric units are related by the crystallographic 2- and 3-fold symmetry axes of the cubic cell, resulting in a tightly packed hexameric assembly of the dimer (Fig. 1c). The predominant intermolecular interactions between the dimers are mediated by the C-terminal domain of one molecule and the N-terminal domain of an adjacent molecule. A solvent-accessible surface area of 564 Å2 of one monomer is excluded by the interactions of the C-terminal domain. The observation led us to probe the oligomerization state of CDase in solution by size-exclusion column chromatography and equilibrium centrifugation analysis at pH 7.5. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated as 638 kDa by the chromatographic method (Fig. 2a) and 687 kDa by centrifugation analysis (data not shown), which is ∼10 times larger than the calculated molecular mass of CDase (67,690.12 Da). These results and the crystallographic analysis demonstrate that CDase forms a dodecamer (or a hexamer of the dimer) at pH 7.5. The huge molecular size and the shape of the dodecamer are probably responsible for the underestimated molecular masses of the assembly in solution by the two methods. Although the oligomerization states of CDase and ThMA are different, a superposition of the C-α atoms of the dimeric or monomeric unit of CDase and of ThMA shows that the relative orientations of the C- and N-terminal domains with respect to the central domain are very similar in the two structures (Fig.1d). The observation indicates that the dimeric structure is highly conserved in the two proteins, which share 58% sequence identity. Unexpectedly, at pH 6.0, both the size-exclusion column chromatography and the analytical centrifugation indicated that CDase exists as a dimer in solution with a minor fraction of a monomer. We found that the dissociation of the dodecamer and the association of the dimer/monomer were slow enough at 4 °C to allow us to separate the dimer/monomer from the dodecamer and vice versa by size-exclusion column chromatography after pH shifts. By virtue of the slow process, the elution profile was used to monitor the interconversion between the two forms. The dodecameric form of the enzyme took ∼72 h of incubation at pH 6.0 and 4 °C to fully dissociate into the dimeric form (Fig. 2). It is a reversible process, and a complete dimer-to-dodecamer conversion at pH 7.0 required less time, with the apparent association rate being about two times faster than the apparent dissociation rate (data not shown). The conversions in both directions became faster at higher temperature, and the separation of the two forms was impossible at room temperature by column chromatography. All 12 active sites are outwardly located on the dodecameric assembly. The hexamer formation does not shield any of the active sites from the access of the bulk solvent and therefore from the access of a substrate molecule. Notably, three active sites related by the crystallographic 3-fold axis are close to each other, thereby forming four identical clusters of three active sites according to the cubic symmetry of the supramolecular assembly. Although the two active sites on the dimer are 180° away from each other, facing the opposite direction, the clustered active sites face each other (Fig.3a). The spatial arrangement of the active sites implied that the supramolecular assembly could confer a better enzyme activity than the dimeric form of ThMA and CDase because a hydrolyzed product released from one active site on the assembly would be readily accepted into the other active sites of a cluster (Fig. 3b). To test this possibility, we carried out the following experiments. The first experiment was to compare the specific activities of CDase and ThMA in the hydrolysis of β-CD, both under their optimal experimental conditions (pH 7.5 and 50 °C for CDase and pH 6.0 and 60 °C for ThMA). We found that the specific activity of CDase (320.5 ± 40.1 units/mg) is about two times higher than that of ThMA (159.6 ± 18.7 units/mg). The second experiment was to compare the Km and kcat values of CDase in the dimeric and dodecameric states for the hydrolysis of β-CD. In one experiment, the enzyme was equilibrated with a buffer solution at pH 6.0 for 3 days at 4 °C. An aliquot of the solution of the enzyme, which must be in the dimeric state, was reacted with the substrate at pH 6.0 and 50 °C. In a parallel experiment, equilibration and reaction of the enzyme at pH 7.0 were performed to measure the reactivity of the enzyme in the dodecameric state. The dodecameric form of the enzyme at pH 7.0 exhibited an ∼10 times higherkcat/Km value than the dimeric form at pH 6.0 (Table II). Conceivably, kcat values of the two oligomeric forms should be similar, but they differ by 5-fold (Table II). We speculate that the difference, despite the identical active site in the two forms, is probably due to different hydrolysis rates for β-CD, maltohexaose, and maltotetraose. To determine whether the different enzyme activities may arise from chemical effects, i.e.changes in the ionization states of the active-site residues, we measured the enzyme activities of the dodecameric form at two different pH values. We first generated the dodecameric form of the enzyme by equilibrating it with the buffer solution at pH 7.0 for 3 days. Each of the same aliquots of the enzyme solution was reacted with the substrate at pH 6.0 and 7.0, respectively. Nearly the same enzyme activities were observed for the dodecameric form at pH 7 and 6 (data not shown). This control experiment indicates that the 10 times higher catalytic efficiency of the dodecameric form at pH 7 compared with that of the dimeric form at pH 6 arises from the physical difference, i.e. the difference in the oligomeric states. It represents a novel example of how oligomerization of an enzyme increases catalytic efficiency in hydrolyzing a polymeric substrate that requires multiple entries into the active site for complete degradation.Table IIKinetic parameters of CDase in two different oligomeric states for the hydrolysis of β-CDKmkcatkcat/Kmmmmin−1pH 6.0 (dimer)1.43 ± 0.11101 ± 670.4 ± 6.9pH 7.0 (dodecamer)0.70 ± 0.05521 ± 23745 ± 60.0 Open table in a new tab To understand the structural basis for the preference of ThMA and other related enzymes, we determined the structure of a catalytically inactive mutant ThMA (E357L) in complex with β-CD at 3.3-Å resolution. The crystals of this dimeric enzyme were easier to work with than those of CDase. The substrate is bound to the deep active-site groove and interacts with various residues of both the (α/β)8-barrel and N-terminal domains (Fig. 4). Although the central domain residues interact with the substrate at the bottom part of the active site, the N-terminal domain residues Tyr45, Trp47, and Asp110 interact with the substrate at the upper part of the active site. The aromatic ring of Phe289 interacts with the inner part of the ring structure of the bound β-CD, whereas Trp47 provides a stacking interaction with one of the sugar rings located at the entrance of the active site. Tyr45 provides a rather remote interaction with the substrate compared with the two residues. In the 20 enzymes present in the public data bases with the annotation of CDase, MAase, or NPase, Tyr45 is conserved or substituted with phenylalanine in two entries. Trp47 is also conserved or substituted with phenylalanine (two entries), tyrosine (one entry), or proline (two entries) (Fig. 5). Asp110 is close to one of the hydroxyl groups of the bound β-CD and could be involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction. However, this residue is not a conserved residue, as it is substituted with valine, leucine, or methionine in three entries (Fig. 5). A Y45A mutant exhibited only a slightly decreased reaction rate (<2-fold) in hydrolyzing both β-CD and soluble starch (data not shown). In contrast, the W47A substitution resulted in differential decreases in enzyme activity toward the two substrates, as shown in Table III. Markedly, the mutation increased theKm by >10-fold for β-CD and by <2-fold for soluble starch. Therefore, Trp47 is an important residue in imparting the preference of the enzyme for β-CD over starch. The structure of the complex suggests that Trp47, located at the entrance to the active site, may not be reached by the linear starch chain, unless it is highly bent at the active site to assume a ring-like conformation that mimics the CD ring.FIG. 5Sequence alignment of ThMA and other amylolytic enzymes. These entries, except for T. vulgaris α-amylase II (TVAII) (gi 4557942) and TAKA amylase A (TAA) (gi 113779), are annotated as CDase, NPase, or MAase in the data bases. They were retrieved with the sequence of ThMA using a BLAST search (24Zhang Z. Schaffer A.A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure and the solution study demonstrated that CDase adopts a dodecameric form in solution at pH >7. As far as we know, the dodecamer is by far the highest oligomeric state observed for an amylolytic enzyme. In the oligomer formation, the C-terminal domain plays a central role in providing a large contact surface between the dimeric units. At least in this enzyme and probably in other related enzymes of alkalophilic organisms, the function of this domain may lie in the oligomer formation. We investigated whether the dodecamer formation imparts a better thermostability by using differential scanning calorimetry. Although the onset temperature of denaturation of CDase was 64.4 °C at pH 7.0, it decreased to 61.0 °C at pH 6.0, indicating a marginal enhancement in the thermostability by forming the dodecameric assembly (data not shown). The most salient feature of the dodecamer is that the oligomerization brings the active sites close together in space, forming four clusters of the actives sites on the supramolecular assembly. The deposition of the active sites on the assembly strongly indicated that the dodecamer is not a random assembly, but a molecular design that allows more efficient hydrolysis of the substrate, which is converted finally to maltose by repeated enzymatic cleavages. We demonstrated that the dodecameric form of the enzyme exhibits ∼10 times higher catalytic efficiency than the dimeric form toward β-CD. We also noted that the dodecameric form of CDase is able to hydrolyze β-CD two times faster than the dimeric enzyme ThMA despite the lower reaction temperature employed for CDase. These data suggest that the physical clustering of the active sites results in the enhanced catalytic activity of the enzyme. A degradation product released from one active site could have a high chance to enter into a nearby active site on the same dodecameric assembly. Therefore, it will spend less time before entering into another active site in comparison to the degradation of the substrate by the dimeric enzyme, in which the same product released from one active site would travel a relatively long distance until it reaches the other active site. Other related enzymes of alkalophilic organisms with a pH optimum of ∼7 may also form the dodecameric structure reported here. Although salient, the dodecamerization should not be a criterion distinguishing CDases from MAases and NPases because the dimeric unit is the common and conserved structural feature of all of these enzymes, whereas the pH-dependent dodecamerization seen in this particular enzyme is a variation of the theme. The structure ofBacillus stearothermophilus neopullulanase was determined recently and exhibits a domain-swapped dimer formation that is nearly identical to those of ThMA and CDase (8Hondoh H. Kuriki T. Matsuura Y. First Symposium on the α-Amylase Family, September 30–October 4, Smolenice Castle, Smolenice, Slovakia. ASCO Art & Science, Bratislava, Slovakia2001: 48Google Scholar). The presence of the novel N-terminal domain is the most salient feature distinguishing these enzymes from other amylolytic enzymes. With a mutant ThMA containing the deletion of the N-terminal domain, we previously demonstrated that the domain is important for the dimerization, stability, and substrate preference of the enzyme for β-CD (19Kim T.-J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14182-14190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We suggested that the narrow and deep active-site cleft shaped by the N-terminal domain that partly covers the otherwise wide and shallow cleft would physically restrict the easy access of the linear starch chain, whereas it allows efficient binding of CDs (1Park K.-H.

Herein, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain residue Trp47 provides a catalytically important interaction with CDs, whereas it provides a mere interaction with soluble starch. We suggest that the physical shape of the active site, as well as the favorable interaction provided by Trp47, allows efficient binding of CDs to the active site of these enzymes. In addition to Trp47, the central domain residue Phe289 in ThMA appears to provide catalytically more important interactions with β-CD than with soluble starch. This is because the substitution of Phe286 with alanine in Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 α-amylase II, which is structurally similar to ThMA, results in more significant reduction of the kcat of the enzyme for β-CD (63-fold) than for starch (2-fold) (20Kondo S. Ohtaki A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the mutation causes similar increases in the Km values for β-CD (3.6-fold) and starch (5.2-fold), indicating that the residue is important for chemical steps in the catalytic reaction with β-CD. In the structure of ThMA in complex with β-CD, Phe289, which corresponds to Phe286 in T. vulgaris α-amylase II, provides prominent interactions with an inner part of the β-CD ring (Fig. 4). The interactions could be important for precise positioning of the scissile bond of CDs with respect to the catalytic residues. It should be noted that Phe289 is invariant in the three groups of enzymes, but is substituted with aspartic acid in TAKA amylase A (Fig. 5), which is a nearly invariant residue in the typical smaller α-amylases. In retrospect, different investigators have independently coined each of the three names mainly based on their observation of the preference for CDs over other starch materials such as amylose and pullulan (CDase), the hydrolysis of pullulan to produce panose (NPase), or the production of maltose as the main product from CDs and starch (MAase) by an enzyme under study. ThMA and CDase display all of these catalytic activities, and other related enzymes are expected to have the catalytic property in common. We propose that these enzymes should be classified under the same name and enzyme code to avoid confusion. Cyclomaltodextrinase is probably the best name of choice for two reasons. First, CDs are the most preferred substrates for these enzymes, although some variations may exist in the relative hydrolytic activity of these enzymes toward starch or pullulan, the less preferred substrates. Second, the open reading frames for CDase, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase, and the CD uptake system are commonly found as a gene cluster on the chromosomal DNA in several organisms, including Klebsiella oxytoca (21Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (22Fujiwara S. Okuyama S. Imanaka T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and Thermococcus sp. strain B1001 (23Hashimoto Y. Yamamoto T. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5050-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase is an extracellular enzyme, whereas CDase (MAase and NPase) is an intracellular enzyme. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these enzymes have been evolved for intracellular degradation of CDs generated extracellularly by cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase and transported into the cell by a specific uptake system. We suggest that the presence of the N-terminal domain is the primary criterion and that the conservation of hydrophobic residues corresponding to Trp47 and Phe289 in ThMA is a secondary criterion that could be used for distinguishing CDases from other amylolytic enzymes. In this context, nine entries in the data bases containing no N-terminal domain but denoted as CDase (three entries), MAase (one entry), and NPase (five entries) are incorrectly annotated. Also, in this context, T. vulgaris α-amylase II is considered as a novel variant of CDase in that it hydrolyzes starch as well as CDs efficiently and exhibits similar Kmvalues for CDs and starch on a weight/volume basis (20Kondo S. Ohtaki A. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. Kamitori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), in contrast with ThMA, which exhibits an ∼43-fold lower Km for β-CD compared with that for starch. The substitution of Trp47 with serine in T. vulgaris α-amylase II is likely to be primarily responsible for the difference. In conclusion, the data regarding CDase, NPase, and MAase provided by this study and by others reported in the literature convincingly suggest that they are nearly the same enzymes in terms of their structures and catalytic property and that they can be rather easily distinguished from other amylases on the basis of the presence of the N-terminal domain and the conservation of Trp47 and Phe289.

The sequences of the human proteins show extensive similarities to their Escherichia coli counterparts (hClpP, 56% identity and 71% similarity in a 192-amino acid overlap; hClpX, 44% identity and 62% similarity in a 415-amino acid overlap), including conservation of all of the known catalytic residues of the E. coli proteins.

Complexes are formed by the interaction of six-membered rings of ClpX and seven-membered rings of ClpP. Although a similar symmetry mismatch apparently exists in the 26 S proteasomes between the six ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulatory particle and the seven α subunits of the 20 S proteasome, such mismatches are not the rule in ATP-dependent proteases; for example, HslUV (ClpYQ) is a symmetrical complex between six-membered rings of both components. Further, no mismatch is possible in ATP-dependent dependent proteases such as Lon and FtsH, which are oligomers of single polypeptide chains with independently folding ATPase and protease domains. The mechanistic consequences of symmetry mismatch are not understood, and until now, it has not been known whether it is a universal feature of ClpXP or ClpAP proteases. Because Clp proteases play important and even essential regulatory roles in many organisms, we have undertaken an investigation of the activity and substrate specificity of the human mitochondrial ClpXP. Our results confirm that symmetry mismatch between ClpX and ClpP is conserved in human ClpXP complexes. We also show that contacts between the two components are conserved well enough to allow complex formation between heterologous components from E. coli and humans. Finally, we show that the bacterial and human ClpXP proteases degrade different proteins and that ClpX is responsible for substrate selection. A probe was made with an EcoRI fragment of cDNA clone HFBCC47 originally reported by Adams et al. (18Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) to have a sequence similar to E. coli ClpP. This probe was used to screen by filter hybridization a human hippocampal cDNA library (Stratagene). The cDNA inserts from the positive phage clones were rescued as phagemids by in vivo excision. The size of the insert was determined by EcoRI digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. One clone, pBluescript SKII/hClpP11, contained an insert of about 1.1 kb. The sequence on both strands was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method on an ABI automated DNA sequencer using universal T7 and T3 oligonucleotide primers as well as custom primers. The sequence confirmed the presence of the entire coding region for hClpP. hClpP and mutated forms were cloned into the pVEX11 vector (Novagen), in a position that allowed hClpP expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) clpP::kan after induction of T7 RNA polymerase with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. A gene encoding mature hClpP was first amplified by PCR using the primers, 5′-CGACCCGGCATATGCCGCTCATTCCCATCGTGGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGCCAAGCTTTCAGGTGCTAGCTGGGACAGGTTCTGC-3′, which resulted in NdeI and Hin dIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the coding region of hClpP. The digested PCR fragment was inserted between the NdeI and Hin dIII sites of pVEX11, creating pVEX11hClpP. His6 was attached to the C terminus of hClpP by PCR to facilitate the purification of hClpP. The above NdeI primer was used with a Hin dIII primer, 5′-CCTCCACATAAGCTTTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGTGCTAGCTGGGACAGGTTCTGCTGC-3′, for PCR. The product was digested with NdeI and Hin dIII and inserted into pVEX11, creating pVEX11hClpPhis. For hClpP lacking the C-terminal extension, PCR was performed with the above 5′-NdeI primer and a 3′-Hin dIII primer, 5′-ATCCTCAAGCTTTCAATTACGGTGGATCAGAACCTTGTCTAAGATGCC-3′, which removed 28 codons of hClpP and inserted the E. coli (e) ClpP C-terminal codons for Arg and Thr. The recombinant plasmids to produce the mutant form at Ser-97 to Ala or Cys were constructed using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) as described in the manufacturer's manual. pVEX11/hClpP(his) plasmid was used as the template. The mutagenic oligonucleotides for changing Ser-97 to Ala were 5′–CCAGGCCGCCGCCATGGGCTCCCTGCTTCTCGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCCCATGGCGGCGGCCTGGCCCACGCACCAGG-3′. The primers for Ser-97 to Cys were 5′-CCAGGCCGCCTGCATGGGCTCCCTGCTTCTCGCCGCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCCCATGCAGGCGGCCTGGCCCACGCACC- AGG-3′. The cells carrying pVEX11/hClpP plasmids were grown with shaking in LB medium at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight cultures were transferred to fresh medium and grown to A600 = 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added, and growth was continued for an additional 3 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were suspended in 50 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer B). The cells were then disrupted in a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The purification of hClpP is reported elsewhere. 2B. Ahvazi, S. G. Kang, M. T. Thompson, M. R. Maurizi, and T. Mueser, manuscript in preparation. For purification of hClpP-His6, the supernatant after centrifugation was passed over a 1-ml talon column (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding buffer containing 10 mm imidazole was used to remove loosely bound protein. hClpP-His6 was eluted using binding buffer containing 300 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. hClpP-His6was further purified by gel filtration on a 1.6 × 60 cm Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mmTris buffer, pH 8.0. For hClpPΔC, the 0.05% poly(ethyleneimine) supernatant was loaded onto a 1.4 × 8-cm column of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a gradient of 0.1–0.4 m KCl. hClpPΔC was precipitated with 65% saturated ammonium sulfate, dissolved in buffer with 0.1 mKCl, and passed over a 1.6 × 60-cm column of Superdex 200 in the same buffer. The hClpPΔC was collected, loaded onto a 10/10 MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a gradient of KCl. To produce functional hClpX and mClpX in E. coli, expression vectors were constructed using pVEX11. The template for hClpX was a human cDNA clone obtained from P. Bross (Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark) and for mClpX, a mouse cDNA clone obtained from Dr. S. Santagata (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). For hCLPX, the primers were hclpXD64_t, 5′-ACACCAGCACATATGGCCTCAAAAGATGGGATAAGTAAAGATGG-3′, and hclpX_b, 5′-CCGCAATATAAGCTTTTAGCTGTTTGCAGCATCTGCTTGGCGGG-3′. For mCLPX the primers were mclpXD65_t, 5′-CCGCGTGGACATATGGCCTCAAAAGACGGGGCAAACAAGGATGGC-3′, and mclpX_b, 5′-TGAGAGTCTAAGCTTTTAGCTGTTTGCACGATCCGCTTGACGAGG-3′. The primers introduced NdeI and Hin dIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and were designed to encode the full-length ClpX protein starting from codon 65 of the hClpX or codon 66 of the mClpX reading frame. The NdeI/Hin dIII-digested PCR fragments were inserted between NdeI and Hin dIII sites of pVEX11, creating pVEX11/hClpX-NΔ65pVEX11/hClpX-NΔ64 and pVEX11/mClpX-NΔ65. BL21 (DE3) RP cells (Stratagene) with a null mutation in clpP and carrying the plasmid pVEX11/hClpXΔ65 or pVEX11/mClpXΔ65 were grown as described above in the presence of 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Following the 3-h induction, the cells were harvested and suspended in 50 ml of ice-cold binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 10% glycerol). The cells were then disrupted by French press, and the insoluble material was collected by centrifugation. The insoluble material was suspended in 50 ml of binding buffer containing 6 m urea, and after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, any residual insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant protein was refolded by stepwise removal of the urea in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μmZnCl2. After refolding the protein, any residual insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1.4 × 8-cm hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (5 mmphosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and eluted with a linear gradient of 5–300 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The fractions containing hClpX or mClpX were pooled and loaded onto a 0.7 × 2.5-cm Hitrap-Heparin (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0m NaCl, and the fractions with mClpX were pooled. The purity was estimated by SDS-PAGE. The buffer used for most assays was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% Triton X-100. For nucleotide-dependent reactions, 10 mmMgCl2 and either 1 mm ATPγS or 4 mm ATP were included. The assays for [3H]λO protein degradation and ATPase activity were described by Grimaud et al.

SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed with a 0.32 × 30-cm Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The columns were equilibrated with buffer B with or without 1 mm ATPγS. The samples were loaded in volumes of 50–100 μl of the same buffer, and the flow rates were 0.08 ml/min. The protein was monitored at 280 nm, and the fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The procedures for specimen sample preparation, recording of electron micrographs, and digital image analysis were previously reported (23Ortega J. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1515-1521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). With hClpP protein, concentrations of 50 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol were used. With ClpX, conditions were similar except that 2 mm ATPγS was added to the buffer. hClpXP complexes were made with 1 mg/ml hClpX and 0.5 mg/ml hClpP in the presence of 2 mm ATPγS, and diluted 1:10 or 1:20 for microscopy. The scanned images were analyzed for symmetry using the rotostat procedure described previously (24Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Cerritelli M. Cheng N. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1995; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). After scanning of the micrograph, correlation averaging of typically 500 particles was performed with PIC-III (25Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Images were obtained after further symmetry averaging: 6- or 7-fold rotational symmetry operations for ClpX or ClpP and two 2-fold symmetry operations (top to bottom and left to right) for 2:1 complexes. Enzymatically inactive ClpP was prepared by incubating ClpP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v). At different times, the reaction was stopped, and the protein was separated from unreacted diisopropyl fluorophosphate by precipitation with 2 volumes of cold acetone. ClpP was dissolved in buffer B and run over a small Sephadex G-25 column in buffer B to remove residual solvent and reagents. Sequence alignment of hClpP with the amino acid sequence of E. coliClpP showed that hClpP possesses an N-terminal extension of about 42 amino acids, and this extension displays properties of typical mitochondrial targeting sequences (14Corydon T.J.

Based on alignment with mature E. coli ClpP (Fig. 1A), we chose Pro-57 between the first negatively charged residue (Glu-64) and the closest upstream arginine residue (Arg-54) for the start site. Our hClpP start site differs from the hClpPs cloned previously, which were either one amino acid shorter (14Corydon T.J. Bross P. Holst H.U. Biochem.

Expression of hClpP in E. coli produced a band with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa on SDS-PAGE; most of the expressed protein was found to be soluble. hClpP was purified to over 95% homogeneity (Fig. 2A). N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the first amino acid was proline, indicating processing of the N-terminal methionine in vivo (data not shown). We also expressed and purified a truncated mutant of hClpP, hClpPΔC, which lacks the C-terminal 28 amino acids of hClpP (Fig. 2A).Figure 2Purified bacterially expressed hClpP and hClpX.

Bross P. Holst H.U. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This peptide as well as several other fluorogenic and chromogenic peptides were not degraded by our hClpP (Table I), hClpPΔC, nor by any hClpXP complexes (data not shown). However, we found that when peptidase activity was monitored by direct observation of peptide products separated by reverse phase chromatography, several other peptides could be degraded by hClpP alone (Table I). hClpP degraded oxidized insulin B chain (Table I) as well as the peptide, FAPHMALVPV (cleptide), which is very rapidly degraded by eClpP (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Insulin B chain was cut primarily at single sites in an apparently nonprocessive manner (data not shown). Cleptide was cut at the same site cleaved by eClpP, and the cleavage rate was stimulated about 20-fold in the presence of hClpX (Table II). Thus, contrary to the implications of previous reports, hClpP has significant peptidase activity; however, it might not have good amidase activity, or the bulky aromatic group might interfere with positioning the peptide in the substrate-binding site.Table IPeptide degradation by hClpP and eClpPSubstrateAmount of peptide cleavedhClpPeClpPnmolSuccinyl-Leu-Tyr-AMC1-aAMC, aminomethylcoumarin.07cleptide2.520Insulin B chain1.72.4Peptidase activity was measured in 50 μl of standard reaction solution with 10 pmol of human or E. coli ClpP14.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To investigate the structure and enzymatic properties of the hClpXP complex, we expressed and purified hClpX. To maximize the alignment with eClpX (Fig. 1B), translation was initiated from codon 65 of hClpX. hClpX was purified from the soluble fraction (Fig. 2B) or from inclusion bodies; structural and enzymatic properties of both forms were similar. Purified mClpX had a somewhat greater tendency to aggregate but otherwise had properties similar to the human protein. As initially purified, hClpX was in a mixed oligomeric state, but addition of ATPγS promoted formation of a monodisperse species that migrated as a hexamer on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Fig. 3A). Electron micrographs of negatively stained hClpX in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 4A) were analyzed for symmetry, and a strong 6-fold symmetry component was found (Fig. 4H). Averaging of the images showed top views of six-membered rings (Fig. 4C) similar to those observed with eClpX. We also confirmed that our purified hClpP particles had 7-fold symmetry (Fig. 4H) and presented easily discernable seven-membered rings in the a"

Slt2 is activated by dual phosphorylation of a threonine and tyrosine residue in response to several environmental stresses that perturb cell integrity. Negative regulation of Slt2 is achieved via dephosphorylation by two protein-tyrosine phosphatases, Ptp2 and Ptp3, and a dual specificity phosphatase, Msg5. In this study, we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the stress-inducible dual specificity phosphatase, Sdp1, negatively regulates Slt2 by direct dephosphorylation. Deletion ofSDP1 exacerbated growth defects due to overexpression of Mkk1p386, a constitutively active mutant of Slt2 MAPK kinase, whereas overexpression of Sdp1 suppressed lethality caused by Mkk1p386 overexpression. The heat shock-induced phosphorylation level of Slt2 was elevated in an sdp1Δstrain compared with that of the wild type, and heat shock-activated phospho-Slt2 was dephosphorylated by recombinant Sdp1 in vitro. Under normal growth conditions, an Sdp1-GFP fusion protein was localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the Sdp1-GFP protein translocated to punctate spots throughout the cell after heat shock. SDP1 transcription was induced by several stress conditions in an Msn2/4-dependent manner but independent of the Rlm1 transcription factor, a downstream target activated by Slt2. Induction of SLT2 by high osmolarity was dependent on Rlm1 transcription factor and Hog1 kinase, suggesting cross-talk between Slt2 and Hog1 MAPK pathways.

The MAPK cascades are sequential phosphorylation-mediated activation of three kinases, MAPK kinase kinase, MAPK kinase, and MAPK (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPK requires phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine residues of a TXY motif in the activation loop. Therefore, inactivation of MAPK can be achieved by dephosphorylation of either of the two phosphorylation sites. It has been demonstrated that three types of phosphatases, protein-tyrosine phosphatase, serine/threonine phosphatase, and dual specificity phosphatase, are involved in negative regulation of MAPK from yeast to mammals (3Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes five MAPKs involved in distinct cellular responses (4Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The four MAPKs present in vegetative cells, Fus3, Kss1, Hog1, and Slt2/Mpk1, are involved in the mating-pheromone response, filamentation-invasion pathway, high osmolarity growth, and cell integrity pathway, respectively. It has been known that two protein-tyrosine phosphatases, Ptp2 and Ptp3, a dual specificity phosphatase Msg5, and type 2C serine/threonine phosphatases are involved in differential inactivation of distinct MAPKs. Ptp3 dephosphorylates Fus3 to maintain a low basal activity and to inactivate Fus3 following pheromone stimulation, and its homologue Ptp2 also plays a minor role as a Fus3 phosphatase (5Zhan X.L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1690-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ptp2 and Ptp3 are also involved in negative regulation of Hog1 and Slt2 for maintaining low basal activities and for adaptation following osmotic stress and heat shock, respectively (6Jacoby T.

However, for Hog1 and Slt2 kinases, Ptp2 is more effective than Ptp3. Targets of the Msg5 dual specificity phosphatase include Fus3, Slt2, and Kss1 (5Zhan X.L. Deschenes R.J. Guan K.L.

Msg5 is involved in recovery from pheromone-induced G1 arrest by dephosphorylating Fus3 kinase (11Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The type 2C protein phosphatase Ptc1 inactivates Hog1 for maintaining low basal levels of Hog1 activity and adaptation in response to osmotic stress (13Warmka J. Hanneman J. Lee J. Amin D. Ota I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A genetic interaction suggests an involvement of Ptc1 in the protein kinase C pathway; however, there is currently no evidence for direct dephosphorylation of Slt2 by Ptc1 (14Huang K.N. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Slt2 cell integrity pathway is involved in maintenance of cell shape and integrity during vegetative growth and mating. This pathway is activated by several environmental stimuli such as heat shock (15Martin H. Arroyo J. Sanchez M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), hypoosmotic stress (16Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol.

Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Rho1 binds and activates Pkc1, which elicits serial activation of the Slt2 MAPK module composed of MAPK kinase kinase (Bck1), two redundant MAPK kinases (Mkk1/Mkk2), and a MAPK (Slt2) (23Heinisch J.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5001-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) transcription factors are two downstream targets of Slt2. Most Rlm1-regulated genes encode cell wall proteins or enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis (27Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). SBF is a heterodimer complex composed of the Swi4 and Swi6 proteins, which regulates gene expression during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (28Koch C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). SBF-activated genes are involved in budding and in membrane and cell wall biosynthesis (29Iyer V.R. Horak C.E. Scafe C.S. Botstein D. Snyder M. Brown P.O. Nature. 2001; 409: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Slt2 is down-regulated by the phosphatases Ptp2, Ptp3, and Msg5. However, little is known about the precise mechanism of negative regulation of Slt2. Since the completion of the genome sequence of S. cerevisiae, genomic scale analyses have provided a wealth of information to experimentally examine the potential function of newly identified proteins and their interactions. One of the reports analyzing global protein-protein interactions using two-hybrid screens suggested an interaction between the Slt2 kinase and Yil113w, a potential dual specificity phosphatase (30Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A., Li, Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). In addition, the genome-wide analysis of genomic expression patterns in response to environmental stresses showed induction of YIL113W mRNA expression under stress conditions (31Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that Yil113w (renamed as Sdp1 for stress-inducibledual specificity phosphatase) dephosphorylates Slt2 in vivo and in vitro. The function and Msn2/4-dependent stress-induced expression ofSDP1 demonstrate a role for Sdp1 in negative regulation of Slt2 following stress activation. All the kinase (slt2Δ and hog1Δ) and phosphatase (ptp2Δ, ptp3Δ, msg5Δ, and sdp1Δ) deletion strains used in this study are strains derivative of BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) or homozygous diploids in the BY4743 background (MATa/α his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0) (Research Genetics). The JH20 (ptp2Δ::kanMX4sdp1Δ::His3MX6) and JH21 (SDP1-13Myc:His3MX6) strains were generated from BY4741ptp2Δ and BY4741, respectively, by a PCR-based integration procedure (32Longtine M.S.

The msn2msn4 and rlm1Δ strains are derived from W303–1A (MATa ade2–1 can1–100 his3–11, 15 leu2–3,-112 trp1–1 ura3–1). The msn2msn4 mutant (33Estruch F. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Estruch, and the rlm1Δ strain (rlm1Δ::kanMX6) was generated by PCR-mediated gene deletion method (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking proper amino acids to maintain plasmids. Plasmid pNV7-MKK1p386(PGAL1MKK1p386) (24Watanabe Y. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5740-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by K. Irie and K. Matsumoto, and plasmid YEp352-SLT2-3HA (25Madden K. Sheu Y.J. Baetz K. Andrews B. Snyder M. Science. 1997; 275: 1781-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from M. Snyder. Plasmid pRS415-SDP1 was generated by cloning a 1.6-kb PCR product, which contains SDP1 promoter region up to −1000 and SDP1 open reading frame with a NotI restriction site before the stop codon, into pRS415 lacking theNotI site. To generate plasmid pRS415-SDP1-GFP, a 750-bp NotI fragment of GFP derived from pSF1-GFP1 was inserted into theNotI site of pRS415-SDP1. ABamHI/SalI fragment from pRS415-SDP1and a BamHI fragment from pRS415-SDP1-GFP were cloned into pRS425 to generate pRS425-SDP1 and pRS425-SDP1-GFP, respectively. Plasmid pRS425-SLT2-GFP containing SLT2 open reading frame and promoter region up to −1000 was constructed with the same strategy for generation of pRS425-SDP1-GFP. Yeast extracts for immunoblot analysis of Slt2 were prepared as follows. Yeast cells were grown toA600 of 0.7 in YPD medium at 25 °C and then shifted to 39 °C for heat shock. Cells were harvested by adding an equal volume of ice, washed with ice-cold water, and then frozen in dry ice. Cell pellet from 30 ml of culture was broken by vortexing with glass beads in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mmNa2H2P2O7, 15 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.2 mmsodium orthovanadate) with protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). 100–150 μg of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to nylon membrane. Phosphorylated Slt2 was detected with anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs), and Slt2 was detected with anti-Slt2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate kit from Pierce. The SDP1 open reading frame was cloned in pGEX-3X GST gene fusion vector (AmershamBiosciences), and GST-Sdp1 was purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by a standard protocol. GST-Sdp1 fusion protein was cleaved with factor Xa protease, and the GST protein was removed by incubation with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). The BY4741slt2Δ cells containing YEp352-SLT2-3HA were grown in SC-Ura medium at 25 °C to A600 of 0.7 and then heat-shocked at 39 °C for 1 h to activate Slt2. 1 mg of cell extracts was incubated with 2 μg of anti-HA antibody (3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by further incubation with 40 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h. The precipitates were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and three times with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and then resuspended in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer. 20 μl of precipitated material was incubated with 1 μg of Sdp1 protein at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 2 mm sodium orthovanadate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and subjected to anti-phospho-p42/44 immunoblotting to detect phosphorylated Slt2–3HA. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-HA antibody to determine the levels of Slt2–3HA. Co-immunoprecipitation of Sdp1–13Myc and Slt2–3HA was carried out as follows. JH21 strain, in which the SDP1 gene was replaced by SDP1-13Myc, was transformed with YEp352-SLT2–3HA or YEp352 plasmid. Cells were grown in SC-Ura medium up to A600 of 0.7 at 25 °C and then shifted to 39 °C for 1 h. Both heat-treated and untreated cells were broken in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors. 1 mg of cell extracts was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and protein A-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed five times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The eluted materials were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibody or anti-Myc (9E10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibody. Yeast cells were grown in YPD medium to A600 of 0.7 at 30 °C and shifted to 39 °C for heat shock. For oxidative stress or osmotic stress, a final concentration of 0.3 mm H2O2or an equal volume of YPD containing 2 m sorbitol was added to the culture and incubated further at 30 °C. PCR-amplified open reading frames of SLT2, MSG5, SDP1, and ACT1 were used as probes for Northern blotting. For the detection of PTP2 and PTP3 mRNA, 0.7-kbSpeI/NcoI and 0.9-kbXbaI/HindIII internal fragments were used, respectively. To localize Sdp1 and Slt2, BY4743 diploid sdp1Δ cells containing pRS425-SDP1-GFP and slt2Δ cells containing pRS425-SLT2-GFP were grown in SC-Leu medium. 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added for nuclear staining, and the fluorescence images were detected using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-2 cooled CCD camera. To test the possible role of the Sdp1 (Yil113w) dual specificity phosphatase in regulation of Slt2 kinase, we examined whether deletion or overexpression of SDP1 could affect growth defects caused by hyperactivation of the Slt2 pathway. Overexpression of the Mkk1p386 allele, which was originally identified as a suppressor of the cell lysis phenotype of a bck1Δ strain, inhibits growth by constitutive activation of the downstream MAPK Slt2 (24Watanabe Y. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5740-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Yashar B. Irie K. Printen J.A. Stevenson B.J. Sprague G.F., Jr. Matsumoto K. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6545-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains were transformed with plasmid pNV7-MKK1p386(PGAL1MKK1p386) (24Watanabe Y. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5740-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), in which the MKK1p386 allele is under the control of theGAL1 promoter, and tested for growth on medium containing glucose (repressing) or galactose (inducing) (Fig.1A). A growth defect observed on galactose medium by MKK1p386overexpression was exacerbated in ptp2Δ and msg5Δ deletion strains compared with the wild type as previously reported (8Mattison C.P. Spencer S.S. Kresge K.A. Lee J. Ota I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7651-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Watanabe Y. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5740-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although a previous report indicated no difference in growth between wild type and ptp3Δ strains uponMKK1p386 overexpression (8Mattison C.P. Spencer S.S. Kresge K.A. Lee J. Ota I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7651-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we could observe a modest growth defect in the ptp3Δ strain under our experimental conditions, perhaps reflecting a minor contribution of Ptp3 in Slt2 dephosphorylation compared with Ptp2. The effect ofSDP1 deletion on the MKK1p386phenotype was weaker than that of the PTP3 deletion, but the sdp1Δ strain also showed poorer growth than the wild type on galactose medium with virtually indistinguishable growth on glucose medium. As a corollary experiment, we tested whether overexpression of Sdp1 could suppress the slow growth phenotype of yeast cells expressing Mkk1p386. Expression of SDP1 both on a low copy number plasmid (pRS415) and a high copy number plasmid (pRS425) suppressed Mkk1p386-mediated growth defects insdp1Δ strains (Fig. 1B). Expression of an Sdp1-GFP fusion protein (pRS425-SDP1-GFP) in thesdp1Δ strain restored growth on galactose medium to the same extent of pRS425-SDP1 expression. Since expression of Sdp1 can reverse growth defects associated with hyperactivation of the Slt2 pathway and Slt2 is activated by phosphorylation, we investigated the possibility that phosphorylated Slt2 might be a direct target for the action of the Sdp1 putative phosphatase. To this end, we compared the heat-induced phosphorylation state of Slt2 in wild type and sdp1Δ strains using anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody, which can recognize phosphorylated Thr190 and Tyr192 in the activation loop of Slt2 (10Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). When wild type cells were shifted from 25 to 39 °C, phosphorylation of Slt2 was weakly detected after 10 min and reached higher levels after 60 min. In comparison, the ptp2Δ, sdp1Δ, and ptp2Δsdp1Δ mutants showed slightly higher basal levels and significantly higher heat-induced levels of phosphorylation of Slt2. Phosphorylation of Slt2 was highly induced 10 min after heat shock in ptp2Δ and ptp2Δsdp1Δ compared with the wild type or sdp1Δ strain. Theptp2Δsdp1Δ strain showed slightly higher levels of Slt2 phosphorylation after heat shock than ptp2Δ. Although previous reports using an Slt2-HA overexpression vector showed no induction of Slt2 protein levels in response to heat shock (8Mattison C.P. Spencer S.S. Kresge K.A. Lee J. Ota I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7651-7660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we reproducibly detected significant elevation of endogenous Slt2 steady state protein levels 60 min after heat shock. This induction of Slt2 protein levels was delayed as compared with the induction ofSLT2 mRNA following heat shock (Fig. 6A), which was detectable within 10 min.FIG. 6Transcriptional regulation of theSLT2 and phosphatase genes in response to various stresses.A, Msn2/4-dependent induction ofSDP1 mRNA under stress conditions. Wild type (WT) (W303–1A) and msn2msn4 strains, grown in YPD medium to A600 of 0.7 at 30 °C, were shifted to 39 °C or treated with 0.3 mmH2O2 or 1 m sorbitol. Samples were taken at the indicated times, and the levels of SLT2, PTP2, PTP3, MSG5, SDP1, and ACT1 transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis.B, Rlm1-dependent induction of SLT2and PTP2 upon stresses.

Northern blot analysis was done in stress-treated wild type (BY4741), slt2Δ, and hog1Δ strains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because SDP1 status affected the steady state phosphorylation of Slt2 kinase, we tested whether recombinant Sdp1 could dephosphorylate Slt2 in vitro. Sdp1 purified fromE. coli showed phosphatase activity toward the small-molecule phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (data not shown). Furthermore, Sdp1 dephosphorylated Slt2–3HA that had been immunoprecipitated from heat-shocked yeast cells (Fig.3). Incubation with sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, inhibited dephosphorylation of Slt2–3HA by Sdp1 in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that Sdp1 functions in the Slt2 pathway by direct dephosphorylation of Slt2 kinase. Data described above suggest a functional interaction between the Sdp1 phosphatase and the Slt2 kinase. Although genome-wide two-hybrid analysis suggested an interaction between a Gal4 activation domain (GAD) fusion of Slt2 and Gal4 DNA binding domain (GBD) fusion of Sdp1 (30Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A., Li, Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar), it was necessary to confirm their interaction to rule out the possibility of a false positive interaction. S. cerevisiae SFY526 strain containing an integrated GAL1-lacZ reporter was transformed with plasmids expressing GBD-Sdp1 and GAD-Slt2 or VP16-Slt2 fusion proteins, and the interactions were detected by β-galactosidase assays (Fig.4A). Although the overall activity was low, transformants expressing GBD-Sdp1 and GAD-Slt2 (1.3 Miller units) or GBD-Sdp1 and VP16-Slt2 (2.3 Miller units) showed higher activity than the cells containing GBD-Sdp1 alone (0.1 Miller units) or GAD-Slt2 alone (0.2 Miller units), suggesting an interaction between Slt2 and Sdp1. We also tested the interaction between Sdp1 and Slt2 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments from yeast cell extracts. For this purpose, we constructed a genomic tagged version of Sdp1 encoding 13Myc epitopes at the carboxyl terminus. The 13Myc-tagged Sdp1 was fully functional as ascertained by the resistance of cells expressing Sdp1–13Myc to toxicity due to Mkk1p386 overexpression (data not shown). Cells expressing Sdp1–13Myc were transformed with YEp352-SLT2–3HA or vector control, and the transformants were grown at 25 °C and heat-shocked at 39 °C for 1 h before harvest and protein extraction under native conditions. Slt2–3HA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. This experiment revealed co-immunoprecipitation of Sdp1–13Myc with Slt2–3HA (Fig. 4B). The strength of the interaction, at least by this analysis, was not responsive to heat shock. To localize Sdp1 within yeast cells, we expressed a functional Sdp1-GFP fusion protein in a diploid sdp1Δ strain. At 25 °C, Sdp1-GFP was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm with slight accumulation in the nucleus (Fig.5A). Upon heat shock, the Sdp1-GFP fusion was observed in punctate spots throughout the cells. This relocalization of Sdp1-GFP was observed within 5 min after heat shock, and after 30 min of heat shock, the localization pattern was more intense and punctate. The punctate Sdp1-GFP spots were redistributed evenly throughout the cell when the heat-shocked cells were shifted back to 25 °C for 20 min. This translocation of Sdp1 was quite specific to heat shock and Sdp1-GFP, since we could not detect changes in Sdp1-GFP localization after treatment with 0.3 mm H2O2 or 1 m sorbitol (data not shown). We also localized Slt2 using a functional Slt2-GFP fusion, which can complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of anslt2Δ mutant. In accordance with the previous report localizing Slt2-HA (35Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), Slt2-GFP was concentrated in the nucleus and also located in the cytoplasm at 25 °C (Fig. 5B). Although a previous report showed more uniform distribution of Slt2-HA between the cytoplasm and the nucleus after heat shock (35Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), the Slt2-GFP fusion showed little change in localization 30 min after heat shock. Slt2 is regulated by at least four protein phosphatases, Ptp2, Ptp3, Msg5, and Sdp1. These phosphatases show diverse specificity toward other MAPKs. Ptp2 and Ptp3 are also involved in dephosphorylation of Fus3 and Hog1, and Msg5 also dephosphorylates Fus3 and Kss1 (6Jacoby T. Flanagan H. Faykin A. Seto A.G. Mattison C. Ota I. J. Biol.

As of now, almost no details are known on how Tat substrates are targeted to and translocated by the cognate translocase.

A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was loaded on a three-step sucrose gradient (12 ml of 0.77 m sucrose, 12 ml of 1.44 m sucrose, and 10 ml of 2.2 m sucrose in 50 mm TeaOAc, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged for 16 h at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C in a SW27 rotor (Beckman). INV were withdrawn from the 0.77/1.44 m sucrose interface, pelleted after dilution, and resuspended in INV buffer (50 mm TeaOAc, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT). Tat+-INV were prepared from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (24Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) transformed with the plasmid p8737. The expression of the tat gene products was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside. The purified INV were stripped of their F1 component of the F1F0-ATPase by low salt treatment (25Wieseler B. Müller M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). INV were pelleted in an Airfuge (Beckman) at 30 p.s.i. for 10 min through a sucrose cushion (500 mm sucrose, 50 mm TeaOAc, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT). The pellet was resuspended in half of the original volume of low salt buffer (1 mm TeaOAc, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The low salt-extracted vesicles were again pelleted through a sucrose cushion (1 mm TeaOAc, pH 7.5, 500 mmsucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) in the Airfuge at 30 p.s.i. for 10 min. The supernatant above the sucrose cushion was collected as the low salt extract (LSE), and the pellet that consists of the washed vesicles (wTat+) was washed one more time in low salt buffer and resuspended in the original volume of INV buffer. Flotation centrifugation was performed as described (26Neumann-Haefelin C. Schäfer U. Müller M. Koch H.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-TatB and anti-TatC antibodies were raised in rabbits using the peptides NH2-CTTVQNELTQELKLQ EFQDSLKKVEK-COOH and NH2-CGKGRNREEENDAEAESEKTEE-COOH, respectively. Peptides corresponding to the signal sequence of SufI (SLSRRQFIQASGIALAAGAVPLKASA) and SufI-KK (SLSKKQFIQASGIALAAGAVPLKASA) were a generous gift of Dr. Ben Berks (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). The Cys at position 16 of the SufI signal peptide had been replaced by Ala. When sufI, encoding a cofactor-less Tat substrate of E. coli (15Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), was expressed from a T7 promoter in an E. coli transcription/translation system, one major translation product of about 52 kDa was obtained that corresponds in size to pre-SufI (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The presence during synthesis of INV of wild-type E. coli did not yield proteolytic processing of pre-SufI (lane 3) nor resistance to proteinase K (lane 4, PK). This indicated that, in contrast to the Sec substrate OmpA (Fig. 1 B), removal of the signal peptide and translocation of pre-SufI into the lumen of wild-type vesicles had not occurred. Similar to a previous finding (9Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), proteolytic processing and protease resistance of pre-SufI were, however, observed when INV had been prepared from a TatABCD-overproducing strain (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6, Tat+-INV). As expected, these Tat+-INV did not exhibit any significant change in translocation of the Sec-dependent OmpA when compared with wild-type INV (not shown). Because proteolytic processing and protease resistance of pre-SufI were completely abolished by the dissipation of the H+ gradient of the Tat+-INV using the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) at 100 μm(lanes 7 and 8), these phenomena cannot be due to unspecific cleavage or inherent protease resistance but rather reflect true translocation of pre-SufI into Tat+-INV. This was further confirmed by the abolishment of protease resistance in the presence of a membrane-disrupting detergent (not shown). Fig. 1 C illustrates the overproduced amounts of TatB and TatC in Tat+-INV, and similar results were obtained for TatA (not shown). In three independent experiments, the extent of translocation of SufI into Tat+-INV was determined to be 20.5% ± 3.2. A similar value (18.4% ± 5.1) was found for another Tat substrate, TorA-23K (Fig. 1 A), a hybrid protein consisting of the RR signal sequence of E. coli trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) and the 23-kDa subunit of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex from spinach chloroplasts (27Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Klösgen R.B. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 23-kDa protein is a substrate of the thylakoidal Tat apparatus. Another hybrid made of the TorA signal sequence and the otherwise Sec-dependent periplasmic P2 domain of E. coli leader (signal) peptidase (TorA-P2) (16Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was also translocated into Tat+-INV albeit less efficiently (Fig. 1 A; 5.1% ± 1.9). In contrast to SufI, the two TorA hybrid precursors were proteolytically processed also by wild-type INV (lane 3, asterisks). These cleavage products, however, were not translocated into INV as they remained totally proteinase K-sensitive (compare lanes 4 and 6) and appeared even in the presence of CCCP (panel B), which otherwise effectively inhibited both the Tat (panel A, lane 7) and the Sec pathway (panel B, OmpA). Non-Tat-related processing appears to be a peculiarity of TorA hybrid proteins (16Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To confirm that the three Tat precursors were in fact translocated into the vesicles via the Tat pathway, competition experiments were performed (Fig. 2) using the signal sequence peptides of SufI (RRsignal) and a mutant peptide in which the two invariant arginines had been replaced by lysines (KKsignal). Translocation into Tat+-INV of all three Tat precursors was completely inhibited by the wild-type SufI signal peptide (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Inhibition was specific since it was not obtained with the mutant KK peptide (lane 6) nor was it observed for the Sec-dependent OmpA. Thus translocation of Tat substrates into Tat+-INV involves specific recognition of the RR signal sequence. Accordingly, the KK mutant precursor of SufI was not translocated into Tat+-INV (Fig. 2 B). To analyze the membrane targeting of Tat substrates, we determined the amount of INV-bound precursor by flotation centrifugation. Under the conditions employed (Fig. 3 A), INV float predominantly to fraction 2 of the sucrose gradient and to some degree also to fraction 3, whereas non-membrane-associated material is recovered mostly from the pellet P. This is exemplified in the upper panel of Fig. 3 A for OmpA, which, when synthesized in the absence of INV, largely stays in the pellet P. On the contrary, the majority of precursor and mature form of OmpA obtained in the presence of Tat+-INV is found in fraction 2. Likewise, in vitro- synthesized SufI and TorA-23K quantitatively floated with Tat+-INV (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to OmpA, the Tat precursors did, however, not exhibit any significant flotation with wild-type INV (not shown) consistent with the low level of TatABC proteins of these vesicles being limiting for translocation. To analyze membrane binding independently of transmembrane translocation, we employed de-energized INV. Removal of the F1-ATPase from INV by low salt stripping impairs translocation of Sec precursors by the dissipation of the H+-motive force and is reversed by the readdition of F1-ATPase or the low salt extract (LSE) (28Müller M. Fisher R.P. Rienhöfer-Schweer A. Hoffschulte H.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3855-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Likewise (Fig. 3 B), when Tat+-INV were treated with low salt (wTat+-INV), processing and translocation of SufI and TorA-P2 were completely abolished (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6). The low salt-stripped vesicles, however, regained RR translocation activity by the addition of the LSE (lanes 7 and 8). Next, the flotation behavior of Tat precursors in the presence of wTat+-INV was analyzed (Fig. 3 A). As found for Tat+-INV, the majority of SufI and TorA-23K floated with the low salt-extracted vesicles (cf. fractions 2 of the Tat+ and wTat+ gradients). The only difference between the two vesicle populations was the lack of signal sequence cleavage by wTat+-INV that, however, was restored by the low salt extract. Evidently, inactivation of the Tat machinery by the dissipation of the H+ gradient does not prevent the precursor from binding to the vesicles. If the Tat precursors floating with low salt-stripped INV reflect populations of functional transport intermediates, translocation of the accumulated precursors should proceed once the H+ gradient has been restored. Pre-SufI was therefore synthesized in the presence of low salt-stripped Tat+-INV to allow for membrane targeting. Subsequently, the low salt extract was added (Fig. 3 C, LSEpost), either directly or after isolating pre-SufI bound to low salt-stripped INV by flotation centrifugation (SufI-wTat+). In both cases, the low salt extract did restore processing and translocation of SufI (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), clearly indicating that the precursor had been targeted to the translocation-deficient vesicles in a functional manner. To find out whether functional targeting requires an intact RR signal sequence, we investigated the flotation behavior of the translocation-defective SufI-KK. As summarized in Table I, the sedimentation pattern of pre-SufI-KK obtained after synthesis in the absence of INV hardly changed upon the addition of Tat+-INV with only a minor part of the pre-SufI-KK being recovered from the prime vesicle fraction 2. This was in clear contrast to the results observed with translocation-proficient precursors (cf. Fig. 3 A). Moreover, sedimentation of pre-SufI-KK was only marginally influenced by de-energizing Tat+-INV with CCCP or by low salt stripping. These results therefore suggest that a specific targeting of Tat precursors requires an intact RR signal sequence.Table IMembrane targeting of SufI requires an RR signal sequenceFraction1234P%%%%%No INV (n = 3)25273135Tat+-INV (n = 4)518311927Tat+-INV/CCCP (n = 3)112242241wTat+-INV (n = 2)28321939Flotation centrifugation of SufI-KK synthesized in the absence or presence of the indicated INV is shown.

We have separated membrane targeting of bacterial twin-arginine preproteins from their translocation into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles. The cell-free system employed here does not grossly differ from previous ones described for the Sec-dependent protein export except that the usage of membrane vesicles prepared from a TatABCD overproducer was imperative. Although wild-type vesicles allow for efficient Sec-dependent translocation, they lack RR translocase activity for reasons that are not yet evident. However, the TatABC proteins have also been shown to be limiting for the Tat pathway in vivo (9Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Sargent F. Gohlke U. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The efficiency of our in vitro system (up to 20% for at least two different Tat substrates) is by far higher than that of a similar one (0.4% for pre-SufI only) that was recently described (9Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in which INV were routinely added after synthesis of pre-SufI. We have repeatedly made the observation that the later the vesicles are added after starting synthesis of the Tat precursors, the lower the efficiency of transport into these vesicles. However, why a precursor addressed to a dedicated posttranslational pathway should become translocation-incompetent in time remains unanswered thus far. In any event, a highly efficient in vitro system was a prerequisite to analyze functional precursor binding and translocation in a separate and stepwise manner by low salt stripping of INV. Efficient membrane binding of RR precursors was observed only with INV harboring elevated levels of TatABC. The lack of Tat-specific translocation into wild-type INV seems to be correlated with an impaired targeting of Tat substrates to these vesicles, suggesting that TatABC proteins function as a receptor site for Tat-specific precursor proteins. We also show that targeting to Tat+-INV requires an intact RR motif in the signal sequence. The combined results are consistent with the bacterial TatABC pore recognizing at least the consensus motif of the RR signal sequence. In accordance, the TatB and TatC analogs of thylakoids were recently shown to represent a Tat-specific recognition site from which translocation proceeds in a TatA-dependent manner (29Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Tat precursors tested throughout these studies are known not to require bound cofactors for export (15Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Klösgen R.B. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, their translocation into INV required Tat-specific conditions such as the presence of TatABC, the H+ gradient, and the RR motif. By use of low salt-stripped INV, we have blocked RR-dependent translocation without interfering with a functional membrane targeting of Tat precursors. This strategy should now enable us to characterize both events individually, applying INV derived from Tat deletion strains and cross-linking methods."

This effect is concentration-dependent with over 75% inhibition achieved at 20 μm radicicol. The ferrous carbonyl complex of nNOS is not formed when hsp90 is inhibited, indicating that functional heme insertion is prevented.

At a concentration of 20 μm, geldanamycin causes a 3-fold increase in NADPH oxidation and hydrogen peroxide formation from purified nNOS, whereas the non-quinone hsp90 inhibitor radicicol had no effect.

Garcia-Cardeña et al. (1Garcia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate direct activation of purified eNOS catalytic activity by purified hsp90 in the absence of ATP, hsp70, and the co-chaperones of the hsp90-based chaperone machinery. The proposed allosteric regulation of eNOS by hsp90 would be a unique mode of regulation in that other hsp90-regulated proteins require the ATP- and hsp70-dependent, multiprotein hsp90 chaperone system for their regulation. More recently, the same laboratory (10Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) has shown that geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of hsp90, causes eNOS to produce superoxide in cells and tissues. From this, it was concluded that hsp90 is essential for eNOS-dependent NO production and that inhibition of hsp90 leads to uncoupling of eNOS and increased superoxide production due to conformational changes in hsp90 and eNOS. Other reports suggest that hsp90 facilitates the calmodulin-assisted dissociation of eNOS from caveolin, thereby opposing the inhibitory effect of caveolin on eNOS activity (11Gratton J.P. Fontana J.

In the case of nNOS, it has been shown that geldanamycin causes an increased turnover of nNOS and a loss in nNOS activity, implying that hsp90 is important for the stability and function of the enzyme (2Bender A.T.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1819-C1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that hsp90 in the absence of ATP, hsp70, or co-chaperones enhances the affinity of calmodulin binding to purified nNOS by ∼10-fold. In our previous study (2Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we were unable to show hsp90-mediated activation of the holo-nNOS, but we did show that geldanamycin treatment of Sf9 cells expressing nNOS inhibits heme-mediated activation of heme-deficient apo-nNOS. Thus, in analogy with the well studied steroid receptor model, we proposed that the hsp90-based chaperone machinery plays a role in opening up the hydrophobic-binding cleft in apo-nNOS to facilitate the entry of heme into its binding site in the interior of the enzyme. In this study, we show that the hsp90-inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, cause a profound inhibition of heme-mediated activation of apo-nNOS activity in the insect overexpression system. Inhibition of hsp90 is accompanied by a marked inhibition in heme binding and by an inability to form the dimeric state of nNOS, implying a role for hsp90 in heme-mediated assembly of the holo-enzyme. In the course of these studies, we have discovered that geldanamycin, an ansamycin benzoquinone, is capable of redox cycling with nNOS to produce reactive oxygen species in a manner similar to that characterized for other quinones (15Kumagai Y. Nakajima H. Midorikawa K. Homma-Takeda S. Shimojo N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to geldanamycin, radicicol, a specific hsp90 inhibitor that is not a quinone, blocks heme binding by nNOS but does not cause the formation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, in contrast to the conclusion of Pritchard et al. (10Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). The baculovirus for expression of the mouse GR was generously provided by Dr. Edwin Sanchez (Medical College of Ohio, Toledo, OH). Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Recombinant baculovirus containing nNOS cDNA was produced as described previously (2Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol.

Sf9 cells were grown in SFM 900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. After 48 h, aliquots (3.0 ml) of the suspensions were treated with heme (24 μm), which was added as an albumin conjugate (16Asseffa A. Smith S.J. Nagata K. Gillette J. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In some samples, the cells were treated with geldanamycin, radicicol, or Me2SO vehicle 20 min before the addition of heme. The final Me2SO concentration was less than 0.4%. Cells were harvested, washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 350 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 320 mm sucrose, 100 μm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 6 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization, and the lysates were spun at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Sf9 cultures infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus containing the mouse GR cDNA at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0 were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al.(17Srinivasan G. Post J.F. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture per 3 ml of buffer, and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Insect cells were infected as above except that 25 μm oxyhemoglobin was added instead of heme. Lysates from infected Sf9 cells (8 × 109) were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose column, and the nNOS was affinity-purified as described previously except that 10 mm 2′AMP in high salt buffer was used to elute the protein (18Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The nNOS-containing fractions were combined and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column (2.6 × 100 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and 1.3 ml-fractions were collected and analyzed for protein content and NOS activity. Fractions containing nNOS were pooled and concentrated with the use of a Centriplus concentrator (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The concentrated enzyme was stored at −80 °C. NO formation was assayed by the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. Conversion of oxyhemoglobin was assayed by adding 15 μl of insect cell supernatant to an assay solution containing 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μml-arginine, 100 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 25 μm oxyhemoglobin, and an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of 400 μm NADP+, 10 mmglucose-6-phosphate, and 1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, expressed as final concentrations, in a total volume of 180 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C and the rate of oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at λ401–411 nm with a microtiter plate reader as described (19Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 455-478Google Scholar). In studies in which the NADPH oxidation was measured, purified nNOS (5 μg/ml) was added to a mixture containing 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm NADPH and the desired amount of geldanamycin or radicicol in a total volume of 180 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. The NADPH oxidation was measured by the loss in absorbance at 340 nm, and the initial rate of oxidation was determined from the linear portion of the plot. In some studies, an aliquot (75 μl) of the mixtures used for NADPH oxidation measurements was taken, and the amount of hydrogen peroxide present was determined by the thiocyanate method (20Vasquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martasek P. Karoui H. Pritchard K.A., Jr. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In some samples, catalase (10 units/ml) was added. The amount of heme was determined by HPLC as described previously (21Sugiyama K. Highet R.J. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples were injected onto an HPLC column (C4 Vydac, 5 μm, 0.21 × 15 cm) equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A linear gradient was run to 75% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 30 min and then to 100% solvent B over the next 5 min. Absorbance at 220 and 400 nm was monitored. Myoglobin (horse heart) was used as a standard. The heme present in nNOS was assessed by measuring the ferrous carbonyl complex. Since the cell cytosols from heme-treated cells contained compounds that absorbed in the 420-nm region, we partially purified the cytosols for nNOS. Cytosols (20 mg of protein) were loaded onto a 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose column (1.5 cm × 0.9 cm) and purified as described above. The ferrous carbonyl complex was measured as a difference spectrum and quantified with an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 as described previously (22McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The insect cytosols were added to an equal volume of sample buffer containing 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 μml-arginine, and 0.02% bromphenol blue in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Samples were kept ice-cold prior to loading on gels. This method has been described previously by Klatt et al. (23Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) to prevent the dissociation of nNOS dimers prior to and during electrophoresis. Samples (50 μg of protein) were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 cm) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). The nNOS protein was visualized by Western blotting using 0.1% anti-nNOS polyclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories. An anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as secondary antibody at a concentration of 0.01%. For electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, 25 μl of insect cytosol was mixed with 50 μl of detergent-free buffer (312 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol), and proteins were resolved on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.35). FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mmsodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm molybdate) plus 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Sf9 cells have very low levels of endogenous heme, and the addition of exogenous heme to the culture medium causes an increase in nNOS activity in infected cells (2Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, heme was added to the medium of Sf9 cells expressing rat nNOS, and cells were harvested at various times for assay of nNOS activity by the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. The addition of heme (closed squares) increased nNOS activity ∼5-fold with respect to the activity in the absence of exogenous heme (open squares). This exogenous heme-dependent increase in nNOS activity is inhibited by ∼60% by either 20 μmgeldanamycin (open circles) or 20 μm radicicol (closed circles). Both compounds bind to the nucleotide-binding site of hsp90 and inhibit hsp90 function (24Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G., De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown in Fig. 2A, geldanamycin (open squares) and radicicol (closed squares) inhibited the heme-mediated activation of nNOS with the same concentration dependence, and nearly complete inhibition was achieved at concentrations above 30 μm.Figure 2Concentration dependence of geldanamycin or radicicol inhibition of heme-mediated activation of apo-nNOS and activation of the glucocorticoid receptor to its steroid binding state.A, heme-mediated activation of apo-nNOS. Sf9 cells expressing heme-deficient apo-nNOS were incubated in the presence of 24 μm heme and the indicated concentrations of radicicol (closed squares) or geldanamycin (open squares). The cells were harvested 30 min after the addition of heme, and the nNOS activity of cytosol was measured.B, activation of glucocorticoid receptor. Stripped GR immune pellets were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the indicated concentrations of radicicol (closed squares) or geldanamycin (open squares), and the immune pellets were washed and incubated with 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide to determine steroid binding activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have compared the inhibition of nNOS activation in Sf9 cells with the potencies of geldanamycin and radicicol in inhibiting the cell-free activation of the glucocorticoid receptor to a steroid binding state, a well established model of an hsp90-dependent process (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, activation of the glucocorticoid receptor to a steroid binding state by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone system is inhibited most potently by radicicol (closed squares) with complete inhibition at 1 μm. Geldanamycin (open squares) is slightly less potent, producing nearly complete inhibition at 5 μm. The concentration dependence of this in vitro inhibition is similar to that reported for in vitro inhibition of hsp90 ATPase activity by geldanamycin and radicicol (26Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The higher concentrations required for inhibition of nNOS activation in Sf9 cells are similar to those found in the recent report by Pritchard et al. (10Pritchard K.A., Jr. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), who used 18 μm geldanamycin to cause eNOS-dependent superoxide production in bovine coronary endothelial cells. The inactive, heme-deficient, monomeric apo-nNOS must form a heme-bound homodimer in order for the enzyme to produce nitric oxide (27Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Under in vivo conditions, this assembly process gives rise to a very stable dimeric state of the enzyme that can be observed on low temperature SDS-PAGE gels as an SDS-resistant dimer (23Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, in Sf9 cells, the monomeric form of the enzyme is produced in the absence of exogenous heme (lane 1). After the addition of exogenous heme for 30 min, the nNOS exists, in large part, as an SDS-resistant dimer (lane 2). When the cells are treated with heme in the presence of 20 or 40 μm geldanamycin, the SDS-resistant dimer is substantially decreased (lanes 3 and 4), and radicicol decreases the amount of SDS-resistant dimer to a similar extent at the same concentrations (lanes 5 and 6). The dimeric form of nNOS can also be measured under non-denaturing conditions in which detergent is omitted. Under these conditions, it is possible to see a dimeric form of nNOS that is not SDS-resistant (28Bender A.T. Nakatsuka M. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26018-26023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, nNOS exists as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms (lane 1). After the addition of exogenous heme, the monomeric nNOS is converted to the dimeric form (lane 2). When the addition of heme is carried out in the presence of 20 μm geldanamycin (lane 3) or 20 μm radicicol (lane 4), the conversion of the monomer to the dimer is inhibited. The initial step in the heme-mediated dimerization of apo-nNOS in vitro is the insertion of heme into the protein and ligation of the heme iron to a cysteine (28Bender A.T. Nakatsuka M. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26018-26023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This heme complex has a characteristic absorbance in the 450-nm region in its ferrous carbonyl state. Although this complex can be readily detected in Sf9 cytosols, a heme-derived chromophore at 420 nm interferes with the quantification of the P450. To minimize the contribution of this 420-nm absorbing compound, we have partially purified the nNOS by the use of a 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column and then measured the P450 spectrum (Fig. 4, inset). As shown in Fig. 4, the amount of P450 was quantified and compared with the cytosolic nNOS activity. The addition of heme (Heme) to Sf9 cells expressing apo-nNOS increased nNOS activity and P450 content ∼5-fold when compared with that found when heme was not added (Unt). When the cells were treated with heme in the presence of 20 or 40 μm radicicol (Heme + 20 μm RAD or Heme + 40 μm RAD), the nNOS activity and P450 content remained at nearly the level of the untreated cells (Unt). The addition of 40 μm radicicol after activation of apo-nNOS with heme did not cause a decrease in nNOS activity (data not shown). Thus, it appears that radicicol does not act to inhibit the active for"

Most neurons showed a preferred heading direction, but some responded only when that heading was part of a particular path. Others responded only when the animal was at a certain place in the room, regardless of its path to that place. Video simulations of the self-movement scene evoked path, but not place, responses. Stationary positioning in the room revealed location preferences that matched place preferences recorded during movement. We conclude that MST encodes heading, path, and place information to support visuospatial orientation."

NCR is the physiological mechanism for achieving this selectivity and is the preeminent control exerted over nitrogen catabolic gene expression in yeast. In excess nitrogen (e.g. glutamine, ammonia), transcription of genes encoding proteins needed to transport and degrade poor sources (e.g. proline, allantoin) is low, i.e.“repressed.” On the other hand, when nitrogen is limiting, transcription of these genes increases, i.e. is “derepressed” (1Hoffman-Bang J.

MKS1 (multicopy compensator of a kinase suppression) was first isolated as a gene whose products function downstream of protein kinase A (19Matsuura A. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, MKS1 was found to be identical to LYS80, at first thought to encode a repressor of the lysine biosynthetic genes (20Ramos F. Wiame J.-M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but later found to down-regulate the α−ketoglutarate pool and several tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme activities (21Feller A. Ramos F. Pierard A. Dujbois E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The last identification of MKS1 was as a high copy suppressor of the NCR-sensitivity of ureidosuccinate (USA) uptake (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). USA, the first unique intermediate in uracil biosynthesis, can fulfill the auxotrophic requirement generated by a ura2 mutation with proline, but not ammonia, as a nitrogen source (8Drillien R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Drillen R.M. Aigle M. Lacroute F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nitrogen source restriction derives from USA permease (encoded by NCR-sensitive DAL5) production being repressed by ammonia (8Drillien R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Drillen R.M. Aigle M. Lacroute F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 53: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Turoscy V. Cooper T.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2598-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A ura2 transformant, containing approximately the 3′ half of MKS1 on a high copy vector, can use USA to cover the ura2 auxotrophy even with ammonia as the nitrogen source (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). Because ure2 is epistatic to mks1, which in turn is epistatic to rtg2, the regulatory circuit, NH3 → Rtg2p ⊣ Mks1p ⊣ Ure2p ⊣ Gln3p → DAL5, was proposed (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mks1p is also required for conversion of Ure2p to its prion form [Ure3p] (25Edskes H.K. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6625-6629Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, genomic analyses led Shamji et al. to agree that Mks1p is a positive regulator of rapamycin-induced, Gln3p-dependent gene expression and a positive regulator of Rtg1/3p-dependent retrograde gene expression (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The retrograde regulon consists of genes, including CIT2, IDH1/2, and DLD3, whose expression is stimulated by damage to mitochondria and reduced in cells grown with glutamate as the sole nitrogen source (26Zhegchang L. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Sekito T. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Komeili et al. also reported that retrograde gene expression is rapamycin-induced and correlates with the quality of the nitrogen source provided, being lowest with preferred nitrogen sources thereby linking carbon and nitrogen regulation (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). They also, in agreement with Sekito et al., demonstrated that Rtg1/3p intracellular localization correlates with the level of retrograde expression, being nuclear when it is high and cytoplasmic when low (27Sekito T. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Several observations, however, raise questions about our current understanding of the role of Mks1p in Tor1/2p signal transduction and NCR-sensitive and retrograde gene expression. (i) Mks1p, a proposed negative regulator of Ure2p, doesn't play a role in Ure2p dephosphorylation, i.e. Ure2p dephosphorylation occurs normally in an mks1 mutant (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). (ii) Tap42p is phosphorylated by Tor1/2p (29Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and a mutant allele,tap42–11, has been isolated in which Tap42 has lost its ability to respond to rapamycin addition. As a result, rapamycin-induction of processes downstream of Tap42p, e.g.Gln3p-dephosphorylation, are lost in the mutant as well (11Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, rapamycin-induced Ure2p dephosphorylation occurs normally in the tap42–11 mutant (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). (iii) In most genetic backgrounds, glutamine and ammonia are more strongly repressive nitrogen sources than urea or glutamate (30Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar). Yet in the measurements of Komeili et al., CIT2 expression occurs at the same high level with ammonia and urea as the nitrogen source and is severely reduced when glutamine or glutamate is provided instead (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In other words, CIT2 expression doesn't correlate with the quality of nitrogen source. Paradoxical observations such as these prompted us to reinvestigate the relation of nitrogen quality to retrograde gene expression and the role of Mks1p as a positive regulator of Rtg1/3p-dependent transcription and negative regulator of Ure2p. Here we show that: (i) retrograde gene expression is controlled not by the quality of the nitrogen source, but the product to which it is degraded, (ii) Mks1p is not a positive but a strong negative regulator of retrograde gene expression, and (iii) Mks1p does not significantly or directly influence NCR-sensitive, GATA-mediated gene expression. We used strains M970 (MATalys5/MATαlys2), YHE677 (MATa/MATα mks1Δ::G418/mks1Δ::G418 ura3/+), YHE815 (MATα ura2 leu2Δ::hisG trp1Δ::hisG (cross 83, spore 2a)), and YHE823–1b (MATα ura2 leu2Δ::hisG trp1Δ::hisG mks1Δ::G418 (cross 83, spore 1b)). Strains were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 nm= 0.50–0.55) in Wickerham's minimal medium (31Wickerham L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1946; 52: 293-301Crossref Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose and the indicated nitrogen sources. Rapamycin (Sigma) (stock solution, 1 mg/ml in 10% Tween 20 plus 90% ethanol) was added to cultures, where indicated, to yield a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml. Wickerham's solid medium containing 2% glucose and 0.1% of either l-glutamic acid, l-glutamine, urea, ammonium sulfate, or asparagine, 0.2% l-proline, or 0.2% allantoin was used to evaluate growth. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Total RNA preparation and Northern blot analyses were performed as described (10Cox K.H. Rai R. Distler M. Daugherty J.R. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with the exception that the breaking buffer contained 0.5 mTris base and diethoxydiformate was not added and 9 μg of total RNA were loaded per lane.

Strains, transformed with DAL5-lacZ pRR29, were grown in 2% glucose yeast nitrogen base medium with 0.1% proline or glutamine as the nitrogen source. Uracil (20 mg/liter), leucine (120 mg/liter), and tryptophan (20 mg/liter) were added to provide for auxotrophic requirements. β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (5Rai R. Genbauffe F.S. Sumrada R.A. Cooper T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Komeili et al. concluded that rapamycin signaling links nitrogen quality to the activity and nuclear localization of retrograde transcription factors Rtg1/3p (31Wickerham L.J. J. Bacteriol. 1946; 52: 293-301Crossref Google Scholar). Urea or ammonia as the nitrogen source elicited high retrograde gene expression, whereas glutamate and glutamine yielded low expression (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, for most strains, urea and glutamate are poorer nitrogen sources than ammonia and glutamine (30Cooper T.G. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 39-99Google Scholar), arguing against the quality of the nitrogen source being the important determinant. There is, however, a physiologically significant correlation in the data of Komeili et al. It is the product of the degraded nitrogen source. Retrograde gene expression was high in both nitrogen sources that yielded ammonia as the degradative product and low in those yielding glutamate (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we measured gene expression in cells provided with a spectrum of nitrogen sources ranging from poor to good, some being degraded to ammonia and others to glutamate (Fig. 1). Expression of GAP1 and GAT1 was used as the control to monitor NCR, i.e. quality of the nitrogen source, while CIT2 and DLD3 expression were the reporters for retrograde gene expression. Proline and allantoin, both poor nitrogen sources, support high level GAP1 expression (Fig. 1C, lanes A and B). Glutamate and urea behave similarly,i.e. support high GAP1 expression (lanes C and D). Ammonia and glutamine, in contrast, are good nitrogen sources for this strain and strongly repress GAP1 expression (lanes E and F). The NCR-sensitive GAT1 expression profile is similar to that of GAP1 (Fig. 1D).CIT2 and DLD3 expression profiles differ from those of GAP1 and GAT1, being higher with allantoin, urea, and ammonia than with proline or glutamate (Fig. 1,A and B). Allantoin and urea are degraded to ammonia, while proline is degraded to glutamate. The results with ammonia and glutamine are similarly correlated but more complex. Ammonia elicits less CIT2 expression than urea but more than glutamine or glutamate (Fig. 1A, lanes C–F). Ammonia is transported and assimilated faster than urea, which accounts for ammonia being repressive, while urea is not. Ammonia and urea assimilation occurs predominantly through the formation of glutamate, hence intracellular glutamate is higher with ammonia as the nitrogen source than with urea. Therefore, the CIT2 results are not surprising because CIT2 and DLD3 expression is highly repressed by glutamate (26Zhegchang L. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Sekito T. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). By this reasoning, glutamine assimilation, which yields equimolar amounts of glutamate and ammonia, should support less CIT2 and DLD3 expression than ammonia alone even though ammonia and glutamine are equally repressive nitrogen sources, and that is what occurs (compare lanes E and F). These data suggest the degradative product rather than ability to elicit NCR controls CIT2 and DLD3 expression. A substantial regulatory network has developed around Mks1p and its relation to NCR-sensitive gene expression (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Schreiber's laboratory, using genomic analyses, reported that Mks1p transmits a signal from Tap42p to Rtg1/3p via the pathway rapamycin ⊣ Torp → Tap42 ⊣ Mks1p → Rtg1/3p → retrograde (CIT2) gene expression. In their model, Mks1p positively regulates Rtg1/3p (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In light of data in Fig. 1, we reinvestigated Rtg1/3p-dependent expression in wild type and mks1Δ strains, measuring CIT2 expression in cells provided with proline, ammonia, or glutamine as the nitrogen source (Fig. 2A, lanes A and G, C and I, E and K). CIT2 is expressed at undetectable levels in wild type cells with proline and low levels with ammonia or glutamine as the nitrogen source (lanes A, C, and E). With all three nitrogen sources, CIT2 expression increases dramatically in the mks1Δ(lanes G, I, and K). Therefore, in contrast to the conclusions of Schreiber and co-workers (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we find that Mks1p is a strong negative regulator of CIT2 expression. To ensure that the observations with CIT2 are not gene-specific but reflect retrograde expression per se, we performed similar experiments with DLD3, IDH1, and IDH2, all genes used in earlier analyses by Komeili et al. and Shamji et al. (Refs. 28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar and 7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, respectively). Expression of all three genes is low to undetectable in wild type proline-grown cells and greatly increases in the mks1Δ (Figs.3C and 4, A and B, lanes A and G). Mks1p negative regulation of retrograde gene expression is not restricted to the use of proline as a nitrogen source. It also occurs with both ammonia and glutamine (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4,lanes C, E, I, and K). Changes between wild type and mks1Δ were less dramatic because of the greater basal level of retrograde gene expression with these nitrogen sources.Figure 3Effects of mks1Δ and rapamycin on DAL5, GAT1, and DLD3 expression.

Histone (H3) was used as control to assess loadings.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether failure to down-regulate retrograde gene expression adversely affects the cell, we grew wild type and mks1Δ strains on minimal glucose medium with a range of nitrogen sources. There was little if any effect of deleting MKS1 when the nitrogen source, irrespective of its quality, provided is degraded to ammonia (Fig. 5,right panel, allantoin, urea, asparagine). However,mks1Δ cells grow more slowly than wild type when the nitrogen source is degraded to glutamate (Fig. 5, left panels), arguing that excess retrograde gene expression is detrimental in the presence of glutamate. Significant differences between our views of Mks1p and those of Shamji et al., Edskes et al., and Pierce et al. prompted us to further query the conclusion that Mks1p is a negative regulator of Ure2p (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If Mks1p is a negative regulator of Ure2p, it would be a positive regulator of Gln3p, Gat1p, and NCR-sensitive gene expression (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the NCR sensitivity of GAP1 expression in wild type and mks1Δ strains. GAP1 expression is equally NCR-sensitive in the two strains; we see no evidence of the Mks1p-dependent GAP1 expression predicted by existing models (Fig. 2B, compare lanes A, C, and E with G, I, and K). To ensure that the observations were not GAP1-specific but reflected NCR-sensitive expression per se, we additionally assayed DAL5 and GAT1 expression and β-galactosidase production supported by a DAL5-lacZ fusion plasmid. The DAL5 expression profile is similar to that of GAP1, i.e. there is no demonstrable Mks1p dependence of expression or alteration of NCR sensitivity in the mks1Δ relative to wild type. The GAT1 expression profile differs little from that of DAL5, except that its NCR sensitivity is greater in the mks1Δ than wild type (Fig. 3B). NCR sensitivity is similarly unaltered when measured with a β-galactosidase assay. Wild type (YHE815) produced 28,276 and 949 units in proline versus glutamine medium, respectively, compared with 8,951 and 210 for mks1Δ YHE823–1b. These data argue against Mks1p having a role in NCR-sensitive gene expression. A possible explanation of our failure to observe differences in NCR-sensitive gene expression between wild type and mks1Δ strains might have been due to previously unnoticed nitrogen-dependent modulation of MKS1 expression or a defect in the mks1Δ construction. Therefore, we measured MKS1 expression in wild type and mutant cells. It is affected by neither nitrogen source nor rapamycin-treatment of wild type cells (Fig. 4C, lanes A–F).MKS1 mRNA could not be detected in the mks1Δ (Fig. 4C, lanes G–L); the same was true when the autoradiogram was heavily overexposed or the blot analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (data not shown). To rectify Mks1p data with that derived from lys80 mutants of Feller et al., we compared LYS1 expression in wild type and mks1Δ strains. Ramos et al. and Feller et al. report saccharopine dehydrogenase (encoded by LYS1) activity is 3–5-fold higher in a lys80 mutant than wild type growing in minimal ammonia + lysine medium (20Ramos F. Wiame J.-M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Feller A. Ramos F. Pierard A. Dujbois E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We confirm their enzymatic data;LYS1 expression increases in an mks1Δ strain relative to wild type (Fig. 2C). According to the Schreiber model, rapamycin ⊣ Torp → Tap42 ⊣ Mks1p → Rtg1/3p → retrograde gene expression (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). That model posits Mks1p to be a positive regulator of Rtg1/3p, connecting retrograde transcription to the upper portions of the Torp pathway. Our evidence demonstrating Mks1p negatively, rather than positively, regulates CIT2 expression calls this model into question and prompted us to query the extent to which Mks1p mediates Tor1/2p control of CIT2 expression. We assayed retrograde and NCR-sensitive gene expression in wild type and mks1Δ strains treated with rapamycin. Higher concentrations of rapamycin than used by some investigators do not induce CIT2 expression in the wild type with proline as the nitrogen source even though they strongly induce DAL5 expression as previously reported by other laboratories (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C., Di Como C.J. Heitman J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lanes A and B). Rapamycin does induce CIT2 expression with ammonia or glutamine as the nitrogen source (Fig. 2,lanes C–F), but in neither case does deletion of MKS1 affect expression (Fig. 2, lanes I–J). In contrast, deletion of MKS1 dramatically increases CIT2 expression in proline-grown cells even though rapamycin cannot. DLD3, IDH1, and IDH2 expression responded similarly, but here rapamycin, in contrast to the Schreiber model, was slightly inhibitory in the mks1Δ strain regardless of the nitrogen source (Figs. 3C and 4). At least with proline as the nitrogen source, the effects of rapamycin treatment and MKS1 deletion are clearly separable and suggest that Mks1p is unlikely to be a direct participant in rapamycin-induced CIT2 expression. Four observations suggest that revisions are needed in the current model of Tor1/2p signal transduction, retrograde, and NCR-sensitive gene regulation. We find that: (i) Mks1p does not directly control NCR-sensitive gene expression, (ii) Mks1p is a strong negative regulator of retrograde gene expression, (iii) nitrogen catabolic and carbon retrograde gene expression are not linked by good versus poor nitrogen sources but by the product of nitrogen source degradation, i.e. compounds degraded to ammonia do not down-regulate retrograde expression, whereas those degraded to glutamate do, and (iv) Mks1p-mediated repression of retrograde gene expression is dissociable from that exerted by the Tor1/2p-mediated pathway. Retrograde control regulates the amount of α-ketoglutarate available for ammonia assimilation into glutamate as manifested by down-regulation of retrograde gene expression with glutamate as the nitrogen source. Mks1p mediates this down-regulation as evidenced by the dramatic phenotype of mks1 mutants. While glutamate is the predominant regulator, ammonia may also play a role because CIT2 expression is greater with glutamine (which is degraded to ammonia and glutamate) than glutamate as the nitrogen source. Whether a direct link exists between Tor1/2p and Mks1p is questionable because the effects of rapamycin can be completely dissociated from Mks1p function with proline as the nitrogen source. The question cannot be answered for ammonia or glutamine because although CIT2 expression increases upon rapamycin treatment in wild type, it is already high in untreated mks1Δ cells and in some cases decreases on treatment with rapamycin. Mks1p affects NCR-sensitive expression only indirectly via α-ketoglutarate production and hence the rate of ammonia assimilation. To us, the function of Mks1p remains unknown. If Mks1p is a direct participant in control of CIT2 expression, it most likely does so by controlling nuclear access of Rtg1/3p, probably by regulating the phosphorylation state of these transcription factors. Consistent with this suggestion, Pierce et al. have shown that: (i) Mks1p is localized to the cytoplasm and (ii) an mks1 mutation is epistatic to one at rtg2; hence Mks1p functions between Rtg2p and the transcription factors Rtg1/3p that are required for activation of CIT2 expression (24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the conclusions of Pierce et al. concerning the mks1-rtg2 epistasis relationships using Northern blot analyses of GAP1, DAL5, and CIT2 gene expression (data not shown). Differences between our conclusions and accepted models of NCR-sensitive and retrograde expression prompt an attempt to rectify the observations. Mks1p was concluded to be a positive regulator of retrograde expression from transcriptome analyses in which the ratios of CIT2 and DLD3 expression in treated versus untreated wild type cells (+7.1 and +6.4, respectively) decreased (+1.0 and −1.2, respectively) in mks1Δ cells (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, ratios can be ambiguous. The ratio of CIT2 expression in Fig. 2A, lanes D and J is close to one but much greater if lanes C and D are compared. This appears to concur with the Shamji et al. conclusion (7Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Cur. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) even though the opposite is true when all of the data can be analyzed. Komeili et al. report that the quality of a nitrogen source determines whether it will stimulate or inhibit retrograde gene expression, i.e. “preferred” nitrogen sources (glutamine and glutamate) down-regulate it (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, we conclude that the significant feature is not nitrogen source quality but the product of degradation. Differences in interpretation derive from the S288c strain background they used and how one classifies various nitrogen sources. Ammonia is not a highly repressive nitrogen source in an S288c genetic background. Although the precise reason for this diminished repression has not been directly identified, it is an idiosyncrasy of this specific nitrogen source because other sources, e.g. asparagine or glutamine, elicit similarly repressive responses in both S288c and Σ1278b. Based on the data Komeili et al. observed, ammonia was not classified as a good nitrogen source (28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It was rather grouped with urea, a nitrogen source widely reported to elicit little NCR. This grouping may have diverted attention away from a correlation involving the end product of degradation, thereby leading them to conclude that nitrogen source quality was the important determinant. According to the conclusions of Komeili et al., both proline and allantoin should support high CIT2 expression because both are poor nitrogen sources. This expectation, however, isn't supported experimentally (Fig. 1). The third difference concerns whether Mks1p transmits the Tor1/2p signal of excess nitrogen to the retrograde genes. Here, the conclusion depends upon the data considered. mks1Δ, but not rapamycin-treatment, increases CIT2 expression in proline medium. With ammonia or glutamine, rapamycin induces CIT2 expression in the wild type. This increase cannot be concluded to occur in the mks1Δ, however, because CIT2 expression is already high and in some cases decreases upon treating mutant cells with rapamycin (Fig. 2). At least three interpretations immediately come to mind: (i) Mks1p and rapamycin belong to different regulatory pathways as far as CIT2 expression is concerned, (ii) Mks1p belongs to the Tor1/2p pathway and the differences are quantitative, or (iii) additional, unknown factors exist that function differentially, one set when Tor1/2p are active and another when they inactive,e.g. with proline as nitrogen source. The last, and by far most challenging, observations to rectify derive from the USA uptake experiments (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar). There is no doubt that overexpression of MKS1 suppresses NCR-sensitivity of DAL5 expression (22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar), but this can occur in two different ways: (i) Mks1p can negatively regulate Ure2p function, the prevailing view or (ii) Mks1p can diminish the ability of ammonia to bring about NCR. We suggest the latter best accounts for all of the data. We show that Mks1p is a strong negative regulator of CIT2 expression, which extends the earlier report that α-ketoglutarate increases in lys80/mks1 mutants along with citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase activities (21Feller A. Ramos F. Pierard A. Dujbois E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We suggest that overproduction of Mks1p excessively down-regulates CIT2 expression and hence citrate synthase production needed to synthesize α-ketoglutarate. The resulting limitation of α-ketoglutarate decreases the rate of ammonia assimilation to glutamate thereby decreasing its ability to elicit NCR. This permits sufficient DAL5/UREP expression to meet the requirements of the selection scheme. This explanation also accounts for the recent report that DAL5-lacZ expression increases in an rtg2Δ (24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because Rtg2p is required for nuclear localization of the retrograde transcriptional activators, Rtg1/3p, its loss would result in diminished CIT2 expression just as occurs with overexpression of MKS1 (26Zhegchang L. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Sekito T. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The most difficult incongruity to explain is the heterologous DAL5-lacZ expression data obtained by Edskes et al., Pierce et al., and in our laboratory (Ref. 22Edskes H.K. Hanover J.A. Wickner R.B. Genet. 1999; 153: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar and 24Pierce M.M. Maddelein M-L. Roberts T. Wickner R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13213-13218Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, respectively). The former researchers find that DAL5-lacZ expression decreases 70-fold in an mks1Δ relative to wild type cells growing in proline medium, whereas we see only a small (2.5-fold) decrease, which is not substantiated by our Northern blot data. Further, the NCR sensitivity of the β-galactosidase production we measure is not significantly different in wild type and mks1Δ cells. These differences may be an example of heterologous gene expression failing to mirror steady state mRNA data.

https://openalex.org/W2036361515,"During mitosis, the catalytic activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) α is enhanced, and its inhibitory binding to Grb2, which specifically blocks Src dephosphorylation, is decreased. These effects act synergistically to activate Src in mitosis. We show here that these effects are abrogated by mutation of Ser180 and/or Ser204, the sites of protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation within PTPα. Moreover, either a Ser-to-Ala substitution or serine dephosphorylation specifically eliminated the ability of PTPα to dephosphorylate and activate Src even during interphase. This explains why the substitutions eliminated PTPα transforming activity, even though PTPα interphase dephosphorylation of nonspecific substrates was only slightly decreased. This occurred without change in the phosphorylation of PTPα at Tyr789, which is required for “phosphotyrosine displacement” during Src dephosphorylation. Thus, in addition to increasing PTPα nonspecific catalytic activity, Ser180 and Ser204 phosphorylation (along with Tyr789 phosphorylation) regulates PTPα substrate specificity. This involves serine phosphorylation-dependent differential modulation of the affinity of Tyr(P)789for the Src and Grb2 SH2 domains. The results suggest that protein kinase C may participate in the mitotic activation of PTPα and Src and that there are intramolecular interactions between the PTPα C-terminal and membrane-proximal regions that are regulated, at least in part, by serine phosphorylation.

This releases Src from its negatively regulated conformation in which Tyr(P)527 is bound intramolecularly to the Src SH2 domain (see Refs. 6Shalloway D. Taylor S.J.

Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar for review). Overexpression of PTPα results in dephosphorylation of Tyr(P)527 and activation of Srcin vivo (3Zheng X.-M. Wang Y.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Conversely, Src Tyr(P)527phosphorylation is higher and Src catalytic activity is about three times lower in cells from PTPα−/− knockout mice (8Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26105-26112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), indicating that PTPα is a major physiological positive regulator of Src. Constitutive activation of the Src proto-oncoprotein by mutation increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signal transduction proteins and thereby neoplastically transforms a variety of cell types (see Ref. 7Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar for review). The fact that activation by overexpressed PTPα also causes transformation (3Zheng X.-M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) is perhaps more surprising and suggests that PTPα activity is directed in vivopreferentially to Src (and Src family members), rather than to Src substrates. This substrate specificity is due, at least in part, to a phosphotyrosine displacement mechanism that selectively promotes dephosphorylation of Src by PTPα: ∼20% of PTPα in NIH3T3 cells is phosphorylated at Tyr789, a residue near its carboxyl terminus (11den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr789 phosphorylation does not affect PTPα dephosphorylation of nonspecific substrates such as myelin basic protein (MBP), whose phosphotyrosines are not bound, but is required for dephosphorylation of Src Tyr(P)527, which is protected against many phosphatases by its SH2 domain binding (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Tyr789 can bind to the Src SH2 domain, thereby displacing and thus unprotecting Src Tyr(P)527. This also forms a transient bound state that additionally facilitates Tyr(P)527 dephosphorylation (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Tyr(P)789 also binds the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 (11den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which participates in Ras activation following peptide growth factor stimulation (see Ref. 14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar for review). Because of steric hindrance resulting from the interaction of one of the Grb2 SH3 domains with PTPα, PTPα-bound Grb2 is not able to bind Sos, the downstream protein in the Grb2-Ras signal transduction pathway. Thus, it does not appear that localization of Grb2 to the plasma membrane by binding to PTPα can activate the Ras signaling pathway (15den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Su J. Yang L.-T Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28086-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Instead, control may flow in the other direction: Grb2 binding to Tyr(P)789 blocks phosphotyrosine displacement and the ability of PTPα to dephosphorylate Src, so only Grb2-unbound, Tyr(P)789-phosphorylated PTPα is able to activate Src (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most Tyr(P)789-phosphorylated PTPα is bound by Grb2 (11den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), so small changes in Grb2 binding can sensitively control Src-directed PTPα activity. Src is activated during mitosis by a cooperative mechanism: mitotic Cdc2-mediated Ser/Thr phosphorylations within the Src amino-terminal region (17Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Shenoy S. Chackalaparampil I. Bagrodia S. Lin P.-H. Shalloway D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26885-26889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby rendering Tyr(P)527 more susceptible to dephosphorylation (21Bagrodia S. Chackalaparampil I. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Nature. 1991; 349: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Kaech S. Covic L. Wyss A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Nature. 1991; 350: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by PTPα, which itself is activated by other means (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There is almost no mitotic activation of Src in PTPα knockout cells, implying that PTPα is the main PTP involved (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mitotic activation of PTPα has two components: 1) its catalytic activity, as measured on nonphysiological substrates such as MBP, increases ∼2-fold; and 2) the inhibitory binding of Grb2 to PTPα is reduced 3–4-fold (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The latter reduction occurs because of a mitotic decrease in the affinity of PTPα for the Grb2 SH2 domain without a decrease in its affinity for the Src SH2 domain. This results in 2–3-fold increased Src-PTPα co-association and a commensurate increase in Src-directed PTPα activity (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This relief from Grb2 competition combines multiplicatively with the increase in catalytic activity to give a 4–5-fold increase in total Src-directed PTPα activity (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) responsible for increasing PTPα specific activity and selectively decreasing its binding to the Grb2 SH2 domain are not known. The changes occur without altered Tyr789phosphorylation and can be observed with purified PTPα in vitro. Moreover, there is no evidence of PTPα dimerization under the experimental conditions. The changes coincide with mitotic reduction of PTPα electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that hyperphosphorylation is involved. Indeed, treating PTPα with the Ser/Thr-specific phosphatase PP2A coordinately eliminates PTPα mitotic mobility retardation, increased catalytic activity, and decreased Grb2 binding. The effect on Src-directed PTPα activity is even stronger: PP2A treatment not only blocks the mitotic increase, but also reduces, if not eliminates, the ability of interphase PTPα to activate Src (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because PTPα is predominantly phosphorylated at serine and has very little or no threonine phosphorylation (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this suggests that the mitotic activation of PTPα requires, and may be caused by, serine hyperphosphorylation (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Two serine phosphorylation sites in PTPα have already been identified: Ser180 and Ser204 can both be phosphorylated in vitro in NIH3T3 cells by protein kinase C and are phosphorylated in vivo following treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (25den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced serine hyperphosphorylation of PTPα increases its catalytic activity 2–3-fold (25den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar), probably because of phosphorylation at these sites (26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that phosphorylation at Ser180and Ser204 is required for the activation of PTPα that follows treatment of A431 cells with a somatostatin analog (27Stetak A. Csermely P. Ullrich A. Keri G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that phosphorylation at Ser180 and/or Ser204 is involved in the mitotic activation of PTPα, we have compared the effects of separate and coordinate site-specific substitutions at these sites with those of PP2A treatment. We found that these phosphorylations are required for mitotic activation of PTPα, for the change in its SH2 domain-binding properties, and for its ability to activate Src and to transform cells. All PTPα immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed with polyclonal antibody 7-091, which was made in rabbits against a GST fusion protein containing PTPα residues 165–793 (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were carried out with monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (28Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Except for cell lines overexpressing the S180A and S204A mutants (described below), all lines were previously described (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cells were grown; PTPα expression was induced; and cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole and collected by mechanical shake-off as described (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmids for inducible expression of the Ser-to-Ala human PTPα mutants were constructed by replacing coding sequences lying between the two HindIII sites in WT PTPα expression plasmids pNTPTPα (no HA tag) and pTPTPα (with the HA epitope tag YPYDVPDYA) with mutated sequences constructed by PCR. PCR products and restriction fragments that together comprised complete (mutated) coding sequences lying between the HindIII sites were then religated into vector plasmid pTet-Splice (Invitrogen) to construct plasmids that were identical to pNTPTPα or pTPTPα except for the specified mutations. For the S180A substitution, a mutatedHindIII-EclXI fragment was prepared by PCR using pNTPTPα as a template with the 5′-primer 5′-CGCCAAGCTTGGCCACCATGGATTCCTGGTTCATTCTTGT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-CAGTGCGGCCGTTGGATAAGCGGAAAGCATTGGAAT-3′. The 5′-primer contained the HindIII site (underlined) and the start codon (boldface); the 3′-primer contained the EclXI site (underlined). The substitution AGA → AGC(boldface italics) in the 3′-primer resulted in the S180A substitution. This PCR product was cleaved withHindIII and EclXI, mixed with the complementary gel-purified EclXI-HindIII restriction fragment from pNTPTPα, and ligated into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTPα(S180A). Plasmid pTPTPα(S180A), which expresses PTPα(S180A)-HA, was constructed similarly, except that the EclXI-HindIII fragment was from pTPTPα. For the S204A mutation, a 0.6-kilobase pairHindIII-BglII fragment containing the 5′-portion of the WT coding sequence was copied from pNTPTPα by PCR using the 5′-primer 5′-CGCCAAGCTTGGCCACCATGGATTCCTGGTTCATTCTTGT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TTGGTGGCTGGAGATCTGGCCAGAAGTGGCACACTCT-3′. The 5′-primer contained the HindIII site (underlined) and the start codon (boldface); the 3′-primer contained the BglII site (underlined). This PCR product was cleaved with HindIII and BglII. (Although the 3′-primer contained the substitution AGC → GGC at nucleotides 6–8, the BglII digestion removed this region.) The BglII-HindIII fragment containing the downstream coding sequence with the S204A mutation was generated using pNTPTPα as a PCR template with the 5′-primer 5′-TGGCCAGATCTCCAGCCACCAACAGGAAATACCCACCCCT-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TGTTGAAGCTTACTTGAAGTTGGCATAATC-3′. The 5′-primer contained the BglII site (underlined); the 3′-primer contained the stop codon (boldface) and theHindIII site (underlined). The mutation AGC →GCC (boldface italics) in the 5′-primer caused the S204A substitution. This PCR product was cleaved with BglII and HindIII, and both fragments were ligated into theHindIII site of pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTPα(S204A). Plasmid pTPTPα(S204A), which expresses PTPα(S204A)-HA, was constructed by ligating the gel-purifiedHindIII-ClaI restriction fragment from pNTPTPα(S204A), containing the S204A mutation, along with the complementary gel-purified ClaI-HindIII restriction fragment from pTPTPα, containing the downstream WT PTPα-HA sequence, into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice. To construct the PTPα(S180A/S204A) expression plasmid, the 0.56-kilobase pair gel-purified HindIII-EclXI fragment from pNTPTPα(S180A) was mixed with the gel-purifiedEclXI-HindIII fragment from pNTPTPα(S204A) and ligated into pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTPα(S180A/S204A). Plasmid pTPTPα(S180A/S204A), which expresses the HA-tagged double mutant, was constructed similarly, except that theEclXI-HindIII restriction fragment was isolated from pTPTPα(S204A). For the S202A mutation, anEclXI-HindIII fragment containing the mutation and the downstream coding sequence was prepared by PCR using pNTPTPα as a template with the 5′-primer 5′-CCAACGGCCGCACTGAGGATGTGGAGCCCCAGAGTGTGCCACTTCTGGCCAGAGCCCCA-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-TGTTGAAGCTTACTTGAAGTTGGCATAATC-3′. The 5′-primer contained the EclXI site (underlined); the 3′-primer contained the stop codon (boldface) and theHindIII site (underlined). The mutation TCC →GCC (boldface italics) in the 5′-primer resulted in the S202A substitution. This PCR product was digested with EclXI and HindIII, mixed with the 0.57-kilobase pair gel-purifiedHindIII-EclXI restriction fragment from pNTPTPα, and ligated into the HindIII site of pTet-Splice to make plasmid pNTPTPα(S202A). The mutations were verified by sequencing of the PTPα coding region. These plasmids were stably cotransfected with the G418 resistance plasmid pSV2neo (29Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) and the tetracycline transactivator plasmid pTet-tTak (Invitrogen) into NIH3T3 cells, selected for G418 resistance and for inducible expression of the PTPα mutants as described (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These were performed as described previously (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed for colony formation on 0.3% agarose without doxycycline as described previously (30Shalloway D. Coussens P.M. Yaciuk P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have previously described genetically modified NIH3T3 cell lines that inducibly overexpress (under repressive control of doxycycline) human WT PTPα and PTPα(Y789F) and the same proteins with a nine-residue HA tag at their C termini, designated PTPα-HA and PTPα(Y789F)-HA (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A “Neo” cell line that had been transfected with an empty vector system and co-selected in the same manner provided a control for analyzing endogenous PTPα. It was previously shown that the localization and specific catalytic activity of overexpressed WT PTPα are similar to those of endogenous PTPα in both unsynchronized and mitotic cells (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). New plasmids and corresponding NIH3T3-derived cell lines for inducible expression of PTPα (with or without the HA tag) with Ser-to-Ala substitutions at residues 180 and/or 204 were created using similar methods (see “Materials and Methods”). A cell line expressing PTPα with a Ser-to-Ala substitution at residue 202 (the only potential site of cyclin-dependent kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase serine phosphorylation within PTPα) was also generated as a control for some experiments. The overexpresser cells maximally expressed ∼10–20 times the amount of endogenous PTPα when grown in the absence of doxycycline for ≥16 h. So that equal levels of overexpression could be obtained in both unsynchronized and mitotic cells, the time of induction was controlled so that transgene PTPα expression was induced only to ∼5–10 times endogenous levels for the biochemical experiments (see Ref. 24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and “Materials and Methods”). Expression levels were similar within each group of cell lines expressing untagged or HA-tagged proteins (data not shown). To see if we could detect serine phosphates added during mitosis, unsynchronized and nocodazole-arrested mitotic WT PTPα and PTPα(S180A/S204A) overexpresser cells were labeled in vivowith [32P]orthophosphate, and the radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by anti-PTPα immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and autoradiography. To avoid radioactivity-induced G2 arrest (17Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1988; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it was necessary to label all the cells for relatively short (2–3 h) periods and the mitotic cells after nocodazole arrest. Thus, equilibrium labeling was probably not achieved, and only phosphorylations that were catalyzed during metaphase (the point of nocodazole arrest) were detected in the mitotic cells. Under these conditions, no significant changes in the stoichiometry of labeling were observed between WT and mutant PTPα from unsynchronized or mitotic cells (data not shown). WT PTPα and PTPα(S180A/S204A) from unsynchronized and mitotic cells displayed similar radioactive phosphoamino acid compositions: a significant excess of phosphoserine over phosphotyrosine and very little or no phosphothreonine (data not shown). We conclude that the serine phosphorylation(s) that cause the electrophoretic mobility retardation of mitotic PTPα do not turn over during mitosis and that PTPα contains at least one site of serine phosphorylation in addition to Ser180 and Ser204. MBP that had been tyrosine-phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (by v-Src) was incubated with WT or mutant PTPα-HA that had been immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from unsynchronized or nocodazole-arrested mitotic overexpresser cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed with 0.5 m NaCl to remove any co-associated proteins. Specific PTP activity was determined by measuring the relative amounts of 32P released per molecule of PTPα. As previously reported (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the activity of WT PTPα from mitotic cells was about twice that of PTPα from unsynchronized cells (Fig.1A), and there was very little change during mitosis in the amount of PTPα (Fig. 1C) or the extent of its tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). (Tyr789 is the only phosphorylated tyrosine in PTPα during both interphase and mitosis (13Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), so anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting specifically detects its phosphorylation.) The increased specific activity correlated with reduced electrophoretic mobility of PTPα (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Both coordinate and separate S180A and/or S204A mutations blocked the mitotic increase in PTP activity (Fig. 1). These mutations also caused a small but reproducible 10–20% decrease in the specific activity of PTPα in unsynchronized cells. The mitotic mobility retardation was completely blocked in PTPα(S180A/S204A), consistent with the hypothesis that the retardation resulted from mitotic phosphorylation at these sites. The mutations did not significantly affect Tyr789 phosphorylation. Similar experiments were conducted with immunoprecipitated WT PTPα and PTPα(S180A/S204A) that had been incubated with the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A before incubation with MBP. PP2A treatment slightly reduced the specific activity of interphase PTPα and eliminated the mitotic increase in activity (Fig. 1D) without affecting Tyr789 phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). It also restored the electrophoretic mobility of mitotic PTPα almost to its interphase level (Fig. 1F). In contrast, it had no observable effect on the activity or mobility of the serine double mutant. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the PP2A effect results from its dephosphorylation of Ser180 or Ser204. These results suggest that the mitotic activation of PTPα nonspecific catalytic activity requires mitotic hyperphosphorylation of both Ser180 and Ser204. The small decrease in the activity of PTPα from unsynchronized cells upon mutation or PP2A treatment may reflect the fact that PTPα is phosphorylated to some extent at these sites even during interphase (26Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of WT and mutant PTPα to activate Src in vitro was measured after immunopurifying the HA-tagged phosphatase from unsynchronized or mitotic overexpresser cells. Equal amounts of solubilized phosphatase were incubated in phosphatase buffer with chicken WT Src that had been immunoprecipitated from unsynchronized NIH3T3-derived Src overexpresser cells. After washing away PTPα, the specific activity of the treated Src was measured by incubating it with [γ-32P]ATP and acid-denatured enolase (substrate) and measuring the amount of transferred 32P by autoradiography (Fig.2A, panel a). Because Tyr(P)527 is the only detectable phosphotyrosine in Src from these overexpresser cells (31Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting was used to assay the amount of Tyr527 phosphorylation (Fig.2A, panel b). As previously shown (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), PTPα from mitotic cells dephosphorylated Src and increased its kinase activity more than PTPα from unsynchronized cells (Fig.2A, lanes 3 and 4). We now found that Ser-to-Ala mutation of either Ser180 or Ser204or both not only abrogated the mitotic increase in activity, but largely eliminated the ability of PTPα from both unsynchronized and mitotic cells to dephosphorylate and activate Src at all (Fig.2A, lanes 7–12). The very low residual activity of the Ser-to-Ala mutants was similar to that of the Y789F mutant (Fig.2A, lanes 5 and 6). Additional experiments were conducted in which PTPα was dephosphorylated by PP2A prior to incubation with the Src substrate. Phosphatase-treated WT PTPα from both unsynchronized and mitotic cells had the same very low Src-activating ability as untreated PTPα(S180A/S204A) (Fig. 2B, panel a, lanes 3–6). Moreover, PP2A treatment did not affect PTPα(S180A/S204A) (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8), suggesting that its effect on WT PTPα was mediated via dephosphorylation of Ser180 and Ser204. To assess the Src-directed activity of WT and mutant PTPα in vivo, Src was immunoprecipitated from unsynchronized and mitotic non-overexpresser cells (control) and PTPα overexpresser cells, and Src phosphorylation and its ability to phosphorylate enolase were measured (Fig. 3, a and b). All of the overexpresser cell lines expressed approximately equal amounts of Src and transgene PTPα (Fig. 3, c and d). As previously shown (24Zheng X.-M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), overexpression of WT PTPα decreased Src tyrosine phosphorylation"

https://openalex.org/W2034361496,"Certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases prevent potential errors in protein synthesis through deacylation of mischarged tRNAs. For example, the close homologs isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) and valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) deacylate Val-tRNAIle and Thr-tRNAVal, respectively. Here we examined the chemical requirements at the 3′-end of the tRNA for these hydrolysis reactions. Single atom substitutions at the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of a variety of mischarged RNAs revealed that, while acylation is at the 2′-OH for both enzymes, IleRS catalyzes deacylation specifically from the 3′-OH and not from the 2′-OH. In contrast, ValRS can deacylate non-cognate amino acids from the 2′-OH. Moreover, for IleRS the specificity for a 3′-O location of the scissile ester bond could be forced to the 2′-position by introduction of a 3′-O-methyl moiety. Cumulatively, these and other results suggest that the editing sites of these class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have a degree of inherent plasticity for substrate recognition. The ability to adapt to subtle differences in mischarged RNAs may be important for the high accuracy of aminoacylation.

Cumulatively, these and other results suggest that the editing sites of these class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have a degree of inherent plasticity for substrate recognition. The ability to adapt to subtle differences in mischarged RNAs may be important for the high accuracy of aminoacylation. The genetic code is based on the accurate aminoacylation of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (1Carter C.W., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These enzymes synthesize aminoacyl-tRNA in two steps. The amino acid is first reacted with ATP to give an activated aminoacyl adenylate, and then transesterified to the 3′-end of the tRNA. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases must precisely recognize both amino acid and tRNA substrates to yield the correct product. While the structural diversity of tRNA molecules allows for rigorous selection based on RNA-protein interactions, differentiating between closely related amino acids is more challenging. Years ago, Pauling (3Pauling L. Festschrift fuer Prof. Dr. Arthur Stoll. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1958Google Scholar) noted the intrinsic difficulty for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase in the recognition of isoleucine over valine through simple binding interactions.Valine, which differs from isoleucine by a single methylene unit, is activated by Escherichia coliIleRS 1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1tRNA NTasetRNA nucleotidyltransferase2′-dA2′-deoxyadenosine3′-dA 3′-deoxyadenosine2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine3′-fluoro-A3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine3′-OMe-A3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1tRNA NTasetRNA nucleotidyltransferase2′-dA2′-deoxyadenosine3′-dA 3′-deoxyadenosine2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine3′-fluoro-A3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine3′-OMe-A3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine only 180-fold less efficiently than isoleucine (4Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of valine for isoleucine at isoleucine codons in the cell is less than 1 in 3000 (5Loftfield R.B. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The increased specificity is a result of the RNA-dependent editing of misactivated valine by IleRS (6Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A highly related class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, valyl-tRNA synthetase, faces a similar dilemma in the accurate aminoacylation of tRNAVal. Threonine, an isostere of valine, is activated at a rate 250-fold reduced from that of valine (8Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Like IleRS, ValRS prevents the misincorporation of threonine into proteins through the RNA-dependent editing of misactivated threonine (9Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).These reactions strictly require the presence of the cognate tRNA (6Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNA, the enzymatically generated misactivated adenylates remain in the active site, sequestered from hydrolysis. Upon addition of cognate tRNA the misactivated amino acids are hydrolyzed, regenerating the free tRNA and amino acid, while converting 1 equivalent of ATP to AMP. A prominent mechanism for editing misactivated amino acids is the rapid hydrolysis of transiently mischarged tRNA (7Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed at a second active site on IleRS and ValRS. This site is located within a large insertion (termed CP1) into the canonical class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase active-site fold. The CP1 domain as an isolated polypeptide hydrolyzes its cognate mischarged tRNA (11Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of Thermus thermophilus IleRS pinpointed the editing site to a pocket of essentially invariant amino acids within CP1 located ∼30 Å from the aminoacylation active site (12Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This site binds valine but sterically excludes isoleucine. A co-crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus IleRS with tRNAIlesuggested how the tRNA may place its 3′-end in the editing site (13Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, specific interactions in the editing site could not be observed. More recently, the co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus ValRS bound to tRNAVal demonstrated a similar mode of tRNA binding (14Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although a mischarged amino acid could be modeled at the end of the tRNA, neither this model nor mutational analysis established a hydrolytic mechanism (15Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11204-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8180-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Early work demonstrated an important role for the 3′-end of tRNAIle and tRNAVal in editing (17von der Haar F. Cramer F. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18von der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4131-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Igloi G.L. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of this role was not determined. Model studies of uncatalyzed ester hydrolysis demonstrated that a cis-hydroxyl stimulates hydrolysis, likely via intramolecular hydrogen bonding (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). While its effect may be important for the efficiency of deacylation, the importance of the terminal hydroxyls could be related to the rapid transacylation known to occur between the two cis-hydroxyls (with a rate of ∼10 s−1) (21Taiji M. Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3220-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, while aminoacylation is specific to a particular hydroxyl (2′-OH in the cases of IleRS and ValRS (22Cramer F. Faulhammer H. von der Haar F. Sprinzl M. Sternbach H. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) deacylation could potentially occur from either the 2′- or 3′-OH group.To address issues that could not be taken up in earlier work because of then existing technical limitations, we constructed a variety of mischarged RNA substrates having different substitutions at the positions of the terminal hydroxyl groups. Using these substrates we were able to test directly whether deacylation occurred from a specific hydroxyl, whether transacylation from the 2′- to the 3′-OH was required for deacylation, and finally, whether a clear chemical role for vicinal hydroxyls could be identified.DISCUSSIONA mischarged 3′-dA76 tRNAIle is completely resistant to deacylation by IleRS. This resistance is most likely because the aminoacyl linkage prevents the scissile ester bond from coming into close proximity of the hydrolytic machinery while bound in the editing site. The magnitude of the rate difference (≥750-fold) between deacylation of Val-A76 tRNAIle and Val-3′-dA76 tRNAIle is larger than one might expect if the 3′-OH had a noncovalent role in deacylation. The calculated difference in transition state stabilization of ∼4 kcal/mol is beyond the range of energies observed for average hydrogen bonds or the electronegative inductive effect of a neighboring hydroxyl. Correspondingly, a fluoro group in place of the 3′-OH failed to allow for even partial deacylation activity. Earlier work did not directly investigate the deacylation of Val-2′-dA76 tRNAIle and, given the available data, concluded that the role of the 3′-OH was to assist catalysis of deacylation from the 2′-OH (43Freist W. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, reasonable quantities of mischarged 2′-dA76 tRNAIle were produced, isolated, and directly shown to be deacylated by IleRS. This mischarged substrate, with a fixed 3′-O-aminoacyl linkage, showed only a modest 5-fold decrease in initial rate of deacylation. This rate decrease is in the range of what might be expected for the loss of neighboring group effects due to the missing 2′-OH (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal circumstances, transacylation from the 2′- to the 3′-OH is required for deacylation of Val-tRNAIle by IleRS.Although IleRS cannot deacylate Val-3′-dA76 tRNAIle, ValRS deacylates Thr-3′-dA76 tRNAVal with an approximate 10-fold reduction in rate compared with deacylation of Thr-A76 tRNAVal. Still, it is possible that ValRS preferentially deacylates 3′-O-aminoacyl esters. Even though the initial site of aminoacylation is the 2′-OH, because transacylation is more rapid than deacylation (21Taiji M. Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3220-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a 3′-O-aminoacyl ester could be the main substrate for editing. In that event, a 10-fold reduced deacylation rate of Thr-3′-dA76 tRNAVal relative to Thr-A76 tRNAVal would not be surprising.Alternatively, the role of the 3′-OH of tRNAVal may be as a hydrogen bond donor (Fig. 8). In this model, derived from studies of non-catalyzed ester hydrolysis by Bruice and co-workers (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the neighboring hydroxyl donates a hydrogen to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, thereby helping to stabilize the build up of negative charge (Fig. 8, left). The 3′-dA analog is obviously unable to fulfill this role (Fig. 8,middle). Not only is the fluoro group unable to donate a hydrogen bond, but its partial negative charge likely also induces some electrostatic repulsion that distorts the tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 8, right). This model fits best with the observed trends in deacylation rates for these substrates.The observed deacylation of Val-3′-OMe-A76 minihelixIle by IleRS demonstrates a shift in substrate specificity for deacylation reminiscent of the substrate specificity ValRS shows. The mechanism by which IleRS is able to hydrolyze this 2′-O-aminoacyl ester likely arises from some local structural rearrangement induced by the bulkier 3′-end as opposed to a hydrogen bonding role for the 3′-OMe group (the 3′-OH cannot play a similar hydrogen-bonding role during deacylation of Val-2′-dA76 substrates). In the context of a 2′-O-aminoacyl ester, the editing active site may be too crowded to accommodate the 3′-OMe group in the normal binding orientation. Alternatively, there could be a small hydrophobic interaction that is made with the 3′-O-Me group, also altering the position of the scissile ester bond with respect to the catalytic center. Such local structural perturbations are certainly feasible within the IleRS-editing site, as evidenced by the deacylation activity seen in the presence of 20% methanol.Regardless of the detailed mechanism, the results show that the editing site is inherently plastic with respect to recognition of mischarged tRNA. For IleRS and ValRS to discriminate against valine and threonine, respectively, the editing sites of both enzymes must recognize subtle differences in aminoacyl side chains. Yet this fine structure discrimination must also be flexible, as both enzymes have been shown to edit multiple non-cognate amino acids (44Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third, related synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, has also been reported to edit multiple amino acids (45Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Mursinna R.S. Lincecum T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This remarkable combination of specificity and plasticity in recognition of the aminoacyl side chain is shown here to include the position of the aminoacyl group on the 3′-end of tRNA. This plasticity may have developed over a long period of evolution and may have been particularly important in the early stages of the development of aminoacylation systems and the genetic code, when aminoacyl-RNA substrates were not perfected. Indeed, the CP1 insertion is ancient, as it is conserved throughout evolution and found in deeply rooted organisms of all three kingdoms such as the Thermotogales, Crenarchaeota, and Diplomonads (47Schimmel, P., and Ribas de Pouplanas, L. (2002) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The genetic code is based on the accurate aminoacylation of tRNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (1Carter C.W., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These enzymes synthesize aminoacyl-tRNA in two steps. The amino acid is first reacted with ATP to give an activated aminoacyl adenylate, and then transesterified to the 3′-end of the tRNA. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases must precisely recognize both amino acid and tRNA substrates to yield the correct product. While the structural diversity of tRNA molecules allows for rigorous selection based on RNA-protein interactions, differentiating between closely related amino acids is more challenging.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1958Google Scholar) noted the intrinsic difficulty for isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase in the recognition of isoleucine over valine through simple binding interactions. Valine, which differs from isoleucine by a single methylene unit, is activated by Escherichia coliIleRS 1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1tRNA NTasetRNA nucleotidyltransferase2′-dA2′-deoxyadenosine3′-dA 3′-deoxyadenosine2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine3′-fluoro-A3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine3′-OMe-A3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine1The abbreviations used are: IleRSisoleucyl-tRNA synthetaseValRSvalyl-tRNA synthetaseCP1connective polypeptide 1tRNA NTasetRNA nucleotidyltransferase2′-dA2′-deoxyadenosine3′-dA 3′-deoxyadenosine2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine3′-fluoro-A3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine3′-OMe-A3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine only 180-fold less efficiently than isoleucine (4Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of valine for isoleucine at isoleucine codons in the cell is less than 1 in 3000 (5Loftfield R.B. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The increased specificity is a result of the RNA-dependent editing of misactivated valine by IleRS (6Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,7Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A highly related class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, valyl-tRNA synthetase, faces a similar dilemma in the accurate aminoacylation of tRNAVal. Threonine, an isostere of valine, is activated at a rate 250-fold reduced from that of valine (8Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Like IleRS, ValRS prevents the misincorporation of threonine into proteins through the RNA-dependent editing of misactivated threonine (9Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase valyl-tRNA synthetase connective polypeptide 1 tRNA nucleotidyltransferase 2′-deoxyadenosine 2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine 3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine 3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase valyl-tRNA synthetase connective polypeptide 1 tRNA nucleotidyltransferase 2′-deoxyadenosine 2′-fluoro-A, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroadenosine 3′-deoxy-3′-fluoroadenosine 3′-deoxy-3′-O-methyl-adenosine These reactions strictly require the presence of the cognate tRNA (6Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNA, the enzymatically generated misactivated adenylates remain in the active site, sequestered from hydrolysis. Upon addition of cognate tRNA the misactivated amino acids are hydrolyzed, regenerating the free tRNA and amino acid, while converting 1 equivalent of ATP to AMP. A prominent mechanism for editing misactivated amino acids is the rapid hydrolysis of transiently mischarged tRNA (7Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed at a second active site on IleRS and ValRS. This site is located within a large insertion (termed CP1) into the canonical class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase active-site fold. The CP1 domain as an isolated polypeptide hydrolyzes its cognate mischarged tRNA (11Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of Thermus thermophilus IleRS pinpointed the editing site to a pocket of essentially invariant amino acids within CP1 located ∼30 Å from the aminoacylation active site (12Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This site binds valine but sterically excludes isoleucine. A co-crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus IleRS with tRNAIlesuggested how the tRNA may place its 3′-end in the editing site (13Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, specific interactions in the editing site could not be observed. More recently, the co-crystal structure of T. thermophilus ValRS bound to tRNAVal demonstrated a similar mode of tRNA binding (14Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although a mischarged amino acid could be modeled at the end of the tRNA, neither this model nor mutational analysis established a hydrolytic mechanism (15Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11204-11210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8180-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Early work demonstrated an important role for the 3′-end of tRNAIle and tRNAVal in editing (17von der Haar F. Cramer F. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18von der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4131-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Igloi G.L. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of this role was not determined. Model studies of uncatalyzed ester hydrolysis demonstrated that a cis-hydroxyl stimulates hydrolysis, likely via intramolecular hydrogen bonding (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). While its effect may be important for the efficiency of deacylation, the importance of the terminal hydroxyls could be related to the rapid transacylation known to occur between the two cis-hydroxyls (with a rate of ∼10 s−1) (21Taiji M. Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3220-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, while aminoacylation is specific to a particular hydroxyl (2′-OH in the cases of IleRS and ValRS (22Cramer F. Faulhammer H. von der Haar F. Sprinzl M. Sternbach H. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) deacylation could potentially occur from either the 2′- or 3′-OH group. To address issues that could not be taken up in earlier work because of then existing technical limitations, we constructed a variety of mischarged RNA substrates having different substitutions at the positions of the terminal hydroxyl groups. Using these substrates we were able to test directly whether deacylation occurred from a specific hydroxyl, whether transacylation from the 2′- to the 3′-OH was required for deacylation, and finally, whether a clear chemical role for vicinal hydroxyls could be identified. DISCUSSIONA mischarged 3′-dA76 tRNAIle is completely resistant to deacylation by IleRS. This resistance is most likely because the aminoacyl linkage prevents the scissile ester bond from coming into close proximity of the hydrolytic machinery while bound in the editing site. The magnitude of the rate difference (≥750-fold) between deacylation of Val-A76 tRNAIle and Val-3′-dA76 tRNAIle is larger than one might expect if the 3′-OH had a noncovalent role in deacylation. The calculated difference in transition state stabilization of ∼4 kcal/mol is beyond the range of energies observed for average hydrogen bonds or the electronegative inductive effect of a neighboring hydroxyl. Correspondingly, a fluoro group in place of the 3′-OH failed to allow for even partial deacylation activity. Earlier work did not directly investigate the deacylation of Val-2′-dA76 tRNAIle and, given the available data, concluded that the role of the 3′-OH was to assist catalysis of deacylation from the 2′-OH (43Freist W. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, reasonable quantities of mischarged 2′-dA76 tRNAIle were produced, isolated, and directly shown to be deacylated by IleRS. This mischarged substrate, with a fixed 3′-O-aminoacyl linkage, showed only a modest 5-fold decrease in initial rate of deacylation. This rate decrease is in the range of what might be expected for the loss of neighboring group effects due to the missing 2′-OH (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal circumstances, transacylation from the 2′- to the 3′-OH is required for deacylation of Val-tRNAIle by IleRS.Although IleRS cannot deacylate Val-3′-dA76 tRNAIle, ValRS deacylates Thr-3′-dA76 tRNAVal with an approximate 10-fold reduction in rate compared with deacylation of Thr-A76 tRNAVal. Still, it is possible that ValRS preferentially deacylates 3′-O-aminoacyl esters. Even though the initial site of aminoacylation is the 2′-OH, because transacylation is more rapid than deacylation (21Taiji M. Yokoyama S. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3220-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a 3′-O-aminoacyl ester could be the main substrate for editing. In that event, a 10-fold reduced deacylation rate of Thr-3′-dA76 tRNAVal relative to Thr-A76 tRNAVal would not be surprising.Alternatively, the role of the 3′-OH of tRNAVal may be as a hydrogen bond donor (Fig. 8). In this model, derived from studies of non-catalyzed ester hydrolysis by Bruice and co-workers (20Bruice T.C. Fife T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962; 84: 1973-1979Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the neighboring hydroxyl donates a hydrogen to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate, thereby helping to stabilize the build up of negative charge (Fig. 8, left). The 3′-dA analog is obviously unable to fulfill this role (Fig. 8,middle). Not only is the fluoro group unable to donate a hydrogen bond, but its partial negative charge likely also induces some electrostatic repulsion that distorts the tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 8, right). This model fits best with the observed trends in deacylation rates for these substrates.The observed deacylation of Val-3′-OMe-A76 minihelixIle by IleRS demonstrates a shift in substrate specificity for deacylation reminiscent of the substrate specificity ValRS shows. The mechanism by which IleRS is able to hydrolyze this 2′-O-aminoacyl ester likely arises from some local structural rearrangement induced by the bulkier 3′-end as opposed to a hydrogen bonding role for the 3′-OMe group (the 3′-OH cannot play a similar hydrogen-bonding role during deacylation of Val-2′-dA76 substrates). In the context of a 2′-O-aminoacyl ester, the editing active site may be too crowded to accommodate the 3′-OMe group in the normal binding orientation. Alternatively, there could be a small hydrophobic interaction that is made with the 3′-O-Me group, also altering the position of the scissile ester bond with respect to the catalytic center. Such local structural perturbations are certainly feasible within the IleRS-editing site, as evidenced by the deacylation activity seen in the presence of 20% methanol.Regardless of the detailed mechanism, the results show that the editing site is inherently plastic with respect to recognition of mischarged tRNA. For IleRS and ValRS to discriminate against valine and threonine, respectively, the editing sites of both enzymes must recognize subtle differences in aminoacyl side chains. Yet this fine structure discrimination must also be flexible, as both enzymes have been shown to edit multiple non-cognate amino acids (44Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third, related synthetase, leucyl-tRNA synthetase, has also been reported to edit multiple amino acids (45Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Mursinna R.S. Lincecum T.L. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5376-5381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This remarkable combination of specificity and plasticity in recognition of the aminoacyl side chain is shown here to include the position of the aminoacyl group on the 3′-end of tRNA. This plasticity may have developed over a long period of evolution and may have been particularly important in the early stages of the development of aminoacylation systems and the genetic code, when aminoacyl-RNA substrates were not perfected. Indeed, the CP1 insertion is ancient, as it is conserved throughout evolution and found in deeply rooted organisms of all three kingdoms such as the Thermotogales, Crenarchaeota, and Diplomonads (47Schimmel, P., and Ribas de Pouplanas, L. (2002) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). A mischarged 3′-dA76 tRNAIle is completely resistant to deacylation by IleRS. This resistance is most likely because the aminoacyl linkage prevents the scissile ester bond from coming into close proximity of the hydrolytic machinery while bound in the editing site.

It has been demonstrated that FGF-7 regulates nephron number and ureteric bud growth (17Qiao J. Uzzo R. Obara-Ishihara T. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Herzlinger D. Dev. Suppl. 1999; 126: 547-554Google Scholar), thus potentially involving it in the development of congenital anomalies of the urethra and disorganization of the trigone (18Baker L.A. Gomez R.A. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 569-584PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, despite defects in hair follicle, bladder wall, and ureteric bud differentiation, FGF7-null mice appear developmentally normal and fertile (15Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). One potential source of a compensatory pathway is the polypeptide product of the FGF-10 gene that is 51% identical to FGF-7 at the amino acid level. During embryonic development, FGF-10 is expressed preferentially in the lungs and prospective limb mesenchyme. It appears to be a key factor in the initial limb budding and continuous limb bud outgrowth of mice. FGF-10 null mice lack limbs and lungs, indicating that FGF-10 is absolutely essential for normal organogenesis and viability during development (19Min H. Danilenko D.M. Scully S.A. Bolon B. Ring B.D. Tarpley J.E. DeRose M. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the structure of the humanFGF-10 gene and demonstrate that this gene is transcriptionally active in fibroblasts of the bladder lamina propria. Recombinant preparations of human FGF-10 were active in proliferation assays of human urothelial cells through a pathway that involves a novel form of the FGFR2IIIb receptor. The recombinant protein was mitogenic for bladder urothelium in wild-type and FGF7-null mice and is likely to function through the same receptor as its close relative FGF-7 does.DISCUSSIONOur results provide the first evidence that FGF-10 plays an important role in regulating DNA synthesis of urothelial cells, a crucial process involved in control of growth, differentiation, and repair of the urothelium. This process is described by a complex network of paracrine action that originates in the fibroblasts of the mesenchyme but acts on urothelial cells of the transitional epithelium. Once FGF-10 is synthesized and secreted by these fibroblasts, the growth factor must then traverse the collagenous network of the lamina propria, cross the urothelial cell membrane, interact with the urothelial cell surface, and ultimately trigger a mitogenic event. The mechanisms by which FGF-10 arrives at the cell surface and how its signal is transduced to stimulate progression through the urothelial cell cycle are currently unknown.The FGF receptor (FGFR) signal transduction complex is comprised by three components: (i) the regulatory polypeptide FGF, (ii) transmembrane tyrosine kinases (FGFRTK), and (iii) heparan sulfate proteoglycans (28McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In our in vitro model of primary cultures of human urothelial cells, we found that our preparations of recombinant FGF-10 required heparin for activity in assays of FGFRTK activation (i.e. phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of bladder FGFRTK) and in assays of [3H]thymidine incorporation. The observed dependence on heparin for FGF-10 activity in assays of DNA synthesis is in agreement with studies with Balb/MK mouse epidermal keratinocytes (29Igarashi M. Finch P.W. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13230-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and human prostate epithelial cells (30Lu W. Luo Y. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12827-12834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The addition of a C-terminal His hexamer to rFGF10-His did not influence binding of rFGF10-His to heparin affinity resins. This result is significant because the C-terminal region of fibroblast growth factors is crucial for its biological activity and high level protein expression in mammalian cells (31Miyakawa K. Ozawa K. Uruno T. Imamura T. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The identity of the in vivo heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in the FGFR signal transduction complex is not known.Our results suggest that FGFRTK activation is linked to urothelial cell mitogenesis. We have characterized the urothelial cell FGFRTK activated by incubation with rFGF10-His and have discovered that the 72-kDa bladder FGFR2IIIb isoform is 20 kDa smaller than the canonical FGFR2III polypeptide (KGFR, accession number A45081). While we cannot rule out the possibility of proteolysis during our immunoprecipitation steps, we feel that such degradation is unlikely because of the wide variety of protease inhibitors and cold temperatures we employed during these steps. We favor a variant form that probably arises from alternative splicing, a well recognized phenomenon that generates a complex array of FGFRTK from only 4 FGFR genes. The anti-FGFR2IIIb antibody used to immunodetect the 72-kDa bladder isoform is specific for the intracellular/tyrosine kinase domain, thus raising the possibility that one or more of the 3 internal, immunoglobulin-like domains have been deleted. Downstream signaling events have yet to be described, but we believe that extracellular FGF-10 would stimulate receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation or recycling. It is plausible that FGF-10 can escape endosomes or lysosomes and reach the nucleus. Indeed, our data support the translocation of rFGF10-His into urothelial cell nuclei. We consider 4 possibilities to explain this translocation phenomenon: 1) a true nuclear localization signal exists, 2) simple diffusion, 3) co-translocation with the receptor for rFGF10-His, or 4) assistance from a carrier protein. Whether nuclear transport is linked to mitogenesis or whether a rFGF10-His::FGFR2IIIb complex comigrates into nuclei is not known. Similar nuclear localization signals demonstrated for FGF-1 have been identified by us for FGF-10. We are actively working to construct and test such recombinant mutations of rFGF10-His in our system.Administration of rFGF10-His to mice by intraperitoneal injection was well tolerated, did not lead to complications, and resulted in marked expansion of urothelium. The interaction with the FGFR2IIIb receptor is supported by a high level of mitogenic activity of rFGF10-His in FGF7-null mice. Since both FGF-10 and FGF-7 are known to bind to, activate, and trigger a mitogenic signaling pathway via FGFR2IIIb in prostate epithelium (30Lu W. Luo Y. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12827-12834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suppose that the two growth factors compete for the same receptor in uroepithelium. The continued responsiveness of FGF7-null uroepithelium to rFGF10-His suggests that FGFR2IIIb levels are significant and amenable to activation. In the absence of FGF-7, the number of FGF-7 receptors might be increased. Indeed, FGF-10 acts as a major ligand for FGFR2IIIb in mouse multiorgan development because the phenotypes of FGF10-null mice closely mirror the phenotypes of FGFR2IIIb-null mice (32Ohuchi H. Hori Y. Yamasaki M. Harada H. Sekine K. Kato S. Itoh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Signaling would then proceed via the mitogen-activated protein kinase and JAK-STAT pathways (33Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar).Growth factors such as FGF-10 likely play a critical role in the urothelial response to injury that is secondary to infection, trauma, urinary tract obstruction, and ischemia. They may also be involved in carcinogenesis. Manipulation of the urothelial response via these growth factors may reduce scar formation or accelerate the eradication of infection. The utility of rFGF10-His as a therapeutic agent is therefore promising. The uroepithelial lining of the urinary bladder is a dynamic structure that maintains a barrier to prevent egress of urine and pathogens from the lumen of the bladder. This multilayered urothelia exhibits two hallmark characteristics: an ability to change shape during distension and contraction and a remarkable regenerative capability. Under normal conditions, the urothelium exhibits the slowest turnover of mammalian epithelia (1Hainau B. Dombernowsky P. Cancer. 1974; 33: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During the initial response to injury, the bladder up-regulates the expression of mitogenic growth factors, a process that initiates several rounds of urothelial basal cell proliferation (2Levin R.M. Wein A.J. Buttyan R. Monson F.C. Longhurst P.A. World J. Urol. 1994; 12: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Baskin L.S. Sutherland R.S. Thomson A.A. Hayward S.W. Cunha G.R. Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar). Unlocking the mechanisms responsible for urothelial growth and differentiation is critical to understanding both normal and abnormal bladder pathology. The subsequent modulation of these processes may allow us to improve management of urinary tract abnormalities and inflammatory processes in children and neoplasms and injury in adults. An understanding of these processes may lead to points of potential pharmacological interaction in many disease processes in the bladder. Heparin-binding growth factors define a group of polypeptides that function as mitogenic signals to urothelial cells. For this group,in vitro studies have shown that incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the cellular DNA of human urothelial cells can be stimulated by an epidermal growth factor-like polypeptide (4Freeman M.R. Yoo J.J. Raab G. Soker S. Adam R.M. Schneck F.X. Renshaw A.A. Klagsbrun M. Atala A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5Chai T.C. Zhang C.O.

Vermey M. Zwarthoff E.C. Van der Kwast T.H. J. Pathol. 1994; 173: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although paracrine pathways for mesenchymally derived FGF-7 have been proposed to initiate mitogenic signaling from the FGF-signal transduction complex at the basolateral face of transitional epithelium (3Baskin L.S.

The importance of mesenchyme to bladder development has been demonstrated in elegant studies where embryonic bladder is placed in direct contact with urogenital sinus mesenchyme, the bladder epithelium differentiates into glandular epithelium that resembles prostatic epithelium (12Donjacour A.A.

Insights into the role of FGF-7 in mesenchymal-epithelial cross-talk comes from studies with FGF7-null mice. These mice exhibit the following phenotypes: (i) a matted fur appearance due to a defect in cells giving rise to the hair shaft (15Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and (ii) reduction of the intermediate cell layers of bladder urothelium (16Tash J.A. David S.G. Vaughan E.D.E.

Native gel assays demonstrated that the RapA dimer forms a stable complex with two molecules of Spo0F∼P or with its PhrA pentapeptide inhibitor. The pentapeptide was shown to displace Spo0F∼P from a preformed complex with RapA. The structural organization of Rap phosphatases in tetratricopeptide repeats provides insights on the mechanisms of RapA interaction with its substrate and its inhibitor. The RapA and RapB proteins are aspartyl phosphate phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate the Spo0F∼P intermediate response regulator of the phosphorelay signal transduction system for sporulation initiation in Bacillus subtilis.

Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Bacillus use the differentiation process of sporulation as a means to escape non-favorable environmental conditions and retreat into a quiescent state that allows them to survive indefinitely. In the Bacillus subtilis model system, the sensory information regulating differentiation is integrated by a cytoplasmic signal transduction network called the phosphorelay whose activation by a variety of signals leads to induction of the sporulation process (1Hoch J.A. Cur. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Positive signals toward the differentiation pathway are interpreted and transduced by multiple histidine kinases (KinA to KinE) (2Jiang M. Shao W. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Signal interaction results in an autophosphorylation reaction followed by the transfer of the phosphoryl group to the intermediate response regulator Spo0F and, subsequently, to the Spo0B phosphotransferase and on to the Spo0A response regulator and transcription factor (3Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the phosphoryl group is successively transferred from one protein to the other in an His-to-Asp-to-His-to-Asp order, a series of events that eventually culminates with the accumulation of a threshold of Spo0A∼P that allows sporulation to initiate (4Trach K.A. Burbulys D. Spiegelman G. Perego M. Strauch M.A. Day J. Hoch J.A. Zukowski M.M. Ganesan A.T. Hoch J.A. Genetics and Bio/Technology of Bacilli.3. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 357-365Google Scholar). The kinase activities are counteracted by protein phosphatases that respond to environmental and physiological signals antithetical to sporulation (5Perego M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 366-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Rap family of phosphatases is comprised of 11 closely related proteins in B. subtilis (6Jiang M. Grau R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Among them RapA, RapB, and RapE activities are directed toward the aspartyl phosphate of the single domain response regulator Spo0F of the phosphorelay (6Jiang M. Grau R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The cellular activity of Rap phosphatases in sporulation is modulated both through transcription regulation and by inhibition of enzymatic activity. rapA, rapB, and rapE gene transcription is regulated by conditions antithetical to sporulation such as competence to DNA transformation or vegetative growth (6Jiang M. Grau R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A.

Inhibition of enzymatic activity involves the production of specific pentapeptide inhibitors through a complex export-import pathway. The pentapeptide inhibitor of RapA is encoded by the rapA-associated phrA gene as a 44-amino acid precursor that, after being exported by the SecA-dependent system and processed to the carboxyl-terminal five-amino acid active inhibitor (ARNQT), is reimported by the oligopeptide permease transport system to act intracellularly (10Perego M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Production of the PhrE pentapeptide follows a similar pathway (6Jiang M. Grau R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Phr pentapeptides are specifically active against their cognate Rap phosphatase, and their specificity is highly dependent on the amino acid sequence of the pentapeptide and on the presence of the carboxylic acid at the carboxyl-terminal end of the peptide (11Core L.J. Ishikawa S. Perego M. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1549-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the biochemical characterization of the RapA phosphatase activity and provide the first evidence of complex formation between the enzyme and its substrate Spo0F and/or its inhibitor, the PhrA pentapeptide. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid construction and propagation. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was used for Rap protein overexpression. Plasmid pET16b (Novagen) was used for the construction of the RapA and RapB expression systems (8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) in E. coli. Plasmid pET20b (Novagen) was used to produce a Spo0F protein fused to six His residues at the carboxyl terminus as described in Tzeng and Hoch (12Tzeng Y.-L. Hoch J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RapA fused to six His residues at the carboxyl terminus was obtained for in vivo studies as follows. A 570-bp fragment containing the 3′ half of the rapA gene was amplified by PCR reaction using at the 5′ end, oligo OL-2 (GTCCGCAGAATCCAATG), which immediately precedes an EcoRI site, and at the 3′ end, oligo RapA 3′ His (GCGATCTGCAGTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGGATTTCATATAAACAATCTCC), which fused six histidine codons and a PstI site. The fragment was cloned in the EcoRI-PstI sites of the integrative vector pJM103 (13Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-Positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pRAH. This plasmid was transformed in the wild-type strain JH642 (trpC2, phe-1), where it recombined with the chromosome by a single crossover event, resulting in strain JHRAH that expresses an active RapA-His6 protein. The E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was freshly transformed with plasmid pET16b-RapA or pET16b-RapB and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A600 of 0.7. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm), and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested and immediately resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.9). Cell disruption was obtained by means of three passages through a French press. After removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). The His-tagged proteins were eluted with a 10–200 mm imidazole linear gradient in lysis buffer. The fractions containing the protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, pooled, and dialyzed against the storage buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol, and 10 mmDTT 1The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolEPPS4-(2- hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTAPS3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acidCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidBis-Tris Propane2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineEDC1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl] carbodiimideTPRtetratricopeptide repeatEGSethylene glycolbis (succinimidyl succinate) ). The proteins were concentrated using a Centriprep-30 concentrator (Amicon), frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at –80 °C. Purification of Spo0F-His6 tag and KinA was as previously described (12Tzeng Y.-L. Hoch J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). dithiothreitol 4-(2- hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)-propyl] carbodiimide tetratricopeptide repeat ethylene glycolbis (succinimidyl succinate) A Spo0F protein modified to contain His6 residues at the carboxyl-terminal end was phosphorylated (50 μm) with KinA (0.5 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm at specific activity of 0.6 Ci/mmol) in the phosphorelay buffer (50 mm EPPS (pH 8.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA 5% glycerol) for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was loaded on a 0.5-ml column of nickel-bound His-bind resin (Novagen) equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer, and protein elution was obtained with binding buffer containing 150 mm EDTA. Fractions containing radioactivity were dialyzed in 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.0). Aliquots were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at −80 °C. The ratio of Spo0F/Spo0F∼P in the purified sample, ∼20/80, was determined by analysis of a 10% Tris-glycine native PAGE with an Ultra Scan XL laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrations of Spo0F/Spo0F∼P used throughout this study refer to the fraction of Spo0F∼P only. The basic dephosphorylation assay used to optimize the reaction conditions was carried out in the presence of 10 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. The buffers tested (MES (pH 6.0–6.5), HEPES (pH 7.0–7.5), TAPS (pH 8.0–9.0), CHES (pH 9.0–10.0), CAPS (pH 10.0–11.00), Bis-Tris propane (pH 6.5–9.5)) were all used at 50 mm. KCl and MgCl2 were tested at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 2. Rap A (1 μm) was preincubated in the reaction buffer for 10 min at 25 °C. Radioactively labeled and purified Spo0F∼P (2.5 μm) was added to initiate the reaction. Samples were removed at various intervals, mixed with an equal volume of 2× loading dye buffer, and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The samples were run on a 15% Tris-Tricine-SDS gel and analyzed by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Tris-Tricine native PAGE was carried out according to Schägger and von Jagow (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The gels were prepared using a 3m Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.45 containing 1 mmEDTA. The running buffer contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1m Tricine, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.25). Protein molecular weights were determined using molecular weight markers for non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Sigma) as standards, and the calculations were carried out as described by the supplier's instructions. Strain JHRAH was grown in Schaeffer's sporulation medium (15Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 701-711Crossref Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Cells were monitored at A600 and harvested 1 h after the transition to stationary phase. Cells were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl. The EGS cross-linker (Pierce) resuspended in Me2SO was added to 0.4 mm final concentration. A 30-min incubation at room temperature was allowed before stopping the reaction with 2 m glycine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysis was allowed to occur for 15 min at 37 °C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 15 min. The lysates was mixed with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) (1 ml of resin/100 ml of lysates) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The mixture was poured into a column and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. Elution samples were run on a 10% SDS Tris-glycine PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RapA antibody. In vitro cross-linking of RapA was carried out in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2. RapA (10 μm) was incubated with and without EGS (5 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of SDS loading buffer, the samples were analyzed on a 7% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Before in vitro cross-linking of RapA and PhrA, RapA was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) in an argon-saturated environment. All other reagents used were degassed and saturated with argon as well. RapA and PhrA (10 μm each) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.0) and 50 mm KCl. EDC (Pierce) dissolved in water was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The reactions were then quenched by the addition of SDS sample buffer to a 1× concentration for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Complexes of RapA with Spo0F∼P and PhrA pentapeptide were obtained by incubating the proteins in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 20% glycerol, 10 mm DTT, and 10 mm EDTA for 5 min in ice. After the addition of loading dye, the samples were separated on Tris-Tricine native gels as described above. The protein band identified as the RapA·Spo0F∼P complex was excised from the native gel after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The slice of acrylamide was ground in 1× SDS sample loading buffer. After incubation for 14 h at room temperature, the sample was loaded on a 10% Tris-Tricine SDS gel. As a control, RapA and Spo0F in equal molar ratio were run alongside. After staining, the gel was scanned, and the molar ratio of the two proteins in the complex was determined using the NIH-Image program (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih_image). A polyclonal antibody against RapA was obtained by standard procedures after immunization of rabbits with the purified protein (16Hanly W.C. Artwohl J.E. Bennett B.T. Inst. Lab. Anim. Res. J. 1995; 37: 93-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies against the PhrA peptide were obtained by immunizing the rabbits with a synthetic carboxyl-terminal 12-amino acid PhrA peptide (NH2-GKTFHIAARNQT-COOH) conjugated at the amino terminus with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified by the caprylic acid-ammonium sulfate precipitation method (18Steinbuch M. Audran R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 19Russ C. Callegaro I. Lanza B. Ferrone S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Enrichment for PhrA-specific antibodies was obtained by removing the keyhole limpet hemocyanin contaminant immunoglobulin. Antigen-affinity purification was carried out using a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-agarose column (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Unbound proteins were collected and concentrated with a Centriprep 10 (Amicon) to a final concentration of 1.7 mg/ml. Western blotting was performed by standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 18.1-18.88Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG conjugates using the ECL system from Amersham Biosciences. We previously reported the overexpression and purification of His-tagged RapA and RapB proteins active in dephosphorylating the phosphorylated form of the Spo0F response regulator (8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The activity of the proteins, however, was extremely labile. In the present studies, the same expression systems were used, but some modifications in the purification procedure were introduced that allowed us to obtain active, stable Rap phosphatases. Because RapA and RapB showed a significant level of aggregation when run on native gels and the amino acid sequence indicated the presence of 4 and 3 cysteine residues, respectively, we carried out all the purification steps in the presence of a reducing agent (20 mm β-mercaptoethanol or DTT 10 mm), which seemed to prevent protein aggregation. A further improvement to protein stability was provided by the addition of 20% glycerol. The reducing agent could be omitted without compromising the stability of the protein as long as this was constantly maintained in an argon-saturated environment. The molecular masses of the His-tagged modified RapA and RapB proteins were calculated to be 48,080 and 47,557 Da, respectively. The size of the purified proteins, as observed on SDS-PAGE, was consistent with the predicted molecular masses (data not shown). To estimate the size of RapA and RapB in native conditions, we analyzed the purified proteins by electrophoresis on a set of Tris-Tricine native gels of various polyacrylamide concentrations (9, 10, 11, and 12%). The estimated molecular masses of RapA and RapB were 96 and 92 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the RapA protein was found to be in two species of 47,976 and 95,777 Da (data not shown). An additional estimate of the molecular weights was obtained from in vivo and in vitro cross-linking studies carried out on RapA. Cross-linking of purified RapA with DST (not shown) or EGS (Fig. 1B) showed the presence of dimeric protein on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. In vivo cross-linking experiments were carried out with the EGS reagent on cells of strain JHRAH carrying a rapA gene modified to encode a RapA protein with a 6× histidine tag at the carboxyl-terminal end. Immunodetection using a polyclonal antibody raised against RapA after electrophoresis in denaturing conditions revealed the presence of RapA in monomeric and dimeric form in addition to a higher (>100 kDa) form. At this time, we cannot discern between the possibility that this high molecular weight form is a multimer of RapA or a complex with other proteins (data not shown). These results suggest that the native state of RapA and RapB is most likely the dimer form. The reaction conditions for RapA-dependent dephosphorylation were investigated using purified phosphorylated Spo0F∼P. RapA activity was first analyzed in the pH range 6.0–11 by carrying out the reaction in various buffers at room temperature. MES buffer was used for pH 6.0–6.5, HEPES buffer for pH 7.0–7.5, TAPS buffer for pH 8.0–9.0, CHES buffer for pH 9.0–10.0, and CAPS buffer for pH 10.0–11.0. Phosphatase activity had a sharp optimum at neutral pH. This requirement was confirmed when the Bis-Tris propane buffer was used in the pH range 6.5–9.5 (data not shown). The buffer HEPES at pH 7.0 was thus used for all subsequent experiments. The optimal salt concentration was then analyzed using KCl in the concentration range of 0–200 mm, and a sharp optimum was obtained at 50 mm (data not shown). Magnesium ions were required at 1 mm for optimal activity, but increasing concentrations did not significantly affect the rate of the reaction (data not shown). The requirement for divalent metal ions was further investigated on both RapA and RapB using CaCl2 and MnCl2 in addition to MgCl2 (Fig. 2). The fastest rate of dephosphorylation was obtained in the presence of manganese ions for both RapA- and RapB-dependent dephosphorylation as well as for Spo0F∼P autodephosphorylation. In particular, the percentage of phosphate released by RapB in the presence of MnCl2 was 3- and 4-fold higher than that released in the presence of MgCl2 and CaCl2, respectively. The activity of RapA and RapB observed in the absence of metal ions is most likely due to carryover of some metal ions from the purification of the phosphatase proteins or Spo0F (Fig. 2, lane 1). This activity was in fact abolished in the presence of high levels of the metal chelator EDTA (10 mm) (Fig. 2,lane 2). RapA is a major antagonist of sporulation initiation by promoting the dephosphorylation of Spo0F∼P. RapA does not dephosphorylate Spo0A∼P or other response regulators tested (8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 2S. Ishikawa, L. Core, and M. Perego, unpublished data. In this study, we investigated whether RapA-specific interaction was also limited to the phosphorylated form of Spo0F or would extend to the unphosphorylated protein as well. We studied the interaction of RapA with Spo0F using a native gel electrophoresis assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, RapA and the Spo0F/Spo0F∼P alone display different mobilities in a 10% Tris-Tricine-EDTA native gel. However, when mixed with each other before loading on the gel, a clear shift in the mobility of RapA was observed, indicating the formation of a complex. A titration of Spo0F∼P with RapA showed that at a 1:1 molar ratio, RapA was fully sequestered in the complex. At a 1:2 ratio Spo0F∼P·RapA, ∼50% of RapA ran in a band with the same mobility of the protein alone (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–5). No band shift was observed when unphosphorylated Spo0F was used in the reaction (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4). However, probing the gel with a Spo0F antibody indicated the presence of Spo0F protein at the level of the RapA protein (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). This suggests that RapA may interact with unphosphorylated Spo0F, but a stable complex with altered mobility is formed only with the phosphorylated form of Spo0F. This complex dissociated if the dephosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed after complex formation (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9), thus regenerating protein bands with the same mobility of RapA and Spo0F. To investigate the composition of the presumed complex, the shifted band was excised from the native gel and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results indicated the presence of RapA and Spo0F at 1:1 molar ratio (data not shown). The molecular mass of the RapA·Spo0F∼P complex was determined by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and compared with Spo0F and RapA alone. The complex was determined to be 121 kDa, a value significantly close to the sum of the molecular mass of 2 molecules of RapA and 2 molecules of Spo0F, calculated to be 126.6 kDa (data not shown). This suggested that the RapA·Spo0F∼P complex consists of one RapA dimer and two Spo0F∼P molecules. The native gel electrophoresis assay used to study the RapA·Spo0F∼P interaction was also applied to the parallel analysis of the interaction between RapA and its pentapeptide inhibitor PhrA (NH2-ARNQT-COOH). We observed that at equimolar concentrations, the addition of pentapeptide resulted in a change of RapA mobility (Fig. 4A, lane 3). A 5:1 ratio RapA·PhrA did not affect the mobility of the phosphatase, whereas a 1:5 ratio did not increase the shift of the protein in the gel from that observed at equimolar concentrations. The mobility of RapA was not affected when an equimolar concentration of the PhrC pentapeptide (NH2-ERGMT-COOH) was mixed with the phosphatase (data not shown). To prove that the shifted band actually contained the PhrA pentapeptide complexed with RapA, the 0 arm length EDC cross-linker was added to the reactions and analyzed by denaturing (Fig. 4B) and native (not shown) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting and immunodetection using polyclonal antibodies against RapA or PhrA. Detection of PhrA in the protein band corresponding to RapA (Fig. 4B, lane 10) in both electrophoresis conditions confirmed the formation of a complex between the two proteins. The increased mobility imparted to RapA by the presence of PhrA in native condition could be the result of a change in electrostatic charge or the induction of a conformational change in RapA upon complex formation. We utilized the native gel electrophoresis assay to analyze the interaction of RapA with PhrA and Spo0F∼P concurrently. As shown in Fig. 4A (lanes 5–8), the addition of PhrA dissociated Spo0F∼P from the complex with RapA. To quantitate the level of dissociation, the experiment was carried out using32P-labeled Spo0F∼P (Fig. 5). With the addition of PhrA at a molar ratio of 1:1:1, an equilibrium was reached with ∼70% of RapA associated with PhrA and 30% associated with Spo0F∼P (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 6). The same equilibrium was reached when the phosphorylated form of Spo0F was added to the preformed RapA·PhrA complex (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 5). Thus, the pentapeptide inhibitor can displace Spo0F∼P after the complex of the substrate with the enzyme is formed and vice versa, Spo0F∼P can partially displace the pentapeptide. The equilibrium reached suggests that substrate and peptide might have a different affinity for RapA. We previously showed that a strain carrying the rapA892 mutation was sporulation-deficient due to the inability of the RapA892 protein to respond to the PhrA pentapeptide inhibitor (10Perego M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This resulted in a protein constitutively active in dephosphorylating Spo0F∼P, thus inhibiting the initiation of the sporulation pathway. Here we used the native gel electrophoresis assay to determine whether the lack of sensitivity to PhrA was due to RapA892 inability to bind the pentapeptide. The RapA892 protein was purified after the protocol established for the wild-type protein, mixed with various concentrations of PhrA pentapeptide, and analyzed by the native gel assay. As shown in Fig. 4C, the mutant protein formed a stable complex with Spo0F∼P. However, its electrophoresis mobility did not change upon the addition of PhrA, and the RapA892·Spo0F∼P complex was not displaced even in the presence of a 5-fold excess of peptide versus Spo0F∼P. This could suggest that RapA892 is indeed unable to form a complex with the pentapeptide. However, probing of EDC-cross-linked RapA892 and PhrA with the corresponding antibodies showed the presence of pentapeptide in the protein band with the mobility of the phosphatase (data not shown). These results suggest that even though the pentapeptide may interact with the RapA892 protein transiently, it is unable to form a stable complex that can displace the Spo0F∼P. This study shows that the RapA and RapB phosphatases are dimeric proteins with an optimal activity at pH 7 in the presence of 50 mm salt. The phosphatase activity is dependent upon the presence of at least 1 mm divalent cations, with manganese supporting the highest level of activity. We observed that the ability of RapA and RapB to dephosphorylate Spo0F∼P depends on maintaining a strong reducing environment during protein purification. If oxidized, RapA and, to a lesser extent, RapB form inter- and/or intramolecular disulfide bonds and aggregate, thus losing their dephosphorylation activity. The predicted amino acid sequence of RapA and RapB indicate the presence of four and three cysteine residues, respectively (8Perego M. Hanstein C.G. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It is believed that disulfide bond formation is prevented in cytoplasmic proteins due to the reducing environment of the cytoplasm (21Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that Rap stability in vitro requires strong reducing conditions or an argon-saturated environment. Transiently formed disulfide bonds are known to be part, for example, of the catalytic cycle of enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase or in redox-regulated proteins such as OxyR (23Zheng M. Åslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 24Aberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson A. Ormo M. Ahgren A. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary mutagenesis studies indicate that none of the RapA cysteine residues are necessary for protein activity in vitro, 3L. Core and M. Perego, unpublished data. thus excluding their involvement in a functional or structural role. Nevertheless, whether the cysteine residues in Rap phosphatases may be part of an additional negative regulatory mechanism remains to be defined. A major finding of this study is that the RapA dimer forms a stable complex with two molecules of phosphorylated Spo0F. Although interaction with the unphosphorylated response regulator is detected, the presence of the phosphoryl group is required to obtain a complex that is stable during electrophoresis. Dephosphorylation of Spo0F∼P after complex formation results in dissociation of the two proteins. Dissociation of the RapA·Spo0F∼P complex is also induced by the PhrA pentapeptide inhibitor. In the present study we observed that at equimolar concentrations, an equilibrium is reached in which ∼70% of RapA is complexed with PhrA, whereas 30% is complexed with Spo0F∼P. Whether this observation reflects a different level of affinity for the Rap phosphatase by its substrate or its inhibitor remains to be established by more detailed analysis. Rap phosphatases are composed of a tandem series of repeated motifs related to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) (25Perego M. Brannigan J.A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Six TPR motifs have been identified in the members of the Rap family. The TPR motif has been found in a wide variety of proteins from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and it is generally believed to represent an ancient protein-protein interaction module (26Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Each motif is composed of 34 amino acids and folds into a well defined structure that consists of a pair of antiparallel α helices of equivalent length generally associated with a packing angle of ∼24° between the helix axes (27Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). TPR motifs are generally organized in tandem arrays of 3–16 motifs that form a scaffold with a right-handed superhelical structure featuring a helical groove suitable for recognizing target proteins (28Groves M.R. Barford D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal TPR domains of the Hop adaptor protein complexed with the carboxyl-terminal peptides of the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones have been determined by x-ray crystallography (29Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). These structures show the peptide in an extended conformation spanning the groove in the TPR domains. Modeling of the six TPR motifs of RapA showed that a helical groove with a predominantly negative charge will be formed. We have proposed that this could provide the appropriate binding environment for the interacting partners PhrA and Spo0F (25Perego M. Brannigan J.A. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The arginine residue at position 2 of the pentapeptide (ARNQT) is a key residue in Phr peptides known to be active (10Perego M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Also, the positively charged Arg-16 on helix α1 and Lys-56 on loop β3-α3 could be interacting with the groove, as they have been found to be involved in Spo0F interaction with RapB (30Tzeng Y.-L. Feher V.A. Cavanagh J. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16538-16545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies are in progress that will allow us to identify the sites of interaction between RapA and its substrate and its inhibitor. Mutagenesis studies indicated that Spo0F residues involved in interaction with Rap phosphatases are localized on the top of the molecule near the active site, mainly in the β1-α1, β3-α3, and β4-α4 loops connecting the β strands to the α helices of the response regulator (30Tzeng Y.-L. Feher V.A. Cavanagh J. Perego M. Hoch J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16538-16545Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The same residues were also found to be involved in Spo0F interaction with histidine kinases and the Spo0B phosphotransferase (12Tzeng Y.-L. Hoch J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Notably, corresponding residues in Spo0A were found to impart resistance to the Spo0E phosphatase. 4Stephenson, S., and Perego, M. (2002) Mol. Microbiol. in press. These observations prompted us to predict that Spo0E and Rap phosphatases may assume a structural conformation with strong similarity to the helical organization of the Spo0B binding interface to Spo0F.4 Also to be determined is whether PhrA and Spo0F∼P interact with RapA in a competitive manner or not. The structural organization of RapA in TPR motifs allows us to envision two equally plausible scenarios, one with the pentapeptide binding within the RapA groove in as much as the Hsp peptides bind to the Hop protein, perhaps inducing a conformational change that prevents Spo0F∼P from binding to RapA at a different site (29Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Note that a conformational change of the TPR domains of the Hop protein upon peptide binding are not expressively reported, but it is predicted that the TPR helix formed by TPR-containing proteins may allow such proteins to interact simultaneously with multiple target proteins by utilizing specific combinations of TPR motifs within the superhelical structure. Alternatively, PhrA and Spo0F may compete for the same binding site, likely to be in the RapA groove (Fig. 6). We previously showed that inhibition of RapA by PhrA is highly specific and dependent on the amino acid sequence of the pentapeptide. We proposed that specificity was probably the result of critical contacts of the peptide side chains with RapA residues (10Perego M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Particularly important is also the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal carboxylate group as its substitution with a carboxyl-terminal amide reduces approximately 40-fold the activity of the peptide (11Core L.J. Ishikawa S. Perego M. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1549-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The interaction established by the carboxyl-terminal carboxylate, however, may not necessarily be involved in specificity because it is a common feature of Phr peptide activity, but rather, may only have a role in positioning the peptide with respect to the TPR domain. The structural alignment of two TPR domains of the Hop protein complexed with their respective Hsp70 and Hsp90 carboxyl-terminal peptides suggests in fact that, whereas the last two residues of the peptides are bound at equivalent positions in the respective TPR domains, the remaining amino-terminal parts of the peptides are binding to very different TPR regions, thus establishing the specificity of contact (29Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). If a similar mechanism of recognition and specificity were used in the interaction of Phr peptide with Rap phosphatases, we can imagine PhrA making contact first and then interacting specifically with RapA so that a stable complex is formed. This complex is visualized by the gel electrophoresis assay developed in this study. Thus specificity will be established only between paired proteins (RapA·PhrA or RapE·PhrE for example), but contacts could be made across pairs. That contacts occur without the establishment of stable interactions is suggested by the observation that the PhrA peptide can be found cross-linked to RapB, although it does not affect its phosphatase activity in vivo or in vitro.2 Similarly, PhrA was found to cross-link to the RapA892 mutant protein known to be insensitive to the inhibitor peptide. On the contrary, PhrA does not cross-link with a control protein such as Spo0F when the same assay conditions are used.2 We believe that although PhrA may make contacts with RapA892, it is unable to stably interact with it due to the lack of specific binding; thus, its inability to dissociate the RapA·Spo0F∼P complex. Whether the P259L substitution in RapA892 is directly or indirectly involved in the interaction with PhrA remains to be determined. We acknowledge Darshini Mehta for the purification of the PhrA antibody."

It has been suggested that individual lesions within a cluster are removed sequentially and that the presence of a vicinal lesion(s) may affect the rate and fidelity of DNA repair. In this study, we addressed the question of how 8-oxoguanine located opposite to normal or reduced abasic sites would affect the repair of these sites by the base excision repair system. We have found that an 8-oxoguanine located opposite to an abasic site does not affect either the efficiency or fidelity of repair synthesis by DNA polymerase β.

Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Ionizing radiation induces damage in DNA by direct ionization and through generation of hydroxyl radicals that attack DNA, resulting in single strand breaks (SSBs)1 and oxidative damage to sugar and base residues (2Wallace S.S. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1988; 12: 431-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two or more DNA lesions of the same or different nature may be produced proximal to each other on opposite DNA strands, generally within two helical turns of the DNA. These various types of DNA damage, known as “clustered DNA lesions”, may include strand breaks that contain damaged DNA termini accompanied by multiple base lesions of varying complexity. 8-oxoguanine is one of the most abundant types of oxidative base damage and is frequently found as a component of clustered lesions (3Cunniffe S. O'Neill P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Sutherland B.M. Bennet P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For densely ionizing radiation (such as α-particles), the yield of clustered DNA damage is high, with >50% of the SSB having a vicinal lesion (3Cunniffe S. O'Neill P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, using enzymatic methods, it was demonstrated that ionizing radiation indeed induces clustered DNA damage containing oxidized bases and that this type of clustered damage constitutes about 50–80% of the total DNA damage (4Sutherland B.M. Bennet P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Base excision repair (BER) pathways and the SSB repair pathway are the major repair systems that contribute to the processing of oxidative lesions (5Wallace S.S. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 49-90Google Scholar, 6Dianov G. Bischoff C. Sunesen M. Bohr V.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11809-11813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). BER involves several steps, i.e. removal of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, nicking of an AP site by AP endonuclease, repair synthesis, and finally the sealing of the nick by DNA ligase (8Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). All of these reactions may be affected by the presence of a neighboring lesion. Several groups (reviewed in Refs. 9Dianov G.L. O'Neill P. Goodhead D.T. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 10Weinfeld M. Rasouli-Nia A. Chaudhry M.A. Britten R.A. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 584-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have extensively studied the effects of opposing or multiple tandem lesions on DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases. However, very little is known about the effect of these lesions on subsequent BER steps. In particular, both the fidelity and efficiency of the DNA repair synthesis step, supported by DNA polymerase β (pol β) and δ (pol δ), may be affected by the presence of a base lesion on the template strand. AP sites or SSBs inhibit the processing of 8-oxoguanine when they are closely located on the opposite DNA strand (11David-Cordonnier M.H. Boiteux S. O'Neill P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11811-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, in the course of repair, clustered lesions containing an 8-oxoguanine opposed by either another oxidized base or an abasic site (e.g.5-hydroxycytosine or an AP site opposite to 8-oxoguanine) will be converted into a lesion consisting of 8-oxoguanine opposite to a 5′-sugar phosphate-containing SSB. Depending on the status of the 5′-sugar phosphate (normal or oxidized/reduced), this lesion can be repaired via short- or long-patch repair. Short-patch BER involves the incorporation of one nucleotide by DNA pol β (12Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) accompanied by removal of the 5′-sugar phosphate moiety by the same enzyme (13Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and finally the rejoining of the DNA ends by DNA ligase (14Tomkinson A.E. Chen L. Dong Z. Leppard J.B. Levin D.S. Mackey Z.B. Motycka T.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 151-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three reactions may be affected by the presence of 8-oxoguanine in the template strand. Long-patch repair may also involve DNA pol δ. DNA polymerase β/δ adds 2–4 additional nucleotides into the repair gap, displacing the 5′-sugar phosphate as part of a flap that is further removed by a flap endonuclease (FEN1), and then DNA ligase seals the DNA ends (7Dianov G.L. Thybo T. Dianova I.I Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11809-11813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this pathway an additional lesion present in the template DNA strand may affect the efficiency of repair even if it resides several nucleotides 3′-downstream of the lesion in the opposite strand. In this study, we have employed oligonucleotide duplexes containing 8-oxoguanine located either directly opposite or one nucleotide 3′ to an SSB containing a 3′-OH end and either a normal or reduced 5′-sugar phosphate end. Using these substrates and purified human BER proteins, we characterized the effect of 8-oxoguanine on the repair of clustered lesions via short- and long-patch BER. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by high performance liquid chromatography were obtained from MWG Biotech. [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant human pol β was overexpressed and purified as described previously (15Kumar A. Widen S. Williams K. Kedar P. Karpel R. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human APE1 and uracil-DNA glycosylase with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus were purified as described (16Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W.

A 30-mer oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue at position 20 (5′-AATAAGCTTGATCGGCCGGUCGCGGTATAT-3′) was 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated labeled nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-25 spin column. To prepare the oligonucleotide duplex, labeled oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue was annealed to its complementary strand containing guanine or 8-oxoguanine at the indicated position. The equimolar solution of both oligonucleotides in TE, 100 mm KCl, was incubated at 90 °C for 3–5 min, and the solution was allowed to cool slowly to 25 °C. Prior to the assembly of the excision reaction, the DNA substrate (500 ng, 50 pmol) was pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (200 ng, 6.25 pmol) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. When indicated, the resulting AP site was reduced by the addition of sodium borohydride to 0.1 m and, after incubation on ice for 10 min, the reaction buffer was exchanged to TE by filtering through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The reactions (10 μl) contained 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (10 ng, 1 pmol). The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. with 5 ng (128 fmol) of APE1, and then pol β or pol δ was added at the amount indicated in the figure legends. Reactions with pol δ also included 100 ng (860 fmol) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. After an additional incubation for the indicated time at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). Following incubation at 80 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mmboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The 30-mer oligonucleotide containing a single uracil residue at position 20 was 5′-end labeled and annealed to the complementary strand containing guanine or 8-oxoguanine at the indicated position. Prior to the assembly of the excision reaction, the oligonucleotide substrate (100 ng) was pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (100 ng) in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 70 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Because of the instability of the AP-containing DNA, the substrates were prepared just before performing the BER reactions. BER reactions were reconstituted in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 20 μm each of the indicated dNTPs, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (10 ng, 1 pmol). The reactions were initiated by the addition of purified APE1, pol β, and DNA ligase I at the amount indicated in the figure legends. After incubation for the indicated time at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). Following incubation at 80 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A 28-mer oligonucleotide containing a uracil residue at position 19 (5′-AATAAGCTTGATCGGCCGUCCGCGGTAT-3′) was annealed to the complementary 30-mer containing two extra nucleotides (TA) at the 5′-end and labeled by filling the protruding ends using an Escherichia coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and cold TTP. Unincorporated labeled nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-25 spin column. Prior to the assembly of the excision reaction, the oligonucleotide substrate (100 ng) was pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (100 ng) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 70 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1h. The resulting AP site was reduced by the addition of sodium borohydride to 0.1 m and, after incubation on ice for 10 min, the reaction buffer was exchanged to TE by filtration through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The excision reactions were reconstituted in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP, and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (10 ng, 1 pmol) and APE1, FEN1, and pol β at the amount indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were initiated by adding substrate oligonucleotides and, after incubation for the indicated time at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). Following incubation at 80 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. All experiments were repeated at least 3–5 times, and representative phosphorimages of the gels are shown. During short-patch BER, after removal of a damaged base and incision of the AP site by AP endonuclease, DNA polymerase β incorporates a single nucleotide into the repair gap and removes a 5′-sugar phosphate. To accomplish repair, DNA ligase seals the DNA ends (8Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). To investigate whether 8-oxoguanine located within the repair gap would affect short-patch BER, we constructed a substrate oligonucleotide duplex containing a strand break with a 5′-sugar phosphate moiety opposing an 8-oxoguanine on the template strand (Fig.1A). We first examined the DNA repair synthesis step and found that at the concentrations used in our experiments, pol β efficiently bypassed 8-oxoguanine and was also able to extend repair synthesis beyond one nucleotide (Fig.1B). We also found that, with this substrate, dCMP was exclusively incorporated opposite to 8-oxoguanine because repair synthesis was completely blocked in the absence of dCTP, although dATP, dGTP, and TTP were added to the reaction at the normal concentration (data not shown). Moreover, in an assay where equal amounts of dCTP and dATP were used, only the incorporation of dCMP was observed (Fig.1C). We thus conclude that 8-oxoguanine located in the repair gap does not affect either the efficiency or the fidelity of repair synthesis. To investigate whether a neighboring 8-oxoguanine residue affects removal of the 5′-sugar phosphate or the ligation step, we reconstituted short-patch BER with purified human APE1, pol β, and DNA ligase. Incubation of the substrate with APE1 resulted in a 19-mer product generated by the incision of the oligonucleotide at the AP site (Fig. 2, lane 2). DNA polymerase pol β and DNA ligase, when added to the reaction, stimulated the complete repair and restoration of the full-length 30-mer product within 20 min for both control (Fig. 2, lanes 7–10) and 8-oxoguanine-containing substrates (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). We thus conclude that repair of the 5′-nicked AP site opposite to 8-oxoguanine was as effective as repair of the control oligonucleotide duplex containing a 5′-nicked AP site opposite to guanine. To address the effect of 8-oxoguanine on long-patch repair, we used substrates containing a reduced AP site and 8-oxoguanine located opposite to it or one nucleotide downstream to the AP site (Fig. 3, A and B). Polymerase β is not able to remove a reduced 5′-sugar phosphate, and the incorporation of at least 2–4 nucleotides is required to accomplish the repair of reduced AP sites (13Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 18DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M. Bambara R.A. Zingman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 47: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found no effect of reduction of the 5′-sugar phosphate on polymerase synthesis through 8-oxoguanine located opposite to the nick (Fig.3C); however, the position of 8-oxoguanine in the template strand had a dramatic effect on the efficiency of bypass. When 8-oxoguanine was moved one nucleotide downstream of the nick, pol β was able to insert a nucleotide opposite the base preceding 8-oxoguanine but was unable to efficiently bypass the 8-oxoguanine itself (Fig. 3D, left panel). In a control experiment with a substrate containing guanine instead of 8-oxoguanine, pol β readily generated strand displacement even at the lowest concentration used (Fig. 3D, right panel). The presence of 8-oxoguanine on the template strand may directly affect the polymerization step itself or indirectly affect the DNA synthesis reaction by reducing the efficiency of strand displacement by DNA polymerase. To evaluate the contribution of these components to the observed repair synthesis block, we tested whether 8-oxoguanine in the same sequence would block polymerization by pol β in a primer extension reaction. We found that pol β readily bypassed 8-oxoguanine (second nucleotide in a template strand), and only a moderate reduction in the rate of addition of the nucleotide opposing 8-oxoguanine was observed (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the major delay may be attributed to the inhibition of the strand displacement reaction. If strand displacement efficiency plays a major role in the inhibitory effect of 8-oxoguanine, then the inhibitory effect should be less pronounced in an AT-rich sequence. To test this surmise, a substrate containing 8-oxoguanine in an A:T-rich sequence context was constructed (Fig.5A). Using this substrate, we find that although 8-oxoguanine still inhibits the strand displacement reaction (Fig. 5B), the effect is not as dramatic as that with the G:C-rich substrate (compare Figs. 3D and 5B).FIG. 5Effect of sequence context on 8-oxoguanine bypass during long-patch repair synthesis by pol β. 1 pmol of the 5′-end-labeled substrate oligonucleotide duplex containing 8-oxoguanine (left panel) or guanine (right panel) positioned one nucleotide downstream opposite to the SSB with a reduced 5′-sugar phosphate (A) was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with the indicated amount of pol β in conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation, the reactions were stopped by the addition of gel-loading buffer and, following incubation at 80 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) During long-patch BER, the incorporation of several nucleotides into the repair gap leads to the generation of a flap containing 5′-deoxyribose phosphate. The FEN1 protein alone is not able to remove 5′-deoxyribose phosphate but rather releases it as part of a small oligonucleotide (2–4-mer) (18DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M. Bambara R.A. Zingman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 47: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Impaired strand displacement caused by the presence of 8-oxoguanine in a template strand may also affect flap excision and, as a consequence, the entire long-patch BER pathway. To address this, we have 3′-end labeled a substrate containing a reduced AP site and an 8-oxoguanine one nucleotide 3′-downstream in the opposite strand (Fig. 6A) and measured the excision of the pol β-generated flap by the FEN1 protein in a reconstituted system containing human APE1, pol β, and FEN1 proteins. We found that, after APE cleaved the AP site (Fig. 6, Time: 5 min), the flap generated by pol β was readily removed from the control substrate containing guanine (Fig. 6, left panel). However, 8-oxoguanine in the template strand significantly reduced the rate of flap removal (Fig. 6, right panel). Although it was recently demonstrated that pol β is responsible for the initiation of both the short- and long-patch pathways of BER (19Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I. Podust V.N. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), either pol β or pol δ may contribute to further incorporation during long-patch BER (20Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 21Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Thus, it was interesting to test whether 8-oxoguanine would also interfere with strand displacement by pol δ. Using the same oligonucleotide substrate, we found that 8-oxoguanine on the template strand also constitutes a strong block for pol δ. The polymerization reaction was nearly completely blocked after addition of the first nucleotide (Fig. 7, left panel), although with a control substrate we observed efficient strand displacement synthesis, resulting in complete strand displacement and accumulation of the 30-mer full-length product (Fig.7, right panel). About 70–80% of radiation-induced DNA lesions are the result of reactive oxygen species generated by the hydrolysis of water in the vicinity of DNA (1Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Although it was earlier proposed that a high density of hydroxyl radicals induced by irradiation may induce multiple closely spaced DNA lesions (23Ward J.F. Radiat. Res. 1985; 103: 103-111Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar), until recently these lesions were considered as regular oxidative lesions that can be repaired by BER. The first indication of the unique nature of radiation-induced DNA damage emerged from the theoretical studies of radiation-induced track structures (24Goodhead D.T. Thacker J. Cox R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 63: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Goodhead D.T. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 61: 7-17Crossref Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Later on, the existence of complex DNA lesions induced by radiation was demonstrated experimentally (3Cunniffe S. O'Neill P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Sutherland B.M. Bennet P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 76: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Theoretically, these complex lesions (known as clustered lesions) may include different combinations of base lesions or SSB and base lesions. Early studies indicated that the complexity of clustered DNA lesions poses a significant challenge to repair systems and may cause infidelity of repair, resulting in mutations and inefficient repair that could potentially lead to the formation of deletions and chromosome rearrangements (27Dianov G.L.

A. 2001; 98: 7426-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this report, we have studied the repairability of clustered lesions by different BER pathways and demonstrated that the damaging effect of such lesions depends on the sequence in which they occur as well as on the relative positioning of primary lesions within a cluster. Short-patch BER is normally accomplished by the removal and replacement of a single nucleotide (12Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For this repair pathway, the major threat may be the repair of simultaneous modifications of complementary bases. The processing of one of the lesions would generate an AP site or an SSB that would block removal of the opposing modified base (31Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15650-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and would lead to the presence of a modified base in the repair gap on the template strand. To model this scenario, we studied the repair of an AP site located opposite to 8-oxoguanine. We have found that 8-oxoguanine in a repair gap does not affect either the fidelity (dCMP is normally incorporated opposite to 8-oxoguanine) or the efficiency of repair (in a reconstituted system, the rate of repair of the AP site located opposite to guanine or 8-oxoguanine is similar). Although this report shows the first data on the tolerance of both the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity by pol β and the efficiency of DNA ligase to the presence of 8-oxoguanine in the repair gap, the fidelity and the rate of bypass of 8-oxoguanine by pol β have been studied before by several groups (34Miller H. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Ahn J.W. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X.J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted now that 8-oxoguanine bypass depends on the DNA polymerase and the structure of the substrate used (34Miller H. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indeed, pol β has evolved as a distributive polymerase designed to fill one-nucleotide gaps in short-patch BER and has increased activity and fidelity on single-nucleotide gap substrates (35Ahn J.W. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X.J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which is in good agreement with our data. However, when the fidelity of the bypass was measured on substrates with longer gaps or in primer extension reactions catalyzed by pol β, both the efficiency and fidelity of DNA synthesis were reduced (34Miller H. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To accomplish the repair of chemically modified AP sites via long-patch BER, either pol β or pol δ should incorporate at least 2 nucleotides into the repair gap before FEN 1 would be able to remove the generated two-nucleotide flap (18DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M. Bambara R.A. Zingman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 47: 30068-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As we demonstrate in this report, 8-oxoguanine in the template strand strongly inhibits strand-displacement DNA synthesis by both DNA polymerases β and δ (Figs. 3D and 7B) and, as a consequence. inhibits flap excision, thus blocking long-patch BER (Fig. 6). This is an unexpected result, because a previous study (22Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar) has shown that both pol β and pol δ can bypass 8-oxoguanine reasonably well in a primer extension reaction. Indeed, we also observed a reasonable bypass of 8-oxoguanine in a primer extension reaction (Fig. 4). However, 8-oxoguanine bypass was significantly reduced under strand displacement conditions. In support of the “strand displacement model” for the explanation of the bypass block by 8-oxoguanine present in the repair gap, we demonstrated that the severity of the polymerase block depends on the sequence around 8-oxoguanine; the more G:C base pairs, the more difficult it is for DNA polymerase to unwind DNA and, at the same time, bypass 8-oxoguanine. In conclusion, as we demonstrate here, the repairability of clustered lesions significantly depends on the relative location of the primary DNA lesions as well as on the sequence context of the damaged DNA. Certain lesion combinations within a cluster that will block lesion processing by DNA repair enzymes may result in genetic instability and reduced cell viability.

https://openalex.org/W2018096113,"The folate derivative 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (folinic acid; 5-CHO-THF) was discovered over 40 years ago, but its role in metabolism remains poorly understood. Only one enzyme is known that utilizes 5-CHO-THF as a substrate: 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS). A BLAST search of the yeast genome using the human MTHFS sequence revealed a 211-amino acid open reading frame (YER183c) with significant homology. The yeast enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant enzyme exhibited kinetics similar to previously purified MTHFS. No new phenotype was observed in strains disrupted at MTHFS or in strains additionally disrupted at the genes encoding one or both serine hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMT) or at the genes encoding one or both methylenetetrahydrofolate reductases. However, when the MTHFS gene was disrupted in a strain lacking the de novo folate biosynthesis pathway, folinic acid (5-CHO-THF) could no longer support the folate requirement. We have thus named the yeast gene encoding methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase FAU1(folinic acid utilization). Disruption of the FAU1 gene in a strain lacking both 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase isozymes (ADE16 and ADE17) resulted in a growth deficiency that was alleviated by methionine. Genetic analysis suggested that intracellular accumulation of the purine intermediate AICAR interferes with a step in methionine biosynthesis. Intracellular levels of 5-CHO-THF were determined in yeast disrupted at FAU1 and other genes encoding folate-dependent enzymes. In fau1 disruptants, 5-CHO-THF was elevated 4-fold over wild-type yeast. In yeast lacking MTHFS along with both AICAR transformylases, 5-CHO-THF was elevated 12-fold over wild type. 5-CHO-THF was undetectable in strains lacking SHMT activity, confirming SHMT as the in vivo source of 5-CHO-THF. Taken together, these results indicate that S. cerevisiae harbors a single, nonessential, MTHFS activity. Growth phenotypes of multiply disrupted strains are consistent with a regulatory role for 5-CHO-THF in one-carbon metabolism and additionally suggest a metabolic interaction between the purine and methionine pathways.

Leucovorin has been employed extensively as a rescue agent in chemotherapeutic protocols, but the physiological role of this folate derivative remains poorly understood. 5-CHO-THF can arise nonenzymatically from the hydrolysis of 5,10-methenyl-THF (5,10-CH+-THF) under mild conditions (2Benkovic S.J. Bullard W.P. Benkovic P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7542-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was considered likely that the 5-CHO-THF detected in cell extracts was an artifact of preparation rather than a normal component of folate metabolism. More recent studies designed to prevent the possibility of artifactual conversion concluded that 5-CHO-THF is indeed a naturally occurring metabolite (3Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological source of 5-CHO-THF, however, remains in question. Stover and Schirch (4Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that in the presence of glycine, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF to 5-CHO-THF and proposed that this reaction is the source of cellular 5-CHO-THF. Supporting evidence was provided by the observation that cells deficient in SHMT activity do not accumulate 5-CHO-THF (3Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stover P. Kruschwitz H. Schirch V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). SHMT is an abundant enzyme that normally catalyzes the reversible conversion of serine to glycine coupled to the production of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-CH2-THF); this reaction is the major source of one-carbon units in most cells (6Schirch L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 399-431Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the SHMT-catalyzed hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF to 5-CHO-THF has recently been called into question. Baggott (7Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) studied the chemical hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF under mildly acidic conditions and concluded that the intermediate proposed by Stover and Schirch does not accumulate and that the likely source of 5-CHO-THF is chemical hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF within subcellular organelles rather than the SHMT-catalyzed reaction.Whereas the biological source of 5-CHO-THF remains controversial, an enzyme that catalyzes its conversion back to 5,10-CH+-THF has been identified and characterized from several prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources (8Hopkins S.

The existence of this enzyme from bacteria to humans strongly suggests that 5-CHO-THF plays a universally important role in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism. 5-CHO-THF has been proposed to function as a stable storage form of one-carbon units (3Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as a regulator of the flow of one-carbon units (13Stover P. Schirch V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), based on its ability to inhibit several folate-utilizing enzymes, including SHMT. Indeed, Girgis et al. (14Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have presented evidence from cultured cells that 5-CHO-THF regulates homocysteine remethylation via inhibition of SHMT.In an effort to better understand the metabolic role of 5-CHO-THF and MTHFS, we have cloned and disrupted the gene encoding MTHFS (YER183c) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have purified and characterized the yeast enzyme. Genetic experiments revealed that this enzyme is required for folinic acid utilization in yeast, and we have named the gene FAU1. We have also characterized yeast strains lacking MTHFS in combination with other enzymes of folic acid metabolism and measured cellular 5-CHO-THF levels in these strains. These studies confirm the role of MTHFS in the metabolism of 5-CHO-THF in yeast and reveal several interesting metabolic interactions between methionine and purine biosynthesis.DISCUSSIONThe experiments described here confirm that the yeast gene, YER183c, encodes a functional MTHFS, with properties very similar to the mammalian homologs. The ORF predicts a protein of 211 residues with 23% identity to the human and rabbit enzymes. An N-terminally His-tagged version of the yeast protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by metal affinity chromatography on a cobalt column. Like the rabbit (8Hopkins S. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5618-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lactobacillus casei (9Grimshaw C.E. Henderson G.B. Soppe G.G. Hansen G. Mathur E.J. Huennekens F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2728-2733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes, the yeast enzyme was inhibited by high salt. The removal of salt and inclusion of glycerol and the nonionic detergent, Triton-X-100, were found to increase the stability and activity of the enzyme. The Km values for (6 R,6 S)-5-CHO-THF monoglutamate (Table II) were found to be similar to those obtained for the human (40Bertrand R. MacKenzie R.E. Jolivet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 911: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and rabbit enzymes (41Schirch V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), confirming the identity of this protein as a functional MTHFS. The rabbit enzyme has a Km of 0.2 μm for the pentaglutamate form of 5-CHO-THF (10Maras B. Stover P. Valiante S. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18429-18433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicative of a polyglutamate binding site on the enzyme. Although we have not examined the yeast enzyme with polyglutamate substrates, the high sequence homology suggests the yeast enzyme will also exhibit a polyglutamate binding site.The gene encoding MTHFS is not essential in yeast. The gene was first disrupted in a diploid yeast strain. This heterozygous diploid was then sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to obtain haploid disruptants. Loss of one MTHFS locus in the diploid did not affect sporulation or subsequent spore germination. Haploid disruptants grew normally under all conditions tested, on both liquid and solid media. The only phenotype observed in the haploid disruptants was loss of MTHFS enzyme activity (measured in crude extracts), indicating that the yeast genome possesses only one gene for MTHFS.Kruschwitz et al. (3Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that 5-CHO-THF polyglutamates are the major folate derivatives in Neurospora crassa spores. Because 5-CHO-THF is the most stable reduced folate derivative, they hypothesized that this form of the coenzyme serves as a storage form of reduced folates and one-carbon units in dormant cells. A functioning MTHFS might then be essential to convert the stored 5-CHO-THF into the active one-carbon pool as the cell resumes vegetative growth. If S. cerevisiae spores accumulate 5-CHO-THF in a similar manner, then spores from a homozygous diploid disruptant might display reduced germination rates or impeded growth. However, a homozygous diploid MTHFS disruptant (WHY1a/α) sporulated efficiently, and the germination and growth of its haploid progeny was the same as that of the wild type diploid DAY4a/α. Although the folate status of yeast spores was not measured, the inability to metabolize 5-CHO-THF via MTHFS clearly did not affect the processes of sporulation or spore germination under the conditions tested.In vivo function of the yeast MTHFS was demonstrated by a genetic approach. Yeasts are capable of synthesizing folic acid by a pathway that begins with GTP (Fig. 5). Disruption of the folic acid biosynthetic pathway results in yeast auxotrophic for folate; this requirement can be satisfied by the addition of 5-CHO-THF (folinic acid) to the media (36Cherest H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9155-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 5, utilization of 5-CHO-THF should require MTHFS activity. Folic acid, on the other hand, can bypass both the DHFS and MTHFS steps, requiring only a functional DHFR for its conversion to THF. Haploid strains WHY1 (MTHFS disruptant) and CCD208B (fol3 disruptant) were crossed to produce an mthfs/MTHFS fol3/FOL3 heterozygous diploid. Upon sporulation of this diploid, one of four spores in each tetrad should harbor both mutations, since the two loci are on separate chromosomes. As expected, when tetrads were dissected onto media containing 5-CHO-THF, on average only three of four spores germinated (Table III). Folic acid supplementation was found to support complete germination of tetrads. If the diploid was first transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing the yeast MTHFS gene, germination was nearly 100% on plates containing 5-CHO-THF. These data confirm the role of MTHFS in the utilization of folinic acid in vivo. We have thus designated the YER183c gene FAU1 for folinic acidutilization.The metabolic role of MTHFS was further investigated by studying strains carrying the fau1 disruption in combination with mutations in other folate enzyme genes. No new growth phenotypes were observed when the fau1 disruption was combined with disruption of the two SHMT genes (SHM1 and SHM2; Refs. 30Dayan A. Bertrand R. Beauchemin M. Chahla D. Mamo A.

Biochem. 1994; 5: 522-528Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or the two methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes (MET12 and MET13; Ref. 39Schirch L. Ropp M. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, when the fau1 disruption was combined with disruptions of two genes in purine biosynthesis, a striking methionine deficiency was observed, and it appeared to be related to the purine intermediate, AICAR.AICAR is produced in one of the latter steps of the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. It is converted to IMP by the two activities of the bifunctional AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (Fig. 6). Yeast have two isozymes of this bifunctional enzyme, encoded by the ADE16 and ADE17 genes (37Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Either of these enzymes is sufficient to support purine biosynthesis in yeast, whereas the double disruptant (Δade16Δade17) is an adenine auxotroph. In addition to a purine requirement, an Δade16Δade17 strain is also auxotrophic for histidine (45Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20920-20927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The connection between purine and histidine metabolism is not well understood, but AICAR is also generated as a by-product of histidine biosynthesis (32Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar), and this AICAR can presumably be utilized in purine biosynthesis (Fig. 6). Yeast that are ade3 mutants also exhibit a secondary histidine requirement (46Roman H. Compt. Rend. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg Ser. Physiol. 1956; 26: 299-314Google Scholar). The ADE3 gene encodes the trifunctional enzyme C1-THF synthase (47McKenzie K.Q. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1977; 86: 85-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which produces the 10-CHO-THF substrate required in the AICAR transformylase reaction. We would predict that AICAR would accumulate in strains lacking AICAR transformylase activity (Δade16Δade17 mutants) or in strains unable to synthesize cytoplasmic 10-CHO-THF (ade3 mutants). These observations led Tibbetts and Appling (45Tibbetts A.S. Appling D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20920-20927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to propose that AICAR inhibits histidine biosynthesis by feedback regulation, explaining the histidine requirement of both ade16ade17 and ade3 mutants. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that blocks in the de novo purine pathway that precede AICAR formation do not result in histidine auxotrophy.The fau1 disruption was introduced into an ade16 ade17 background by crossing and tetrad dissection to create the haploid strain WHY1.3 (Δfau1Δade16Δade17), which lacks all AICAR transformylase and MTHFS activities. In addition to the adenine and histidine requirements caused by the ade16ade17 disruptions, this strain exhibited a new methionine-dependent growth defect (Table IV). The parental strains WHY1 (Δfau1) and ATY3.1 (Δade16Δade17) were expected to accumulate 5-CHO-THF and AICAR, respectively. Since neither parental strain had a methionine deficiency, we speculated that the effect required the simultaneous accumulation of both metabolites. This was tested by introducing additional mutations that block the synthesis of AICAR. Mutation of the HIS4 gene blocks AICAR production from the histidine biosynthetic pathway, and mutation of ADE2 blocks its production from the de novo purine pathway (32Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Metabolism and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 181-299Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). If just one of the pathways was blocked, the resulting strains remained methionine-deficient (data not shown). When both pathways were blocked, however, the strain WHY3.1 (Δfau1Δade16Δade17Δade2Δhis4) regained normal growth on media lacking methionine (Table IV). Therefore, it appears that the accumulation of AICAR, combined with elevated 5-CHO-THF, leads to a defect in methionine synthesis. There is some precedent for an interaction between AICAR and methionine metabolism. AICAR was found to inhibit S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in extracts of blood cells from rabbit and human, although significant inhibition required 1 mm AICAR (38Ha T. Baggott J.E. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1994; 5: 522-528Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is involved in the remethylation cycle, and its inhibition would lead to decreased homocysteine levels, thereby slowing methionine synthesis. However, homocysteine depletion is probably not the mechanism in this case, since the methionine deficiency was not alleviated by the addition of homocysteine in the medium (data not shown).Whatever the mechanism, it appears to require elevated 5-CHO-THF as well as AICAR. Intracellular 5-CHO-THF was indeed elevated in fau1 mutants and was highest in WHY1.3 (Δfau1Δade16Δade17). The intracellular 5-CHO-THF concentration was estimated to be 5 μm in wild type cells (Table V). This increased to 16 μm in the Δfau1 mutant (WHY1) and to 62 μm in the Δfau1Δade16Δade17 mutant. The polyglutamate forms of 5-CHO-THF are known inhibitors of several mammalian folate-dependent enzymes, including AICAR transformylase (48Bertrand R. Jolivet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8843-8846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SHMT (29Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with Ki values in the low micromolar range. If the yeast enzymes have similar kinetic properties, the 5-CHO-THF levels observed in the MTHFS mutants are clearly sufficient to inhibit AICAR transformylase and SHMT activity in vivo. In yeast grown with serine, where the cytoplasmic SHMT operates in the direction of glycine and 5,10-CH2-THF production (35Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.Y. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), inhibition of SHMT would lead to a deficiency of cytoplasmic 5,10-CH2-THF and thus the 5-methyl-THF required for methionine synthesis. The extreme elevation of 5-CHO-THF in the Δfau1Δade16Δade17 strain (12-fold) may explain why the methionine deficiency is seen only when both MTHFS and AICAR transformylase activities are missing in the same strain.Additional evidence that 5-CHO-THF can inhibit SHMT activity in vivo comes from the recent work of Piper et al. (49Piper M.D. Hong S.P. Ball G.E. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30987-30995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) on the regulation of one-carbon metabolism in yeast. Based on experiments with various mutant strains, they concluded that yeast respond to a deficiency of 5,10-CH2-THF by increasing expression of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system, which produces 5,10-CH2-THF from glycine. They showed that strain WHY1 (Δfau1) has altered control of the glycine cleavage system gene expression, indicative of low cytoplasmic 5,10-CH2-THF levels. This effect is consistent with the elevated 5-CHO-THF in that strain inhibiting SHMT, causing the deficiency of 5,10-CH2-THF.We can only speculate as to why the loss of AICAR transformylase activity is associated with additional accumulation of 5-CHO-THF in the fau1 mutant. Based on studies with Salmonella typhimurium grown under folate starvation conditions, Bochner and Ames (50Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Cell. 1982; 29: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proposed that 5-aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside 5′-triphosphate (ZTP; the 5′-triphosphate derivative of AICAR) is an “alarmone” that signals a cellular deficiency of 10-CHO-THF. AICAR (ZMP) accumulates in the folate-starved cells and is subsequently phosphorylated to the triphosphate level (ZTP). The authors proposed that this ZTP then triggers alterations in cellular metabolism to remedy the one-carbon unit deficiency (50Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Cell. 1982; 29: 929-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If AICAR does influence the cellular content of one-carbon units, these might be stored as 5-CHO-THF. In the absence of MTHFS activity, the effect would be the trapping of the one-carbon unit and perhaps more importantly the coenzyme as 5-CHO-THF. ZTP can be detected in eukaryotic cells (51Sabina R.L. Patterson D. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6107-6114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,52Sidi Y. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2416-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but there are no reports on its existence in yeast. AICAR itself, however, has been shown to be an activator of the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (53Sullivan J.E. Carey F. Carling D. Beri R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1551-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 54Stefanelli C. Stanic I. Bonavita F. Flamigni F. Pignatti C. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Members of the AMP-activated protein kinase subfamily are found in most eukaryotes, where they are the central component of a protein kinase cascade that acts as a metabolic sensor for the AMP/ATP ratio (55Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae also has an AMP-activated protein kinase homologue, the SNF1 protein kinase. In yeast, the SNF1 protein kinase plays a central role in the glucose repression response but is also involved in the regulation of sporulation, glycogen storage, peroxisome biogenesis, and lipid metabolism as well (56Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular signal in yeast is not known, changes in the AMP/ATP levels correlate reasonably well with SNF1 kinase activity under a variety of nutritional conditions (57Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Attempts to demonstrate a direct effect of AMP on the activity of the purified yeast kinase in vitro have been unsuccessful, but AICAR was not tested (57Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains a possibility that the elevated AICAR in the ade16ade17 mutants, acting through the SNF1 kinase cascade, alters folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, and in cells lacking the ability to move 5-CHO-THF into the active one-carbon pool, this form accumulates to the extreme levels observed in the Δfau1Δade16Δade17 strain.Finally, our data also shed new light on the source of 5-CHO-THF in vivo. Stover and Schirch (4Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that SHMT catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-CH+-THF to 5-CHO-THF in vitro, and proposed that this is the primary source of 5-CHO-THF in vivo. Consistent with this proposal is the observation that E. coli and N. crassa cells deficient in SHMT activity do not accumulate 5-CHO-THF (3Kruschwitz H.L. McDonald D. Cossins E.A. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stover P. Kruschwitz H. Schirch V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Baggott (7Baggott J.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14647-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has argued that all cellular 5-CHO-THF is due to the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF in mildly acidic subcellular organelles, based on the in vitro observation that the equilibrium between 5,10-CH+-THF and 5-CHO-THF favors 5-CHO-THF at pH 4.5. In the present study, 5-CHO-THF was undetectable in yeast strains entirely lacking SHMT activity (EKY3, WHY1.6). Deletion of fau1 was shown to cause accumulation of 5-CHO-THF but only in strains with active SHMT (compare WHY1 and WHY1.6; Table V), confirming that SHMT is the only significant source of 5-CHO-THF in vivo. Thus, results in S. cerevisiae, E. coli, and N. crassa strains with reduced or absent SHMT activity all support the hypothesis that the cellular source of 5-CHO-THF is the SHMT-catalyzed hydrolysis of 5,10-CH+-THF.

Heid H.W. Schäfer S. Nuber U.A. Zimbelmann R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 229-245PubMed Google Scholar). IF can be classified into groups expressed in higher eukaryotes in a tissue-specific and cell type-restricted pattern (2Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, IFs consist of stoichiometrically equal amounts of type I (smaller and acidic) and type II (larger, neutral, or basic) cytokeratin polypeptides, which form strongly interacting heterodimers (4Hatzfeld M.

Cytokeratin 8 (K8) and cytokeratin 18 (K18), type I and II, respectively, are the major components of IFs of simple or single layer epithelia, such as those of the intestine, the liver, and the breast ducts, although cytokeratin 19 (K19) is also present and forms heterodimers with K8 (2Moll R.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). The assembly of IF involves several association steps where the α-helical rod domain of the cytokeratin molecules plays the central role (7Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J.

The head and the tail domains are not thought to be part of the filamentous backbone but to protrude laterally and contribute to profilament and IF packing, and to IF interaction with other cellular components (10Hatzfeld M.

Cotransfection of head-deleted K8 and K18 resulted in formation of a dispersed non-fibrillar pattern, whereas cotransfection of a combination of one headless plus one intact cytokeratin resulted in formation of cytoplasmic granules or fibrils (12Bader B.L. Magin T.M. Freudenmann M. Stumpp S. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis showed that only short and irregular IF was generated when K8 and K18 were N-terminally truncated by deleting the first 66 amino acids of K8 and K18, whereas only tetramers were generated when a major part of the H1 domain was removed (13Hatzfeld M. Burba M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1959-1972PubMed Google Scholar). During cell transformation and tumor development, the cell type specificity of K8 and K18 is conserved, making them useful as clinical histopathological markers (2Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L.

Interestingly, it has been found that oncogenes, which activate the Ras signal transduction pathway, stimulate K18 gene expression through transcription factors, such as members of the ETD and AP-1 families, including junand fos (16Oshima R.G.

The continuous and sometimes even increased expression of K8 and K18 in tumor cells, while many other proteins, including other cytokeratins, are lost, may be the result of constitutive activation of the Ras pathway. Supporting the notion that K8 and K18 play a role in the tumorigenic phenotype, increased expression of K8 and K18 has been found at the invasive front of some tumors (14Schaafsma H.E.

B9165 was grown in protein-free medium, and COU-1 was purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-coupled monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human μ-chain (HB57, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and further purified by gel permeation chromatography. IgM purified from normal human serum (Cappel, Cochranville, PA) was used as a control. Murine mAbs, M20 directed against normal K8, CY-90 directed against normal K18, and A53-B/A2 directed against normal K19, were obtained from Sigma. ELISA wells (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with fractions from the purification of cytokeratin or with different recombinant K8/K18 complexes (5 μg/ml) in PBS, pH 7.4. The wells were washed twice with PBS, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and incubated with COU-1 for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed 10× with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), and bound antibody was detected with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled goat anti-human κ-chain (Sigma, 1/1000) in PBS/Tween. Bound antibody was visualized withpara-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) diethanolamine, pH 9.6, and read at 405 nm. The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 (ATCC) was maintained in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FCS, non-essential amino acids, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 1 mm HEPES buffer, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 mg of streptomycin/ml, and 2 mml-glutamine. The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line colo137 (kindly provided by Dr. P. Ebbesen, Aarhus University, Denmark) and the human melanoma cell line M21 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Reisfeld, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine as above. Cytokeratin was extracted from fresh, surgically removed, colon cancer tissue or normal colon epithelia using a procedure taking advantage of the insoluble filamentous structure of cytokeratins and other cytoskeletal proteins in buffer at physiological salt concentrations. Tissue samples (1–5 g) were minced with shears and homogenized in 10–30 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 10 mm Tris, 0.14 m NaCl, 15 mmNaN3, pH 7.6) containing 1% (v/v) Emulphogene (Sigma) using a blade rotor (Euro Turrax T20b basic, IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) 3× for 5 s at 27,000 rpm on ice. Enzyme inhibitors, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA (all Sigma), 5 mmcyclocapron (Kabi, Stockholm, Sweden), and 10 units of aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) per ml, were included in the buffers during homogenization, sonication, and ion-exchange chromatography. The suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice in TBS containing 1% Emulphogene, and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.6, containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 0.05% (v/v) Emulphogene). The suspension was sonicated 3× for 15 s on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to an anion-exchange column (20-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column, QFF, Amersham Biosciences and The Upjohn Co.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 10 column volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 1m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting and by ELISA. For ELISA 10 μl of each fraction was added to wells containing 10 μl of SM2 beads (Bio-Rad) in 100 μl of TBS, followed by incubation and detection with COU-1 as described above. The beads bind the detergent and thus allow for the direct coating of the proteins in the fractions. Electrophoresis was performed in a discontinuous buffer system on 8-cm 4–20 or 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels for analysis and on 15-cm 14% polyacrylamide gels for N-terminal sequencing (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with 2× sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol in 100 mm Tris-buffered saline), boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed. Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Separated proteins were also electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF, Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 100 V for 1 h on ice, using transfer buffer (10% (v/v) ethanol, 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.6). Prior to transfer, the membrane was soaked in ethanol for 2 min, and the membrane and the gel were incubated in transfer buffer for 10 min. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked for 2 h in Western blot buffer (50 mm Tris, 350 mm NaCl, 15 mmNaN3, 0.1% Tween 20) and washed 3× with Western blot buffer and incubated with COU-1 antibody (5 μg/ml), mouse K8 antibody (diluted 1/2000), mouse K18 antibody (diluted 1/2000) or goat anti-GST antibody (diluted 1/1000, Amersham Biosciences and The Upjohn Co.) overnight at room temperature. The membrane was washed in Western blot buffer and incubated with AP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (diluted 1/1000, Sigma) or AP-conjugated rabbit-anti-human IgM antibody (diluted 1/500, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 2 h at room temperature. Following 3 washes in PBS, the membrane was fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and washed in PBS. Bound AP conjugate was visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate BCIP (Bio-Rad). MCF7 or colo137 cells, resuspended in SDS sample buffer and sonicated were used as control antigen. A low range protein marker (Bio-Rad) was used to estimate the molecular weight of the fragments. The procedures were as described by Crawford et al. (28Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequencing, purified cytokeratin was run on SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes prior to detection with Coomassie. The different bands were excised from the blot and sequenced in an Applied Biosystems 470A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Forster City, CA). Sequences similar to cytokeratins were searched for in GenBankTM/EBI/DDBI/PDB databases using the BLAST program. Escherichia coli DH5a harboring plasmids encoding a panel of K8 and K18 proteins were analyzed. The panel consisted of cDNA encoding the full-length and several N-terminal- and C-terminally deleted fragments of K8 and K18, cloned as GST fusion constructs into a modified pGEX-2T vector, as described (29Waseem A. Lane E.B. Harrison D. Waseem N. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The transfected E. coli cultures were grown in Super Broth medium, supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2 and 50 mg of carbenicillin/ml, at 37 °C untilA600 reached 0.6. Protein expression was then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and 4 μm cAMP, and the cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were pelleted at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For SDS-PAGE, the pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and sonicated 5 × 10 s before electrophoresis. For purification of recombinant K8 or K18, the pellet of a 400-ml culture, grown and processed as described above, was resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg of lysozyme/ml and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The suspension was sonicated 3× for 20 s and pelleted at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice in a high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) and once in lysis buffer. The pellet was subsequently washed twice in lysis buffer containing 2 m urea and stored at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 8 m urea. Panels of different C- or N-terminally deleted or intact K8 and K18 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, as described above. After blocking, the membrane was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 100 μg of purified K8 or K18 per ml of PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 4m urea. If K8 proteins were transferred to the membrane, it was subsequently incubated with a purified K18 protein, and vice versa (29Waseem A. Lane E.B. Harrison D. Waseem N. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Hatzfeld M. Maier G. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed with PBS, incubated with COU-1 (5 μg/ml) in Western blot buffer containing 10% FCS for 2 h at room temperature, and developed as described above. The kinetics of COU-1 binding to heterotypic complexes of recombinant intact K8 or K18 and fragments thereof were determined by surface plasmon resonance measurements using the BIAcore instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The sensor chip was activated for immobilization with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The heterotypic cytokeratin complexes were coupled to the surface by injecting 50 μl of a 50 μg/ml sample. Excess activated esters were quenched with 30 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically, 3000 resonance units were immobilized. Binding of COU-1 to immobilized heterotypic cytokeratin complexes was studied by injecting COU-1 in a range of concentrations (0.5–80 μg/ml) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min using HBS-P buffer (0.01 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4, Biacore Inc). Dissociation at the end of the association phase was with a buffer flow rate of 20 μl/min. The cytokeratin surface was regenerated with 10 mm HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 2.0, and remained active for 10 measurements. The association and dissociation rate constants, kon and koff, were determined from a series of measurements, as described previously (31Karlsson R.A. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Association and dissociation constants were deduced from the kinetic data using the Bioevaluation program version 3.1 (Biacore Inc.). Cells were seeded into Lab Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and allowed to grow and adhere to the glass slides for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were fixed with ice-cold 96% ethanol for 5 min, washed 3× with PBS, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. COU-1 (5 μg/ml in PBS) together with either mouse anti-K8 antibody (1/1000 in PBS) or mouse anti-K18 antibody (1/1000 in PBS) were added to the cells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-human κ-chain and Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1/200) in PBS (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed with PBS 3× for 5 min, and the slides were mounted with anti-fading reagent in PBS/glycerol (Slow FadeTM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Results were analyzed using an MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV. As a control, all experiments were also performed omitting the primary antibody or including species and isotype-matched control immunoglobulin instead of the primary antibody. In addition, differential interference contrast images of the analyzed cells were obtained. To study the composition of the K8/K18 filaments in normal and malignant glandular epithelia and to determine the basis for the adenocarcinoma-specific binding of HmAb COU-1, total cytokeratin was separately purified from fresh tissue of surgically removed colon cancer tissue and normal colon epithelia using the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following separation by QFF anion-exchange chromatography, the fractions containing COU-1 reactivity were found in the first and second peak of the gradient (fractions 41–48) as determined by ELISA (Fig.1A). Western blot analysis demonstrated reactivity of COU-1 with three main bands in the same fractions (Fig. 1B). These three bands represented only a portion of the proteins with molecular masses in the 41–46-kDa range found in these fractions, as revealed by Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-separated gels (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis and Coomassie Blue staining of cytokeratin purified from colon cancers of four patients revealed a similar pattern of protein bands, reactive and non-reactive with HmAb COU-1. Cytokeratin was also isolated from normal colon epithelia obtained from three individuals using the same purification procedure to compare the nature of the K8/K18 in colon cancer versus normal colon tissues. Tissue lysates and purified cytokeratin preparations (QFF eluate) from the two sources were examined by Western blotting used a panel of K8-, K18- and K19-specific antibodies. When approximately equal amounts of cytokeratin from cancer and the normal epithelia were analyzed, protein bands (in the 41–46-kDa range) of equal intensity were observed following staining with the murine K18 antibody (CY-90), which recognizes a linear epitope in the C-terminal part of K18 (Fig.2). In contrast, when the same preparations were stained with COU-1, protein bands (in the 41–46-kDa range) were only observed in the cytokeratin preparations from the colon cancer tissue and not from the normal colon epithelia (Fig.2). To determine the nature of the different K8/K18-like proteins found in the colon cancer tissues, purified cytokeratin preparations from primary colon cancer tissues of three patients were individually separated on large 14% polyacrylamide gels, the proteins blotted, and Coomassie Blue-stained. In addition, a cytokeratin preparation purified from the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line colo137 was also separated, the proteins blotted, and Coomassie Blue-stained. Fig.3A shows a typical blot of a colon cancer tissue sample, displaying ∼10 bands. Strips of the blot were incubated with either mAb M20 (K8), CY-90 (K18), or COU-1. At this increased separation, 5 bands showed COU-1 reactivity. Additional bands, not stained with COU-1, were stained either with the anti-K8 mAb, the anti-K18 mAb, or both (Fig. 3A). All 10 bands were N-terminal sequenced, revealing that the bands, except one, corresponded to different forms of K8, K18, and K19 (Fig.3B). The additional band was identified as migration inhibitory factor-related protein 8 (MRP8, also known as calretinin), a calcium-binding protein that has been suggested to bind cytokeratins (32Marilley D. Schwaller B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Most of the bands represented N-terminally truncated K8 or K18, with the identified amino acid sequence starting at residues 23–76. The N-terminal truncations of K8 corresponded to residues 23, 40, 66, and 76, whereas the truncations of K18 corresponded to residues 50 and 68. Significantly, the K8 and K18 truncations were found at the same residues in three different primary colon cancers and the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line colo137, indicating that the truncations were caused by specific proteases. Analysis of the sequences surrounding the cleavage sites suggests that at least two proteases are responsible for the cleavage, including one trypsin-like protease. The bands recognized by COU-1 were the N-terminally truncated K8 and K18. Interestingly, not all the N-terminally truncated K8 and K18 proteins were recognized by COU-1. For example, no COU-1 binding was observed to N-terminally truncated K8 protein where the first 22 amino acid was missing nor did the antibody react with intact K8 or K18. The latter two were identified by staining with K8 and K18 antibody, respectively (bands 1 and 3 in Fig. 3A), but not by N-terminal sequencing, because they were N-terminally blocked (K18 contains an acetylated serine at its N terminus). To detail the nature of the epitope recognized by COU-1, it was mapped using a panel of recombinant intact as well as N- and C-terminally deleted K8 and K18 polypeptides expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4). Initially, the panels of K8 and K18 fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. To ensure that equal amounts of K8 and K18 polypeptide were loaded on the gels, gels run in parallel were stained with Coomassie Blue, and blots were stained with an anti-GST antibody (Figs. 5A and 6A). Subsequent analyses of Western blots with COU-1 surprisingly showed that COU-1 did not bind to any of the individual K8 or K18 fragments nor to the intact K8 or K18 molecules (Figs. 5B and6B). In each experiment, MCF7 cell lysate was also included as a positive control, demonstrating bands at molecular masses of 41–46 kDa. Due to the control experiments, we could conclude that the lack of signal with COU1 was not due to insufficient amounts of K8 or K18 loaded on the gel or incomplete transfer of proteins. In addition, the panels of K8 or K18 fragments were recognized by conventional mAbs anti-K8 and anti-K18, respectively. The anti-K18 reacted strongly with K18-(1–356), K18-(1–385), and intact K18, but not with K18-(1–312), indicating that its epitope was located in the region 312–356 (Fig.5C). We next examined the binding of COU-1 to heterotypic complexes of K8 and K18, which were formed by incubating Western blots of the panel of K18 fragments with intact purified K8 (Fig.5D). COU-1 bound strongly to complexes formed between intact K8 and K18-(1–213) through K18-(1–385), only weakly to intact K8/K18-(1–187) and intact K8/intact K18, and no binding was seen to intact K8/K18-(1–72) and intact K8/K18-(1–124) (Fig. 5D). Likewise, blots containing the panels of K8 fragments were incubated with intact K18 before staining with COU-1, revealing strong staining of complexes formed between intact K18 and the K8 fragments K8-(1–129) through K8-(1–403). In contrast, COU-1 bound weakly to intact K8-(1–483)/intact K18 and not at all to K8-(1–65)/intact K18 or K8-(1–85)/intact K18 (Fig.6C).FIG. 5Analysis of recombinant K18 fragments. A panel of C-terminally deleted K18 fragments expressed as GST fusion proteins were run in parallel on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and stained with either a goat anti-GST antibody (A), COU-1 (B), or a mouse anti-K18 antibody (CY-90) (C). In addition, a PVDF membrane containing the SDS-PAGE-separated K18 fragments was incubated with purified intact K8 prior to staining with COU-1 (D).View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2087535570,"The Arabidopsis thaliana flavoprotein AtHAL3a, which is linked to plant growth and salt and osmotic tolerance, catalyzes the decarboxylation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine to 4′-phosphopantetheine, a key step in coenzyme A biosynthesis. AtHAL3a is similar in sequence and structure to the LanD enzymes EpiD and MrsD, which catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of peptidylcysteines. Therefore, we hypothesized that the decarboxylation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine also occurs via an oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate containing an aminoenethiol group. A set of AtHAL3a mutants were analyzed to detect such an intermediate. By exchanging Lys34, we found that AtHAL3a is not only able to decarboxylate 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine but also pantothenoylcysteine to pantothenoylcysteamine. Exchanging residues within the substrate binding clamp of AtHAL3a (for example of Gly179) enabled the detection of the proposed aminoenethiol intermediate when pantothenoylcysteine was used as substrate. This intermediate was characterized by its high absorbance at 260 and 280 nm, and the removal of two hydrogen atoms and one molecule of CO2 was confirmed by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Using the mutant AtHAL3a C175S enzyme, the product pantothenoylcysteamine was not detectable; however, oxidatively decarboxylated pantothenoylcysteine could be identified. This result indicates that reduction of the aminoenethiol intermediate depends on a redox-active cysteine residue in AtHAL3a.

Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of an active-site mutant of EpiD with a bound substrate peptide gave the first insight into the decarboxylation mechanism used by the HFCD proteins (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it looks like Cα-Cβ dehydrogenation is not the initial reaction but rather the oxidation of the thiol group by the flavin cofactor. The spontaneous decarboxylation of the thioaldehyde group-containing intermediate then leads to the peptidylaminoethenethiolate reaction product (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The existence of oxidatively decarboxylated reaction products in the case of the LanD enzymes is a direct hint that the homologous PPC decarboxylases also use oxidation of the thiol group to enable decarboxylation of cysteine residues. Therefore, it was concluded that a “peptidyl”-aminoenethiol is an intermediate of the PPC decarboxylases (2Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and that this compound is finally reduced to 4′-phosphopantetheine (see Fig. 7). Mechanistic studies on the Dfp enzyme such as detection of substrate/product-induced charge-transfer complexes also favor a mechanism via oxidation of the thiol group and the presence of a thioaldehyde group-containing intermediate (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6449-6450Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the existence of this oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate has not been proven, and up to now, the intermediate itself has not been purified or characterized. The four characterized HFCD proteins EpiD, MrsD, Dfp (CoaC) and AtHAL3a are similar in sequence and the reaction they catalyzed, but they use different substrates, with peptidylcysteines on one hand and 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine on the other. Crystal structure analysis of EpiD with bound substrate peptide and a theoretical model for the binding of PPC to AtHAL3a showed that substrate binding involves an NH2-terminal substrate binding helix and a COOH-terminal substrate binding clamp (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The substrate binding clamp of EpiD forms an antiparallel β-sheet with the residues SSG (Ser-152 to Gly-154) in the turn region. The binding clamp and substrate peptide together form a three-stranded β-sheet (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The substrate binding clamp of the PPC decarboxylases AtHAL3a and Dfp is four residues shorter than that of EpiD and contains a conserved ACGD motif. The conserved Cys residue of this motif (Dfp, Cys158; AtHAL3a, Cys175) aligns with Ser153 of EpiD, and modeling of the AtHAL3a-PPC complex suggests that the conserved Cys residue is in the vicinity of the substrate cysteinyl moiety and might participate in catalysis (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For Dfp the substrate binding structural elements have been partially characterized and a PPC decarboxylase signature defined. The conserved lysine residue of the NH2-terminal G(G/S)IA XYK motif of the Dfp proteins is probably important for the binding of the phosphate group of PPC, whereas the exchange of the residue Cys158 led to loss of PPC decarboxylase activity (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To elucidate the reaction mechanism of PPC decarboxylases, two central questions have to be answered. First of all, it has to be proven that decarboxylation of PPC involves an oxidatively decarboxylated substrate. Second, elucidation of the mechanism by which this compound is reduced by FMNH2 to complete the reaction cycle of the flavoprotein must occur. To address these questions, we chose the following approach. It should be possible to trap the reaction at the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate and to prevent complete reduction by changing the geometry between the enzyme-bound intermediate and reduced flavin coenzyme. This could be achieved by changing residues involved in the binding of PPC, such as residues of the NH2-terminal binding helix or the substrate recognition clamp and/or by changing the substrate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, it should also be possible to identify amino acid residues involved in reoxidation of FMNH2 and to trap the intermediate in this way. We decided to carry out these experiments with AtHAL3a, which encodes only the PPC decarboxylase but not the PPC synthetase activity. Here we present data that AtHAL3a not only decarboxylates PPC but also pantothenoylcysteine (PC) and that the conserved Lys residue of the NH2-terminal binding helix is important for discriminating between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated substrate. We then show the purification and characterization of oxidatively decarboxylated PC obtained by incubation with mutant AtHAL3a enzymes. Furthermore, we present data indicating that the conserved Cys175 residue is important for reduction of the oxidized intermediate. PCR amplifications were performed with Vent-DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs). The entire sequences of the AtHAL3a-coding regions of the constructed plasmids were verified. The oligonucleotides used were purchased from MWG Biotech. AtHAL3a mutants were constructed by sequential PCR steps (17Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 8.5.1.-88.5.9Google Scholar) using appropriate mutagenesis primers and pET28a(+)AtHAL3a (4Espinosa-Ruiz A. Bellés J.M. Serrano R. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as template. The primers (i) forward, 5′-GGTGCCGCGCGGCAGCCATATGGCTAG-3′, and (ii) reverse, 5′-GGCTTTGTTAGCAGCCGGATCTCAGTG-3′ were used as 5′- and 3′-terminal primers for the sequential PCR and bind upstream and downstream of the BamHI and Hin dIII sites of pET28a(+)AtHAL3a, respectively. The mutant AtHAL3a genes were then cloned into the single BamHI and Hin dIII sites of the pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) so that a fusion with the His-tag codons occurred. The pET28a(+) derived plasmids were transformed into the expression strain Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by electroporation. The pET28a(+)AtHAL3a expression plasmids encode NH2-terminal His-tag fusion proteins of the mutant AtHAL3a proteins (His-AtHAL3a, MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM ASMTGGQQMGRGS-AtHAL3a). The E. coli BL21 (DE3) pET28a(+) AtHAL3a strains were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml kanamycin to A578= 0.4 in 0.5 liters of B-broth (10 g of casein hydrolysate 140 (GibcoBRL (Life Technologies)), 5 g of yeast extract (GibcoBRL (Life Technologies)), 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of glucose, and 1 g of K2HPO4/liter, pH 7.3) in 2 liters shaker flasks induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested 2 h after induction. 500 ml of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) pET28a(+) AtHAL3a cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 3 ml of the cleared lysate, obtained by two centrifugation steps (each 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C), was diluted with 3 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl) and applied to an equilibrated Ni-NTA column containing ∼0.5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The column was then washed with 10 ml of column buffer. His-AtHAL3a and mutant His-AtHAL3a proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 250 mm instead of 10 mmimidazole, and the yellow peak fractions (∼400 μl) were collected. If not otherwise stated, immediately after elution from the column, DTT was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. For gel filtration, a 25-μl aliquot of the Ni-NTA eluate was subjected to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated in running buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) at a flow rate 40 μl/min. The Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column and the standard proteins used for calibration were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. For activity assays (see below), the Ni-NTA eluates were used. Proteins were separated using Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis (18Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions. Approximately 50–100 μg of PPC as a calcium salt (2Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were incubated with 0.5–1.0 μg of His-AtHAL3a for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 0.70 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm DTT. The decarboxylation of pantothenoylcysteine used as barium salt (2Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was assayed in the same way; however, for each assay 475 μg of substrate were used in a total volume of 1 ml. The purity of both substrates was in the range of 60–80%, and it was verified by mass spectrometry that no 4′-phosphopantetheine or pantothenoylcysteamine was present in the synthesized substrates. However, PPC contained minor amounts of the unphosphorylated pantothenoylcysteine. The His-AtHAL3a mutants were adjusted to the same absorbance at 455 nm to enable a direct comparison of their activities. The reaction mixtures were kept at –80 °C and then were successively separated by reversed phase chromatography (RPC) with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 5.8 ml with a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The absorbance was measured simultaneously at 214, 260, and 280 nm to enable identification of oxidatively decarboxylated intermediates (7Kupke T. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4759-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,8Kupke T. Kempter C. Gnau V. Jung G. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5653-5659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions obtained were analyzed by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) as described below. ESI-FTICR-MS (19Marshall A.G. Hendrickson C.L. Jackson G.S. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1998; 17: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) measurements were carried out with a passively shielded 4.7-Tesla APEXTMII-ESI/matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-FTICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik). The mass spectrometry software XMASS version 5.0.10 (Bruker Daltonik) was used for mass calculation, data acquisition, and processing. Mass calculation was performed with the standard elemental mass compilation of Audi and Wapstra (20Audi G. Wapstra A.H. Nucl. Phys. A. 1995; 595: 409-480Crossref Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). The measured mass range was m/z 200–2000, and broadband excitation took place from m/z 100 to 2000. In general, 524,288 data points were acquired. For positive ion investigations, 50 μl of methanol and 1% acetic acid were added to the sample solutions (∼40–70-μl fractions from RPC). Electrospray ionization was performed in the positive mode with a grounded capillary sprayer needle mounted 60° off-axis (Analytica of Branford). No nebulizer gas was necessary to support the spray process. In general, the spectrum of a blank run (solvent and 1% acetic acid) was subtracted from the sample spectrum. For the external four-point calibration, standards derived from organic synthesis with the nominal masses m/z 201, 274, 342, and 364 were used. AtHAL3a and mutant AtHAL3a genes were expressed as His-tag fusion proteins purified from the corresponding E. coli clones by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and additionally characterized by gel filtration (Figs. 1 and2). All the mutant proteins have the same elution volume as wild-type His-AtHAL3a, and the ratio of the absorbance values at 280 and 450 nm was not significantly altered by the introduced mutations. We conclude that the introduced mutations do not affect the trimeric structure and coenzyme binding of AtHAL3a, indicating that the overall three-dimensional structure is not significantly altered. In the absence of DTT, trimeric His-AtHAL3a proteins oxidize and form higher multimers (Fig. 3).Figure 2Gel filtration of mutant His-AtHAL3a proteins under reducing conditions. Immediately after elution from the Ni-NTA-agarose column, 5 mm DTT was added to the protein solutions. The IMAC-enriched His-AtHAL3a and mutant His-AtHAL3a proteins were then separated by gel filtration, and the elution was followed by absorbance at 280 nm (upper line), 378 nm (not shown), and 450 nm (lower line). The Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column used was calibrated with standard proteins to correlate the elution volume with molecular weight information as recently described (2Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All the His-AtHAL3a proteins eluted at about 1.382 ml. This elution volume corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of about 110 kDa (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and is in accordance with the trimeric structure of His-AtHAL3a-FMN (21Albert A. Martinez-Ripoll M.

IMAC-enriched His-AtHAL3a protein solutions containing no DTT were subjected to gel filtration after different times of incubation at 4 °C (His-AtHAL3a wt, 120 min; His-AtHAL3a N142D, 30 min; His-AtHAL3a C175S, 20 h; His-AtHAL3a G179A, 20 h). His-AtHAL3a wt containing 5 mm DTT was used in the control experiment. In the absence of DTT, His-AtHAL3a wt, N142D, and G179A oxidize and form higher multimers, whereas the elution volume of His-AtHAL3a C175S is not changed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent molecular characterization of CoaC activity showed that mutations within the NH2-terminal G(G/S)IA XYK motif of the Dfp proteins, especially the exchange of the residue Lys20 for Gln or Asn, decreased PPC decarboxylase activity (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the conserved Lys residue is involved in binding of the phosphate group of PPC. This assumption is supported by the model for binding of PPC to AtHAL3a (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in characterizing the Lys34 residue within the motif GSVAAIK in the plant AtHAL3a protein. For the K34Q mutant, we could show a small decrease of PPC decarboxylase activity (Fig. 4). However, we also observed that exchange of the residue Lys34 for Asn or Gln led to an additional reaction product. This compound is only present in very low amounts if wild-type enzyme is used and, therefore, has not been detected before. Small amounts of this additional compound are also observed when the mutants I33V and K34R are used. Because we were aware that the synthetic PPC used is contaminated with pantothenoylcysteine, we decided to investigate if, in contrast to Dfp, AtHAL3a and mutant AtHAL3a proteins are able to decarboxylate PC (see below). We have previously shown that AtHAL3a is not as specific as Dfp (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To analyze if AtHAL3a not only decarboxylates PPC but also PC, synthetic PC was incubated with wild-type and mutant His-AtHAL3a proteins. The reaction mixtures were then separated by RPC, and the masses of the eluted compounds were determined. AtHAL3a enzymes, which were active in decarboxylation of PPC, were also active in the decarboxylation of PC (Fig. 5). The mass difference between PC and the observed reaction product was determined to be 43.990 Da (not shown but see Fig. 6), which is in excellent agreement with the monoisotopic mass of CO2 (the calculated monoisotopic mass is 43.9898 Da). The reaction product pantothenoylcysteamine eluted with a retention time of about 24.0–24.2 min. This retention time is in agreement with that of the observed additional reaction product of the AtHAL3a K34N/K34Q reaction with synthetic PPC (see above; minor shifts in the overall retention times are explained by changes in the column material with increasing numbers of applications). We conclude that, in a mixture of PPC and PC, wt AtHAL3a preferentially decarboxylates PPC and that this discrimination between both substrates depends on Lys34. This is a direct hint that Lys34 of AtHAL3a binds the phosphate group of PPC. If no PPC is present, there should be no difference between AtHAL3a and AtHAL3a K34N/K34Q in the reaction with PC, because this substrate lacks the phosphate group (the data presented in Fig. 5 support this view). The elucidation of the kinetic parameters for AtHAL3a and AtHAL3a K34N/K34Q for both substrates is impeded by the lack of a suitable enzyme assay. Moreover, the determination of decarboxylase activities for different ratios of PPC and PC is only possible by separating the reaction products (as it is shown in Fig. 4).Figure 6ESI-FTICR-MS analysis of the reaction products formed by His-AtHAL3a G179A. After incubation ofd-pantothenoylcysteine with a high concentration of His-AtHAL3a G179A, the reaction mixture was separated by RPC (A), with the elution was followed by absorbance at 214 nm (thin lin e), 260 nm (thick line), and 280 nm (not shown). Compounds 2 and 3 are characterized by high absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (compound 2:A260/A214 = 2.23 and A260/A280 = 3.92). The masses of the peak fractions 1 and 2 were determined by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (B and C, respectively). Fraction 1 is a mixture of PC and decarboxylated PC (pantothenoylcysteamine), whereas fraction 2 contains oxidatively decarboxylated pantothenoylcysteine (pantothenoylaminoethenethiol). Mass spectrometric analysis also indicates the presence of minor amounts of pantothenoylaminoethenethiol in fraction 3 (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The P XMN XXMW motif is conserved within the HFCD proteins, and crystal structure analysis of EpiD revealed the importance of this motif (residues 114–121 of EpiD) for binding of the substrate and the flavin cofactor (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The conserved residue Asn117 of EpiD contacts the Cβhydrogen atoms and the carboxylate group of the substrate cysteinyl moiety. It appears that this Asn residue (EpiD, Asn117; MrsD, Asn125; Dfp, Asn125; AtHAL3a, Asn142) and the conserved His residue of the HCFD proteins (EpiD, His67; MrsD, His75; Dfp, His75; AtHAL3a, His90) are essential for the decarboxylase reaction. Met120 of EpiD is located above the pyrimidine system of the FMN cofactor. For the eubacterial enzyme Dfp, the importance of the conserved Asn and Met residues for the PPC decarboxylase activity has already been published (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,2Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To verify these data and the proposed model of PPC binding to AtHAL3a, the mutant proteins His-AtHAL3a N142D and His-AtHAL3a M145L were purified and characterized. As expected, both enzymes were inactive in decarboxylating PPC and PC (Figs. 4and 5). Recently, crystal structure analysis of EpiD H67N with bound peptide DSYTC revealed that the pentapeptide is embraced by a 20-amino acid substrate recognition clamp comprising residues Pro143 to Met162. Residues of the NH2-terminal binding helix, the residue Asn117, and the NHI motif (containing the above mentioned conserved His residue) are also important for substrate binding (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We were interested in changing the way that PC and PPC bind to AtHAL3a to detect the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate. Therefore, we not only exchanged Asn142 and residues of the NH2-terminal binding helix (see above) but also residues within the proposed PPC binding clamp of AtHAL3a. Characterization of the substrate recognition clamp of HFCD proteins by site-directed mutagenesis has not been published apart from the preliminary characterization of the conserved Cys residue of the PPC decarboxylases (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We mutated residues Ala174, Cys175 (see below), Gly179, and Gly181 of the AtHAL3a substrate recognition clamp Pro168-Ile-Lys-Lys-Arg-Leu-Ala174-Cys175-Gly-Asp-Ile-Gly179-Pro-Gly181-Arg-Met183and elucidated the activity of the altered enzymes with both PPC and PC (Figs. 4 and 5). All of these residues are conserved in the eubacterial Dfp proteins (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mutant protein AtHAL3a D177N was included in the studies, because both AtHAL3a and E. coli Dfp have the ACGD motif, which is not present in the LanD enzymes EpiD and MrsD. Activity of AtHAL3a A174S, G179A, and G181A was significantly reduced with both substrates compared with wild-type AtHAL3a. D177N showed very low activity. However, activity of AtHAL3a A174V was comparable with wild-type activity, indicating that a hydrophobic side chain in position 174 is important for hydrophobic interactions with the substrate (compare the published model of PPC binding to AtHAL3a (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). As described below, further characterization of the AtHAL3a G179A reaction with pantothenoylcysteine then led to the identification of the proposed intermediate. From the characterization of the flavoenzyme EpiD it was known that oxidatively decarboxylated peptidylcysteines are characterized by their absorbance properties. The aminoenethiol group NH—CH==CH—SH is a strong chromophore, and the UV spectra of the EpiD reaction products were pH-dependent, with an absorption maximum of 259 nm under acidic conditions (pH ≤ 4.2) for the enethiol form and 283 nm at pH 7.0 for the enethiolate form; the isosbestic point was determined to be 271 nm. It was shown that the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of SFNSYV—NH—CH==CH—SH at 259 nm is at least ε ≈ 6,800m −1cm−1 and that the p Ka value of the enethiol group is about pH 6.0 (7Kupke T. Götz F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4759-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reversed phase separation of the AtHAL3a reaction mixtures was not only followed by absorbance at 214 nm but also by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. Using PPC as substrate, we did not unambiguously detect compounds with an increased absorbance at 260 nm, even if mutant AtHAL3a proteins were used in the decarboxylation assay (data not shown). However, the combination of pantothenoylcysteine as a substrate and mutant His-AtHAL3a enzymes such as R95Q, A174S, A174V, C175S, D177N, and G179A enables the identification of a compound that showed strong absorption at 260 nm (Fig. 5 B). The residues Ala174, Cys175, Asp177, and Gly179 are within the proposed substrate recognition clamp of AtHAL3a and could directly contact the substrate. Gly179 could also be important for the maintenance of the correct secondary/tertiary structure of the clamp. We believe that changing the structure of the recognition clamp results in a different active-site architecture and that the different geometry of the substrate/intermediate FMN/FMNH2 pair prevents complete reduction of the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate by FMNH2. It is also possible that structural changes within the recognition clamp enables reoxidation of FMNH2 by oxygen. Modeling of PPC binding to AtHAL3a shows that also residue Arg-95 could contact the substrate (5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The putative oxidatively decarboxylated PC (pantothenoylaminoethenethiol) was purified in larger amounts by incubation of PC with His-AtHAL3a G179A, because incubation with this enzyme led to the largest amounts of the intermediate. After separation of the reaction mixture by RPC, the reaction products were analyzed by ESI-FTICR-MS (Fig. 6). The MS data prove that PC is decarboxylated to pantothenoylcysteamine and that the compound with increased absorbance at 260 nm (and 280 nm) is pantothenoylaminoethenethiol. Interestingly, a second compound with the mass of pantothenoylaminoethenethiol could also be detected, and we propose that the two compounds are cis and trans isomers of the aminoenethiol intermediate. Recently, it has been shown that the conserved Cys residue of the substrate recognition clamp of Dfp proteins, which is missing in the LanD enzymes EpiD, MrsD, and MutD (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), is essential for activity (1Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We could prove this for AtHAL3a, because His-AtHAL3a C175S is inactive in decarboxylation of PPC to PP and of PC to pantothenoylcysteamine (Figs. 4 and 5). However, we detected pantothenoylaminoethenethiol when this mutant His-AtHAL3a enzyme was incubated with PC (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the C175S mutant differs from the R95Q, A174S, A174V, D177N, and G179A mutants, which were able to reduce the oxidized intermediate but had a very low decarboxylase activity (Figs.4 and 5). These mutants are probably substrate binding mutants. We suggest that Cys175 is directly involved in the reaction mechanism by reoxidation of the FMNH2 cofactor and/or by reduction of the oxidized intermediate (Fig. 7). Oxidation of the thiol side chain of the substrates would still be possible with the C175S mutant (if Cys175 has the proposed function), and consequently, spontaneous decarboxylation occurs. However, the reduced coenzyme will not be reoxidized by the substrate so that the native reaction cycle is interrupted, and only oxidatively decarboxylated but no decarboxylated compounds are detectable. Partial reoxidation of FMNH2 by oxygen can explain the fact that oxidatively decarboxylated intermediates are present in greater molar amounts than the enzyme used. Because C175 itself is part of the substrate recognition clamp, the previously mentioned structural changes of the clamp, for example the G179A exchange, not only change the binding of the reaction intermediate but also the geometry between reduced coenzyme, Cys175, and the intermediate. The elucidation of the mechanism of the second half reaction of the PPC decarboxylases will require further detailed biochemical and structural studies. However, it is tempting to speculate that the aminoenethiol/enethiolate group of the intermediate, NH—CH==CH—SH, and the side chain of Cys175, CH2—SH, form the mixed disulfide NH—CH2—CH2—S—S—CH2 during one stage of the second half reaction of the PPC decarboxylases. In this model, we suggest that disulfide formation concurs with reduction of the double bond, although the mechanism of this reaction is not clear. The disulfide is finally reduced by FMNH2, generating the cysteamine residue of the substrate and restoring the thiol side chain of Cys175. Interestingly, in contrast to wild-type AtHAL3a and other mutants, trimeric AtHAL3a C175S cannot form dimers (of trimers) under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3). In the absence of a substrate, the recognition clamp has no defined structure (6Blaesse M. Kupke T. Huber R. Steinbacher S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and Cys175 could form intermolecular disulfide bridges. In this paper, we have shown that the plant flavoprotein AtHAL3a not only decarboxylates PPC but also PC and that the discrimination between both substrates involves the conserved Lys34 residue. We were able to show that pantothenoylaminoethenethiol is the intermediate in decarboxylation of PC. We conclude that the decarboxylation of PC and PPC follows the mechanism decarboxylation by initial oxidation (Fig. 7). The role of the flavin cofactor of the PPC decarboxylases AtHAL3a and Dfp is therefore the same as for the LanD enzymes EpiD and MrsD. However, it appears that the difference in structure of the substrate binding clamp of PPC decarboxylases compared with LanD enzymes (for example the presence of the ACGD motif in the PPC decarboxylases) not only causes the difference in substrate specificity but also a different overall reaction.PPC decarboxylases are able to reduce the aminoenethiol group to a cysteamine residue, whereas LanD decarboxylases are not able to reoxidize their flavin cofactor in this way. Starting with the characterization of the peptidylcysteine decarboxylase EpiD a decade ago, we now understand how the decarboxylation of Cys residues occurs."

The significance with respect to rRNA maturation and the interdependences in rRNA processing are discussed. external transcribed spacer internal transcribed spacer The rRNAs of eukaryotic ribosomes are cleaved from a large 35–45 S pre-rRNA nucleolar precursor, which initially must be fully transcribed, modified through RNA methylation and base conversions, and assembled into an 80–90 S nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle (1Raue H.A. Planta R.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 91-129Google Scholar, 2Woolford J.L. Warner J.R. Brooch J.R. Pringle J. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 587-626Google Scholar). Electron micrographs of chromatin spreads from actively transcribed nucleoli (3Miller O.L., Jr. Beatty B.R. Science. 1969; 164: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) as well as structural analyses of the nucleolar RNA precursors (4Choi Y.C. Nazar R. Busch H. Cell Nucleus. 1974; 3: 109-149Crossref Google Scholar) have demonstrated such transcripts in many organisms. The processing of the transcripts, however, has been pictured as a cleavage pathway (5Raue H.A. Planta R.J. Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 71-77PubMed Google Scholar) of many rapid and independent steps beginning with the two external transcribed spacers (5′-ETS and 3′-ETS)1 and followed with cleavages in the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2). Although some variations in the details have been reported, in general, this cleavage pathway is considered a conserved feature of eukaryotic cells. In recent years, a number of genetic and biochemical analyses have begun to indicate that, at least in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the cleavage steps in rRNA processing are not independent as previously believed. In this fission yeast, distant interactions between the external and internal transcribed spacers can dramatically influence the efficiency of rRNA processing and ribosomal integration. For example, deletion of a conserved 3′-ETS structure has been found to dramatically affect the processing of the ITS2 and the 5.8 S rRNA sequences, located more than 3000 bases upstream (6Melekhovets Y.F. Good L. Abou Elela S. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Hitchen J. Ivakine E. Melekhovets Y.F. Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Equally, the deletion of the ITS2 spacer not only prevents the maturation of the large subunit but severely affects maturation of the small subunit rRNA (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutations in the 5′-ETS also can dramatically affect the production of large subunit RNA constituents (9Intine R.V.A. Good L. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 695-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and even changes to the position of termination appear to critically alter the maturation efficiency (10Lee Y. Melekovetz Y.F. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28003-28005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All of these observations have been taken as evidence that interdependences in rRNA maturation act as quality control mechanisms to help ensure that only functional rRNA is incorporated into ribosomes. To identify structural components that underlie the observed interdependences, searches have been made for proteins that interact specifically with the transcribed spacers (11Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With the application of affinity chromatography and the use of the transcribed spacers as ligands, a large protein complex of 20 or more polypeptides has been isolated (13Lalev A. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and putatively called RAC (ribosomes assembly chaperone). Many of the polypeptides appeared to contain RNA-binding sites, but no RNA cleavage activity could be demonstrated with this protein complex. Subsequently, the complex was shown to contain independent binding sites for each of the transcribed spacers in the pre-rRNA (14Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16655-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and consistent with a role in rRNA processing, the disruption of an RAC-binding site in the ITS1 rRNA spacer was observed to severely affect rRNA processing (13Lalev A. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the RAC complex itself appears not to have any nuclease activity, more recent studies with the PacI RNase III-like endonuclease have shown that, in the presence of the RAC complex, this enzyme specifically cleaves the ribosomal RNA precursor at the 3′-end of the 25 S rRNA sequence (15Spassov K.A. Perdomo L.I. Evakine E. Nazar R.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 433-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provide evidence that the RAC complex does indeed function as a chaperone for ribosome maturation. Because deletion of the ITS2 region is critical not only to the maturation of the large ribosomal subunit but also has been found to dramatically affect the efficiency of 18 S rRNA production, further study now has been made of essential structural features in the ITS2 sequence from S. pombe, particularly with respect to RAC binding. The results identify the protein-binding domain in the central extended hairpin structure and show that this site is critical to rRNA maturation in vivo. A DNA template for the ITS2 region in S. pombe rDNA was prepared by PCR amplification using primers specific for the 3′-end of the 5.8 S rRNA (ATGCCTGTTTGAGTGTC), beginning 20 nucleotides from the 3′-end, and the 5′-end of the 25 S rRNA (GCGAATAACTATACGAA), ending 55 nucleotides downstream of the 5′-end. This 374-bp fragment was cloned in the pTZR19 plasmid for expression by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase after cleavage with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, as described previously (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The precursor RNA transcript was purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and labeled at the 5′-end using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, (16Chaconas G. van de Sande J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), after dephosphorylation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 133-134Google Scholar). The phosphatase was inactivated by heating to 75 °C for 10 min in 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) before the RNA was labeled, and the labeled RNA again was purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To prepare just the central extended stem RNA in ITS2, the same methodology was applied using primers specific for the 5′ (GATGAGGTGTTG) and 3′ (GTTAAGGTTCAA) ends of the 222-nucleotide sequence. The RAC protein complex was purified by affinity chromatography using ITS1 RNA bound to a poly(C)-agarose support (Sigma-Aldrich) as recently described (13Lalev A. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16655-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The RNA ligand was immobilized on the column matrix using a poly(G) sequence at the 3′-end that was initially inserted into the DNA template sequence. Protein was extracted from logarithmically growingS. pombe, strain h− leu 1–32 ura 4-D18, and applied at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in chromatography buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 5–10 mg of unrelated calf liver rRNA. The column was washed with chromatography buffer containing 0.133 m KCl and then eluted in two steps using buffer containing first 0.3 m and then 1 m KCl, respectively. As previously reported, the RAC complex was present in the 1 m KCl fraction. Ribonucleoprotein complex formation was assayed by gel retardation as described previously (11Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Aliquots of in vitro transcribed and labeled spacer RNA (0.3–2 ng/20,000–25,000 cpm were incubated with 5 μl of RAC protein in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 8% glycerol and 0.25 mg/ml calf liver rRNA to eliminate nonspecific interactions. For comparative analyses, 0.3 ng of RNA was incubated with RAC protein on ice for 10 min in 20 ml of buffer; the protein concentration was adjusted to be limiting with normal RNA, allowing about 60–70% of the labeled RNA to be incorporated into the ribonucleoprotein complex. The complexes were fractionated from free RNAs on 2% (w/v) agarose gels at 4 °C; following electrophoresis the gels were exposed to x-ray film to detect the bands by autoradiography. Critical residues in protein-binding sites within the RNA spacer were determined by modification exclusion as described previously (18Peattie D.A. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2273-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Nazar R.N. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After dephosphorylation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, in vitro transcribed ITS2 precursor RNA or just the central extended stem region was labeled at the 5′-end using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified in a denaturing 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (11Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The labeled RNA (5 × 105 cpm) together with 10 μg of carrier RNA (tRNA) was dissolved in 200 μl of reaction buffer (1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.5), 1 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate was added, and the solution was heated at 90 °C for 3 min. The mixture was cooled, 20 μl of 3 m NaAc were added to stop the reaction, and the RNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The modified RNA was dissolved in 20 μl of water and incubated with 4 μl of 5× binding buffer, 6 μg of calf liver rRNA, and 5 μl of RAC protein extract to form complex. The solution was then cleared by microcentrifuge centrifugation, and the RNP was purified by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The free and complexed labeled RNA bands were detected by autoradiography and eluted by gel homogenization. After SDS/phenol extraction, each RNA fraction again was purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel, dissolved in 20 μl of freshly prepared aniline solution (1 m aniline in 2.5% acetic acid), and incubated at 60 °C for 20 min in the dark. The mixture was cooled, the reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 0.3 mNaAc, and the RNA was precipitated with 0.5 ml of ethanol. The RNA fragments were dissolved in loading buffer (50% formamide, 0.001% xylene cyanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and fractionated on a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel; following electrophoresis the gels were exposed to x-ray film to detect the bands by autoradiography. Quantitative analyses of the cleaved bands were performed using a scanner (Umax Technologies) to capture the images and Molecular Analyst PC software, version 1.5 (Bio-Rad). The level of modification for each nucleotide in protein-associated RNA was determined as a percentage of that observed with the free RNA fraction. Site-specific mutations were introduced into the 1TS2 sequence of a S. pombe rRNA transcriptional unit that had previously been subcloned (20Abou Elela S. Good L. Melekhovets Y.F. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 686-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into the pFL20 yeast shuttle vector and “tagged” with a PstI restriction site in the 18 S rRNA sequence (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and a four-base insert in the 5.8 S rRNA (21Abou Elela S. Good L. Nazar R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The base substitutions and some deletions were introduced by two-step PCR amplification (22Good L. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4934-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using a pBluescript KS plasmid template containing the entire intrageneic region with adjacent 3′-end 18 S and 5′-end 25 S rRNA sequences. In some instances when deletions were not successful with this strategy, mutations were introduced by plasmid-enhanced PCR-based mutagenesis (23Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) using the same template. In either case, the resulting mutated and amplified DNA was used to replace the normal sequence in the shuttle vector containing the tagged S. pombe rDNA transcriptional unit. The recombinants subsequently were amplified in Escherichia coli, strain C490, and used to transform S. pombe strain h− leu 1–32 ura 4-D18 using the method described by Prentice (24Prentice H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 621Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Each mutation initially was confirmed by DNA sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen A. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), and subsequently, where required, the presence of mutant rDNA in transformed cells was confirmed again by PCR amplification of the ITS2 rDNA region followed once more by DNA sequencing. Transformed S. pombe cells expressing normal or mutant rRNAs were grown with constant aeration at 30 °C in minimal medium broth (26Leupold U. Method Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 169-177Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For all analyses, the cells were rapidly cooled with ice, harvested by centrifugation, and extracted with SDS/phenol after disruption by vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads (27Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For 5.8 S rRNA analyses, the RNA was fractionated on an 8% (v/w) polyacrylamide gel and stained with methylene blue to detect the separated RNA components (21Abou Elela S. Good L. Nazar R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For 18S rRNA or precursor analyses, the RNA was fractionated on a 0.8% agarose, 0.2 m formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon by capillary blotting (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with methylene blue to confirm that equivalent amounts of RNA were transferred and then hybridized with a 32P-labeled oligomer probe specific for the tagged 18 S rRNA transcribed from the plasmid-associated rDNA (8Good L. Intine R.V.A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gel retardation studies with the ITS2 region in the S. pombe rRNA precursor indicate that the central extended hairpin structure in this rRNA sequence forms a specific and stable ribonucleoprotein complex (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig.1 (inset), based on sequence comparisons with the ITS1 and 3′-ETS regions in the same rRNA precursor molecule, a protein-binding site was putatively identified at that terminal end of this hairpin structure. In the present study direct evidence for this site initially was sought using modification exclusion (19Nazar R.N. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whole ITS2 rRNA or just the central extended hairpin was prepared by transcription using T7 rRNA polymerase, and the rRNA was labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP. To maintain protein limited conditions, sufficient affinity-purified RAC complex was incubated with labeled rRNA to convert about 90% of the rRNA to ribonucleoprotein complex (Fig.2, lane b). To probe the protein-binding site, the labeled rRNA was first modified using an rRNA chemical sequencing reagent containing diethylpyrocarbonate (28Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) and then incubated with RAC protein. As also shown in Fig. 2 (lane c), when the resulting ribonucleoprotein complex was fractionated by gel electrophoresis, a significantly reduced amount of ribonucleoprotein was evident, with only about half of the rRNA being able to form RNP. The rRNA in both the free and the protein-bound rRNA fractions was eluted, purified by SDS/phenol extraction, and treated with aniline to cleave the chemically modified residues (19Nazar R.N. Wildeman A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The fragments were fractionated on polyacrylamide sequencing gels as shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), and after exposure to x-ray film, the images were analyzed to determine the relative reactivity at each base in the protein-associated fraction as compared with the free rRNA. Although the diethylpyrocarbonate-induced cleavage was primarily directed at the purine residues (28Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), as noted previously (13Lalev A. Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), sufficient cleavage occurred at pyrimidine sites to permit the analysis of all of the nucleotides. As also shown in Fig. 3C, when images of replicated experiments were analyzed, the relative reactivity at each base in the protein-associated fraction was reduced in two areas, U144–G167 and U186–A192. More important, when the sites are examined with respect to the secondary structure (Fig.3D), they appear on opposite sides of the helix near the end of the extended central stem. As indicated in Fig. 3D, this is the same region that contained nucleotides that were previously noted to be conserved in the extended hairpin structures from the ITS1, ITS2, and 3′-ETS regions in the 35S pre-rRNA of S. pombe (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).FIG. 2Effect of diethylpyrocarbonate modification on ribonucleoprotein formation. The S. pombe ITS2 RNA sequence was transcribed in vitro, labeled at the 5′-end, and chemically modified with diethlypyrocarbonate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unmodified RNA (lane b) or RNA modified with 2 μl diethlypyrocarbonate (lane c) was incubated with affinity purified RAC protein and unrelated carrier RNA to form ribonucleoprotein and fractionated an a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The positions of the free and protein-associated RNA are indicated on the right; unmodified RNA is included on the left(lane a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 3Probing of the protein-binding site by modification exclusion. Labeled ITS2 RNA was prepared, modified with diethylpyrocarbonate, and used to form ribonucleoprotein as shown in Fig. 2. The gel purified protein-associated (RNP) or free RNA (RNA) bands were eluted and extracted with SDS/phenol, and the modified bases were cleaved with aniline. The resulting fragments were fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels for comparison and image analyses. Both ribonucleoprotein formed with the original cellular protein extract (A) and affinity-purified protein (B) were examined. The gel images were captured and used to determine the level of modification in protein-associated RNA as compared with the free RNA fraction. The average for three replicate experiments with affinity-purified protein is presented as a histogram (C). The two regions with reduced modification (regions I and II) in the secondary structure are indicated with light shading (D); nucleotides common to the ITS1, ITS2 and 3′-ETS structures are indicated bydark shading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the correspondence between conserved nucleotides and the protein-binding site was striking, the biological significance of these observations remained unclear. To further establish the protein-binding site and any role in rRNA maturation, mutations were introduced in this region to assess their effects on rRNA processing in vivoand protein binding in vitro. Initially, the entire end of the extended hairpin (Fig. 4A) was deleted using a plasmid-enhanced PCR-based mutagenesis strategy (23Abeyrathne P.D. Nazar R.N. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 1172-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, when rDNA containing this mutation was expressed in vivo and the amount of plasmid-derived 5.8 S rRNA was determined after fractionation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the observed effect was dramatic. As described previously, in control cells that were transformed with rDNA containing the normal ITS1 sequence, about 50% of the total 5.8 S rRNA was plasmid-derived. In cells that were not transformed with plasmid, no mutant RNA was evident. In all of the mutational analyses, to ensure a reproducible conclusion, at least three separate transformants were examined. As shown in Fig. 4B, in all three examples for this deletion (lanes a–c), the substantial amount of plasmid-derived RNA clearly was absent when the mutation was present. As also shown in Fig. 4C, when hybridization analyses were conducted using an oligonucleotide probe that was specific for the plasmid-derived 18 S rRNA sequence, precursor rRNA was clearly detectable, although, again, no mature rRNA was present. Untransformed cells contained no RNA that was homologous with the oligonucleotide probe, and in normal transformed cells, only a very large amount of mature rRNA was evident under the exposure conditions that were used. In strong contrast, only greatly elevated levels of 37 S nRNA transcript or transcript trimmed of ETS sequence was evident in any of the three mutant colonies (lanes a–c). To ensure a uniform transfer, all of the membranes were stained with methylene blue prior to hybridization analyses. As shown in Fig. 4D, comparable amounts of RNA were evident in each lane. Because sequence comparisons and the RAC ITS2 RNA footprint indicated that the binding site was centered in the top of the second base-paired section in the central extended hairpin, specific base substitutions also were introduced into this region of the hairpin structure to further evaluate the critical features. As shown in Fig.5, in some cases the effects again were very dramatic. For example, when the hairpin was disrupted with a substitution of three nucleotides at G187, U190, and G191 (mutant II) or a smaller disruption with a substitution of two adenylic acid residues at U188 and U189 (mutant III), essentially no 5.8 S rRNA was detected (Fig. 5, left panels) and levels of the mature plasmid-derived 18 S rRNA were severely impacted (Fig. 5, right panels). More important, also as indicated by the hybridization analyses (Fig. 5, right panels), significantly elevated levels of the initial transcript were very apparent, and only ETS cleavage was evident. Clearly, internal cleavages are not observed, so mature 18 S rRNA was not produced. As indicated by the somewhat lower levels of uncleaved precursors, the more severe distruption (mutant II) appeared also to result in a less stable nascent transcript. In contrast, when this hairpin region was not disrupted but a substitution of three nucleotides at U186, U190, and G191 (mutant IV) simply further stabilized the hairpin structure, little or no effect was observed with respect to either 5.8 or 18 S rRNA maturation. Furthermore, when significant changes were made in the terminal loop (mutant I), modest effects were evident, but as indicated by the hybridization analyses, increased levels of precursor intermediates were not observed, suggesting an effect on precursor stability rather than an inhibition in a defined step in the maturation pathway. Taken together these mutational analyses indicated that the protein-binding site, identified by sequence comparisons and modification exclusion, was uniquely critical to rRNA maturation. To further confirm the RAC protein-binding site, the mutant rRNA also was examined with respect to RAC protein binding in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, the simple substitution of two adenylic acid residues at U188 and U189 that strongly impacted rRNA maturation also dramatically affected protein binding. This relatively modest disruption in the hairpin structure completely disrupted protein binding, and no complex was formed with RNA that contained these changes (Fig. 6, lane d). Based on comparative analyses the core structure of the ITS2 region has been postulated to comprise of a single extended hairpin that includes the interacting termini of the mature 5.8 and 25 S rRNAs (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). InS. pombe and all of the other examples that have been examined, various smaller hairpin branches were also always present. Such features appear not to be conserved in any consistent fashion and tend to be characteristic of individual ITS2 sequences (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, in the present study, modification exclusion did not indicate contacts between these structures and the RAC protein complex, further suggesting that they may not be important with respect to rRNA maturation. Nevertheless, to detect any other influences on rRNA maturation, the three branch structures in the S. pombe ITS2 were each deleted separately, and the effects of these changes also were examined in vivo. As indicated in Fig.7, some effects were evident, but they were far less dramatic than observed with the RAC-binding site. In replicated experiments with all three of the new mutations, the amount of plasmid-derived 5.8S S rRNA was reduced to about 60% of the control value (Fig. 7, left panels), and the amount of 18S rRNA also was similarly depressed (Fig. 7, right panels). More important, however, when these mutants were examined with respect to changes in specific precursor intermediates, no elevated precursor levels were evident as was observed with the RAC-binding site mutations. These observations again suggest that this group of mutant RNAs were simply less stable with no specific failure in rRNA processing. As shown in Fig. 1, based on computer-aided modeling and experimental probing, the ITS2 region has been predicted extensively paired into a relatively simple secondary structure (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the hairpin structure proximal to the mature termini appears to be more complex with some evidence of a higher order structure, making this region less susceptible to enzyme digestion (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In view of these observations and the potential importance of these features with respect to the removal of the ITS2 sequence, a number of substitutions also were introduced into the large loop in this region (Fig. 7, mutant IV). WhenS. pombe cells were transformed with this sequence, and the effects were examined in vivo, as observed with that terminal helix, these changes proved critical, and little or no mature rRNA was observed. As shown in Fig. 7, the large amount of plasmid-derived 5.8 S rRNA was clearly absent, and only small amounts of mature 18 S rRNA could be detected by hybridization analyses. More important was the fact that the amount of initial nascent rRNA transcript was greatly elevated, consistent with a direct inhibition in rRNA processing. Although the sequencing of rDNAs from many diverse eukaryotes has revealed highly conserved core structures in the mature rRNAs, the spacer regions have been shown to vary greatly, both in size and sequence, with little conservation even between relatively close examples. This has caused some to speculate that the processing mechanisms may vary with phylogeny (29Subrahmanyan C.S. Cassidy B. Busch H. Rothblum L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3668-3680Google Scholar, 30Bachellerie J.-P. Michot B. Raynal F. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 9: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation could be a role in which the spacers act as “biological springs” to maintain processed sites in close proximity (31Nazar R.N. Wong W.M. Abrahamson J.L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7523-7527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In more recent analyses, computer modeling and probes for nuclease protection were applied in searches of conserved core features (11Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, these analyses have suggested that all of the spacer regions may act in a similar fashion not only to organize the maturing terminal sequences but also to organize transacting factors in a manner that may be analogous with that of many small nuclear RNAs (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mutation analyses in the present study are consistent with these two basic functions. On one hand the ITS2 spacers interact with the RAC complex, an interaction that has been shown to be critical to rRNA maturation. Equally critical is the sequence surrounding the mature termini, where changes also can eliminate rRNA maturation. The influence of the remaining secondary structure clearly was less important and appeared primarily to result in precursor instability. Early studies on the removal of internal transcribed spacers from preribosomal RNP particles in S. cerevisiae suggested a split maturation for two portions of the 80–90 S nucleolar precursor particle. Removal of large portions from the 5′-ETS or almost half of ITS1 appeared to only affect the formation of tagged 17 S rRNA (32Musters W. Boon K. Van der Sande C.A.F.M. Van Heerikhuizen H. Planta R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3989-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33Musters W. Planta R.J. Van Heerikhuizen H. Raue H.A. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 435-442Google Scholar) and complete or partial deletions of ITS2 prevented the production of mature 26 S rRNA (33Musters W. Planta R.J. Van Heerikhuizen H. Raue H.A. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner J.R. The Ribosome: Structure, Function and Evolution. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1990: 435-442Google Scholar) but did not interfere with the synthesis of the 17S rRNA (34Van der Sande C.A.F.M. Kwa M. Van Nues R.W. Van Heerikhuizen H. Raue H.A. Planta R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These conclusions differ from more recent studies inS. pombe (e.g. 6, 8), including the present analysis, primarily because of differences in the tagged experimental systems that were used. As noted previously, in the initial studies a low copy plasmid vector resulted in very small amounts of mutant RNA that had to be detected by very sensitive hybridization analyses. In the more recent studies, at least half of the cellular RNA normally is plasmid-derived, and the tagged 5.8 S rRNA can be detected by a simple staining procedure (21Abou Elela S. Good L. Nazar R.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This ensures that large amounts of mutant RNA precursors are forced to compete with normal RNA during quantitative analyses and provides a more accurate measurement of interdependences in the process. Although alternate conclusions were reached regarding interdependence in rRNA processing, the earlier studies in S. cerevisiaefirst demonstrated that although the spacers vary widely in size and sequence (35Nazar R.N. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 1-28Google Scholar), they do contain structural features that are essential for their removal. In their study of the role of ITS2 in processing, Raue and co-workers (34Van der Sande C.A.F.M. Kwa M. Van Nues R.W. Van Heerikhuizen H. Raue H.A. Planta R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 36Van Nues Rientjes J.M.J. Morre S.A. Mollee E. Planta R.J. Venema J. Raue H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) concluded that this sequence is more sensitive to structural alteration than ITS1. They also concluded that elements of ITS2 that play a major role in processing were confined largely to structures that were conserved in other yeast species. The deletion of individual nonconserved segments appeared to cause little or no disturbance in processing. With respect to a generalized estimate of the secondary structure for ITS2 regions (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Yeh L.-C.C. Lee J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the regions of sequence conservation and deleterious mutations in S. cerevisiae primarily correspond with the terminal helix in the extended central hairpin and the region surrounding or adjacent to the interacting mature termini of the 5.8 and 25 S rRNAs. Changes in the branch helices or in the middle portion of the central stem were those that, individually, caused little or no disturbance. Similarly, in the present studies, mutations in the branched regions again were not critical. With large amounts of plasmid-derived RNA and more accurate quantitative analyses, there was a clear reduction in the mature RNA yield, but, as indicated by the precursor profiles, no specific steps were inhibited, and the precursors appeared simply to be less stable. Also in agreement with the studies in S. cerevisiae, inS. pombe the end of the extended hairpin and the sequence adjoining the mature termini proved to be critical to RNA maturation. In both regions, the mutations also induced large changes in the precursor profile as characterized by hybridization analyses, and substantial build-up in the initial precursors were evident. With changes near the maturing termini, some 18 S rRNA was clearly evident; this was essentially eliminated entirely with changes in the RAC-binding site. Taken together, the previous studies in S. cerevisiae and the present studies in S. pombe are consistent with two critical requirements in the ITS2 spacer: a site that interacts with the RAC complex, possibly to contribute to a common processing domain in the nucleolar precursor particle (14Lalev A. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16655-16659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and a defined structure at the maturing termini that is recognized by the processing enzyme(s). As previously suggested (31Nazar R.N. Wong W.M. Abrahamson J.L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7523-7527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the remaining ITS2 structure simply may act to organize the critical domains in a stable fashion. This would be consistent with the wide range of size and composition that is observed among ITS2 sequences. Although the present study documents the critical nature of the ITS2-RAC interaction, the reason why RNA processing is inhibited remains unclear. In a recent study of the 3′-ETS (15Spassov K.A. Perdomo L.I. Evakine E. Nazar R.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 433-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the RAC complex, which, independently, exhibits no nuclease activity, was observed to dramatically alter the efficiency and specificity of the RNase III-like PAC nuclease, a primary processing enzyme in the maturation of the 3′-ETS. This observation was consistent with and provided new direct evidence of a “chaperone” role for this protein complex. The effects of the RAC-binding site mutations in the present study are completely consistent with this function and raise the possibility that the RAC complex can affect the efficiency and/or specificity of enzyme activities in ITS1 sequence removal, including RNase MRP (38Stohll L.L. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the nuclear RNase P (39Chamberlain J.R. Lee Y. Lane W.S. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1678-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), or the Rrp4p protein (40Allmang C. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Studies with these enzymes will be required to examine this possibility. In the interim, the RAC-binding site analyses provide a explanation for the critical nature of mutations at the end of the central extended hairpin in the ITS2 region and further underlines the structural equivalence (12Lalev A. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in the transcribed spacers of pre-rRNA transcripts."
