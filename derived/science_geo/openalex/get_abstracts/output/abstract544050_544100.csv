https://openalex.org/W2103021272,"Epigenetic silencing including histone modifications and DNA methylation is an important tumorigenic mechanism. However, its role in cancer immunopathology and immunotherapy is poorly understood. Using human ovarian cancers as our model, here we show that enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation repress the tumour production of T helper 1 (TH1)-type chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, and subsequently determine effector T-cell trafficking to the tumour microenvironment. Treatment with epigenetic modulators removes the repression and increases effector T-cell tumour infiltration, slows down tumour progression, and improves the therapeutic efficacy of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also known as B7-H1) checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell transfusion in tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, tumour EZH2 and DNMT1 are negatively associated with tumour-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and patient outcome. Thus, epigenetic silencing of TH1-type chemokines is a novel immune-evasion mechanism of tumours. Selective epigenetic reprogramming alters the T-cell landscape in cancer and may enhance the clinical efficacy of cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2130497602,"The study of bacterial ion channels has provided fundamental insights into the structural basis of neuronal signalling; however, the native role of ion channels in bacteria has remained elusive. Here we show that ion channels conduct long-range electrical signals within bacterial biofilm communities through spatially propagating waves of potassium. These waves result from a positive feedback loop, in which a metabolic trigger induces release of intracellular potassium, which in turn depolarizes neighbouring cells. Propagating through the biofilm, this wave of depolarization coordinates metabolic states among cells in the interior and periphery of the biofilm. Deletion of the potassium channel abolishes this response. As predicted by a mathematical model, we further show that spatial propagation can be hindered by specific genetic perturbations to potassium channel gating. Together, these results demonstrate a function for ion channels in bacterial biofilms, and provide a prokaryotic paradigm for active, long-range electrical signalling in cellular communities."

https://openalex.org/W1841190780,"The authors trained mice to attend to or suppress vision based on behavioral context and show, through novel and established techniques, that changes in visual gain rely on tunable feedforward inhibition of visual thalamus via innervating thalamic reticular neurons; these findings introduce a subcortical model of attention in which modality-specific thalamic reticular subnetworks mediate top-down and context-dependent control of sensory selection. The prefrontal cortex is thought to regulate attention to sensory stimuli through top-down control of sensory cortical areas. Here, Michael Halassa and colleagues trained mice to attend to the appropriate stimulus by selecting between two competing auditory and visual stimuli. Performance on this task required the prelimbic cortex, but not the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and involved prelimbic cortex interactions with the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) rather than with sensory cortex. They provide evidence that the visTRN controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition of the lateral geniculate nucleus, thereby selecting the appropriate input for further processing. These findings support a subcortical model of sensory selection in which modality-specific thalamic reticular subnetworks mediate top-down control of sensory thalamic gain. How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function1, its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection2,3,4,5. To test this idea and, more generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing."
https://openalex.org/W1813751289,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger non-proteolytic ubiquitylation of adjacent chromatin areas to generate binding sites for DNA repair factors. This depends on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 (refs 1-6), and UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that specifically generates K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Whereas RNF168 is known to catalyse ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones, leading to the recruitment of repair factors such as 53BP1 (refs 8-10), the critical substrates of RNF8 and K63-linked ubiquitylation remain elusive. Here we elucidate how RNF8 and UBC13 promote recruitment of RNF168 and downstream factors to DSB sites in human cells. We establish that UBC13-dependent K63-linked ubiquitylation at DSB sites is predominantly mediated by RNF8 but not RNF168, and that H1-type linker histones, but not core histones, represent major chromatin-associated targets of this modification. The RNF168 module (UDM1) recognizing RNF8-generated ubiquitylations is a high-affinity reader of K63-ubiquitylated H1, mechanistically explaining the essential roles of RNF8 and UBC13 in recruiting RNF168 to DSBs. Consistently, reduced expression or chromatin association of linker histones impair accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates and repair factors at DSB-flanking chromatin. These results identify histone H1 as a key target of RNF8-UBC13 in DSB signalling and expand the concept of the histone code by showing that posttranslational modifications of linker histones can serve as important marks for recognition by factors involved in genome stability maintenance, and possibly beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2121041004,"Alkenes are the most ubiquitous prochiral functional groups--those that can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single step--that are accessible to synthetic chemists. For this reason, difunctionalization reactions of alkenes (whereby two functional groups are added to the same double bond) are particularly important, as they can be used to produce highly complex molecular architectures. Stereoselective oxidation reactions, including dihydroxylation, aminohydroxylation and halogenation, are well established methods for functionalizing alkenes. However, the intermolecular incorporation of both carbon- and nitrogen-based functionalities stereoselectively across an alkene has not been reported. Here we describe the rhodium-catalysed carboamination of alkenes at the same (syn) face of a double bond, initiated by a carbon-hydrogen activation event that uses enoxyphthalimides as the source of both the carbon and the nitrogen functionalities. The reaction methodology allows for the intermolecular, stereospecific formation of one carbon-carbon and one carbon-nitrogen bond across an alkene, which is, to our knowledge, unprecedented. The reaction design involves the in situ generation of a bidentate directing group and the use of a new cyclopentadienyl ligand to control the reactivity of rhodium. The results provide a new way of synthesizing functionalized alkenes, and should lead to the convergent and stereoselective assembly of amine-containing acyclic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1918633965,"Heterochromatin mostly comprises repeated sequences prone to harmful ectopic recombination during double-strand break (DSB) repair. In Drosophila cells, 'safe' homologous recombination (HR) repair of heterochromatic breaks relies on a specialized pathway that relocalizes damaged sequences away from the heterochromatin domain before strand invasion. Here we show that heterochromatic DSBs move to the nuclear periphery to continue HR repair. Relocalization depends on nuclear pores and inner nuclear membrane proteins (INMPs) that anchor repair sites to the nuclear periphery through the Smc5/6-interacting proteins STUbL/RENi. Both the initial block to HR progression inside the heterochromatin domain, and the targeting of repair sites to the nuclear periphery, rely on SUMO and SUMO E3 ligases. This study reveals a critical role for SUMOylation in the spatial and temporal regulation of HR repair in heterochromatin, and identifies the nuclear periphery as a specialized site for heterochromatin repair in a multicellular eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W1885752046,Bacteria and archaea generate adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating foreign DNA of specific 30-40-base-pair lengths into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci as spacer segments. The universally conserved Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex catalyses spacer acquisition using a direct nucleophilic integration mechanism similar to retroviral integrases and transposases. How the Cas1-Cas2 complex selects foreign DNA substrates for integration remains unknown. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Escherichia coli Cas1-Cas2 complex bound to cognate 33-nucleotide protospacer DNA substrates. The protein complex creates a curved binding surface spanning the length of the DNA and splays the ends of the protospacer to allow each terminal nucleophilic 3'-OH to enter a channel leading into the Cas1 active sites. Phosphodiester backbone interactions between the protospacer and the proteins explain the sequence-nonspecific substrate selection observed in vivo. Our results uncover the structural basis for foreign DNA capture and the mechanism by which Cas1-Cas2 functions as a molecular ruler to dictate the sequence architecture of CRISPR loci.

https://openalex.org/W2174109782,"Using functional MRI and a novel model-based analysis, the authors find that the uncertainty in sensory representations can reliably be estimated from trial-by-trial activity in human visual cortex. Moreover, this uncertainty represented in cortical activity affects the way people make decisions. Bayesian theories of neural coding propose that sensory uncertainty is represented by a probability distribution encoded in neural population activity, but direct neural evidence supporting this hypothesis is currently lacking. Using fMRI in combination with a generative model-based analysis, we found that probability distributions reflecting sensory uncertainty could reliably be estimated from human visual cortex and, moreover, that observers appeared to use knowledge of this uncertainty in their perceptual decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2113451459,"The X-ray crystal structure of influenza C virus polymerase, captured in a closed, pre-activation confirmation, is solved at 3.9 Å resolution; comparison with previous RNA-bound structures reveals large conformational changes associated with RNA binding and activation, and illustrates the notable flexibility of the influenza virus RNA polymerase. Erwin Fodor and colleagues report the crystal structure of influenza C virus RNA polymerase, captured in a closed, pre-activation conformation. This closed conformation appears very different from previously reported crystal structures of influenza A and B virus polymerases, which contained the RNA promoter. Influenza C infects pigs and humans, but is rarer than the A and B viruses and causes a less severe form of flu. Comparison of the new structure with the previous RNA-bound structures identifies large conformational changes associated with RNA binding and activation, illustrating the flexibility of the influenza virus RNA polymerase. Negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza, encode large, multidomain RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that can both transcribe and replicate the viral RNA genome1. In influenza virus, the polymerase (FluPol) is composed of three polypeptides: PB1, PB2 and PA/P3. PB1 houses the polymerase active site, whereas PB2 and PA/P3 contain, respectively, cap-binding and endonuclease domains required for transcription initiation by cap-snatching2. Replication occurs through de novo initiation and involves a complementary RNA intermediate. Currently available structures of the influenza A and B virus polymerases include promoter RNA (the 5′ and 3′ termini of viral genome segments), showing FluPol in transcription pre-initiation states3,4. Here we report the structure of apo-FluPol from an influenza C virus, solved by X-ray crystallography to 3.9 Å, revealing a new ‘closed’ conformation. The apo-FluPol forms a compact particle with PB1 at its centre, capped on one face by PB2 and clamped between the two globular domains of P3. Notably, this structure is radically different from those of promoter-bound FluPols3,4. The endonuclease domain of P3 and the domains within the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of PB2 are completely rearranged. The cap-binding site is occluded by PB2, resulting in a conformation that is incompatible with transcription initiation. Thus, our structure captures FluPol in a closed, transcription pre-activation state. This reveals the conformation of newly made apo-FluPol in an infected cell, but may also apply to FluPol in the context of a non-transcribing ribonucleoprotein complex. Comparison of the apo-FluPol structure with those of promoter-bound FluPols allows us to propose a mechanism for FluPol activation. Our study demonstrates the remarkable flexibility of influenza virus RNA polymerase, and aids our understanding of the mechanisms controlling transcription and genome replication."
https://openalex.org/W2273229061,"Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. This study shows that the secreted factor GDF10 is a signal for the formation of new brain connections that lead to recovery after stroke and can be manipulated to enhance recovery and movement control in this disease. Stroke produces a limited process of neural repair. Axonal sprouting in cortex adjacent to the infarct is part of this recovery process, but the signal that initiates axonal sprouting is not known. Growth and differentiation factor 10 (GDF10) is induced in peri-infarct neurons in mice, non-human primates and humans. GDF10 promotes axonal outgrowth in vitro in mouse, rat and human neurons through TGFβRI and TGFβRII signaling. Using pharmacogenetic gain- and loss-of-function studies, we found that GDF10 produced axonal sprouting and enhanced functional recovery after stroke; knocking down GDF10 blocked axonal sprouting and reduced recovery. RNA sequencing from peri-infarct cortical neurons revealed that GDF10 downregulated PTEN, upregulated PI3 kinase signaling and induced specific axonal guidance molecules. Using unsupervised genome-wide association analysis of the GDF10 transcriptome, we found that it was not related to neurodevelopment, but may partially overlap with other CNS injury patterns. Thus, GDF10 is a stroke-induced signal for axonal sprouting and functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2265785955,"Replay of hippocampal place cell sequences has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory. However, the standard interpretation of replay has been challenged by reports that similar activity is observed before experience ('preplay'). By the preplay account, pre-existing temporal sequences are mapped onto new experiences without learning sequential structure. Here we employed high density recording methods to monitor hundreds of place cells simultaneously while rats explored multiple novel environments. While we observed large numbers of synchronous spiking events before experience, they were not temporally correlated with subsequent experience. Multiple measures differentiated pre-experience and postexperience events that, taken together, defined the latter but not the former as trajectory-depicting. The formation of events with these properties was prevented by administration of an NMDA-receptor antagonist during experience. These results suggest that the sequential structure of behavioral episodes is encoded during experience and reexpressed as trajectory events."
https://openalex.org/W1840470014,"Selective neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which, counterintuitively, are often caused by mutations in widely expressed genes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathies, for which there are no effective therapies. A subtype of these diseases--CMT type 2D (CMT2D)--is caused by dominant mutations in GARS, encoding the ubiquitously expressed enzyme glycyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (GlyRS). Despite the broad requirement of GlyRS for protein biosynthesis in all cells, mutations in this gene cause a selective degeneration of peripheral axons, leading to deficits in distal motor function. How mutations in GlyRS (GlyRS(CMT2D)) are linked to motor neuron vulnerability has remained elusive. Here we report that GlyRS(CMT2D) acquires a neomorphic binding activity that directly antagonizes an essential signalling pathway for motor neuron survival. We find that CMT2D mutations alter the conformation of GlyRS, enabling GlyRS(CMT2D) to bind the neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor. This aberrant interaction competitively interferes with the binding of the cognate ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to Nrp1. Genetic reduction of Nrp1 in mice worsens CMT2D symptoms, whereas enhanced expression of VEGF improves motor function. These findings link the selective pathology of CMT2D to the neomorphic binding activity of GlyRS(CMT2D) that antagonizes the VEGF-Nrp1 interaction, and indicate that the VEGF-Nrp1 signalling axis is an actionable target for treating CMT2D."
https://openalex.org/W2109323481,"Chemoproteomic studies have revealed that a Wnt-pathway inhibitor, CCT251545, is a potent and selective small-molecule chemical probe that inhibits the Mediator complex–associated protein kinases CDK8 and CDK19 through a type 1 binding mode and modulates the growth of Wnt-dependent tumors. There is unmet need for chemical tools to explore the role of the Mediator complex in human pathologies ranging from cancer to cardiovascular disease. Here we determine that CCT251545, a small-molecule inhibitor of the WNT pathway discovered through cell-based screening, is a potent and selective chemical probe for the human Mediator complex–associated protein kinases CDK8 and CDK19 with >100-fold selectivity over 291 other kinases. X-ray crystallography demonstrates a type 1 binding mode involving insertion of the CDK8 C terminus into the ligand binding site. In contrast to type II inhibitors of CDK8 and CDK19, CCT251545 displays potent cell-based activity. We show that CCT251545 and close analogs alter WNT pathway–regulated gene expression and other on-target effects of modulating CDK8 and CDK19, including expression of genes regulated by STAT1. Consistent with this, we find that phosphorylation of STAT1SER727 is a biomarker of CDK8 kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate in vivo activity of CCT251545 in WNT-dependent tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1872174515,"Viruses in the Reoviridae, like the triple-shelled human rotavirus and the single-shelled insect cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV), all package a genome of segmented double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) inside the viral capsid and carry out endogenous messenger RNA synthesis through a transcriptional enzyme complex (TEC). By direct electron-counting cryoelectron microscopy and asymmetric reconstruction, we have determined the organization of the dsRNA genome inside quiescent CPV (q-CPV) and the in situ atomic structures of TEC within CPV in both quiescent and transcribing (t-CPV) states. We show that the ten segmented dsRNAs in CPV are organized with ten TECs in a specific, non-symmetric manner, with each dsRNA segment attached directly to a TEC. The TEC consists of two extensively interacting subunits: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and an NTPase VP4. We find that the bracelet domain of RdRP undergoes marked conformational change when q-CPV is converted to t-CPV, leading to formation of the RNA template entry channel and access to the polymerase active site. An amino-terminal helix from each of two subunits of the capsid shell protein (CSP) interacts with VP4 and RdRP. These findings establish the link between sensing of environmental cues by the external proteins and activation of endogenous RNA transcription by the TEC inside the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1821115316,"Ubiquitylation is crucial for proper cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). If unrepaired, these highly cytotoxic lesions cause genome instability, tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration or premature ageing. Here, we conduct a comprehensive, multilayered screen to systematically profile all human ubiquitin E2 enzymes for impacts on cellular DSB responses. With a widely applicable approach, we use an exemplary E2 family, UBE2Ds, to identify ubiquitylation-cascade components downstream of E2s. Thus, we uncover the nuclear E3 ligase RNF138 as a key homologous recombination (HR)-promoting factor that functions with UBE2Ds in cells. Mechanistically, UBE2Ds and RNF138 accumulate at DNA-damage sites and act at early resection stages by promoting CtIP ubiquitylation and accrual. This work supplies insights into regulation of DSB repair by HR. Moreover, it provides a rich information resource on E2s that can be exploited by follow-on studies. Jackson and colleagues and Hendzel and colleagues reveal that the E3 ligase RNF138 functions in the repair of double-strand breaks by promoting CtIP accumulation and displacement of DNA-PK subunit Ku."
https://openalex.org/W2181106088,"Analysis of 501 melanoma exomes identified RASA2, encoding a RasGAP, as a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in 5% of melanomas. Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in RASA2 were found to increase RAS activation, melanoma cell growth and migration. RASA2 expression was lost in ≥30% of human melanomas and was associated with reduced patient survival. These findings identify RASA2 inactivation as a melanoma driver and highlight the importance of RasGAPs in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2146842287,"Cytosolic valosin-containing protein (p97(VCP)) is translocated to the ER membrane by binding to selenoprotein S (SelS), which is an ER membrane protein, during endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Selenoprotein K (SelK) is another known p97(VCP)-binding selenoprotein, and the expression of both SelS and SelK is increased under ER stress. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of SelS, SelK, and p97(VCP) during ERAD, the interaction of the selenoproteins with p97(VCP) was investigated using N2a cells and HEK293 cells. Both SelS and SelK co-precipitated with p97(VCP). However, the association between SelS and SelK did not occur in the absence of p97(VCP). SelS had the ability to recruit p97(VCP) to the ER membrane but SelK did not. The interaction between SelK and p97(VCP) did not occur in SelS knockdown cells, whereas SelS interacted with p97(VCP) in the presence or absence of SelK. These results suggest that p97(VCP) is first translocated to the ER membrane via its interaction with SelS, and then SelK associates with the complex on the ER membrane. Therefore, the interaction between SelK and p97(VCP) is SelS-dependent, and the resulting ERAD complex (SelS-p97(VCP)-SelK) plays an important role in ERAD and ER stress."

https://openalex.org/W2118823045,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a highly conserved signaling cascade that functions to alleviate stress and promote cell survival. If, however, the cell is unable to adapt and restore homeostasis, then the UPR activates pathways that promote apoptotic cell death. The molecular mechanisms governing the critical transition from adaptation and survival to initiation of apoptosis remain poorly understood. We aim to determine the role of hepatic Xbp1, a key mediator of the UPR, in controlling the adaptive response to ER stress in the liver. Liver-specific Xbp1 knockout mice (Xbp1(LKO)) and Xbp1(fl/fl) control mice were subjected to varying levels and durations of pharmacologic ER stress. Xbp1(LKO) and Xbp1(fl/fl) mice showed robust and equal activation of the UPR acutely after induction of ER stress. By 24 h, Xbp1(fl/fl) controls showed complete resolution of UPR activation and no liver injury, indicating successful adaptation to the stress. Conversely, Xbp1(LKO) mice showed ongoing UPR activation associated with progressive liver injury, apoptosis, and, ultimately, fibrosis by day 7 after induction of ER stress. These data indicate that hepatic XBP1 controls the adaptive response of the UPR and is critical to restoring homeostasis in the liver in response to ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2129622901,"Objectives Myostatin (MSTN), a member of TGF-β superfamily, is produced in the skeletal muscle to inhibit myocyte differentiation. MSTN expression is increased in the skeletal muscle in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia or in the protein energy wasting (PEW). This observation implies that the plasma MSTN level may be correlated with kidney function. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the association between the plasma MSTN concentration and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Subjects and Methods Subjects were 781 participants of a health examination performed in a rural area in Japan. Among them, 124 subjects were selected by stratified random sampling according to eGFR. Creatinine clearance (ClCr) by the Cockcroft-Gault equation was used as a measure of kidney function. Plasma concentration of MSTN was determined by ELISA. Results The plasma MSTN level was not different between men (3.42±1.61 ng/mL) and women (3.27±1.43 ng/mL). In a simple regression analysis, the MSTN level was significantly correlated with eGFR (r = -0.25, p<0.01) and ClCr (r = -0.20, p<0.05) but not with age and BMI. In a multiple linear regression analysis, the MSTN level showed a negative correlation with eGFR (standardized β = -0.31, p<0.01) and ClCr (standardized β = -0.35, p<0.01) under the adjustment with age, sex, BMI and LDL-C. Weak correlation was observed between the MSTN level and BMI / the serum LDL-C level. When the subjects were stratified into 4 groups according to eGFR, MSTN was significantly greater in the groups with the lowest and the 2nd lowest eGFR (3.55±1.79 and 3.76±1.75 ng/mL, respectively) than the level in the group with the highest eGFR (2.77±0.85 ng/mL). Conclusion Plasma MSTN level was elevated in an early stage of CKD, which could be involved in the progression of sarcopenia."

Wnt glycoproteins initiate Wnt signaling by interacting with the FZD CRD, as well as with the extracellular domains of LRP5/6 to form a Wnt/FZD/LRP complex. sFRPYs (secreted Frizzled-related proteins) inhibit Wnt signaling by blocking the interaction between Wnt proteins and FZD with a homologous CRD domain, demonstrating that FZD is a critical target for upstream Wnt signaling regulation (12.Bafico A.

Indeed, it was shown that a monoclonal antibody that targets the CRD domains of FZDs can block canonical Wnt signaling induced by Wnt ligands and is able to reduce the growth of different types of tumor (9.Gurney A.

Here, we report on the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the FZD8 CRD using a hybrid structure-based lead discovery approach that combined molecular modeling, biophysical methods, and a cell-based assay. The crystal structure of the CRD of mouse FZD8 has been reported, and mutagenesis studies identified the key residues for the FZD CRD binding to Wnt ligands (20.Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). A recent x-ray structure of Xenopus Wnt8 (XWnt8) in complex with the mouse FZD8 CRD confirmed that this site directly interacts with the XWnt8 ligand and plays a key role in mediating Wnt signaling (20.Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21.Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Based on the structural information, several hierarchical virtual screening (VS) simulations were conducted to select small molecule compounds that can target the Wnt binding site on the FZD8 CRD. We tested 120 top ranked compounds for their inhibitory activities of canonical Wnt signaling by using a cell-based luciferase reporter assay. Five compounds were shown to be strong inhibitors of canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling. In addition, using NMR spectroscopy, we confirmed that these small molecule compounds specifically bind, with low micromolar affinities, to the Wnt/FZD binding site on the FZD8 CRD. Our work demonstrates that interrupting the Wnt-FZD CRD interaction by small molecules from structure based drug discovery is of highly promising potential for the development of new therapeutics against diseases influenced by abnormal Wnt signaling. The Glide module in the Schrödinger package was used for the virtual screening of the CRD of mouse FZD8 (Frizzled8). Two small molecule databases, National Cancer Institute plate 2007 (containing 117,500 compounds) and ChemDiv (containing 1,414,174 compounds), were used for structure-based virtual screening. The ChemDiv database was prescreened using the UNITY module (Tripos) to identify compounds that are potentially compatible with the size and shape of the primary Wnt binding site on the mouse FZD8 CRD (21.Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This procedure reduced the database size of ChemDiv to 11,000 compounds. All selected compounds were prepared using the LIGPREP module in the Schrödinger package (Schrödinger, New York, NY). The pH was set at 7.5, and OPLS 2005 force field parameters were applied to all selected small molecules. The receptor model was derived from the mouse FZD8 CRD crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1IJY, chain A) (20.Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) with removal of all water molecules. The protein preparation script in MAESTRO (Schrödinger, New York, NY) was used to add polar hydrogen atoms, partial charges and fix errors in crystal structure. The molecular mechanics force field grids around the space of primary Wnt binding site were generated by Glide, and the virtual screening was performed by Glide with standard precision. The compounds with top predicted binding free energies and reasonable binding orientations within the defined active site were subsequently obtained from NCI and ChemDiv for further evaluation of the docking results (22.Shan J. Zheng J.J. Virtual ligand screening combined with NMR to identify Dvl PDZ domain inhibitors targeting the Wnt signaling.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 928: 17-28PubMed Google Scholar). A stable transfected cell line expressing Luciferase under a transcription factor (TCF)/LEF promoter was used. 3T3 cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10 mm HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded and grown overnight in a 96-well plate at 4 × 105 cells/ml confluences. Wnt3a and compounds (0–40 μm) were dissolved in DMEM (Invitrogen) assay media containing 0.5% FBS. The plate was divided between two sections: one with 50 ng/ml of Wnt3a and a control with the assay media. Cells were incubated with protein plus compound between 12 and 16 h before readings. Each experiment was performed in duplicate for each compound. The Promega (Madison, WI) ONE-GloTM + Tox luciferase reporter and cell viability assay kit was used to measure inhibition of Wnt signaling. In brief, cells were first incubated for 30 min with a cell-permeant fluorogenic substrate. In a living cell, the substrate is cleaved by a liver protease that results in emission of fluorescence. This was used to normalize for potential toxic effects of the ligands. After measuring cell viability, 5′-fluoroluciferin was added to the cells. In the cells, the fluoroluciferin is cleaved by luciferase, which emits luminescence. Both fluorescence and luminescence were measured using an EnVision® microplate reader. Analysis of inhibitors dose-response data and calculation of IC50 values were performed using the program Origin. Human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T) cells were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 10 × 104 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Cells were stimulated by Wnt3a conditioned medium supplemented with 10 μm individual compounds or DMSO (control) for 3 h. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay. Protein samples were dissolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellular membranes. Membranes were blocked by 5% nonfat milk and then incubated with anti-phosphor-LRP6 (S1490) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; catalog no. 2568s) (1:2000) overnight at 4 °C, followed by anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with TBST for three times at room temperature. Finally, phosphor-LRP6 band was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Tubulin was used as the loading control. ECL signal was calculated by using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software. The mouse FZD8 CRD (Ala28–Asp155) was subcloned into pET28a vector and was transformed into Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen). The cells were grown in MOPS media supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose as the source of nitrogen and carbon, respectively. The cells were grown to a A600 value of 0.5 ∼ 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 37 °C with 200 rpm. The target protein was expressed insolubly as inclusion bodies. To denature the target protein, the pellet of 1 liter of Escherichia coli cell culture was dissolved with 20 ml of 8 m urea with 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then was refolded by rapid dilution using 10 mm Tris, pH 9.0, with 50 mm Arg and 1 mm oxidized glutathione. The protein was further purified by HPLC and was dialyzed in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5 or 7.5) with 5 mm EDTA. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the purified 15N-labeled FZD8 CRD showed that the FZD8 CRD protein is folded (23.Holmen S.L. Robertson S.A. Zylstra C.R. Williams B.O. Wnt-independent activation of β-catenin mediated by a Dkk1-Fz5 fusion protein.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Octet RED instrument (FortéBio) was used to measure the interaction of mouse FZD8 CRD to the compounds identified from the both the VS and the cell-based assays. Super streptavidin (SSA) sensors were used to attach the biotinylated FZD8 CRD. Biotinylation of FZD8 CRD was made by incubating 100 μl of 2 mm EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 21335) with 1 ml of 8 μm FZD8 CRD in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 4 h on a rocking platform at room temperature. A desalting column was used to purify the biotylated-FZD8 CRD. Before experiments, the SSA sensors were preincubated for 10 min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, with 0.01% Tween 20, 5% DMSO, and 1 mg/ml BSA (assay buffer). The biotinylated proteins were attached to the SSA sensors for 10 min. The excess protein was removed by washing with assay buffer for 20 min. To determine the binding affinity of mouse FZD8 CRD to the five compounds, several concentrations of compounds were used. The association step for 50 s was followed by the dissociation step for 100 s. Biocytin-loaded SSA sensor without loading biotinylated protein was used as a control to correct the systematic optical artifacts and baseline drifts (24.Rana R. Carroll C.E. Lee H.J. Bao J. Marada S. Grace C.R. Guibao C.D. Ogden S.K. Zheng J.J. Structural insights into the role of the Smoothened cysteine-rich domain in Hedgehog signalling.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 25 °C with 1,000 rpm rotary shaking. The processed data were fitted locally with the integrated fitting function using the 1:1 binding model in Forté Bio analysis software (v6.4). The kinetic constants kon (on rate constant), koff (off rate constant), and KD were calculated from curve fitting. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO-d6 to make 10 mm stock solutions. To investigate physical properties, such as solubility and self-aggregation, of compounds in aqueous buffer, we made a series of samples with various compound concentrations in 50 mm potassium phosphate at two different pHs, pH 6.5 and 7.5, with 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% D2O, and 5% DMSO-d6. Because of the poor solubility of compounds, we were unable to make the desired concentration of 12.5–200 μm. We obtained one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of each compound at various desired concentrations. The peak intensity changes of resonance for each compound were examined to determine the solubility, as well as visual inspection of precipitation of compound in buffer. The solubility of compounds in the two different buffers was examined. All spectra were recorded using either 1H,15N-labeled or 1H-, 15N-, and 13C-labeled protein on Bruker Avance 600- or 800-MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with 1H/15N/13C detect, triple resonance cryogenic inverse probes at 25 or 32 °C. All spectra were processed using Topspin 3.0 NMR software (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using the program CARA (computer-aided resonance assignment). To assign the backbone chemical shift of mouse FZD8 CRD, 200 μm FZD8 CRD was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 10% D2O (v/v). We performed two-dimensional 1H-15N HQSC and three-dimensional HNCA, HNCOCA, CACB (CO)NH, HNCACB, and 15N NOESY (mix time = 120 ms) NMR experiments at 32 °C. Chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments were performed using 15N-labeled mouse FZD8 CRD. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (or 1H-15N fast HSQC) (25.Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. Improved sensitivity of HSQC spectra of exchanging protons at short interscan delays using a new fast HSQC (FHSQC) detection scheme that avoids water saturation.J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded as a function of concentration of compound. A stock solution of 10 mm compound was made in DMSO-d6 for use in NMR titration experiments. The concentration of DMSO in the NMR titration experiment was below 3%. A control experiment was done by titrating 5% DMSO, which did not show any structural change in this condition. The chemical shift perturbation (Δδ, ppm) of 1H and 15N resonances were obtained and weighted according to Equation 1. Δ Δ = ( Δ Δ H ) 2 + ( 0.2 * Δ Δ N ) 2 (Eq. 1) The atomic structure of the FZD8 CRD was reported previously, and the residues critical for mediating Wnt signaling were examined by mutagenesis experiments (20.Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It was shown that Xenopus Wnt8 (XWnt8) binds to a cavity formed by residues Ile46, Gly47, Tyr48, Ile95, Leu97, Gln141, Gly142, Asn143, Pro144, Asp145, Thr146, Leu147, Met149, Asp150, and Tyr151 of the mouse FZD8 CRD, which is located at the FZD8 CRD dimerization interface in the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1IJY). A recent x-ray structure of the Wnt-FZD CRD complex confirmed that this cavity directly binds to a loop structure known as the “index finger” region on the Wnt8 protein (21.Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Based on the available structural information, hierarchical structure-based VS utilizing the UNITY module in the SYBYL package (Tripos, Inc.) and Glide (Schrödinger) was performed. A chemical diversity (ChemDiv) library (containing ∼1,414,000 compounds) and a NCI 2007 plate library (containing ∼117,000 compounds) were searched for potential small molecule compounds that would bind to the FZD8 CRD Wnt binding site (26.Li X. Shan J. Chang W. Kim I. Bao J. Lee H.J. Zhang X. Samuel V.T. Shulman G.I. Liu D. Zheng J.J. Wu D. Chemical and genetic evidence for the involvement of Wnt antagonist Dickkopf2 in regulation of glucose metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 11402-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The initial predocking screening was performed by UNITY (Tripos, Inc.). A UNITY three-dimensional query was built by defining the hydrophobic region formed by residues Tyr48, Ile95, Leu97, Leu147, and Met149 (Fig. 1), all of which are critical for Wnt-FZD8 CRD binding. After searching both libraries using UNITY, ∼5,000 compounds were selected to be docked into the Wnt binding cavity using Glide. By visual inspection of bound conformations and comparing predicted binding free energies, we selected the top 40 candidate compounds from the ChemDiv library and the top 80 compounds from the NCI 2007 plate library as the initial virtual hits. These virtual hits had the best predicted binding free energies with reasonable bound conformations. Because the Wnt-FZD CRD interaction mediates canonical Wnt signaling from upstream of the pathway by directly binding to Wnt proteins, a compound competing with Wnt proteins by binding the FZD CRD with high affinity will reduce the Wnt-β-catenin signaling activity. Wnt3a is the best studied canonical Wnt ligand (27.Koval A.V. Vlasov P. Shichkova P. Khunderyakova S. Markov Y. Panchenko J. Volodina A. Kondrashov F.A. Katanaev V.L. Anti-leprosy drug clofazimine inhibits growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells via inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2014; 87: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test potential inhibitory effects of compounds selected from VS on Wnt-β-catenin signaling, we performed a luciferase-based screening assay on Wnt-3a mediated reporter gene activity in 3T3 cells (28.Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Zhang W. Liu B. Li L. Wu D. Zheng J. Structural basis of the recognition of the dishevelled DEP domain in the Wnt signaling pathway.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Initially, each compound was incubated at two different concentrations in 3T3 cells transfected with a Wnt3a-conditioned medium that activates the Wnt pathway. Of the 120 compounds tested, five compounds exhibited strong inhibition of Wnt3a-induced responses in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). We then explored the dose dependent inhibitory effect of each compound identified from initial screening in the same cell-based assay with compound concentration gradients up to 40 μm and accordingly calculated the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values. These results are summarized in Table 1. The results show that all five compounds have the capability to inhibit Wnt3a-induced β-signaling at the low micromolar range dose-dependently (Fig. 4) with compounds NSC36784 (Fig. 4D) and NSC654259 (Fig. 4E) being the most potent inhibitors.TABLE 1The IC50 value and binding affinity (KD) of compounds to mouse FZD8 CRD by cell-based assays and BLI assays, respectivelyCompoundsIC50aCell-based assays.

Open table in a new tab A critical event in canonical Wnt signaling is phosphorylation of the Wnt co-receptors, LRP5/6. Upon stimulation with Wnt, the intracellular domain LRP6 is phosphorylated at multiple sites including Thr1479, Ser1490, and Thr1493 (29.Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H.

Mol. life Sci. 2010; 67: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We therefore used the LRP6 phosphorylation as a marker to further assess the ability of the compounds to inhibit Wnt signaling. In HEK293T cells, increased phosphorylation level at Ser1490 of LRP6 could be clearly observed after Wnt3A treatment. When we added the compounds to the cell cultures, respectively, we found that comparing to the empty carrier, DMSO, all five compounds reduced phosphorylation of LRP6 at Ser1490 (Fig. 5) confirming that, indeed, all five compounds are inhibitors of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. To further evaluate the five compounds, we generated mouse FZD8 CRD and measured the dissociation constants (KD) of selected compounds to the FZD8 CRD by BLI experiments. To avoid the low solubility issue of some of the compounds, relatively low concentrations of the compounds were used in the experiments. For each compound binding to the biotinylated FZD8 CRD, the binding assays were repeated multiple times (all the experiments are reported in Fig. 6), and the average KD value of each was obtained (Table 1). All five compounds bound to the FZD8 CRD show KD values at low micromolar values, which is consistent with the outcomes of cell-based assay and NMR experiments. We then used NMR spectroscopy to study the interactions between the five compounds and the FZD8 CRD. Because the typical required sample concentration f"

The centrosome in animals constitutes the cell's microtubule-organizing center that nucleates spindle assembly, and is characterized by a symmetrical array of nine microtubule triplets emanating from a cartwheel structure in the very proximal region of the centriole. Biogenesis of centrioles requires many regulatory proteins, including SAS-6, SAS-4/CPAP, and BLD10/CEP135, which are thought to constitute the core ancestral module involved in centriole assembly (1.Carvalho-Santos Z.

Trypanosoma brucei, a flagellated protozoan and the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, does not have centrosomes, but it possesses the basal body as its microtubule-organizing center to nucleate the assembly of a motile flagellum. The basal body is characterized by an array of nine microtubule triplets, with the conserved SAS-6 protein forming the cartwheel structure (10.Hu H. Liu Y. Zhou Q. Siegel S. Li Z.

Trypanosomatids, a group of kinetoplastid parasites consisting of T. brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania spp., appear in a variety of different morphological forms during their life cycle and are distinguished by the relative position of the kinetoplast (mitochondrial DNA) and the nucleus and by the position, length, and cell body attachment of the flagellum (26.Hoare C.A. Wallace F.G. Developmental stages of trypanosomatid flagellates: a new terminology.Nature. 1966; 212: 1385-1386Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the tsetse fly vector, T. brucei differentiates from the trypomastigote form to the epimastigote form, which undergoes asymmetrical cell division to produce a long epimastigote cell and a short epimastigote cell (26.Hoare C.A. Wallace F.G. Developmental stages of trypanosomatid flagellates: a new terminology.Nature. 1966; 212: 1385-1386Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar). How life cycle transitions in T. brucei are regulated is largely unknown, but recent work has begun to uncover the regulators involved in this process. ALBA3 and ALBA4, two closed related RNA-binding proteins, are the first factors found to be involved in life cycle transitions in T. brucei (27.Subota I. Rotureau B. Blisnick T. Ngwabyt S.

Another RNA-binding protein, RBP6, is also required for driving the transition from trypomastigotes to epimastigotes (28.Kolev N.G. Ramey-Butler K. Cross G.A. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Developmental progression to infectivity in Trypanosoma brucei triggered by an RNA-binding protein.Science. 2012; 338: 1352-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These discoveries highlight the regulation of life cycle transitions via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Recently, two flagellar proteins, ClpGM6 and FLAM3 (15.Hayes P. Varga V. Olego-Fernandez S.

Cell. 2015; 26: 3013-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were also reported to be required for life cycle transitions in T. brucei, suggesting that modulation of flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures also drives life cycle transitions. Here, we report that the SAS-4 homolog in T. brucei, TbSAS-4, plays a surprising role in life cycle transitions. Unlike its orthologs in metazoa and other flagellated and ciliated organisms, TbSAS-4 is not detectable in the basal body but, instead, is concentrated at the distal tip of the FAZ filament, where it associates with multiple FAZ tip proteins. Consistent with its localization to the FAZ tip, TbSAS-4 promotes the elongation of the newly synthesized FAZ filament during the cell cycle, thereby positioning the newly assembled basal body toward the cell posterior and maintaining trypomastigote cell morphology. The procyclic 29-13 cell line (31.Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. A tightly regulated inducible expression system for conditional gene knock-outs and dominant-negative genetics in Trypanosoma brucei.Mol. Biochem.

Cells were routinely diluted when the cell density reaches 5 × 106 cells/ml. For RNAi of TbSAS-4, a 464-bp DNA fragment from the coding region of TbSAS-4 was cloned into the pZJM vector (32.Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei gene expression by RNA interference using an integratable vector with opposing T7 promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was electroporated into the 29-13 cell line according to the previous procedure (10.Hu H. Liu Y. Zhou Q. Siegel S. Li Z. The centriole cartwheel protein SAS-6 in Trypanosoma brucei is required for probasal body biogenesis and flagellum assembly.Eukaryot. Cell. 2015; 14: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Successful transfectants were selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Cells were cloned by limiting dilution in a 96-well plate in SDM-79 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and all three antibiotics. At least three clonal cell lines were selected for further analysis. To induce RNAi, the clonal cell lines were induced with 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cell growth was monitored daily by counting the number of cells with a hemocytometer and plotted against the time of RNAi induction. A 948-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the C-terminal coding region (amino acids 617–932) of TbSAS-4 was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA and cloned into the pET26 vector for expressing a hexahistidine-fused TbSAS-4 truncation protein in Escherichia coli. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, and recombinant His-tagged TbSAS-4 truncation protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C, purified through a nickel column, and used for immunizing rabbit to produce anti-TbSAS-4 antibody at Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA). Crude anti-serum was used directly for immunofluorescence microscopy. For endogenous epitope tagging of TbSAS-4-binding partners and near neighbors, the DNA fragment corresponding to the C-terminal coding region of each of these genes was cloned into the pC-3HA-PAC vector. The resulting construct was linearized by digestion within the gene fragment with appropriate restriction enzymes, electroporated into the cell line harboring the TbSAS-4 RNAi construct, and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin in addition to 15 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution in a 96-well plate containing SDM-79 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and all four antibiotics. Cells were washed once with PBS, settled onto glass coverslips for 20 min, fixed with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 30 min, and then rehydrated with PBS. Coverslips were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The following primary antibodies were used: FITC-conjugated anti-HA mAb (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), L8C4 (anti-PFR2 mAb, 1:50 dilution) (33.Kohl L. Sherwin T. Gull K.

Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 3848-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and YL 1/2 (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore). After washing the coverslips three times with PBS, coverslips were incubated with FITC- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and then mounted with DAPI-containing VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Slides were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (model Orca-ER, Hamamatsu) and a PlanApo N 60 × 1.42-NA differential interference contrast objective. Images were acquired using the SlideBook 5 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). The full-length coding sequence of TbSAS-4 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA, and then cloned into the pLew100-BirA*-HA vector, which was generated by cloning the BirA*-HA into the pLew100 vector for expressing BirA*-HA-tagged TbSAS-4. The construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into the 29-13 cell line. Transfectants were selected with 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin and then cloned by limiting dilution as described above. Expression of TbSAS-4-BirA*-HA was induced by incubating the cells with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and then verified by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody and anti-TbSAS-4 antibody and by immunofluorescence microscopy with FITC-conjugated anti-HA antibody. Affinity purification of biotinylated proteins was carried out essentially as described previously (35.Morriswood B. Havlicek K. Demmel L. Yavuz S. Sealey-Cardona M. Vidilaseris K. Anrather D. Kostan J. Djinovic-Carugo K. Roux K.J. Warren G. Novel bilobe components in Trypanosoma brucei identified using proximity-dependent biotinylation.Eukaryot. Cell. 2013; 12: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, TbSAS-4-BirA*-HA was overexpressed by induction with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h, and cells (∼5 × 109) were incubated with 50 μm biotin for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with PBS, and then treated with PEME buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cytosolic (soluble) and cytoskeletal (pellet) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 3,200 × g for 10 min. The cytoskeletal fraction was further extracted with lysis buffer (0.4% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 30 min, and solubilized materials were collected by centrifugation. Both the cytosolic extract and the cytoskeletal extract were incubated with 500 μl of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen), which were pre-washed with PBS, at 4 °C for 4 h. The Dynabeads were then washed extensively with PBS. The non-induced control cells (∼2.5 × 109) were similarly treated and included as the negative control. For mass spectrometry, the Dynabeads were washed five times with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate before resuspended in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. 10% DTT was then added to reduce the disulfide bond, and subsequently 50% iodoacetamide was added for alkylation. 5% DTT was then added to the solution, and proteins were digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to approximately pH 2.0. The digests were desalted, and then analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC 2D plus cHiPLC system (Eksigent Technologies) at the Proteomics Core Facility of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Data analysis was performed according to our published methods (17.Zhou Q. Hu H. He C.Y. Li Z. Assembly and maintenance of the flagellum attachment zone filament in Trypanosoma brucei.J.

Raw data files were searched against the T. brucei genome database using the Mascot search engine. The search conditions used peptide tolerance of 10 ppm and MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da with the enzyme trypsin and two missed cleavages. Previous comprehensive analyses of centriole/basal body components conserved in eukaryotes (1.Carvalho-Santos Z. Machado P. Branco P. Tavares-Cadete F. Rodrigues-Martins A. Pereira-Leal J.B.

Langdale J.A. Gull K. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the centriole from protein components.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) showed that the T. brucei genome encodes a conserved SAS-4 homolog (Tb927.11.3300), which we named TbSAS-4, but the function of TbSAS-4 is unknown. TbSAS-4 possesses several coiled coil motifs at its N terminus and a conserved TCP10-like domain and a highly conserved G-box motif at its C terminus, which are in the same order as in its human ortholog CPAP (Fig. 1A). Alignment of the G-box motif between TbSAS-4 and human CPAP (HsCPAP) identified 47% identity and 77% similarity in this motif between the two proteins (Fig. 1B). TbSAS-4 exhibits sequence similarity to the SAS-4 proteins from many organisms, but is closely related to the putative SAS-4 protein from T. cruzi and Leishmania major (1.Carvalho-Santos Z. Machado P. Branco P. Tavares-Cadete F. Rodrigues-Martins A. Pereira-Leal J.B. Bettencourt-Dias M. Stepwise evolution of the centriole-assembly pathway.J.

Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the centriole from protein components.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of TbSAS-4, a polyclonal antibody against TbSAS-4 was raised in rabbit and used for immunofluorescence microscopy. Surprisingly, TbSAS-4 was not detected in the basal body at any cell cycle stages. Instead, it was concentrated at the distal tip of the FAZ filament, which was labeled by the anti-FAZ1 antibody L3B2 (Fig. 1C). The localization of TbSAS-4 to the distal tip of the FAZ filament was further confirmed by co-immunostaining with the 1B41 antibody (34.Gallo J.M. Précigout E. Schrével J. Subcellular sequestration of an antigenically unique β-tubulin.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 9: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which detects the microtubule quartet that associates with the FAZ filament (Fig. 1D). The unusual localization of TbSAS-4 to the FAZ tip suggests that TbSAS-4 may play roles in the FAZ filament. To investigate the function of TbSAS-4, we carried out RNAi in the procyclic form of T. brucei. Western blotting with anti-TbSAS-4 antibody showed that upon RNAi induction, TbSAS-4 was reduced to ∼15% of the control level at day 2 of RNAi induction (Fig. 2A). This knockdown caused severe growth defects (Fig. 2B), suggesting that TbSAS-4 is essential for cell proliferation in the procyclic form. To further characterize the defects, we tabulated the cells for the numbers of nucleus and kinetoplast, and the results showed that depletion of TbSAS-4 resulted in the accumulation of cells of various karyotypes, including anucleate cells containing only the kinetoplast (0N1K), bi-nucleate cells with a single kinetoplast (2N1K), multi-nucleate (>2 nuclei) cells with a single kinetoplast (XN1K), two kinetoplasts (XN2K), or multiple (>2) kinetoplasts (XNXK) (Fig. 2C). The defects caused by TbSAS-4 RNAi were strikingly different from that caused by TbSAS-6 RNAi, which led to the accumulation of 2N1K cells initially and XN1K cells subsequently due to inhibition of basal body duplication (10.Hu H. Liu Y. Zhou Q. Siegel S. Li Z. The centriole cartwheel protein SAS-6 in Trypanosoma brucei is required for probasal body biogenesis and flagellum assembly.Eukaryot. Cell. 2015; 14: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although TbSAS-4 RNAi also produced 2N1K cells (Fig. 2C), they were derived from the asymmetrical division of 2N2K cells, which also produced 0N1K cells (see below). These results suggest that TbSAS-4 is not required for basal body duplication in T. brucei, consistent with the fact that TbSAS-4 is not detectable in the basal body at any stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 1). Intriguingly, after TbSAS-4 depletion for 2 days, cell morphology appeared to be altered. The 1N1K cells from the TbSAS-4 RNAi-induced cell population became heterogeneous in size: a significant cell population became smaller in size and contained a longer unattached flagellum (Fig. 2 D and E). Notably, the kinetoplast and the basal body in these smaller-sized 1N1K cells were juxtaposed or were anterior to the nucleus (Fig. 2, D and E), which is reminiscent of an epimastigote-like morphology. Similarly, positioning of the kinetoplast and the basal body to the anterior region of the nucleus was also observed in 1N2K and 2N2K cells after TbSAS-4 RNAi for 2 days (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that TbSAS-4 is involved in controlling life cycle transitions in T. brucei. The generation of epimastigote-like cells upon TbSAS-4 RNAi indicates that the FAZ filament may be shortened, as in the cases of ClpGM6 RNAi (15.Hayes P. Varga V. Olego-Fernandez S. Sunter J.

Post-operative [18F]FET-PET was compared with MRI, intra-operative assessment and clinical follow-up.[18F]FET-PET, MRI and intra-operative assessment consistently revealed complete resection in 12/25 (48%) patients and incomplete resection in 6/25 cases (24%).

The dopamine transporter carries an endogenous binding site for Zn2+, but the nature of the Zn2+-dependent modulation has remained elusive: both, inhibition and stimulation of DAT have been reported. Here, we exploited the high time resolution of patch-clamp recordings to examine the effects of Zn2+ on the transport cycle of DAT: we recorded peak currents associated with substrate translocation and steady-state currents reflecting the forward transport mode of DAT. Zn2+ depressed the peak current but enhanced the steady-state current through DAT. The parsimonious explanation is preferential binding of Zn2+ to the outward facing conformation of DAT, which allows for an allosteric activation of DAT, in both, the forward transport mode and substrate exchange mode. We directly confirmed that Zn2+ dissociated more rapidly from the inward- than from the outward-facing state of DAT. Finally, we formulated a kinetic model for the action of Zn2+ on DAT that emulated all current experimental observations and accounted for all previous (in part contradictory) findings.

The dopamine transporter (DAT 2The abbreviations used are: DATdopamine transporterADHDattention deficit hyperactivity disorderHEK-293 cellshuman embryonic kidney cells 293. , SLC6A3) terminates synaptic transmission by reuptake of extracellular dopamine into the presynaptic neuron. The transport cycle of DAT is consistent with the alternating access model (1Kristensen A.S. Andersen J. Jørgensen T.N. Sørensen L. Eriksen J. Loland C.J. Strømgaard K. Gether U. SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters: structure, function, and regulation.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 585-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar): the transporter presents a substrate-binding site to the extracellular side of the membrane; upon binding of substrate and co-substrates (Na+ and Cl−), conformational changes occlude the extracellular access pathway and expose the solutes to the intracellular space. This results in their transport into the cell. Subsequently, the transporter returns to the outward facing conformation. This reaction is assumed to be the rate-limiting step of dopamine transport (2Erreger K. Grewer C. Javitch J.A. Galli A.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Crystallographic investigations of bacterial transporters, in conjunction with computational modeling, provide compelling evidence in support of this general mechanism (3Krishnamurthy H.

The crystal structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter (dDAT) confirmed that insights from these bacterial SLC6 transporter homologs can be extrapolated to SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters (6Penmatsa A.

DAT and its close relatives, i.e. the transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine, are targets of several psychoactive substances. These chemically diverse ligands are used for both, therapeutic and recreational purposes, and can be classified with respect to their mode of action on DAT (1Kristensen A.S. Andersen J. Jørgensen T.N. Sørensen L. Eriksen J. Loland C.J. Strømgaard K. Gether U. SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters: structure, function, and regulation.Pharmacol.

They act as substrates (e.g. amphetamines), competitive inhibitors (e.g. cocaine), or non-competitive inhibitors (e.g. ibogaine), and have in common that they increase extracellular dopamine concentrations because they reduce the net-uptake of dopamine into the cell (1Kristensen A.S.

However there is one notable exception: Zn2+, which is an endogenous allosteric modulator of DAT. The mode of Zn2+ binding has been elucidated; it binds DAT at an extracellular site, which is coordinated by four residues (10Stockner T. Montgomery T.R. Kudlacek O. Weissensteiner R. Ecker G.F.

The effect of Zn2+ on the function of DAT, however, has remained enigmatic. Both, inhibition and activation of DAT were observed, depending on the experimental assay employed. Originally, Zn2+ was found to inhibit substrate uptake (8Jacobs M.T. Zhang Y.W. Campbell S.D. Rudnick G. Ibogaine, a noncompetitive inhibitor of serotonin transport, acts by stabilizing the cytoplasm-facing state of the transporter.J. Biol.

Zinc potentiates an uncoupled anion conductance associated with the dopamine transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49671-49679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, Zn2+ potentiated dopamine-induced currents through DAT. This is inconsistent with reduced substrate influx (11Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. Defining proximity relationships in the tertiary structure of the dopamine transporter. Identification of a conserved glutamic acid as a third coordinate in the endogenous Zn(2+)-binding site.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In fact, Zn2+ was subsequently shown to either inhibit or stimulate [3H]dopamine uptake in heterologous expression systems, depending on the selected cell line (13Pifl C. Wolf A. Rebernik P. Reither H. Berger M.L. Zinc regulates the dopamine transporter in a membrane potential and chloride dependent manner.Neuropharmacology. 2009; 56: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is evident that these findings are difficult to reconcile. Here, we examined the hypothesis that Zn2+ exerts an allosteric effect on the transport cycle of DAT. Based on our observations, we provide a mechanistic framework, which accounts for all reported actions of Zn2+. Most importantly, we show that the kinetics of the transport cycle dictate an intricate coupling between the allosteric effect of Zn2+ and the intracellular Na+ concentration: at low [Na+]i binding of Zn2+ affords accelerated cycling, but at high [Na+]i it acts as a brake. Patch-clamp recordings were performed with HEK-293 cells stably expressing human DAT (hDAT). The cells were seeded at low density 24 h before recordings. Substrate-induced hDAT currents were recorded under voltage clamp using the whole-cell configuration. Briefly, glass pipettes were filled with a solution consisting of 133 mm K-gluconate, 5.9 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Substrate-induced peak currents were isolated using an internal solution comprising 152 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH), which eliminated the steady current component. For some measurements we used a solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH). The cells were continuously superfused with external solution (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Currents were recorded at room temperature (20–24 °C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 10.2 software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Cells were voltage-clamped to a holding potential of −60 mV or 0 mV and the washout period following dopamine application was 30 s in all cases. Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1320A (MDS Analytical Technologies). Drugs were applied using a DAD-12 (Adams & List, Westbury, NY), which permits complete solution exchange around the cells within 100 ms (14Sucic S. Dallinger S. Zdrazil B. Weissensteiner R.

Chem. 2010; 285: 10924-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Current amplitudes in response to application of dopamine or the combination of dopamine and Zn2+ were quantified using Clampfit 10.2 software. Passive holding currents were subtracted and the traces were filtered using a 100 Hz digital Gaussian low-pass filter. Membranes were prepared from a defined number of stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing human DAT. The binding reaction was carried out as described previously (15Boehm S. ATP stimulates sympathetic transmitter release via presynaptic P2X purinoceptors.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 737-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): briefly, the assay volume was 0.1 ml, the membranes (corresponding to about 1–1.5 × 104* cells/reaction) were incubated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and [3H]CFT (specific activity: 80 Ci/mmol; 6 to 7 concentrations covering the range of 3 to 120 nm) for 30 min at 20 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm mazindol. The recorded currents were emulated with a previously published kinetic model of the transport cycle of DAT (2Erreger K. Grewer C. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Currents in response to rapid concentration jumps of amphetamine uncover novel aspects of human dopamine transporter function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This model was extended to account for binding of Zn2+ to DAT. The time-dependent changes in state occupancies were evaluated by numerical integration of the resulting system of differential equations using Systems Biology Toolbox (16Schmidt H. Jirstrand M. Systems Biology Toolbox for MATLAB: a computational platform for research in systems biology.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 514-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and Matlab 2012a (Mathworks). The voltage-dependence of individual rates were modeled according to Laeuger (17Laeuger P. Electrogenic Ion Pumps. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar) assuming a symmetric barrier as kij = k0ijexp(−zQijFV/2RT), with F = 96485 Cmol−1, r = 8.314 JK−1 mol−1 and V the membrane voltage in volts and T = 293 K. The extra- and intracellular ion concentrations were set to the values used in the experiments. Substrate uptake was modeled as (TiClS × kSioff-TiCl × Si × kSion + TiClSZn × kSioff-TiClZn × Si × kSion) × NC/NA. Where NC is the number of transporters and NA is the Avogadro constant. Currents were simulated assuming a transporter density of 25 × 106/cell. We analyzed the action of Zn2+ on distinct partial reactions of the transport cycle by capitalizing on the high temporal resolution of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. We selected stably transfected HEK293 cells, which expressed the human DAT to high levels; the number of DAT molecules was estimated in saturation binding experiments of [3H]CFT and amounted to 27 ± 3.9 × 106 transporters/cell. Upon rapid substrate application, HEK293 cells expressing hDAT exhibit an inwardly directed current that comprises two components, a transient peak current and a steady-state current (Fig. 1A). These currents have been assigned to distinct events in the transport cycle: the peak current has been attributed to the conformational rearrangement that carries substrate through the membrane. The steady-state current is assumed to originate predominantly from the conversion of empty inward facing transporters to the outward facing conformation (2Erreger K. Grewer C. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Currents in response to rapid concentration jumps of amphetamine uncover novel aspects of human dopamine transporter function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In other words, the peak current can be used to study substrate translocation, whereas the steady-state current reads out the forward transport mode. Fig. 1A shows a typical current elicited by fast application of 10 μm dopamine to a HEK-293 cell stably expressing DAT. The current was measured in the presence of physiological ion gradients, and the membrane potential was clamped to −60 mV. Application of 10 μm dopamine elicited the initial peak current (see inset to Fig. 1A), which was followed by the sustained steady-state current mentioned above. The steady-state current deactivated upon removal of dopamine from the bath solution. The magnitude of the steady-state current depended on the concentration of dopamine: i.e. it was close to saturation at 30 μm (Fig. 1B). The concentration-response curve was adequately described by a saturation hyperbola. The EC50 values in the presence and absence of Zn2+ were 1.48 μm [1.33 μm-1.64 μm], 0.77 μm [0.67 μm-0.88 μm], respectively. We verified that Zn2+ did not change the current-voltage-relation of the steady-state current through DAT by recording currents between −60 and +30 mV. At potentials more positive than +30 mV, excessive noise precluded further analysis. The currents were induced by application of 30 μm dopamine; the current amplitudes were normalized to the amplitude measured at −60 mV and plotted as a function of voltage: It is evident from Fig. 1C that (i) the current-voltage-relation of the dopamine-induced steady-state current was linear over the explored voltage range and (ii) that it was not affected by Zn2+. Fig. 2A shows representative traces of currents induced by 30 μm dopamine in the presence and absence of 10 μm Zn2+. Binding of Zn2+ to DAT changed the following properties of the dopamine-induced current: (i) it increased the steady-state current (inset to Fig. 2, A and B) consistent with previous reports, which documented potentiation of dopamine-induced currents by extracellular Zn2+ (18Meinild A.K. Sitte H.H. Gether U. Zinc potentiates an uncoupled anion conductance associated with the dopamine transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49671-49679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Pifl C. Rebernik P. Kattinger A. Reither H. Zn2+ modulates currents generated by the dopamine transporter: parallel effects on amphetamine-induced charge transfer and release.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and (ii) decreased the peak current (Fig. 2C). (iii) Moreover, the current deactivated more rapidly in the presence of Zn2+. The latter finding suggests that the DAT/Zn2+ complex relaxes faster to its original state (ToNaClZn: see model described below). We tested this conjecture directly by monitoring the time course of peak current recovery after dopamine application and subsequent washout. For these measurements, we exploited the fact that the peak current amplitude is proportional to the number of transporters available for dopamine binding. Thus, the peak current amplitude provides a read-out for occupancy of the outward facing conformation (ToNaCl and ToNaClZn). Similarly, the time course of peak current recovery allows for estimating the time required for the transporter to return to the outward facing conformation. We applied 30 μm dopamine for 0.5 s and subsequently removed dopamine from the bath solution for 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.5, and 2 s, respectively. We then re-applied 30 μm dopamine to determine the fraction of transporters that had returned to ToNaCl/ToNaClZn and were therefore available to support another peak current. It is evident from Fig. 2, D and E that peak current amplitudes increased in magnitude as a function of the dopamine-free interval. In Fig. 2F, this time course of recovery is plotted in the presence and absence of 10 μm Zn2+: the data were well described by a mono-exponential function. The fit yielded time constants of 0.29 s (0.26–0.33 s) and 0.72 s (0.67–0.78 s) in the presence and absence of Zn2+. The time course of recovery is a measure of the turnover rate of DAT, i.e. the time needed to complete one conformational cycle. Thus, the analysis yields a turnover rate of DAT in the absence of Zn2+ of 1.45 s−1 (versus 3.45 s−1 in the presence of Zn2+). This rate agrees well with earlier estimates (2Erreger K. Grewer C. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Currents in response to rapid concentration jumps of amphetamine uncover novel aspects of human dopamine transporter function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Sonders M.S. Zhu S.J. Zahniser N.R. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Multiple ionic conductances of the human dopamine transporter: the actions of dopamine and psychostimulants.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 960-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observations therefore suggest that the turnover rate of DAT is larger in the Zn2+-bound state. This interpretation, however, disagrees with studies, which documented inhibition of substrate uptake by Zn2+ (11Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. Defining proximity relationships in the tertiary structure of the dopamine transporter. Identification of a conserved glutamic acid as a third coordinate in the endogenous Zn(2+)-binding site.J.

Delineation of an zinc-binding site in the human dopamine transporter.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The analysis of the Zn2+ action on the peak current by DAT is hampered by the confounding presence of the steady-state current. Therefore, we measured the peak current in the absence of the steady-state current. This can be achieved by using high intracellular Na+ concentrations ([Na+]i: 150 mm) (2Erreger K. Grewer C. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Currents in response to rapid concentration jumps of amphetamine uncover novel aspects of human dopamine transporter function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Hasenhuetl P.S. Schicker K. Koenig X. Li Y. Sarker S. Stockner T. Sucic S. Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Sandtner W. Ligand Selectivity among the Dopamine and Serotonin Transporters Specified by the Forward Binding Reaction.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 88: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An intracellular concentration of 150 mm Na+ favors rebinding of Na+ to the inward facing transporter, thus precluding progression through the transport cycle. This eliminates the steady-state current, but keeps the peak current intact. Fig. 3A shows typical current traces. Shown are representative peak currents elicited by 30 μm dopamine measured at 0 mV before and after application of 0.1, 1, and 10 μm Zn2+. Zn2+ reduced the peak current amplitude. The magnitude of the effect is quantified for 6 independent recordings on different cells in Fig. 3B. Importantly, the inhibition by Zn2+ exceeded that seen in the measurements summarized in Fig. 2C: when the currents were measured in the presence of 6 mm Na+i, 10 μm Zn2+ reduced the peak current by only 30%. In contrast at 150 mm Na+i, 10 μm Zn2+ reduced the peak by ∼70%. This suggests that Na+i rendered the process that gives rise to the peak current more sensitive to Zn2+. We then investigated whether Na+i also alters the Zn2+ action on the steady-state current. For this purpose, we set [Na+]i to 50 mm. As predicted, the steady-state current was lower at 50 mm Na+i than at 6 mm Na+i, because the progress through the cycle was impeded. More importantly, however, under these conditions, 10 μm Zn2+ led to a reduction of the steady-state current (Fig. 3, C and D). This contrasts with the observed current potentiation at 6 mm Na+i (see Fig. 2, A and B). It has been proposed that Zn2+ binds to the outward facing state of DAT with higher affinity than to the inward facing state (10Stockner T. Montgomery T.R. Kudlacek O. Weissensteiner R. Ecker G.F. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. Mutational analysis of the high-affinity zinc binding site validates a refined human dopamine transporter homology model.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9: e1002909Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Generation of an activating Zn(2+) switch in the dopamine transporter: mutation of an intracellular tyrosine constitutively alters the conformational equilibrium of the transport cycle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To verify this conjecture by an experimental approach, we designed a protocol to measure the dissociation rate of Zn2+ from the outward facing conformation (Fig. 4A) and a complementary protocol (Fig. 4C) for the inward facing conformation. For the former, we relied on peak current suppression by Zn2+ (see Fig. 2), which is expected to vanish upon Zn2+ dissociation. In the protocol depicted in Fig. 4A, we exposed cells to Zn2+ for 5 s and subsequently measured the recovery of the peak current as a function of the time interval of Zn2+ washout. The time course of peak current recovery was adequately described by mono-exponential rise (Fig. 4B) and thus provided a measure of the dissociation rate of Zn2+ (τ = 1.57 s). However, the modest peak current reduction by Zn2+ (∼20–30%) limited the dynamic range of this measurement. This is reflected by the large 95% confidence interval for the time constant estimated by the fit 1.57s (1.06–3.01 s). These measurements were conducted with physiological ion gradients in place, a condition at which DAT was shown to adopt the outward facing conformation. Hence, the measured rate most likely represents the dissociation rate of Zn2+ from the outward facing conformation. The other protocol to measure Zn2+ dissociation is shown in Fig. 4C. Here, we first applied 30 μm dopamine to induce a current. After 5 s, 10 μm Zn2+ was co-applied; this led to the expected potentiation of the steady-state current. Subsequently, Zn2+ was removed from the solution and the steady-state current relaxed to its initial amplitude. The time course of this relaxation is another measure of Zn2+ dissociation (Fig. 4C, inset) and it was well described by a mono-exponential function. The estimated time constant for Zn2+ dissociation under this condition was 0.21 s ± 0.06 s (Fig. 4C). Thus, this time constant (for relaxation of steady-state current) is ∼10 times smaller than the one obtained by measuring recovery of peak current. This second protocol differs considerably from the first, because upon dopamine binding, DAT enters the transport cycle. Accordingly, under this condition, the transporter visits all conformations within the transport cycle, including those that are inward facing. The faster rate of Zn2+ dissociation observed with the latter protocol is therefore consistent with the idea that Zn2+ dissociates faster from the inward facing conformation of DAT. It is evident that the dopamine test pulses employed in the first protocol (peak current recovery) elicit currents that display a mixed response: while the peak current suppression by Zn2+ was still observed in test pulses following a Zn2+ free interval of 2 s, the two other effects by Zn2+ (current potentiation and accelerated current deactivation) were not observed in any of the test pulses including those following the shortest Zn2+ free interval (0.2 s, see Fig. 4A). This differential effect is consistent with the fast Zn2+ dissociation observed in the second protocol, i.e. under the condition, where DAT is allowed to undergo the transport cycle to generate the steady state current. Meinild and coworkers showed that application of dopamine together with Zn2+ gave rise to a larger depolarization than dopamine alone when the membrane voltage was measured in unclamped Xenopus laevis oocytes (18Meinild A.K. Sitte H.H. Gether U. Zinc potentiates an uncoupled anion conductance associated with the dopamine transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49671-49679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We reproduced this finding in unclamped HEK293 cells stably expressing DAT. However, the average difference in voltage (VDA&Zn2+ − VDA) was only ∼6 mV (Fig. 5, A and B). This may contribute to the reported inhibitory action of Zn2+ on cellular substrate uptake, but it is unlikely to account for its reported magnitude (i.e. by 50%). Given our measured current-voltage-relation (see Fig. 1C), a change by 6 mV is predicted to only modestly affect substrate uptake by DAT.

https://openalex.org/W2098026426,"Photosystems (PS) I and II activities depend on their light-harvesting capacity and trapping efficiency, which vary in different environmental conditions. For optimal functioning, these activities need to be balanced. This is achieved by redistribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems via the association and disassociation of light-harvesting complexes (LHC) II, in a process known as state transitions. Here we study the effect of LHCII binding to PSI on its absorption properties and trapping efficiency by comparing time-resolved fluorescence kinetics of PSI-LHCI and PSI-LHCI-LHCII complexes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. PSI-LHCI-LHCII of C. reinhardtii is the largest PSI supercomplex isolated so far and contains seven Lhcbs, in addition to the PSI core and the nine Lhcas that compose PSI-LHCI, together binding ∼320 chlorophylls. The average decay time for PSI-LHCI-LHCII is ∼65 ps upon 400 nm excitation (15 ps slower than PSI-LHCI) and ∼78 ps upon 475 nm excitation (27 ps slower). The transfer of excitation energy from LHCII to PSI-LHCI occurs in ∼60 ps. This relatively slow transfer, as compared with that from LHCI to the PSI core, suggests loose connectivity between LHCII and PSI-LHCI. Despite the relatively slow transfer, the overall decay time of PSI-LHCI-LHCII remains fast enough to assure a 96% trapping efficiency, which is only 1.4% lower than that of PSI-LHCI, concomitant with an increase of the absorption cross section of 47%. This indicates that, at variance with PSII, the design of PSI allows for a large increase of its light-harvesting capacities.

In eukaryotic organisms, the photosynthetic apparatus contains two main pigment-protein complexes, embedded in the thylakoid membrane, Photosystems (PS) 2The abbreviations used are:PSPhotosystemLHClight-harvesting complexRCreaction centerChlchlorophyllDASdecay-associated spectraSASspecies-associated spectra. I and II, that harvest light energy and convert it into chemical energy (1.Blankenship R.E. Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Blackwell, Hoboken, NJ2014Google Scholar). The PS performances are largely determined by their capacities to harvest light and transfer excitation energy to the reaction center (RC) where charge separation occurs (2.Croce R. van Amerongen H. Natural strategies for photosynthetic light harvesting.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To efficiently harvest light, PSI and PSII are equipped with two types of antennae. The inner antenna is composed of chlorophyll (Chl) a-binding complexes that together with the RC form the core complex. The core complexes of PSI and PSII bind 98 and 35 Chls, respectively (3.Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N.

The outer antenna, by contrast, varies in the different organisms as it is optimized for the absorption in their light-growth conditions (2.Croce R. van Amerongen H. Natural strategies for photosynthetic light harvesting.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In plants and green algae, it is composed of members of the light-harvesting complex (Lhc) multigenic family, each coordinating between 10 and 14 Chls (a and b) (6.Pan X. Liu Z. Li M. Chang W.

Despite the high sequence similarity, the number and properties of the Lhcs vary in plants and algae. LHCII trimers are composed of three major Lhcbs in Arabidopsis thaliana (Lhcb1–3 (8.Jansson S.

Three monomeric antenna, CP29 (Lhcb4), CP26 (Lhcb5), and CP24 (Lhcb6), located between the core and the LHCII trimers, are present in A. thaliana PSII-LHCII (10.Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J.

Concerning PSI-LHCI, in A. thaliana, four Lhcas (Lhca1–4) are associated with the PSI core (13.Ben-Shem A. Frolow F. Nelson N.

The amount of excitation energy delivered to the RCs by the Lhcs does not only depend on their number but also on their biochemical and spectroscopic properties (19.Croce R. van Amerongen H.

This creates an excitation imbalance that can affect electron transport and induce photo-damage (22.Rochaix J.-D. Regulation and dynamics of the light-harvesting system.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2014; 65: 287-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To avoid this and maintain a maximal photosynthetic efficiency, plants and algae regulate the association of Lhcbs with PSI and PSII in a process known as state transitions (23.Allen J.F. State transitions: a question of balance.Science. 2003; 299: 1530-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24.Minagawa J.

In plants, the mobile LHCII represents ∼15% of the total LHCII population, and under sunlight, it is mainly associated with PSI i.e. plants in light are in state 2 (25.Wientjes E. van Amerongen H. Croce R. LHCII is an antenna of both photosystems after long-term acclimation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1827: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of state transitions in the green alga C. reinhardtii seem to differ from what is observed in plants (26.Allorent G. Tokutsu R. Roach T. Peers G. Cardol P. Girard-Bascou J.

U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5042-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For a long time, this difference was believed to be the pool size of LHCII involved in the transitions (80% according to Ref. 29.Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A.

Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar); however, recent results suggest that the mechanism and probably also the physiological role of this process are different from in plants. It was indeed observed that although a large part of LHCII functionally disconnects from PSII during the state 1 to state 2 transition, only part of it associates with PSI, whereas the rest gets quenched (27.Ünlü C.

However, due to the complexity of the cells and the presence of different LHCII pools, a conclusion about excitation energy transfer efficiency from Lhcbs to PSI could not be made. PSI-LHCI-LHCII supercomplexes with different antenna size have been purified (31.Kargul J. Turkina M.V. Nield J. Benson S. Vener A.V. Barber J.

The antenna size depends on the method used to induce the state transition and/or on the isolation protocol. The largest PSI-LHCI-LHCII isolated so far contains seven Lhcbs (two LHCII trimers and one monomer located on the PsaH/L side of the core complex), in addition to the nine Lhcas located on the other side of the core complex (34.Drop B.

In this work, we have performed time-resolved fluorescence measurements on the PSI-LHCI-LHCII complex of C. reinhardtii with or without preferential excitation of Lhcbs. We have determined the energy transfer efficiency of these Lhcbs and their influence on the trapping yield of PSI. The data indicate a loose connection between the Lhcbs and the PSI core, which is responsible for a relatively slow energy transfer step. These results are interpreted on the bases of the new PSI-LHCI structures (14.Qin X. Suga M. Kuang T. Shen J.-R.

In short, cells were harvested in mid-logarithmic phase (growth at 25 °C, 20 microeinsteins × m−2 s−1) and state 2 was induced by incubating them in anaerobic conditions (i.e. shaken in the dark for 20 min in the presence of NaN3). Thylakoid membranes were solubilized to a final concentration of 0.5 mg of chlorophyll/ml, 0.5% Digitonin (Sigma), and 0.2% dodecyl-α-d-maltoside, and then loaded on a sucrose gradient. PSI-LHCI-LHCII was harvested with a syringe. Light-harvesting complexes II (Lhcbs) were prepared as in Ref. 12.Drop B. Webber-Birungi M. Yadav S.K.N. Filipowicz-Szymanska A. Fusetti F. Boekema E.J.

Band 2 from the sucrose gradient contained Lhcb monomers such as CP26, CP29 and LhcbMs, and Band 3 contained LHCII trimers. To selectively excite Lhcbs, we determined the fraction of excitation in Lhcbs and chose excitation wavelengths for the time-resolved measurements that showed the largest differences. Lhcbs were excited the least upon 400 nm with 27–29% of PSI-LHCI-LHCII excitation present in the Lhcbs, whereas Lhcbs were excited the most upon 475 nm excitation corresponding to 41–46% of the excitation. To determine the fraction, we used two different methods as described in Ref. 40.Le Quiniou C. Tian L. Drop B. Wientjes E. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Oort B. Croce R. PSI-LHCI of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: Increasing the absorption cross section without losing efficiency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1847: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. For details, see SI1. The absorption spectra were measured at room temperature with a Varian Cary 4000 UV-visible spectrophotometer. CD spectra were measured at 10 °C on a Chirascan-Plus CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK). The 10 °C steady state fluorescence spectra were measured with a spectrofluorometer (FluoroLog, Horiba Scientific) upon 500 nm excitation. To avoid self-absorption, the sample was diluted to optical density 0.07 at the Qy maximum (1-cm path length) in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 0.02% digitonin (Sigma). Time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed with a streak camera setup as described in Ref. 40.Le Quiniou C. Tian L. Drop B. Wientjes E. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Oort B. Croce R.

In short, fs pulses were generated with a repetition rate of 250 kHz using a laser system (Coherent Vitesse Duo and Coherent RegA 9000) and were used to feed the OPA (Coherent OPA 9400) to generate excitation light at 475 and 400 nm. The pulse energy was reduced to 0.3 nJ to avoid singlet-singlet annihilation. The exciting light focused on the sample was 0.151 mol of photons/m2/s at 475 nm and 0.127 mol of photons/m2/s at 400 nm. Fluorescence was detected at the magic angle with respect to the excitation polarization, in the 590–860 nm range from 0 to 400 ps. The sample was measured at 15 °C in its purification buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.02% digitonin, 0.7 m sucrose) in a 10 × 10-mm quartz cuvette at optical density 0.35 cm−1 at the Qy maximum. To avoid self-absorption, the laser beam was focused in the sample close to the cuvette wall, and emission was collected at a right angle close to the entry point of the laser beam into the cuvette. The sample was stirred with a magnet bar to avoid singlet-triplet annihilation. A power study confirmed the absence of annihilation (data not shown). The fluorescence decays measured upon 400 and 475 nm excitation were analyzed with a sequential model (see SI1). The average decay time τav (Equation SI1-1) characterizes the time for the excitation energy to be used for charge separation and is calculated by considering only the components attributed to the PSI-LHCI-LHCII kinetics (excluding ns components attributed to disconnected species). For more details on the acquisition and data analysis, see SI1. We used the previous kinetic model describing C. reinhardtii PSI-LHCI (see Fig. 3a) (40.Le Quiniou C. Tian L. Drop B. Wientjes E. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Oort B. Croce R. PSI-LHCI of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: Increasing the absorption cross section without losing efficiency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1847: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and extended it with a new compartment representing the seven Lhcbs (called “Lhcb”) in equilibrium with “Bulk” (see Fig. 3b). The natural decay rate constant of Lhcb was fixed to k0′ (3.3 ns)−1 as found for isolated LHCII trimers of C. reinhardtii (41.Natali A. Croce R. Characterization of the major light-harvesting complexes (LHCBM) of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0119211Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The complete kinetic scheme (Scheme SI2-1) also contains precursors populating the other compartments on the ps time scale, with relative amounts varying depending on excitation wavelength (Table SI1-2), and a disconnected compartment corresponding to species with ns lifetimes. A detailed description of the procedure for the target analysis is given in SI1. Population dynamics were simulated (MathWorks R2014b 64-bit, MATLAB) for hypothetical particles of: 1) different size (number of Chls a); 2) different connectivity; and 3) different composition (energy of Chls) (Scheme SI3-1). This enabled us to independently study the effects of these three factors on trapping time and efficiency. See SI3 for details. PSI-LHCI-LHCII EM of higher plants (36.Galka P. Santabarbara S.

The positions were set as close as possible to the EM, but uncertainties remain concerning the exact distance that separates the apoproteins and their relative orientation. The reconstruction was made with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (Version 1.3) to have a three-dimensional perspective and a first estimation of distances between the Chls of interest. Absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of PSI-LHCI-LHCII are shown in Fig. 1, a and b, together with the spectra of PSI-LHCI. The maximum Qy absorption of PSI-LHCI-LHCII (at 678 nm) as well as its maximum emission (at 683 nm) are blue-shifted as compared with the PSI-LHCI maxima (at 679.5 and 687.5 nm, respectively). The absorption difference spectrum between PSI-LHCI-LHCII and PSI-LHCI (Fig. 1a, green) overlaps well with the Lhcbs absorption spectrum (Fig. 1a, magenta) in agreement with previous results (34.Drop B.

Consequences of state transitions on the structural and functional organization of Photosystem I in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant J. 2014; 78: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CD spectra of PSI-LHCI-LHCII and PSI-LHCI are compared in Fig. 1c. They show similar features in the Qy absorption region (negative peaks at 648 and 680 nm and a positive peak at 664 nm), as well as in the Soret region (similar shape below 423 nm). Major differences are visible between 423 and 532 nm, as shown in the PSI-LHCI-LHCII minus PSI-LHCI difference spectrum (Fig. 1d, green). This spectrum strongly resembles the spectrum of LHCII trimers in detergent micelles (42.Georgakopoulou S. van der Zwan G. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Croce R. Understanding the changes in the circular dichroism of light harvesting complex II upon varying its pigment composition and organization.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4745-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but also has some feature of aggregated LHCII trimers (distinct negative peak at 438 nm and positive peak at 483 nm (43.Akhtar P. Dorogi M. Pawlak K. Kovács L. Bóta A. Kiss T. Garab G. Lambrev P.H. Pigment interactions in light-harvesting complex II in different molecular environments.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 4877-4886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)). This suggests that the Lhcbs are involved in additional (or modified) excitonic interactions and/or that as compared with the detergent, LHCII trimers associated with PSI-LHCI are present in a slightly different conformation similar to LHCII trimers in aggregates. In this preparation, Lhcbs have been shown to be functionally associated to PSI-LHCI-LHCII (34.Drop B. Yadav K.N. S. Boekema E.J. Croce R. Consequences of state transitions on the structural and functional organization of Photosystem I in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant J. 2014; 78: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To characterize the excitation energy transfer and trapping kinetics of PSI-LHCI-LHCII and estimate the energy transfer rate between Lhcbs and PSI-LHCI, time-resolved fluorescence of PSI-LHCI-LHCII was measured with a streak camera set-up. In C. reinhardtii, as in higher plants, the PS core antenna contains only Chls a, whereas the peripheral antenna also contains Chls b. Excitation in the Chl a and in the Chl b region can then be used to disentangle the contributions of the core and peripheral antennas (44.van Oort B. Amunts A. Borst J.W. van Hoek A.

Picosecond fluorescence of intact and dissolved PSI-LHCI crystals.Biophys J. 2008; 95: 5851-5861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). More specifically, upon 475 nm excitation, 41–46% of the energy was in Lhcbs, whereas this value dropped to 27–29% upon 400 nm excitation. These two excitation wavelengths were chosen for the time-resolved measurements. The fluorescence decays measured upon 400 and 475 nm excitation were analyzed with a sequential model. The data can be well described by a minimum of four components (no structure in the residuals, Fig. 2). A clear difference between both excitation wavelengths is observed in the decay of PSI-LHCI-LHCII at an early time where fast Chl b decay is clearly visible af"
https://openalex.org/W1854364138,"Although the importance of large noncoding RNAs is increasingly appreciated, our understanding of their structures and architectural dynamics remains limited. In particular, we know little about RNA folding intermediates and how they facilitate the productive assembly of RNA tertiary structures. Here, we report the crystal structure of an obligate intermediate that is required during the earliest stages of group II intron folding. Composed of domain 1 from the Oceanobacillus iheyensis group II intron (266 nucleotides), this intermediate retains native-like features but adopts a compact conformation in which the active site cleft is closed. Transition between this closed and the open (native) conformation is achieved through discrete rotations of hinge motifs in two regions of the molecule. The open state is then stabilized by sequential docking of downstream intron domains, suggesting a 'first come, first folded' strategy that may represent a generalizable pathway for assembly of large RNA and ribonucleoprotein structures."

Three compounds were identified as potential candidates for further development. The listed compounds were also assayed for their antimalarial efficacy against chloroquine (CQ) sensitive strain (3D7) of Plasmodium falciparum. Assay of twenty seven hydroxyethylamine derivatives revealed four (5e, 6j, 6o and 6s) as strongly active, which were further evaluated against CQ resistant strain (7GB) of P. falciparum. Compound 5e possessing the piperidinopiperidine moiety exhibited promising antimalarial activity with an IC50 of 1.16 ± 0.04 μM. Further, compounds 5e, 6j, 6o and 6s exhibited low cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cell line. Compound 6s possessing C2 symmetry was identified as the least cytotoxic with significant antimalarial activity (IC50: 1.30 ± 0.03 μM). The combined presence of hydroxyethylamine and cyclic amines (piperazines and piperidines) was observed as crucial for the activity. The current studies suggest that hydroxyethylamine based molecules act as potent antimalarial agent and may be helpful in drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2192441965,"The degradation of transitory starch in the chloroplast to provide fuel for the plant during the night requires a suite of enzymes that generate a series of short chain linear glucans. However, glucans of less than four glucose units are no longer substrates for these enzymes, whereas export from the plastid is only possible in the form of either maltose or glucose. In order to make use of maltotriose, which would otherwise accumulate, disproportionating enzyme 1 (DPE1; a 4-α-glucanotransferase) converts two molecules of maltotriose to a molecule of maltopentaose, which can now be acted on by the degradative enzymes, and one molecule of glucose that can be exported. We have determined the structure of the Arabidopsis plastidial DPE1 (AtDPE1), and, through ligand soaking experiments, we have trapped the enzyme in a variety of conformational states. AtDPE1 forms a homodimer with a deep, long, and open-ended active site canyon contained within each subunit. The canyon is divided into donor and acceptor sites with the catalytic residues at their junction; a number of loops around the active site adopt different conformations dependent on the occupancy of these sites. The ""gate"" is the most dynamic loop and appears to play a role in substrate capture, in particular in the binding of the acceptor molecule. Subtle changes in the configuration of the active site residues may prevent undesirable reactions or abortive hydrolysis of the covalently bound enzyme-substrate intermediate. Together, these observations allow us to delineate the complete AtDPE1 disproportionation cycle in structural terms."

The first method contains two aspects of information: function value and gradient value. The two methods both possess some good properties, as follows: 1) βk ≥ 0 2) the search direction has the trust region property without the use of any line search method 3) the search direction has sufficient descent property without the use of any line search method. Under some suitable conditions, we establish the global convergence of the two algorithms. We conduct numerical experiments to evaluate our algorithms.

We examined the correlates associated with e-cigarette awareness, use and perceived effectiveness in smoking cessation among Chinese daily smokers in Hong Kong.Daily smokers (N = 1,307) were recruited to a community-based randomised controlled trial ('Quit to Win') in 2014. Socio-demographic characteristics, conventional cigarette smoking status, nicotine addiction level, quit attempts, quit intention, e-cigarette awareness, use and perceived effectiveness on quitting were reported at baseline and 1-week follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with e-cigarette awareness, use and perceived effectiveness in quitting.Most smokers (82.6%, 95% CI 80.2%-84.9%) had heard about e-cigarettes, and 13.3% (11.3%-15.5%) ever used e-cigarettes. Most users (74.1%) and non-users (91.2%) did not perceive e-cigarettes as effective in quitting. Being younger and having a larger family income were associated with e-cigarette awareness. Being younger, a tertiary education and a stronger addiction to nicotine were associated with e-cigarette use, which was itself associated with lower levels of intention to quit and had no association with attempts to quit (P for trend 0.45). E-cigarette use, the last quit attempt being a month earlier, having made a quit attempt lasting 24 hours or longer and perceiving quitting as important were all associated with the perceived effectiveness of e-cigarettes in quitting (all P <0.05).Among community-recruited smokers who intended to quit, awareness of e-cigarettes was high, but most did not perceive e-cigarettes as effective in quitting. Correlates concerning e-cigarette perceptions and use will help to inform prospective studies, public education and policy on controlling e-cigarettes."
https://openalex.org/W2210222520,"The validated therapeutic effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in solid tumors have encouraged us to explore its potential in treating T-cell lymphoma. We found that Jurkat cells (a T-cell lyphoma cell line) were sensitive to DHA treatment with a IC50 of dihydroartemisinin. The cytotoxic effect of DHA in Jurkat cells showed a dose- and time- dependent manner. Interestingly, the cytotoxic effect of DHA was further enhanced by holotransferrin (HTF) due to the high expression of transferrin receptors in T-cell lymphoma. Mechanistically, DHA significantly increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The DHA treatment also inhibited the expression of protumorgenic factors including VEGF and telomerase catalytic subunit. Our results have proved the therapeutic effect of DHA in T-cell lymphoma. Especially in combination with HTF, DHA may provide a novel efficient approach in combating the deadly disease."

https://openalex.org/W1881516094,"The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection exhibits a high global prevalence frequently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, taking years to develop. Despite the standardization of highly sensitive HCV quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) detection methods, false-negative diagnoses may be generated with current methods, mainly due to the presence of PCR inhibitors and/or low viral loads in the patient’s sample. These false-negative diagnoses impact both public health systems, in developing countries, and an in lesser extent, in developed countries, including both the risk of virus transmission during organ transplantation and/or blood transfusion and the quality of the antiviral treatment monitoring. To adopt an appropriate therapeutic strategy to improve the patient’s prognosis, it is urgent to increase the HCV detection sensitivity. Based upon previous studies on HBV, we worked on the capacity of the scavenger acute phase protein, Apolipoprotein H (ApoH) to interact with HCV. Using different approaches, including immunoassays, antibody-inhibition, oxidation, ultracentrifugation, electron microscopy and RT-PCR analyses, we demonstrated specific interactions between HCV particles and ApoH. Moreover, when using a two-step HCV detection process, including capture of HCV by ApoH-coated nanomagnetic beads and a home-made real-time HCV-RT-PCR, we confirmed the presence of HCV for all samples from a clinical collection of HCV-seropositive patients exhibiting an RT-PCR COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test, v2.0 (COBAS)-positive result. In contrast, for HCV-seropositive patients with either low HCV-load as determined with COBAS or exhibiting HCV-negative COBAS results, the addition of the two-step ApoH-HCV-capture and HCV-detection process was able to increase the sensitivity of HCV detection or more interestingly, detect in a genotype sequence-independent manner, a high-proportion (44%) of HCV/RNA-positive among the COBAS HCV-negative patients. Thus, the immune interaction between ApoH and HCV could be used as a sample preparation tool to enrich and/or cleanse HCV patient’s samples to enhance the detection sensitivity of HCV and therefore significantly reduce the numbers of false-negative HCV diagnosis results."
https://openalex.org/W2271409962,"Tumor invasiveness depends on the ability of tumor cells to breach endothelial barriers. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which the adhesion of melanoma cells to endothelium regulates adherens junction integrity and modulates tumor transendothelial migration (TEM) by initiating thrombin generation. We found that the B-Raf(V600E) mutation in metastatic melanoma cells up-regulated tissue factor (TF) expression on cell membranes and promoted thrombin production. Co-culture of endothelial monolayers with metastatic melanoma cells mediated the opening of inter-endothelial spaces near melanoma cell contact sites in the presence of platelet-free plasma (PFP). By using small interfering RNA (siRNA), we demonstrated that B-Raf(V600E) and TF silencing attenuated the focal disassembly of adherens junction induced by tumor contact. Vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) disassembly was dependent on phosphorylation of p120-catenin on Ser-879 and VE-cadherin on Tyr-658, Tyr-685, and Tyr-731, which can be prevented by treatment with the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, or by silencing the thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1, in endothelial cells. We also provided strong evidence that tumor-derived thrombin enhanced melanoma TEM by inducing ubiquitination-coupled VE-cadherin internalization, focal adhesion formation, and actin assembly in endothelium. Confocal microscopic analysis of tumor TEM revealed that junctions transiently opened and resealed as tumor cells accomplished TEM. In addition, in the presence of PFP, tumor cells preferentially transmigrated via paracellular routes. PFP supported melanoma transmigration under shear conditions via a B-Raf(V600E)-thrombin-dependent mechanism. We concluded that the activation of thrombin generation by cancer cells in plasma is an important process regulating melanoma extravasation by disrupting endothelial junction integrity.Background: A prothrombotic state is one of the hallmarks of advanced cancer.Results: B-Raf(V600E)-dependent thrombin release from metastatic melanoma signals focal adherens junction disassembly by triggering VE-cadherin phosphorylation and ubiquitination.Conclusion: Thrombin-mediated junction breakdown allows melanoma extravasation via a paracellular route.Significance: Targeting B-Raf(V600E)-mediated thrombin generation and endothelial barrier dysfunction may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to limit tumor metastasis."

Positive human immunodeficiency virus tests were confirmed via western blotting.Among 416,130 subjects, the seroprevalences for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Treponema pallidum were 5.72%, 1.23%, 0.196%, and 0.76%, respectively. Among 671 patients with positive human immunodeficiency virus results, 392 cases were confirmed via western blotting. Hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus infections were more frequent in men (7.78% and 0.26%, respectively) than in women (4.45% and 0.021%, respectively). The hepatitis B and C virus seroprevalences decreased from 6.21% and 1.58%, respectively, in 2010, to 5.37% and 0.988%, respectively, in 2014.

https://openalex.org/W1871676704,"A variety of protein domain predictors were developed to predict protein domain boundaries in recent years, but most of them cannot predict discontinuous domains. Considering nearly 40% of multidomain proteins contain one or more discontinuous domains, we have developed DomEx to enable domain boundary predictors to detect discontinuous domains by assembling the continuous domain segments. Discontinuous domains are predicted by matching the sequence profile of concatenated continuous domain segments with the profiles from a single-domain library derived from SCOP and CATH, and Pfam. Then the matches are filtered by similarity to library templates, a symmetric index score and a profile-profile alignment score. DomEx recalled 32.3% discontinuous domains with 86.5% precision when tested on 97 non-homologous protein chains containing 58 continuous and 99 discontinuous domains, in which the predicted domain segments are within ±20 residues of the boundary definitions in CATH 3.5. Compared with our recently developed predictor, ThreaDom, which is the state-of-the-art tool to detect discontinuous-domains, DomEx recalled 26.7% discontinuous domains with 72.7% precision in a benchmark with 29 discontinuous-domain chains, where ThreaDom failed to predict any discontinuous domains. Furthermore, combined with ThreaDom, the method ranked number one among 10 predictors. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/xuezhidong/DomEx."

A competition assay, based on a validated chemical kinetic model of steroid hormone action, is now used to identify two new factors (BRD4 and negative elongation factor (NELF)-E) and to define their sites and mechanisms of action. BRD4 is a kinase involved in numerous initial steps of gene induction. Consistent with its complicated biochemistry, BRD4 is shown to alter both the maximal activity (Amax) and the steroid concentration required for half-maximal induction (EC50) of GR-mediated gene expression by acting at a minimum of three different kinetically defined steps.

Steroid hormone action has been studied intensively since the discovery of steroid hormone receptors almost 50 years ago (1Jensen E.V. DeSombre E.R. Mechanism of action of the female sex hormones.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1972; 41: 203-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) for three reasons. First, the receptors are obligatory mediators for the biological responses of the five classes of endogenous steroid hormones. Second, steroids and their receptors provide an ideal system in which to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate the controlled induction of gene transcription. Such studies have resulted in the identification of many species or factors that are required for transcription initiation, elongation, and termination (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Third, the clinical benefits of steroid hormones are often severely limited by undesired side effects (5Simons Jr., S.S.

A better molecular understanding of steroid action should lead to fewer side effects, which would significantly expand the clinical applications of steroids in treating human pathologies. The majority of factors identified to date for steroid-regulated gene induction participate in the early steps of transcription initiation (e.g. chromatin remodeling, assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, and synthesis of the first oligonucleotides) (9Devaiah B.N. Singer D.S. Two faces of brd4: mitotic bookmark and transcriptional lynchpin.Transcription. 2013; 4: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two interesting classes of factors for steroid-regulated gene transcription are coactivators and corepressors (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. The coregulator exchange in transcription functions of nuclear receptors.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141PubMed Google Scholar, 3McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W.

One of the earliest and most widely studied of these factors is TIF2/GRIP1, which is a member of the p160 family of coactivators with molecular masses of about 160 kDa (10Xu J. Li Q. Review of the in vivo functions of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 11Johnson A.B. O'Malley B.W.

Despite the detailed understanding of many of the factors involved in transcription initiation, much less is known about factors involved in elongation, termination, and release of the initially transcribed RNA. Furthermore, the overall number of molecular reactions between steroid binding to its cognate receptor and the appearance of product has yet to be determined. Because the precise sequence of events leading to the final product has not been identified, much less characterized, it is difficult to use classical biochemical or molecular biology approaches to determine the factors participating in each step. Similarly, the order of factor action, as opposed to binding, in the overall sequence of events is virtually unknown. Here, we utilize an alternative approach to the problem of undefined reaction steps with unknown factors and the position of these steps in the overall reaction sequence. We first identify those agents that have any effect on receptor-mediated transcription (12Blackford Jr., J.A. Brimacombe K.R. Dougherty E.J. Pradhan M. Shen M. Li Z. Auld D.S. Chow C.C. Austin C.P. Simons Jr., S.S. Modulators of glucocorticoid receptor activity identified by a new high-throughput screening assay.Mol. Endocrinol. 2014; 28: 1194-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We then analyze pairs of these factors using a competition assay that is based on the analysis of a chemical kinetic scheme of gene expression. This assay yields mechanistic information about how and where each of the competing factors acts (13Dougherty E.J. Guo C. Simons Jr., S.S. Chow C.C. Deducing the temporal order of cofactor function in ligand-regulated gene transcription: theory and experimental verification.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e30225Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This different approach is made possible by the observation that the dose-response curve for steroid-regulated gene expression is usually non-cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1, as in a classical Michaelis-Menten curve. For such regulated genes, an experimentally validated chemical kinetic model has been developed that explains ligand regulation of gene induction, gene repression, and the partial agonist activity of antisteroids (13Dougherty E.J.

This kinetic scheme models gene expression as a chain of complex building chemical reactions consistent with what is known about the process. The constraint that the dose-response curve be noncooperative is extremely stringent and renders the system to have a very specific form. The result is a mathematical formula for the dose-response curve as a function of the steroid in the presence of added cofactors. The formula shows that factors only affect the dose-response curve through the maximal activity (Amax) of gene expression and the steroid concentration required for half-maximal induction (EC50) of steroid-mediated gene expression. These parameters vary as a function of how and where the factors act. Information about each factor is then obtained from a series of graphs, similar to Lineweaver-Burk graphs in biochemistry, that plot combinations of the Amax and EC50 values from the competition assays. Specifically, the graphs reveal the number of sites at which each factor acts, their kinetically defined mechanism of action, and their relative order of action in the overall sequence leading to changes in gene expression (12Blackford Jr., J.A.

This approach has been extensively validated, and the derived information is novel and not available from other methodologies. Implicit in the model are new chemical kinetic and mechanistically descriptive alternatives to label the actions of a modulatory factor. The traditional terms of “coactivator” and “corepressor” consider only the ability of factors to increase and decrease, respectively, the total amount of gene product without reference to mechanism. In fact, chemical kinetics tell us that the final product can increase due to two opposite actions: (a) a species that accelerates an intermediate step or (b) a factor that decelerates a currently utilized step, thereby allowing a more productive but otherwise avoided step to be followed (19Blackford Jr., J.A. Guo C. Zhu R. Dougherty E.J. Chow C.C. Simons Jr., S.S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 40982-40995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Under the traditional terminology a coactivator could become a corepressor under different conditions, although its mechanistic action is invariant (17Chow C.C. Finn K.K. Storchan G.B. Lu X. Sheng X. Simons Jr., S.S. Kinetically-defined component actions in gene repression.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004122Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, we adopt the terms “accelerator” and “decelerator,” which describe how a given species alters the reaction kinetics at that step where each species acts. An accelerator's or decelerator's local action is invariant, but it could increase or decrease the final gene product, depending on how and where it acts with respect to other factors involved. In the language of chemical enzyme kinetics, an accelerator acts like an activator, whereas a decelerator acts like an inhibitor. Like inhibitors in enzyme kinetics, decelerators can be competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive. A key feature of the chemical kinetic scheme for steroid hormone action is the concentration-limited step (CLS), 4The abbreviations used are: CLS, concentration-limited step; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; NELF, negative elongation factor; Pol II, polymerase II; CTD, C-terminal domain; Dex, dexamethasone; BIC, Bayesian information criterion; LUC, luciferase; dnCDK9, dominant negative CDK9; wtCDK9, wild type CDK9; wtBRD4, wild type BRD4; mtBRD4, mutant BRD4. which is the equilibrium analog of a rate-limiting step in enzyme kinetics. All reaction steps (known and unknown) in the scheme can be grouped according to whether they are positioned before the CLS, at the CLS, and or after the CLS. Accelerators are limiting in the reaction steps before and at the CLS, whereas, after the CLS, products are limiting, and accelerators are abundant (14Ong K.M. Blackford Jr., J.A. Kagan B.L.

The chemical kinetic scheme shows that a competition assay between any two species can be used to classify the two species as accelerators or decelerators, to specify the number of steps at which they act, to provide the relative order in which they function, and to infer their positions of action relative to the CLS (13Dougherty E.J.

In addition, several well known transcription factors have been found to modulate GR-regulated gene induction, such as components of the transcription negative elongation factor (NELF) complex (20Luo M.

A conserved protein motif is required for full modulatory activity of negative elongation factor subunits NELF-A and NELF-B in modifying glucocorticoid receptor-regulated gene induction properties.J.

A kinase-independent activity of Cdk9 modulates glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene induction.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 1753-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which is the kinase subunit of P-TEFb. The NELF complex is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), enforcing a pause in early elongation about 100 bp after transcription initiation. P-TEFb triggers the release of paused Pol II and the initiation of efficient elongation via phosphorylation of the NELF complex through the action of CDK9. P-TEFb/CDK9 also functions as a transcription elongation factor by phosphorylating Pol II on Ser-2 residues of its C-terminal domain (CTD), thus enabling the recruitment of necessary chromatin remodeling and RNA maturation factors (22Cheng B. Price D.H. Properties of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes before and after the P-TEFb-mediated transition into productive elongation.J. Biol.

Biochem. 2012; 81: 119-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor, BRD4, has been identified as a kinase involved in the initial steps of gene induction. BRD4 is a bromodomain protein that binds to acetylated lysines of histones and remains associated with chromatin throughout mitosis, bookmarking actively transcribed genes. However, BRD4 also functions throughout the cell cycle. BRD4 interacts with transcription and chromatin-modifying factors and recruits them to enhancers and promoters (9Devaiah B.N. Singer D.S. Two faces of brd4: mitotic bookmark and transcriptional lynchpin.Transcription. 2013; 4: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of BRD4 is to recruit P-TEFb to the transcription initiation complex. However, it was recently discovered that BRD4 is a kinase that also phosphorylates the Ser-2 of the RNA Pol II CTD, facilitating the transition of RNA Pol II from initiation to elongation (24Devaiah B.N. Lewis B.A. Cherman N. Hewitt M.C. Albrecht B.K. Robey P.G. Ozato K. Sims 3rd, R.J. Singer D.S.

Furthermore, BRD4 participates in coordinating the early steps of transcription initiation and elongation through its interactions with and cross-regulations of P-TEFb and the general transcription factor TFIIH (24Devaiah B.N.

The purpose of the present study was to use the competition assay derived from the chemical kinetic model of steroid hormone action to investigate the possible roles of both BRD4 and the NELF-E subunit of the NELF complex in glucocorticoid induction of target genes. We report that both significantly modulate the Amax and EC50 of GR-regulated gene induction. Furthermore, BRD4 and the NELF-E subunit physically interact. In competition assays with CDK9, NELF-E, and the accelerator TIF2, BRD4 can act at a minimum of three sites with site-dependent activity as either a competitive decelerator or an accelerator. Surprisingly, the mode and relative positions of action of two of the three sites were unaffected by mutations that abrogate either the BRD4 interaction with CDK9 or CDK9 kinase activity, although one site of action was eliminated. By determining the kinetic behavior of various mutants of BRD4 and CDK9, we relate the kinetic properties to some of the multiple roles of BRD4, including recruitment and phosphorylation of P-TEFb and phosphorylation of RNA Pol II CTD. This new information will be helpful in reducing the side effects of glucocorticoid therapies.

However, UPP recording in female rats, a widely used animal model, is challenging due to their small body sizes. This study reports a novel method for recording UPP in female rats.Seventeen anesthetized female rats were studied. LPP data for 14 rats were included. The other 3 rats were excluded because of death or abnormal urogenital organs. UPP curves were recorded using a modified water-perfusion catheter system, with the lateral hole facing the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-o'clock positions in a randomized sequence. LPP, functional urethral length (FUL) and maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) were analyzed.The mean LPP was 64.39 ± 20.29 cm H2O. The mean FUL and MUCP values at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-o'clock positions were 12.90 ± 1.20, 16.70 ± 1.95, 13.90 ± 2.42, and 11.60 ± 0.97 mm, respectively, and 38.70 ± 11.85, 33.90 ± 11.82, 37.40 ± 11.95, and 71.90 ± 23.01 cm H2O, respectively. The FUL at the 6-o'clock position and MUCP at the 12-o'clock position were significantly greater than those at the other 3 positions. The FUL and MUCP of repeated UPP recordings were not significantly different than those of the first recordings.UPP recording using a modified method based on a water-perfusion catheter system is feasible and replicable in female rats. It produces UPP curves that sensitively and appreciably reflect detailed pressure changes at different points within the urethra and thus provides opportunity to evaluate urethral structures, especially the urethral sphincter, in detail. These results may enhance the utility of female rat models in research of urinary sphincter mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2108184055,"Proteins are flexible, and this flexibility has an essential functional role. Flexibility can be observed in loop regions, rearrangements between secondary structure elements, and conformational changes between entire domains. However, most protein structure alignment methods treat protein structures as rigid bodies. Thus, these methods fail to identify the equivalences of residue pairs in regions with flexibility. In this study, we considered that the evolutionary relationship between proteins corresponds directly to the residue–residue physical contacts rather than the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of proteins. Thus, we developed a new protein structure alignment method, contact area-based alignment (CAB-align), which uses the residue–residue contact area to identify regions of similarity. The main purpose of CAB-align is to identify homologous relationships at the residue level between related protein structures. The CAB-align procedure comprises two main steps: First, a rigid-body alignment method based on local and global 3D structure superposition is employed to generate a sufficient number of initial alignments. Then, iterative dynamic programming is executed to find the optimal alignment. We evaluated the performance and advantages of CAB-align based on four main points: (1) agreement with the gold standard alignment, (2) alignment quality based on an evolutionary relationship without 3D coordinate superposition, (3) consistency of the multiple alignments, and (4) classification agreement with the gold standard classification. Comparisons of CAB-align with other state-of-the-art protein structure alignment methods (TM-align, FATCAT, and DaliLite) using our benchmark dataset showed that CAB-align performed robustly in obtaining high-quality alignments and generating consistent multiple alignments with high coverage and accuracy rates, and it performed extremely well when discriminating between homologous and nonhomologous pairs of proteins in both single and multi-domain comparisons. The CAB-align software is freely available to academic users as stand-alone software at http://www.pharm.kitasato-u.ac.jp/bmd/bmd/Publications.html."
https://openalex.org/W1825474987,"Short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation (SSPI) is used for unstable burst fractures to correct deformity and stabilize the spine for fusion. However, pedicle screw loosening, pullout, or breakage often occurs due to the large moment applied during spine motion, leading to poor outcomes. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of a newly designed device, the Trans-Endplate Pedicle Pillar System (TEPPS), to enhance SSPI rigidity and decrease the screw bending moment with a simple posterior approach.Six human cadaveric spines (T11-L3) were harvested. A burst fracture was created at L1, and the SSPI (Moss Miami System) was used for SSPI fixation. Strain gauge sensors were mounted on upper pedicle screws to measure screw load bearing. Segmental motion (T12-L2) was measured under pure moment of 7.5 Nm. The spine was tested sequentially under 4 conditions: intact; first SSPI alone (SSPI-1); SSPI+TEPPS; and second SSPI alone (SSPI-2).SSPI+TEPPS increased fixation rigidity by 41% in flexion/extension, 28% in lateral bending, and 37% in axial rotation compared with SSPI-1 (P<0.001), and it performed even better compared to SSPI-2 (P<0.001 for all). Importantly, the bending moment on the pedicle screws for SSPI+TEPPS was significantly decreased 63% during spine flexion and 47% in lateral bending (p<0.001).TEPPS provided strong anterior support, enhanced SSPI fixation rigidity, and dramatically decreased the load on the pedicle screws. Its biomechanical benefits could potentially improve fusion rates and decrease SSPI instrumentation failure."
