https://openalex.org/W2007768242,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional peptide that controls proliferation, differentiation, and other functions in many cell types. Many cells synthesize TGF-beta and essentially all of them have specific receptors for this peptide. TGF-beta regulates the actions of many other peptide growth factors and determines a positive or negative direction of their effects. Its marked ability to enhance formation of connective tissue in vivo suggests several therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2032055976,"Age-associated increases in collagen cross-linking and accumulation of advanced glycosylation products are both accelerated by diabetes, suggesting that glucose-derived cross-link formation may contribute to the development of chronic diabetic complications as well as certain physical changes of aging. Aminoguanidine, a nucleophilic hydrazine compound, prevented both the formation of fluorescent advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation products and the formation of glucose-derived collagen cross-links in vitro. Aminoguanidine administration to rats was equally effective in preventing diabetes-induced formation of fluorescent advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation products and cross-linking of arterial wall connective tissue protein in vivo. The identification of aminoguanidine as an inhibitor of advanced nonenzymatic glycosylation product formation now makes possible precise experimental definition of the pathogenetic significance of this process and suggests a potential clinical role for aminoguanidine in the future treatment of chronic diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2074492469,"We describe the isolation, characterization, and sequence of cDNA clones encoding one subunit of the complex of membrane glycoproteins that forms part of the transmembrane connection between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. The cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 89 kd that has features strongly suggesting the presence of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment, and a small C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain contains a threefold repeat of a novel 40 residue cysteine-rich segment, and the cytoplasmic domain contains a tyrosine residue that is a potential site for phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases. We propose the name integrin for this protein complex to denote its role as an integral membrane complex involved in the transmembrane association between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2085583092,"The hypothesis that red-green ""color blindness"" is caused by alterations in the genes encoding red and green visual pigments has been tested and shown to be correct. Genomic DNA's from 25 males with various red-green color vision deficiencies were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with the cloned red and green pigment genes as probes. The observed genotypes appear to result from unequal recombination or gene conversion (or both). Together with chromosome mapping experiments, these data identify each of the cloned human visual pigment genes."
https://openalex.org/W2058403714,"The inherited genetic defect in adenomatous polyposis has been localized to a small region on the long arm of chromosome 5. Sixteen DNA marker loci were used to construct a linkage map of the chromosome. When five kindreds segregating a gene for adenomatous polyposis coli were characterized with a number of the markers, significant linkage was found between one marker and the disease gene. Linkage analysis determined the location of the defective gene within a primary genetic map of chromosome 5."
https://openalex.org/W2071142530,"We have recently proposed that a common recombinase performs all of the many variable region gene assembly events in B and T cells, and that the specificity of these joining events is mediated by regulating the “accessibility” of the involved gene segments. To test this possibility, we have introduced “accessible” T cell receptor (TCR) variable region gene segments into a pre-B cell line capable of recombining endogenous and transfected immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region gene segments. Although the corresponding “inaccessible” endogenous TCR gene segments do not rearrange in this line or in B cells in general, the introduced TCR gene segments join very frequently and, in fact, closely resemble introduced Ig gene segments in their recombination characteristics. These observations suggest a new role for conventional Ig transcriptional enhancers — recombinational enhancement. Our studies provide insight into additional aspects of the joining mechanism such as N region insertion, aberrant joining, and recombination-recognition sequence requirements for joining."

https://openalex.org/W1965526093,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The potential role of PDGF in the altered vasoreactivity of atherosclerotic vessels has been studied through an examination of its effects on contractility in the rat aorta. PDGF caused a concentration-dependent contraction of aortic strips and was significantly more potent on a molar basis than the classic vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II. Furthermore, PDGF increased the cytosolic free calcium concentration in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. These observations suggest a new biological activity for PDGF that may contribute to the enhanced vasoreactivity of certain atherosclerotic vessels."

https://openalex.org/W1968079356,"Although the T cell gamma genes are similar in many respects to T cell receptor alpha and beta genes, earlier studies suggested that only a single gamma variable (V gamma) gene is expressed in mature T cells. We report the isolation and characterization of three new rearranged V gamma genes from murine fetal thymocytes. Although each of the new V gamma gene rearrangements is present in fetal thymocytes, two of them are undetectable in mature T cells. The levels of mRNA corresponding to each type of V gamma gene rearrangement in mature T cells are dramatically diminished compared with those in fetal thymocytes, although the abundance of two of the rearranged genes is increased in mature T cells. Our results demonstrate that there is significant expressed variability of gamma genes in immature T cells. Furthermore, the dynamics of gamma gene rearrangement and expression support the idea that gamma genes function in immature T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602098835,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), an impurity in certain batches of illicit heroin substitutes, is known to cause parkinsonian symptoms and degeneration of the nigrostriatal cells in drug abusers and primates. Neurotoxicity depends on oxidation of MPTP by monoamine oxidase in brain cells to the dihydropyridinium form, which is further oxidized to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the 4-electron oxidation product. The latter is widely believed to be the compound responsible for neuronal destruction and the NADH dehydrogenase of the inner membrane has been postulated to be its target. This enzyme is inhibited, however, only at very high concentrations of MPP+, while the steady-state concentration of MPP+ in the nigrostriatal cells of MPTP-treated animals is several orders of magnitude lower. This paradox has now been resolved by the discovery of an energized uptake system for MPP+ in mitochondria which rapidly concentrates MPP+ to very high concentrations in the mitochondria at micromolar external concentrations. The process is dependent on the electrical gradient of the membrane, has a Km of about 5 mM, and is completely blocked by respiratory inhibitors and uncouplers."
https://openalex.org/W2044485561,"Almost all B cells in autoimmune mice with the viable motheaten (mev) mutation express the Ly-1 cell surface antigen, which marks a minor population of B cells constituting a separate lineage in normal mice. Immunoglobulins primarily of the M and G3 classes, which in both normal and mev mice contain high levels of lambda light chain, are produced in excess in mev mice. These and other observations suggest that the development of B cells that express Ly-1 is regulated independently from the development of B cells that do not express Ly-1. B cells bearing the Ly-1 surface antigen may play specialized roles in the normal immune system and in autoimmunity by regulating other B cells via lymphokines, by producing antibodies to self and certain foreign antigens, and by preferentially secreting immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G3."
https://openalex.org/W1527715380,"Addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to human A431 cells causes a 2-4-fold increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) as measured by quin-2 fluorescence. The EGF effect is rapid but transient: [Ca2+]i reaches a maximum within 30-60 s and then returns to its resting value (182 +/- 3 nM) over a 5-8-min period. The EGF-induced [Ca2+]i rise is completely dependent on extracellular Ca2+, is abolished by La3+ and Mn2+, and is not accompanied by changes in membrane potential (mean values of -64 mV). Serum also elicits a transient [Ca2+]i rise in A431 cells, but this response is not dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate completely inhibits the EGF- and serum-induced increases in [Ca2+]i without affecting basal [Ca2+]i levels. Our results, together with previous 45Ca2+ uptake data (Sawyer, S. T., and Cohen, S. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 6280-6286), suggest that while serum factors trigger the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, EGF acts by opening a voltage-independent Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane. The data further suggest a role for protein kinase C in attenuating the Ca2+-mobilizing mechanisms of EGF and serum."
https://openalex.org/W1516463671,"The inositol lipid pools of isolated rat hepatocytes were labeled with [3H]myo-inositol, stimulated maximally with vasopressin and the relative contents of [3H]inositol phosphates were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulated rapidly (peak 20 s), while inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate and a novel inositol phosphate (ascribed to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate) accumulated at a slower rate over 2 min. Incubation of hepatocytes with 10 mM Li+ prior to vasopressin addition selectively augmented the levels of inositol monophosphate, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. A kinase was partially purified from liver and brain cortex which catalyzed an ATP-dependent phosphorylation of [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. Incubation of purified [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with diluted liver homogenate produced initially inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate and subsequently inositol 1,3-bisphosphate, the formation of which could be inhibited by Li+. The data demonstrate that the most probable pathway for the formation of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate is by 3-phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by a soluble mammalian kinase. Degradation of both compounds occurs first by a Li+-insensitive 5-phosphatase and subsequently by a Li+-sensitive 4-phosphatase. The prolonged accumulation of both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate in vasopressin-stimulated hepatocytes suggest that they have separate second messenger roles, perhaps both relating to Ca2+-signalling events."
https://openalex.org/W2088606571,"By in situ chromosomal hybridization, the GM-CSF and FMS genes were localized to human chromosome 5 at bands q23 to q31, and at band 5q33, respectively. These genes encode proteins involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, and are located within a chromosome region frequently deleted in patients with neoplastic myeloid disorders. Both genes were deleted in the 5q-chromosome from bone marrow cells of two patients with refractory anemia and a del(5)(q15q33.3). The GM-CSF gene alone was deleted in a third patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) who has a smaller deletion, del(5)(q22q33.1). Leukemia cells from a fourth patient who has ANLL and does not have a del(5q), but who has a rearranged chromosome 5 that is missing bands q31.3 to q33.1 [ins(21;5)(q22;q31.3q33.1)] were used to sublocalize these genes; both genes were present on the rearranged chromosome 5. Thus, the deletion of one or both of these genes may be important in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes or of ANLL."
https://openalex.org/W1551174843,"The colony-stimulating factor, CSF-1, stimulates cultured quiescent murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) to enter DNA synthesis with a lag phase of 10-12 h. The binding, dissociation, internalization, and degradation of 125I-CSF-1 by BMM during the lag phase were investigated. Quiescent BMM express approximately 5 X 10(4) cell surface receptor sites/cell but contain additional cryptic sites (approximately 10(5)/cell) that can appear at the cell surface within 10 min at 37 degrees C. Studies of the binding reaction at both 2 degrees C (Kd less than or equal to 2 X 10(-13) M) and 37 degrees C (Kd approximately 4 X 10(-10) M) are consistent with the existence of a single class of cell surface sites. The disappearance of cell surface 125I-CSF-1 following a 2-37 degrees C temperature shift results from two, competitive, first order processes, internalization and dissociation. Internalization (t1/2 = 1.6 min) is 6 times more frequent than dissociation (t1/2 = 9.6 min). Following internalization, 10-15% of the intracellular CSF-1 is rapidly degraded whereas the remaining 85-90% is slowly degraded by a chloroquin-sensitive first order process (t1/2 greater than 3.5 h). These findings were confirmed and extended by studies of the uptake of 125I-CSF-1 at 37 degrees C. Following addition of 125I-CSF-1, cell surface receptors are rapidly down-regulated (t1/2 approximately 7 min) and their replacement does not commence until 20-60% of pre-existing surface receptor sites have disappeared. Despite receptor replacement, initially from the cryptic pool and later by de novo synthesis and/or receptor recycling (4 molecules/cell/s at steady state), the number of receptors at the cell surface remains low. The process results in the intracellular accumulation of large amounts of 125I-CSF-1 (greater than 10(5) molecules/cell) by BMM. Thus, whereas the kinetics of association, dissociation, and internalization of CSF-1 with BMM and peritoneal exudate macrophages are similar, BMM, which exhibit a higher proliferative response, degrade growth factor 12 times more slowly."
https://openalex.org/W2012908073,"Two human T-cell leukemias carrying a t(8;14)(q24;q11) chromosome translocation were studied for rearrangements and expression of the c-myc oncogene. For one leukemia, rearrangement was detected in a region immediately distal (3′) to the c-myc locus; no rearrangements of c-myc were observed in the second case (DeF). However, studies with hybrids between human and mouse leukemic T cells indicated that in the leukemic cells of DeF, the breakpoint in chromosome 14 occurred between genes for the variable (Vα) and the constant (Cα) regions for the α chain of the T-cell receptor. The Cα locus had translocated to a region more than 38 kilobases 3′ to the involved c-myc oncogene. Since human c-myc transcripts were expressed only in hybrids carrying the 8q+ chromosome but not in hybrids containing the normal chromosome 8, it is concluded that the translocation of the Cα locus 3′ to the c-myc oncogene can result in its transcriptional deregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1511387305,"Treatment of rats with macrolide antibiotics such as triacetyloleandomycin (TAO) dramatically increases the hepatic concentration of a cytochrome P-450 indistinguishable from P-450p, the major liver cytochrome induced by glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Wrighton, S. A., Maurel, P., Schuetz, E. G., Watkins, P. B., Young, B., and Guzelian, P. S. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 2171-2178). To investigate the mechanism of induction of P-450p, we treated rats for 4 days with these agents and found that dexamethasone and TAO induced the synthesis of P-450p at least 70- and 35-fold over control values, respectively, as estimated from measurements of P-450p mRNA translatable in a cell-free system. However, the accumulation of P-450p holocytochrome (measured as TAO-metabolite spectral complex) or P-450p protein (measured by quantitative immunoblotting) increased at least 150-fold by TAO but only 32-fold by dexamethasone. The possibility that TAO decreases the degradation of P-450p was supported by the observation that administration of TAO to dexamethasone-treated rats labeled with NaH[14C]O3 and [3H]-delta-aminolevulinic acid retarded the decay of radioactive immunoprecipitable P-450p protein (t1/2 = 60 versus 14 h) and heme (t1/2 = 73 versus 10 h). To confirm these results, P-450p protein synthesis was measured as radioactivity incorporated into immunoprecipitable P-450p in primary monolayer cultures of adult rat hepatocytes incubated with [3H]leucine. Dexamethasone treatment of the cultures stimulated P-450p synthesis by at least 30-fold whereas macrolides were without effect. However, macrolide antibiotics but not dexamethasone inhibited the disappearance of radiolabeled P-450p from cultured hepatocytes similar to the results obtained in vivo. We conclude that macrolide antibiotics induce P-450p, the most rapidly turning over cytochrome yet reported, by stimulating its synthesis indirectly and by blocking its degradation, significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1540622966,"The C21 side-chain cleavage enzymes from porcine adrenal and testicular microsomes have been purified and shown to resemble each other very closely (Nakajin, S., Shinoda, M., Hanui, M., Shively, J.E., and Hall, P.F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3971-3976). We have investigated the reason for the low levels of lyase activity shown by adrenal microsomes as compared to testicular microsomes. Competition for substrate with 21-hydroxylase in adrenal microsomes was excluded by studies showing that antibodies to 21-hydroxylase do not increase lyase activity in spite of almost complete inhibition of 21-hydroxylation. Reconstitution of the purified testicular enzyme in lipids extracted from adrenal and testicular microsomes excluded a specific effect of lipids on lyase activity. On the other hand, addition of porcine hepatic P-450 reductase to microsomes from adrenal and testis increased the activity of lyase relative to hydroxylase. The same effect is seen when reductase is added to the pure enzymes. As the concentration of reductase increases, lyase activity increases relative to hydroxylase until the rates of the activities become almost equal. Vmax is the same for both activities (hydroxylase and lyase) of the two enzymes (6.3-6.5 nmol/min/nmol of P-450). Km for reductase is approximately the same for the hydroxylase activities (0.4-0.6 microM) and for the lyase activities (1.7-2.0 microM) of the two enzymes. Antibodies to reductase, when added to testicular microsomes, inhibit both activities, but inhibition of lyase is greater than that of hydroxylase. The enzyme activity of reductase in testicular microsomes is 3-4 times higher than that of adrenal microsomes (0.29 and 0.08 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). These findings may account for the greater activity of lyase in testicular as opposed to adrenal microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W2130792052,"Abstract In order to establish the nature of the aldosterone synthetase activity in the adrenal cortex, we have used porcine adrenal, bovine adrenal cortex, highly purified bovine and porcine 11 beta-/18-hydroxylase, and antibodies raised against the latter enzyme. Mitochondria from two zones (glomerulosa and fasciculata) of the bovine cortex synthesize aldosterone, but those from glomerulosa are much more active than those from fasciculata. Partially purified (cholate-extracted plus ammonium sulfate-precipitated) extracts of mitochondria from the two zones are equally active in catalyzing all three steps in the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone. 18-Hydroxylase and aldehyde synthetase activities (18-hydroxycorticosterone----aldosterone) were completely precipitated from cholate extracts of mitochondria from bovine adrenal by antibodies to the pure porcine enzyme. No activity corresponding to any of the three steps in the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone was found in extramitochondrial fractions of the bovine cortex. Synthesis of aldosterone by the pure porcine enzyme was inhibited by antibodies to this enzyme and by metyrapone (an inhibitor of 11 beta-/18-hydroxylase). When fractions of porcine adrenal, resulting from purification of the enzyme from mitochondria, were exhaustively tested for any of the enzyme activities required for the synthesis of aldosterone, activity was found only in those fractions containing the 11 beta-/18-hydroxylase, i.e. no additional enzyme was discarded during the purification procedure. It is concluded that the only adrenocortical enzyme capable of synthesizing aldosterone in bovine and porcine adrenal is the well known 11 beta-hydroxylase, that the conversion of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone is catalyzed by this cytochrome P-450, and that this step (aldehyde synthetase) requires the heme of the P-450 as demonstrated by the photochemical action spectrum."

https://openalex.org/W2009365160,"T-cell receptors bind antigens only when the antigens are exposed on the cell surface. This can be studied best in the interaction of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) with target cells because the recognition and binding event can be separated from the lytic phase. Studies with CTL clones specific for HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 demonstrated that conjugates of CTL's and target cells can be formed in the absence of specific antigen recognition. Furthermore, T-cell receptor and target antigen cannot interact unless there is conjugate formation. This indicates that nonspecific conjugate formation between CTL's and target cells precedes the recognition of specific antigen by the T-cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1803227917,"Addition of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin to adult bovine chromaffin cells maintained in primary culture causes permeabilization of cell membrane as shown by the release of intracellular 86Rb+. The alpha-toxin does not provoke a spontaneous release of either catecholamines or chromogranin A, a protein marker of the secretory granule, showing the integrity of the secretory vesicle membrane. However the addition of micromolar free Ca2+ concentration induced the co-release of noradrenaline and chromogranin A. In alpha-toxin-treated cells, the released chromogranin A could not be sedimented and lactate dehydrogenase was still associated within cells, which provides direct evidence that secretory product is liberated by exocytosis. By contrast, permeabilization of cells with digitonin caused a Ca2+-dependent but also a Ca2+-independent release of secretory product, a dramatic loss of lactate dehydrogenase, as well as release of secretory product in a sedimentable form. Ca2+-dependent exocytosis from alpha-toxin-permeabilized cells required Mg2+-ATP and did not occur in the presence of other nucleotides. Thus alpha-toxin is a convenient tool to permeabilize chromaffin cells, and has the advantage of keeping intracellular structures, specifically the exocytotic machinery, intact."
https://openalex.org/W1965790897,"The generally mild bleeding disorder of von Willebrand disease is associated with abnormalities of two distinct plasma proteins, the large multimeric von Willebrand factor (vWF), which mediates platelet adhesion, and von Willebrand antigen II (vW AgII), which is of unknown function. The two proteins were found to have a common biosynthetic origin in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, which explains their simultaneous absence in the severe form of this hereditary disease. Shared amino acid sequences from a 100-kilodalton plasma glycoprotein and from vW AgII are identical to amino acid sequences predicted from a complementary DNA clone encoding the 5' end of vWF. In addition, these proteins have identical molecular weights and immunologic cross reactivities. Monoclonal antibodies prepared against both proteins recognize epitopes on the pro-vWF subunit and on a 100-kilodalton protein that are not present on the mature vWF subunit in endothelial cell lysates. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies against vWF recognize both pro-vWF and vWF subunits. Thus, the 100-kilodalton plasma glycoprotein and vW AgII are identical proteins and represent an extremely large propolypeptide that is first cleaved from pro-vWF during intracellular processing and then released into plasma."

https://openalex.org/W1590324956,"The human plasma glycoprotein Factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds specifically and with high affinity to sulfatides (galactosylceramide-I3-sulfate). vWF does not bind to gangliosides, neutral glycolipids, phospholipids, or cholesterol 3-sulfate. Although the largest oligomers of vWF bind preferentially to sulfatides, vWF monomers and dimers also bind but with reduced affinity. vWF binding is inhibited at high ionic strength or low pH, by some sulfated polysaccharides and by antibodies to vWF. Binding of vWF to sulfatides is probably responsible for its agglutination of aldehyde-fixed erythrocytes and may play a role in vWF-induced platelet adhesion or platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1490083974,"The implication of protein phosphorylation in the mitogenic action of high density lipoproteins (HDL) on bovine vascular endothelial cells was investigated by incubating endothelial cell cultures in the presence of 32P-labeled phosphoric acid. The incorporation of 32P into proteins was measured after fractionation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and autoradiography of the gel. In endothelial cells seeded at low density and made quiescent by serum starvation, HDL markedly and consistently enhanced the degree of phosphorylation of a Mr 27,000 protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Using 500 micrograms/ml HDL, 32P labeling of the 27-kDa protein was already measurable after 10 min of incubation and reached a maximum at 20-30 min. Minimal effective dose of HDL during a 30-min incubation period was in the range of 5-10 micrograms/ml. While the apolipoprotein moiety of HDL was able to mimic the effect of total HDL, the lipid part of HDL was not. Furthermore, fibroblast growth factor appeared to potentiate the effect of HDL on 27-kDa protein phosphorylation, in agreement with the synergism observed between fibroblast growth factor and HDL on endothelial cell proliferation. Two activators of protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol also induced the phosphorylation of the 27-kDa protein. These results suggest that the 27-kDa protein may be a physiological substrate for protein kinase C and that HDL could exert their mitogenic effect on endothelial cells through activation of protein kinase C and subsequent protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2085426689,"During ontogeny, T cell precursors must colonize the thymus to acquire immunocompetency. Using migration assays, a chemotactic activity was detected in conditioned media from avian embryonic thymic epithelial cells. The responding cells were shown to acquire T lymphocyte markers after homing into the thymus. Absorption experiments demonstrated surface receptors for the chemotactic substance on these hemopoietic precursors, which were not found on thymus-derived lymphocytes. Two peaks of chemotactic activity in the 1 kd-4 kd molecular weight range were detected after fractionation of thymic epithelial cell-conditioned medium. One of these activities was retained after heating to 95 degrees C but was destroyed after proteolytic treatment. Thus chemotactic peptides may be responsible for the thymic recruitment of the first hemopoietic precursors and may also be involved in the renewal of these precursors throughout adult life."
https://openalex.org/W2077669146,"Differentiation of lymphoid precursor cells in a variety of species is induced by polypeptide hormones such as thymopoietin for T cells and bursin for B cells. In the present experiments, bursin isolated from the bursa of Fabricius of chicken was found to induce the phenotypic differentiation of mammalian and avian B precursor cells but not of T precursor cells in vitro. Similarly, bursin increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate in cells of the human B-cell line Daudi but not in cells of the human T-cell line CEM. These inducing properties of bursin are the reverse of the inducing properties of thymopoietin produced by the thymus and are appropriate to a physiological B-cell-inducing hormone. A tripeptide sequence (lysyl-histidyl-glycyl-amide) was determined for bursin and confirmed by synthesizing this proposed structure and demonstrating chemical identity of the natural and synthetic peptides. Similarity of biological action was indicated in induction assays by elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate in Daudi B cells but not in CEM T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1542374459,"Ca2+-specific minielectrodes were used to monitor changes in the ambient free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]a) maintained by the intracellular organelles of permeabilized GH3 cells. Mitochondria maintained a [Ca2+]a steady state of around 500 nM and displayed a very high capacity for Ca2+ uptake. A nonmitochondrial pool, tentatively identified as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), displayed higher affinity for Ca2+ by maintaining a steady state of approximately 170 nM. The capacity of this pool was around 10 nmol/mg cell protein. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) released Ca2+ specifically from the ER, with an EC50 of approximately 2 microM, and gave maximal release of around 4 nmol Ca2+/mg of cell protein. Repeated InsR3 additions under conditions allowing for functional mitochondrial transport resulted in successively attenuated peaks, leading eventually to the depletion of the InsP3 sensitive portion of the ER. However, Ca2+ could still be released from the total ER pool with the ATPase inhibitor, vanadate. This InsP3-insensitive store did not reaccumulate InsP3 releasable Ca2+ nor could it directly refill the sensitive pool. However, the attenuation of the InsP3 responses could be overcome by repleting the sensitive pool with exogenous Ca2+ or by inhibiting Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria. The results suggest: 1) the ER is the major intracellular organelle buffering Ca2+ in nonstimulated GH3 cells; 2) InsP3 releases Ca2+ from only a portion of the ER; 3) the InsP3-sensitive and -insensitive ER pools are functionally distinct; 4) InsP3 addition results in a transfer of Ca2+ from the ER to the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1572621490,"The role of discrete domains of diphtheria toxin (DT) B chain in cytosol entry and cytotoxicity was investigated by linking a monoclonal antibody recognizing the human T cell-specific antigen T3 (UCHT1) to diphtheria toxin (UCHT1-DT), DT A subunit (UCHT1-DTA), or to a genetically engineered form of DT (UCHT1-MspSA) lacking the C-terminal 17-kDa portion of the B subunit. The N-terminal 21-kDa region of DT B chain increased toxicity of UCHT1-DTA 100-fold (UCHT1-MspSA) while addition of the C-terminal 17-kDa region (UCHT1-DT) increased toxicity 100-fold more. The cytotoxicity was dependent upon antibody binding as demonstrated by blocking toxicity with excess UCHT1. The differences in toxicity between these reagents were not due to differences in ADP-ribosylation activity of DT A chain, binding activity of the antibody moiety, extent of DT nicking, or the cross-linking method, so we conclude that the large differences in toxicity were due to the presence of different B chain domains. The large increase in toxicity by the C-terminal region of DT B did not appear to be caused by DT receptor binding. The lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl blocked the cytotoxic effect of DT, UCHT1-DT, and UCHT1-MspSA but not UCHT1-DTA."

This observation made it possible to construct cytocidal compounds that caused antigen-specific suppression of murine lymphocyte function. When daunomycin was coupled to the hapten conjugate of ovalbumin by an acid-sensitive cis-aconityl group, it caused hapten-specific impairment of immunocompetence in murine B lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1562283900,"Ferritin maintains iron in a bioavailable, nontoxic form for vertebrates and invertebrates, higher plants, fungi, and bacteria; the protein is formed from two classes of subunits (H and L) in ratios which vary in different cell types. Ferritin may be an abundant, differentiation-specific protein or a housekeeping protein. The red cells of embryos are specialized for iron storage and have abundant ferritin; iron regulates the synthesis of ferritin in such cells translationally by recruitment of stored, ferritin mRNA and by translational competition. To characterize mRNA regulated in such a manner, we prepared cDNA from reticulocytes of bullfrog tadpoles, a readily available source of embryonic red cells; moreover, no protein sequence information was available for nonmammalian ferritin. An almost full-length (817 base pairs) cDNA (pJD5F12) was isolated and sequenced, the 5' end was analyzed by primer extension, and the cloned DNA was used as a hybridization probe. We have shown that ferritin mRNA is stored in the cytoplasm and that the 5' end of the mRNA is heterogeneous. The 5'-untranslated region of ferritin mRNA consisted of 143 nucleotides in the major (65%) species and 146 or 152 in the minor species (approximately 17% each). (Heterogeneity is characteristic of some other abundant mRNAs, e.g. globin, which is also translationally regulated.) Since excess iron had no detectable effect on the heterogeneity of the 5' end of ferritin mRNA, the feature is more likely associated with mRNA abundance and/or cell specialization than translational control. In the bullfrog, as in humans and rats, ferritin is encoded by multiple genomic sequences (four to eight) which specify proteins of considerable homology. For example, 75 of the 81 amino acids present in all mammalian ferritins sequenced are also present in the frog; the overall homology between frogs and humans or rats is 59-66%. Ferritin H and L subunits in humans are distinct (overall homology 56%) and appear to have diverged from a common precursor relatively recently. In contrast, ferritin H and L subunits have high homology in tadpole red cells, determined by hybrid select translation, which suggests that bullfrog red cell ferritin may be close to the primordial sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2092842984,"Light causes both depolarization and adaptation to light in Limulus ventral photoreceptors. Both visual excitation and adaptation were blocked by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-beta-S), a metabolically stable analog of guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP). However, GDP-beta-S did not block the excitation caused by injection of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate into the cell. These results suggest a molecular cascade of visual excitation and adaptation: Light isomerizes the visual pigment rhodopsin, which in turn activates a guanyl nucleotide-binding protein. The binding protein then stimulates production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which causes release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1569342091,"Human interleukin-2 (IL-2) has 3 cysteine residues; cysteines 58 and 105 form an intramolecular disulfide bridge, whereas cysteine 125 has a free sulfhydryl group. In this study, site-specific mutagenesis has been used to modify the cysteine residues of recombinant Escherichia coli-derived IL-2 (rIL-2) to evaluate the functional structure of IL-2. Substitution or deletion of cysteine 105 disrupted the disulfide bridge and yielded a mutant protein which was 8-10 times less active than wild type rIL-2. A similar modification at position 58, however, reduced the activity of rIL-2 by more than 250-fold. Although substitution of serine for cysteine 125 did not affect IL-2 activity, deletion of cysteine 125 or deletion of amino acids in the vicinity of this cysteine yielded mutant proteins with little, if any, activity. These results indicate that the protein structure in the vicinity of both positions 58 and 125 is more critical than that close to position 105. These findings may provide a clue to the understanding of the functional structure of human IL-2."

https://openalex.org/W2111433219,"Mitogen-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and lymphocyte proliferation assessed by counting the number of cells were reduced by greater than 95% when cells were cultured at low density in the absence of serum. Supplementation with either transferrin or lipoprotein alone only partially restored lymphocyte responses. Addition of both transferrin and lipoproteins of each major subclass permitted mitogen-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation equal to that observed in serum-containing medium. The degree of enhancement was dependent on the concentration of the lipoprotein added and could not be explained by the nonspecific addition of protein to the defined medium. The mechanisms of growth promotion by various lipoprotein fractions did not appear to be explained by provision of cholesterol to the cells. Neither cholesterol nor cholesteryl ester from endogenous sources or supplied exogenously was able to enhance mitogen-induced lymphocyte responses. In contrast, fatty acids, phospholipid, and triglyceride alone supported lymphocyte responses. Furthermore, lipoproteins retained the capacity to enhance lymphocyte responses following extraction of neutral lipid. Both low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein, subclass 3, increased the number of cells initially activated by mitogenic stimulation and supported the subsequent continued growth of the activated cells. Low density lipoprotein was more efficient than high density lipoprotein, subclass 3, in this latter regard. These results indicate that lipoproteins can promote maximal growth of mitogen-activated lymphocytes in transferrin-containing medium by providing growth factors other than cholesterol necessary for initial activation and required for continued lymphocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1649862870,"Two tyrosine protein kinase activities have been identified previously to be present in HL-60 leukemia cells during induction of granulocytic and monocytic differentiation with a variety of differentiating agents. We have copurified a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (p93) and an activity associated with both the cytosol and membrane fractions (p60). Triton X-100 extracts from HL-60 cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were subjected to tyrosine-agarose chromatography, polypropyl aspartamide high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC using an antiphosphotyrosine IgG-derivatized column. Overall purification was 2700-fold for p93 and 1800-fold for p60. p60 and p93 are phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues and can use poly(Glu,Tyr)4:1, histone H1 and vasoactive intestinal peptide as substrates. Poly(Glu,Tyr)1:1 and poly(Glu,Ala,Tyr)6:3:1 were less effective substrates for p60 and p93. The activity of p93 was dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas p60 was dependent on Mg2+; however, the activity of p60 was stimulated in a synergistic manner by the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+, whereas the activity of p93 was not enhanced further by the combination of divalent ions. Both p60 and p93 were immunoprecipitated by an anti-v-src monoclonal antibody but only p93 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-v-fps/fes antibody. V8 protease digestion of p60 revealed one major proteolytic fragment containing phosphotyrosine, whereas V8 protease digestion of p93 produced two major peptides that were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These results suggest that, although p93 and p60 may possess some epitopic similarities, they have distinguishing phosphorylation sites. Moreover, p93, in contrast to p60, appears to be strictly associated with granulocytic/monocytic differentiation and related to the cellular fps/fes protooncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1552871052,"Genetic deficiencies in the nucleoside transport function markedly altered the abilities of cultured mutant S49 T lymphoblasts to transport, incorporate, and salvage exogenous hypoxanthine. The concentrations of exogenous hypoxanthine required to reverse azaserine toxicity and replenish azaserine-depleted nucleoside triphosphate pools in AE1 cells, a nucleoside transport-deficient clone, were about 10-fold higher than those required for wild type cells. In a similar fashion, guanine could reverse mycophenolic acid toxicity in wild type but not in AE1 cells. Surprisingly, a second nucleoside transport-deficient clone, 80-5D2, which had lost 80-90% of its ability to transport nucleosides, required lower hypoxanthine concentrations than the wild type parent to reverse these azaserine-mediated effects. The addition of submicromolar concentrations of either p-nitrobenzylthioinosine or dipyridamole, two potent inhibitors of nucleoside transport, to wild type cells mimicked the phenotype of the AE1 cells with respect to hypoxanthine. AE1 cells or p-nitrobenzylthioinosine-treated wild type cells could only transport hypoxanthine at 10-25% the rate of untreated wild type cells, whereas 80-5D2 cells could transport hypoxanthine more efficiently. Adenine transport was also diminished in AE1 and FURD-80-3-6 cells, but not to sufficiently low levels to interfere with their ability to salvage adenine to overcome azaserine toxicity. These studies on S49 cells altered in their nucleoside transport capacity provide powerful genetic evidence that purine nucleobases share a common transport function with nucleosides in these mammalian T lymphoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2019332302,"T lymphocytes recognize foreign antigen together with allele-specific determinants on membrane-bound class I and class II (Ia) gene products of the major histocompatibility complex. To identify amino acids of class II molecules critical to this recognition process, the genes encoding the beta chains of the I-Ak molecule were cloned from a wild-type B-cell hybridoma and from an immunoselected variant subline showing distinct serological and T-cell stimulatory properties. Nucleotide sequencing and DNA-mediated gene transfer established that a single base transition (G----A) encoding a change from glutamic acid to lysine at position 67 in the I-Ak beta molecule accounted for all the observed phenotypic changes of the variant cells. These results confirm the importance of residues 62 to 78 in the amino terminal domain of I-A beta for class II-restricted T-cell recognition of antigen and demonstrate the ability of a single substitution in this region to alter this recognition event."
https://openalex.org/W1538711286,"A sulfurtransferase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the prokaryote Acinetobacter calcoaceticus lwoffi by conventional protein fractionation techniques. Steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme revealed that its formal mechanism varies with the acceptor substrate employed. With inorganic thiosulfate as the sulfane sulfur-donor substrate and cyanide anion as the acceptor, the enzyme was shown to catalyze the reaction by a double displacement mechanism like that of mammalian rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1). In contrast, with a thiol as the acceptor substrate at relatively high concentrations, the reaction proceeds by a single displacement mechanism, reminiscent of catalysis by another sulfur-transferase, thiosulfate reductase, glutathione-dependent (EC 2.8.1.3). When dithiothreitol is the acceptor substrate, the enzyme cycles through both the single and double displacement pathways, with the flux through each depending differentially on the concentration of dithiothreitol employed. In view of both the relaxed acceptor substrate specificity and the corresponding variability of formal mechanism, the more general name of sulfane sulfurtransferase is proposed for this bacterial enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1603622101,"The com10 mutant of Haemophilus influenzae binds donor DNA reversibly, but is deficient in uptake. The DNA binding has all the characteristics of interaction with a protein receptor; it is saturable, reversible, and specific. However, binding specificity is 6-fold weaker in com10 than is uptake specificity in wild-type. The binding of small (120 base pairs) and large (14,400 base pairs) DNA molecules were compared. For small molecules, binding data fitted a straight line by Scatchard analysis (Bmax = 4.8 DNA molecules/cell, Kd = 0.5 X 10(-9) M). In contrast, for large DNA molecules, the Scatchard plot was not linear. A high affinity binding (Kd = 0.4 X 10(-12) M) and a lower affinity binding (Kd = 1.2 X 10(-11) M) were found with a total number of 3 molecules bound per cell. In wild-type cells, 3.2 large molecules were taken up per cell, whereas up to 40 small 120-base pair DNA fragments were taken up per cell. Uptake of small DNA molecules followed a Michaelis-Menten function with a Km of 0.5 X 10(-9) M and a maximal initial velocity of 1.5 molecules/cell/min at room temperature. For large DNA molecules, maximal initial velocity was approximately 2 molecules/cell/min at room temperature. The analysis of the binding and uptake data suggest to us that a receptor or a receptor complex is responsible for the uptake of either a single large DNA molecule or, successively, a number of small DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1676905571,"The adult bullfrog Rana catesbeiana has two major hemoglobin components, B and C. Component C polymerizes by disulfide bond formation between tetramers but component B does not. The amino acid sequence of the first 112 residues of the beta chain of component C has been reported (Baldwin, T. O., and Riggs, A. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6110-6118). We have completed the sequence of the beta chain of component C by determining the last 28 residues. This segment contains the 2 cysteinyl residues of the chain. Examination of models indicates that neither of these is in a readily accessible position for the formation of intertetramer disulfide bonds. Reactive sulfhydryl groups of the alpha chains are shown to be responsible for the initial formation of disulfide bonds between tetramers. The beta chains within the tetramers form disulfide bonds only when the hemoglobin molecules are subjected to prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C under oxygen. The beta chains of components B and C appear to be identical; the alpha chains are clearly quite different. This suggests that the alpha B and alpha C subunits interact in the association of the deoxygenated tetramers B and C to form what appears to be a BC2 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1510854421,"Detailed analyses regarding the effects of temperature and phospholipid fatty acid replacement on the capping of membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) have been performed using a recently described flow cytometric procedure (Cuchens, M. A., and Buttke, T. M. (1984) Cytometry 5, 601-609). Purified murine B cells were incubated for 12-20 h in the presence of bovine serum albumin-complexed 80 microM stearic (18:0), oleic (cis-18:1), or linoleic (cis, cis-18:2) free fatty acids. Unmodified and free fatty acid-treated cells were stained with fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig and subjected to pulse-shape (width) analyses to follow the kinetics of mIg capping. In both unmodified and free fatty acid-treated cells, capping of mIg occurred at all temperatures between 17 and 37 degrees C, but the rate of cap formation was temperature dependent. Arrhenius plots of mIg capping were linear, with activation energies ranging from 14 to 23 kcal/mol depending on the saturated/unsaturated fatty acid ratio of B cell phospholipids. Ligand-induced redistribution of mIg thus appears to be sensitive to changes in membrane acyl chain composition."
https://openalex.org/W1548792883,"The nuclear protein, p110, encoded by the avian MC29 virus degrades with a half-life of 30 to 40 min in virus-transformed cells. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis had no effect on this degradation. When inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis were added immediately after pulse-labeling the p110 with [35S]methionine, degradation was impeded. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide prior to, and after, the pulse extended the half-life of p110 further than post-treatment alone, and addition of both actinomycin D and cycloheximide to cells pretreated with cycloheximide extended the half-life even further. In cells depleted of cellular ATP using a glucose-deficient medium containing oligomycin, degradation of p110 was only partially inhibited, indicating no direct involvement of ATP in degradation. Isolation of nuclei or nuclear matrices containing labeled p110, with subsequent incubation, resulted in minimal loss of p110 during several hours. These results suggest that p110 is degraded by a protease which is itself labile and freely diffusible from the nucleus, and, in addition, degradation may involve interaction of p110 with newly synthesized RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2036111126,"The kinetic alpha-deuterium isotope effect on Vmax/Km for hydrolysis of NMN catalyzed by AMP nucleosidase at saturating concentrations of the allosteric activator MgATP2- is kH/kD = 1.155 +/- 0.012. This value is close to that reported previously for the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of nucleosides of related structure, suggesting that the full intrinsic isotope effect for enzymatic NMN hydrolysis is expressed under these conditions; that is, bond-changing reactions are largely or completely rate-determining and the transition state has marked oxocarbonium ion character. The kinetic alpha-deuterium isotope effect for this reaction is unchanged when deuterium oxide replaces water as solvent, corroborating this conclusion. Furthermore, this isotope effect is independent of pH over the range 6.95-9.25, for which values of Vmax/Km change by a factor of 90, suggesting that the isotope-sensitive and pH-sensitive steps for AMP-nucleosidase-catalyzed NMN hydrolysis are the same. Values of kH/kD for AMP nucleosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of NMN decrease with decreasing saturation of enzyme with MgATP2- and reach unity when the enzyme is less than half-saturated with this activator. This requires that the rate-determining step changes from cleavage of the covalent C-N bond to one which is isotope-independent. In contrast to the case for NMN hydrolysis, AMP nucleosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of AMP at saturating concentrations of MgATP2- shows a kinetic alpha-deuterium isotope effect of unity. Thus, covalent bond-changing reactions are largely or completely rate-determining for hydrolysis of a poor substrate, NMN, but make little or no contribution to rate-determining step for hydrolysis of a good substrate, AMP, by maximally activated enzyme. This behavior has several precedents."
