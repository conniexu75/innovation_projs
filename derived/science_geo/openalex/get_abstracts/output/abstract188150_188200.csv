They are divided into two groups: acetylcholinesterase, involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and butyrylcholinesterase of unknown function. Several crystal structures of the former have shown that the active site is located at the bottom of a deep and narrow gorge, raising the question of how substrate and products enter and leave. Human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has attracted attention because it can hydrolyze toxic esters such as cocaine or scavenge organophosphorus pesticides and nerve agents. Here we report the crystal structures of several recombinant truncated human BChE complexes and conjugates and provide a description for mechanistically relevant non-productive substrate and product binding. As expected, the structure of BChE is similar to a previously published theoretical model of this enzyme and to the structure of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase. The main difference between the experimentally determined BChE structure and its model is found at the acyl binding pocket that is significantly bigger than expected. An electron density peak close to the catalytic Ser198 has been modeled as bound butyrate. Cholinesterases are among the most efficient enzymes known.

An electron density peak close to the catalytic Ser198 has been modeled as bound butyrate. Cholinesterases are divided into two subfamilies according to their substrate and inhibitor specificities: acetylcholinesterase (AChE 1The abbreviations used are: AchE, acetylcholinesterase; BchE, butyrylcholinesterase; TcAChE, Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase; DmAChE, Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase; BTC, butyrylthiocholine; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.; EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3.1.1.8). Acetylcholinesterase is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released at the synaptic cleft and the neuromuscular junction in response to nerve action potential (1Massoulie J. Sussman J. Bon S. Silman I. Prog. Brain Res. 1993; 98: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, both AChE and BChE seem to be involved in roles that are independent of their catalytic activities, such as cell differentiation and development (2Meshorer E. Erb C. Gazit R. Pavlovsky L. Kaufer D. Friedman A. Glick D. Ben-Arie N. Soreq H. Science. 2002; 295: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 3Behra M. Cousin X. Bertrand C. Vonesch J.L. Biellmann D. Chatonnet A. Strahle U. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism of AChE is extremely efficient approaching diffusion-controlled rates (4Quinn D. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the Torpedo californica enzyme (TcAChE) showed that the active site catalytic Ser-His-Glu triad is found at the bottom of a 20-Å deep gorge lined mostly with aromatic residues (5Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). The structure also revealed the nature and the location of the previously described peripheral and “anionic” sites; the former, located at the outer rim of the gorge, has been postulated to be the initial substrate binding site (6Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand to this site has been proposed to slow down the traffic of substrate and product at the acylation site (6Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7De Ferrari G.V. Mallender W.D. Inestrosa N.C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although a similar peripheral site has been described for human BChE, site-directed mutagenesis and photo-affinity labeling studies showed that its location and the response upon ligand binding differ significantly from those of AChE (8Nachon F. Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Colas C. van Dorsselaer A. Goeldner M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10507-10513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Masson P. Legrand P. Bartels C.F. Froment M.T. Schopfer L.M. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2266-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The site to which the positively charged quaternary ammonium of choline moiety productively binds is found half-way down the gorge, in between the peripheral and acylation sites. Originally, there was a great deal of controversy concerning the nature of the residues involved in this site. Both the crystal structure and labeling experiments showed that positively charged ligands form π-cation interactions with Phe 330 and Trp 84 (numbering in italics corresponds to that of torpedo AChE) (10Harel M. Schalk I. Ehret-Sabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The physiological role of BChE remains unclair (11Chatonnet A. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 12Mack A. Robitzki A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 607-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although it is capable of hydrolyzing ACh and other acylcholines, so far no endogenous natural substrate has been described for this enzyme. Because BChE is relatively abundant in plasma (about 3 mg/liter), and can degrade a large number of ester-containing compounds, it plays important pharmacological and toxicological roles (13Lockridge O. Masson P. Neurotoxicology. 2000; 21: 113-126PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, BChE is a potential detoxifying enzyme to be used as a prophylactic scavenger against neurotoxic organophosphates such as the nerve gas soman (14Allon N. Raveh L. Gilat E. Cohen E. Grunwald J. Ashani Y. Toxicol. Sci. 1998; 43: 121-128PubMed Google Scholar, 15Broomfield C.A. Maxwell D.M. Solana R.P. Castro C.A. Finger A.V. Lenz D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 633-638PubMed Google Scholar, 16Raveh L. Grunwald J. Marcus D. Papier Y. Cohen E. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We have recently published the engineering and crystallization of a monomeric and partially glycosylated recombinant human BchE (17Nachon F. Nicolet Y. Viguie N. Masson P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we report several crystal structures of BChE complexed with a substrate, products, and conjugated to soman after aging. From these structures we propose alternative substrate and product binding that may be related to the high catalytic efficiency of the choline esterases. Crystallization of Recombinant BChE and Its Complexes—Recombinant human BChE suitable for crystallization was obtained, purified, and crystallized as described previously (17Nachon F. Nicolet Y. Viguie N. Masson P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). No butyrate was present in the culture medium and none was added during any step of the purification procedure. The 3-bromopropionate-BChE complex was obtained by soaking crystals for a few minutes in the mother liquor containing 100 mm bromopropionate (Sigma). The BChE-choline complex was obtained by soaking BChE crystals grown from a 2.1 m (NH4)2SO4 100 mm Bicine (Fluka), pH 9.0, crystallization solution, in the mother liquor containing 100 mm choline chloride. Crystallization of soman-aged BChE: racemic soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) was obtained from CEB Le Bouchet (Vert-le-Petit, France). The purified enzyme (6.6 mg/ml) was inhibited in the presence of 0.5 mm soman (∼5.5-fold molar excess) in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5. The reaction mixture was further incubated for 3 days at 4 °C, allowing enough time for completion of the aging reaction and the disappearance of the remaining unreacted soman. The inhibited enzyme was crystallized under the same conditions as the uninhibited BChE except that the mother liquor was buffered at pH 8.0 using a 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer solution. Soman-aged BChE and butyrylthiocholine (BTC) were cocrystallized at pH 6.5 (0.1 m MES buffer, 2.1 m (NH4)2SO4) with 10 mm BTC (Sigma). X-ray data were collected from a 4-day-old crystal to limit the loss of substrate by spontaneous hydrolysis. X-ray Data Collection and Structure Solution—All crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K in a nitrogen stream using 15–20% glycerol in the mother liquor as cryoprotectant. Data sets were collected at the following beamlines of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France): ID14-eh1 for the soman-aged BChE, ID14-eh2 for the native BChE, BM30 for the choline-BChE complex and the somanaged BTC complex, and ID14-eh4 for the 3-bromopropionate-BChE complex (see Table I). Data sets for the native, the soman-aged BchE, and soman-aged BChE-BTC complex crystals were integrated, scaled, and reduced using MOSFLM, SCALA, and TRUNCATE from the CCP4 suite (18Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Data sets from the choline-BChE complex and the 3-bromopropionate-BChE species were processed using the program XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3233) Google Scholar). Data collection from the 3-bromopropionate-BChE crystal was performed at a wavelength of 0.915 Å to measure the Br anomalous scattering signal. Subsequent data processing was performed without merging the Friedel mates to better evaluate the anomalous signal of the bromine atom. Molecular replacement was carried out with the native data set between 15- and 3.5-Å resolution using the program AMoRe (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) and the TcAChE structure (Protein Data Bank ID code: 2ACE) as a search model. A well constrasted solution with R-factor = 42.4% and correlation coefficient = 46.7% was obtained for one monomer per asymmetric unit. This solution was used as a starting model for manual rebuilding and refinement of BChE against all data to 2.0-Å resolution with the programs TURBO (21Roussel A. Cambillaud C. TURBO computer program. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar) and CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gross P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), respectively. Observed structure factors were scaled anisotropically and a bulk solvent correction was applied. Several cycles of refinement, manual rebuilding, and solvent addition led to a model with good statistics (Table I). Residues 1–3, 378–379, and 455 did not have matching electron density and, consequently, were not included in the model. Carbohydrate chains corresponding to five of the six expected glycosylation sites (17Nachon F. Nicolet Y. Viguie N. Masson P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have been included in the crystallographic model. They correspond to those connected to Asn57, Asn106, Asn241, Asn341, and Asn485. Although Asn256 was expected to be glycosylated, no electron density was observed for carbohydrate. Further examination of the electron density maps led to the inclusion of three molecules of glycerol, used as cryoprotectant, two sulfate ions, the precipitanting agent, one molecule of MES buffer, and two chloride ions. During refinement, an unexpected residual positive electron density was observed around the Oγ atom of the catalytic serine. At the final stages of refinement and after several attempts at modeling this density as corresponding to chemicals added either during purification or crystallization, a very good fit was only obtained when butyrate was used as a model (see Fig. 2).Table IData and refinement statisticsData setNative BChE3-BromopropionateCholineaThe choline-BChE complex was refined to 2.38-Å resolution.Soman-agedSoman-aged/BSChSpace groupI422I422I422I422I422Unit cell axes, a = b, c (Å)154.659 127.890154.920 126.939154.657 128.570154.616 127.307154.924 127.909X-ray sourceID14-eh2ID14-eh4 (λ = 0.915Å)BM30ID14-eh1ID14-eh2Resolution range (Å)55.0-2.02.72.3240.6-2.4354.7-2.3No. of unique reflections51,32637,108b3-Bromopropionate-BChE data processing was carried out without merging the Friedel mates to evaluate the anomalous signal from the bromine atom.29,37825,86828,730Completeness (%)98.6 (99.6)94.1 (69.9)87.4 (77.7)90.8 (88.6)86.5 (49.6)R sym0.074 (0.448)0.103 (0.506)0.061 (0.398)0.071 (0.217)0.081 (0.264)I σ(I)6.8 (1.7)11.75 (2.72)23.7 (4.3)7.6 (3.3)8.1 (2.8)Multiplicity7.3 (6.4)4.97 (4.08)9.9 (6.7)10.2 (6.2)6.4 (5.5)R-factor (free R-factor)0.195 (0.225)0.227 (0.229)0.215 (0.244)0.199 (0.235)0.199 (0.242)No. atomsProtein4,1994,2074,1574,175Others155154126147Solvent496264286337B (Å2)36.549.238.335.1Root mean square from idealityBond length (Å)0.0140.0080.0060.006Angles (°)1.61.41.31.4Dihedrals (°)23.723.423.423.6Impropers (°)1.080.880.830.81a The choline-BChE complex was refined to 2.38-Å resolution.b 3-Bromopropionate-BChE data processing was carried out without merging the Friedel mates to evaluate the anomalous signal from the bromine atom. Open table in a new tab The soman-aged BChE structure was solved using the rigid body refinement from the program CNS. The refined model statistics are shown in Table I. Residues 1–3, 378–379, and 455 and carbohydrates bonded to Asn256 and Asn485 had no significant matching electron density and consequently were not included in the final model. The soman-aged BChE structure also contains the three glycerol molecules, the two chloride ions, and one of the two sulfate ions previously observed in the native structure. The same refinement scheme was applied to this and the choline-BChE structure (Table I). The structure of the 3-bromopropionate-BChE complex was solved using the native BChE structure as a starting coordinate set in which the modeled butyrate had been removed. Anomalous difference and F obs – F calc difference Fourier maps were calculated with the program CNS. The starting Protein Data Bank coordinates, parameters, and topology files for 3-bromopropionate were obtained using PRODRG (23van Aalten D.M.F. Bywater R. Findlay J.B.C. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G.W. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was manually positioned to fit the electron density maps. Comparable B-factors for bromine and the other 3-bromopropionate atoms were obtained when fixing the occupancy to 0.5, suggesting that the putative butyryl moiety was only partially substituted during the soaking process. Crystallographic Analysis of Uninhibited Butyrylcholinesterase—The BChE crystal structure was originally solved by the molecular replacement method and subsequently refined to 2.0-Å resolution using CNS (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). As expected (24Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25Kaplan D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the overall structure of BChE is very similar to that of TcAChE. However, BChE does not form the dimer observed in previous structures of TcAChE (5Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar, 29Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B. Silman I. Sussman J.L.

Shafferman A. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In AChEs, the four helices involved in the subunit-subunit interaction are antiparallel and the active site openings are located on opposite sides of the dimer. Although homologous helices are found at the BChE dimer interface (residues 362–375 and 514–529), they are not antiparallel but form a ≈45° angle, and the active site openings are located on the same side of the dimer (not shown). Constraints resulting from the crystal packing could be responsible for these differences. Most differences between BChE and TcAChE are confined to 1) the residues lining the gorge, where the former enzyme has replaced several of the aromatic groups of the latter by hydrophobic ones; 2) the acyl-binding pocket, with the replacements of Phe 288 and Phe 290 of TcAChE by Leu286 and Val288, respectively; these changes make it possible for the binding of the bulkier butyrate substrate moiety in BChE (as discussed below); and 3) the conformation of the acyl loop (Fig. 1). In addition, the catalytic serine is connected to a large electron density peak whose identity is discussed in the next section. We note, in passing, that a previously modeled structure of BChE (24Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) differs from the actual structure precisely at these regions, indicating a strong bias toward the AChE starting atomic coordinate set. As an example, the acyl pocket of the model is significantly smaller than the one observed in the crystal structure. A Putative Butyryl Moiety Bound to the Catalytic Serine— During the crystallographic refinement procedure, it became evident that the catalytic serine 198 was bound to an unidentified moiety that was eventually modeled as butyrate with well matching electron density (Fig. 2a and “Experimental Procedures”). To confirm this result, we soaked native crystals with the butyrate isosteric analog 3-bromopropionate in which the γ carbon is replaced by a bromine atom. Subsequently, we collected x-ray data at 0.915-Å wavelength where bromine gives rise to a strong anomalous signal. Fig. 2b clearly indicates extensive substitution of the putative butyryl moiety by its brominated analog with essentially no changes in the shape of the corresponding electron density. In the case of the butyrated enzyme the length of the bond connecting the acyl group to the catalytic serine refined to values >2.0 Å, with no residual peaks in the Fourier difference electron density maps. On the other hand, maps calculated after crystallographic refinement of either restrained non-bonded butyrate or the tetrahedral intermediate display significant negative peaks, suggesting that neither one is a good model for the Ser198-butyrate interaction (Fig. 3). We are currently investigating the plausibility of the long bond using density function theory calculations. Although the source of the butyryl moiety is unknown, it seems to be essential for crystallization because “butyrate-depleted” samples were extremely difficult to crystallize. In fact, the few crystals grown from these samples had the putative butyrate still bound to Ser198. Furthermore, crystals were readily obtained when butyrate, or BTC, was added to the crystallization solutions. 2J. Colletíer, personal communication. This phenomenon may be related to the stabilization of the extensive acyl pocket in BChE by butyrate. A Mobile Acyl Loop—As we already noticed when comparing the native hBChE, TcAChE, and DmAChE structures, although the omega loop has the same conformation (see Fig. 1), residues belonging to the acyl loop have appreciably different orientations in the three cholinesterases. Furthermore, in BChE the acyl loop changes conformation depending on the substitution at the catalytic serine by butyrate or soman (Fig. 4). The reaction of soman and other related organophosphate esters with the catalytic serine of cholinesterases can be reversed initially by nucleophilic agents such as oximes (reviewed in (33Dawson R.M. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1994; 14: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). However, with time, serine phosphonylation becomes irreversible through dealkylation of an alkoxy chain on the phosphorus atom, a process called “aging” (34Harris L.W. Fleisher J.H. Clark J. Cliff W.J. Science. 1966; 154: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Except for its size, the resulting “aged” phosphonyl adduct is a structural analog of both the butyryl-serine association we have detected in the original BChE crystals and of the postulated deacylation tetrahedral intermediate. The protonated His438 forms a salt bridge with one oxygen atom of the methylphosphonyl moiety. Such a bridge was also observed in the crystal structures of soman-, sarin-, and phosphonylfluoridate-aged TcAChE (35Millard C.B. Kryger G. Ordentlich A. Greenblatt H.M. Harel M. Raves M.L. Segall Y. Barak D. Shafferman A. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7032-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A conformational change of the acyl loop has also been reported for the crystal structure of phosphonylfluoridate-aged TcAChE. Taken together, these changes in cholinesterases show that the acyl loop is flexible and are consistent with molecular dynamic studies, indicating that acetate could leave the AChE active site either directly through the gorge, “above” this loop or through an alternative exit located “below” it (36Enyedy I.J. Kovach I.M. Brooks B.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8043-8050Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, stabilization of the acyl loop by butyrate seems to be required for crystallization. Alternative Choline Binding Site at the Active Site—To obtain an image of the unsubstituted Ser198 in BChE, we soaked our crystals in a 100 mm choline chloride solution, pH 9.0. Indeed, maps calculated with x-ray data collected from a choline-soaked crystal displayed no electron density corresponding to the putative butyryl moiety. In this structure the Oγ from Ser198 displays two approximately equally occupied conformations: a classical one where it forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic His438, and a much less expected one, where it has turned away from the histidine and establishes a hydrogen bond with the main chain N-H from Ala199 at the oxyanion hole (Fig. 5, a and b). It is unlikely that this is solely due to the deprotonation of His438 at pH 9.0, because identical crystals grown at pH 6.5 display similar Ser198 conformations when soaked with cocaine, tacrine, or decamethonium, and a native structure solved at pH 9.0 still has the putative butyrate bound to the active site (not shown). Another surprising feature in this structure is the orientation of the bound choline. Although, as expected, its quaternary ammonium group binds close to Trp82 through a π-cation interaction, the alcohol group points roughly toward the gorge entrance and forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule that, in turn, interacts with the main chain carbonyl O from His438. Although choline binding may not be physiologically relevant (given the high choline concentration in the soaking solution and the basic pH), it shows that this reaction product may adopt at least two conformations at the active site: the productive one, as part of butyrylcholine bound to the active site region, and an alternative one, as observed here (Fig. 5, a and b). The existence of an alternative choline binding mode prompted us to perform an additional experiment where crystals obtained from protein previously inhibited with soman were soaked in a solution containing the substrate BTC. In the complex between soman-aged BChE and BTC (pH 6.5) (Fig. 5c), the latter binds very much like choline, with its ammonium group close to Trp82 and its carbonyl group hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule topologically equivalent to the one described above for the BChE-choline complex (Fig. 5). This confirms the above-stated notion that substrate binding through π-cation interactions is bimodal and that a tetrahedral adduct bound to the catalytic serine is sterically compatible with intermediate site substrate binding as defined here by the soman-aged BChE-BTC complex. Crystallographic data for all the structures are presented in Table I. Taken together, the results presented here, in conjuction with data from the literature, shed new light concerning the catalytic mechanism of cholinesterases. These enzymes appear to function through an assembly line approach where every step in the reaction is tightly controlled by the protein environment and extremely efficient use is made of the available substrate binding sites. Peripheral sites serve as attraction centers for substrate at the outer rim of the gorge (an observation confirmed by a BChE-decamethonium complex; not shown). From one or several of these positions, substrate can move into an intermediate site, equivalent to the one observed in the soman-aged BChE-BTC complex. Computer graphics simulations show that, as predicted by Masson et al. (9Masson P. Legrand P. Bartels C.F. Froment M.T. Schopfer L.M. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2266-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a simple rotation of the molecule around its quaternary ammonium group, bound at the π-cation site, can bring the substrate to productive binding. Hydrogen bonding of the carbonyl group of BTC to a water molecule, rather than to protein, may facilitate this transition. It has been proposed that the position of the catalytic triad in cholinesterases, at the bottom of a 20-Å-deep gorge allows the exothermic formation of the transition state in a “dry” environment (37Harel M. Quinn D.M. Haridasan K.N. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The results presented here provide an additional explanation for the location of the buried catalytic triad as the presence of peripheral and intermediate sites at the gorge allow for a drastic reduction of substrate mobility, leading it to the active site in a most efficient way. The presence of a putative butyrate bound to Ser198 could be related to the reactivity and/or stability of the catalytic serine. This is supported by the recent observation by Bourne et al. (38Bourne Y. Taylor P. Radic Z. Marchot P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) who described a carbonate or acetate molecule found close to the catalytic serine of mouse AChE in complex with a peripheral site inhibitor. Interestingly, other structures of AChE also display electron densitiy peaks very close to the catalytic serine (39Harel M. Kryger G. Rosenberry T.L. Mallender W.D. Lewis T. Fletcher R.J. Guss J.M. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 40Weik M. Ravelli R.B. Kryger G. McSweeney S. Raves M.L. Harel M. Gros P. Silman I. Kroon J. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Although the distance between Oγ of Ser198 and Nϵ2 of His438 of 2.8 Å is compatible with hydrogen bonding, the angle between Cδ2, Nϵ2, and Oγ is about 170°, a value that is unfavorable for that type of interaction. In fact, if this hydrogen bond geometry were better, proton transfer to the alcoholate of the choline moiety would be less favorable (similar observations have been made on serine proteases. For example, the Streptomyces griseus protease A structure refined at 1.8-Å resolution (41Matthews D.A. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Freer T. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sielecki A.R. Hendrickson W.A. Broughton C.G. Delbaere L.T. Brayer G.D. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 781-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) shows a Ser-His hydrogen bond distance of 3.1 Å and the orientation is far from optimal, suggesting that the bond is very weak or even absent). One way to overcome the problem of poor geometry of the His-Ser hydrogen bond is to propose that the side chain of His438 rotates to optimize hydrogen bonding to Ser198 when this residue is free. However, our observations do not support this hypothesis: His438 seems to be well ordered and be similarly oriented in all the structures discussed here. On the other hand, we have observed that in several butyrate-free BChE complexes the Oγ atom of Ser198 is highly disordered and shows no tendency to bind to His438 (see, for example, Fig. 5). Furthermore, a very recent report by Masson et al. (43Masson P. Nachon F. Bartels C.F. Froment M.T. Ribes F. Matthews C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicates that in the presence of excess substrate and low pH, BChE is still active, although His438 should remain protonated under these conditions. Consequently, neither our results, nor previously reported data (41Matthews D.A. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Freer T. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sielecki A.R. Hendrickson W.A. Broughton C.G. Delbaere L.T. Brayer G.D. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 781-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 43Masson P. Nachon F. Bartels C.F. Froment M.T. Ribes F. Matthews C. Lockridge O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), favor the deprotonation of the catalytic serine by His438 during turnover. One alternative to deprotonation of the catalytic serine by His438 during turnover would be a concerted product release/substrate binding at Ser198, whose Oγ would remain deprotonated throughout the catalytic cycle. The presence of a putative serine-bound butyrate moiety in the purified BChE hints at this possibility. As discussed above, upon productive substrate binding at the active site the C=O bond becomes polarized through its interaction with the oxyanion hole: a lone pair orbital develops on the oxygen atom, and an empty orbital forms on the carbon atom, facilitating the nucleophilic attack of the Oγ atom of Ser198 on the partially positive carbon atom. This makes the first step of the reaction easier by lowering the energy barrier toward the formation of the first tetrahedral intermediate. A similar mechanism would operate when a water molecule hydrolyzes the acyl-enzyme intermediate. X-ray structures of both “native” and soman-aged BChE have a glycerol molecule bound to the π-cation site. As glycerol was used only as cryoprotectant (see the “Experimental Procedures”), its presence in the active site gorge confirms the broad specificity of the π-cation site and that the substrate specificity is mainly due to residues Val288 and Leu286 lining the acyl pocket. The presence of a moiety next to the catalytic serine is intriguing. Several lines of evidence indicate that in our case it is most likely butyrate as it can be replaced by 3-bromopropionate, it is displaced by choline, and the presence of butyrate is essential for crystrallization. However, additional experiments will be required to definetively establish its identity. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank codes 1P0I (BChE with butyrate), 1P0Q (BChE with aged soman), 1P0M (BChE plus choline), and 1P0P (BChE with aged soman and BTC) and will be released upon publication. We are grateful to the staffs of ID14 and FIP beamlines from the European Synchrotron Radiation facility. Julien Lescar is especially thanked for his help with data collection from the 3-bromopropionate-BChE crystal."

Cobalamin (CBL), 1The abbreviations used are: CBL, cobalamin; Ado-CBL, adenosylcobalamin; Uro′III, uroporphyrinogen III; TMSs, transmembrane segments; CoA, coenzyme A; CR, corrin ring. along with chlorophyll, heme, siroheme, and coenzyme F430, constitute a class of the most structurally complex cofactors synthesized by bacteria. The distinctive feature of these cofactors is their tetrapyrrole-derived framework with a centrally chelated metal ion (cobalt, magnesium, iron, or nickel). Methylcobalamin and Ado-CBL, two derivatives of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) with different upper axial ligands, are essential cofactors for several important enzymes that catalyze a variety of transmethylation and rearrangement reactions. Among the most prominent vitamin B12-dependent enzymes in bacteria and archaea are the methionine synthase isozyme MetH from enteric bacteria; the ribonucleotide reductase isozyme NrdJ from deeply rooted eubacteria and archaea; diol dehydratases and ethanolamine ammonia lyase from enteric bacteria involved in anaerobic glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, and ethanolamine fermentation; glutamate and methylmalonyl-CoA mutases from clostridia and streptomycetes; and various CBL-dependent methyltransferases from methane-producing archaea (1Banerjee R.

Most prokaryotic organisms as well as animals (including humans) and protists have enzymes that require CBL as cofactor, whereas plants and fungi are thought not to use it. Among the CBL-utilizing organisms, only some bacterial and archaeal species are able to synthesize CBL de novo (6Martens J.H. Bargv H. Warren M.J. Jahn D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there are two distinct routes of the CBL biosynthesis in bacteria (Fig. 1): the well studied oxygen-dependent (aerobic) pathway studied in Pseudomonas denitrificans and the oxygen-independent (anaerobic) pathway that was partially resolved in Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus megaterium and Propionibacterium shermanii (7Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of Ado-CBL from Uro′III, the last common precursor of various tetrapyrrolic cofactors, requires about 25 enzymes (6Martens J.H. Bargv H. Warren M.J. Jahn D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and can be divided into two major parts. The first part, the corrin ring synthesis, is different in the anaerobic and aerobic pathways; the former starts with the insertion of cobalt into precorrin-2, whereas in the latter, this chelation reaction occurs only after the corrin ring synthesis. The second part of the Ado-CBL pathway is common for both anaerobic and aerobic routes and involves adenosylation of CR, attachment of the aminopropanol arm, and assembly of the nucleotide loop that bridges the lower ligand dimethylbenzimidazole and CR (4O'Toole G.A. Rondon M.R. Trzebiatowski J.R. Suh S.-J. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 710-720Google Scholar). The corresponding CBL genes from S. typhimurium and P. denitrificans have different traditional names, mainly using prefixes cbi and cob, respectively (Fig. 1). For example, S. typhimurium has two separate genes, cbiE and cbiT, that encode precorrin methyltransferase and decarboxylase, respectively, whereas in P. denitrificans these functions are encoded by one gene, cobL. For consistency, we use the S. typhimurium names whenever possible. In particular, we assign gene names to experimentally uncharacterized genes using analysis of orthology. The anaerobic and aerobic pathways contain several pathway-specific enzymes. First, the cobalt insertion is performed by the ATP-dependent aerobic cobalt chelatase of P. denitrificans, which consists of CobN, CobS, and CobT subunits, and two distinct, ATP-independent, single subunit cobalt chelatases, CbiK from S. typhimurium and CbiX from B. megaterium, which are associated with the anaerobic pathway (8Debussche L. Couder M. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7445-7451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Raux E. Thermes C. Heathcote P. Rambach A. Warren M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Dahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 370: 505-516Crossref Google Scholar). Second, since the majority of the intermediates of the anaerobic, but not aerobic, pathway have the cobalt ion inserted into the macrocycle, the pathways could use enzymes with different substrate specificities. CobG from P. denitrificans requires molecular oxygen to oxidize precorrin 3A and is specific for the aerobic pathway (11Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respective CR oxidation of anaerobic route is probably mediated via the complexed cobalt ion, which can assume different valence states. In summary, CbiD, CbiG, and CbiK are specific to the anaerobic route of S. typhimurium, whereas CobE, CobF, CobG, CobN, CobS, CobT, and CobW are unique to the aerobic pathway of P. denitrificans. In most bacteria, cobalt and other heavy metal ions are mainly accumulated by the fast and unspecific CorA transport system (12Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional cobalt transporter, a part of the cobalt-dependent nitrile hydratase gene cluster, was identified in Rhodococcus rhodochrous and, together with some nickel-specific transporters, belongs to the HoxN family of chemiosmotic transporters (13Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Further, the ATP-dependent transport system CbiMNQO, encoded by the CBL biosynthetic operon in S. typhimurium, probably mediates high affinity transport of cobalt ions for the B12 synthesis (14Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vitamin B12, cobinamide, and other corrinoids are actively transported in enteric bacteria using the TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor BtuB in the complex with the ABC transport system BtuFCD (15Cadieux N. Bradbeer C. Reeger-Schneider E. Koster W. Mohanty A.K. Wiener M.C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 706-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Vitamin B12 is known to repress expression of the btuB genes of Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium (16Nou X. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6719-6728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the cob operon in S. typhimurium (17Ravnum S. Andersson D.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). No B12-regulatory genes were identified in bacteria, but it was shown that Ado-CBL is an effector molecule involved in the regulation of CBL genes in enterobacteria (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved B12-box, a cis-acting translational enhancer element, contains a stem-loop structure that would mask the ribosome binding site as well as several additional RNA structural elements. This element is found in the 5′-untranslated regions of the CBL operons and is absolutely required for their regulation, which is conferred mainly at the translational level (17Ravnum S. Andersson D.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the btuB mRNA leader sequence can directly bind an effector molecule, Ado-CBL, and consequently undergo conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the RNA and that the likely mechanism of regulation involves formation of two alternative RNA structures (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Combination of the comparative analysis of gene regulation, positional clustering of genes, and phylogenetic profiling, when applied to a metabolic pathway in a variety of bacterial species, is a powerful approach to the search of missing genes within the pathway as well as identification of specific metabolite transport genes (19Gelfand M.S. Novichkov P.S. Novichkova E.S. Mironov A.A. Brief Bioinform. 2000; 1: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Here we use this combined comparative approach for the analysis of the CBL biosynthetic pathway in prokaryotes. The expression of genes involved in the CBL biosynthesis and vitamin B12 transport in eubacteria was predicted to be regulated mainly by a conserved RNA regulatory element, the B12 element. In four archaeal genomes, a new DNA-type regulatory signal was observed upstream of the CBL-related genes. After reconstruction of the B12 regulon and the CBL pathway in most bacterial and archaeal genomes, we identified several new enzymes and transporters related to the CBL biosynthesis. In particular, numerous new cobalt transporters and chelatases, as well as new CR methyltransferases, were found. Furthermore, the vitamin B12 transporters are widely distributed in bacteria and archaea and mostly B12-regulated. Finally, the B12 element was predicted to regulate B12-independent methionine synthase and ribonucleotide reductase isozymes in bacteria that also have corresponding B12-dependent isozymes. Complete and partial sequences of bacterial genomes were downloaded from GenBank™ (22Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data were also obtained from the World Wide Web sites of the Institute for Genomic Research (www.tigr.org), the University of Oklahoma's Advanced Center for Genome Technology (www.genome.ou.edu/), the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (www.sanger.ac.uk/), the DOE Joint Genome Institute (jgi.doe.gov), and the ERGO Data base (ergo.integratedgenomics.com/ERGO) (23Overbeek R.

Procedings of the Third International Conference on “Complex Systems: Control and Modeling Problems,” Samara, Russia, September 4–9, 2001. The Institute of Control of Complex Systems, Samara, Russia2001: 623-625Google Scholar) was used to search for conserved RNA regulatory elements. The input RNA pattern included both the RNA secondary structure and the sequence consensus motifs. The RNA secondary structure was described as a set of the following parameters: the number of helices, the length of each helix, the loop lengths, and description of the topology of helix pairs. The initial RNA pattern of the B12 element was constructed using a training set of upstream regions of the btuB orthologs from proteobacteria. Each genome was scanned with the B12 element pattern, resulting in detection of approximately 200 B12 elements. A protein similarity search was done using the Smith-Waterman algorithm implemented in the GenomeExplorer program (25Mironov A.A. Vinokurova N.P. Gelfand M.S. Mol. Biol. 2000; 34: 222-231Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using ClustalX (26Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). Orthologous proteins were initially defined by the best bidirectional hits criterion (27Tatusov R.L. Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3035) Google Scholar) and, if necessary, confirmed by construction of phylogenetic trees. Note that the fact of gene absence used in phylogenetic profiling is reliable only for complete genomes. The phylogenetic trees were created by the maximum likelihood method implemented in PHYLIP (28Felsenstein J. J. Mol. Evol. 1981; 17: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (11195) Google Scholar) and drawn using the GeneMaster program. 2A. Mironov, unpublished results. Distant homologs were identified using PSI-BLAST (29Altschul S. Madden T. Schaffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Transmembrane segments (TMSs) were predicted using the TMpred program (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html). Conserved Structure of the B12 Element—Previously, we have described two highly conserved RNA elements, RFN and THI, involved in the regulation of the riboflavin and thiamin biosynthetic genes in bacteria (20Rodionov D.A.

Vitamin B12-dependent regulation of the btuB and cbiA genes in enterobacteria requires their upstream regions and occurs via a post-transcriptional mechanism involving formation of alternative RNA structures. Several recent studies describe possible secondary structures of the E. coli btuB and S. typhimurium cbiA 5′-untranslated leader sequences, but the proposed structures have a limited number of conserved elements (17Ravnum S. Andersson D.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Using the comparative analysis of nearly 200 regulatory regions of vitamin B12-related genes in bacteria, we derived a highly conserved RNA structure named here the B12 element (30Vitreschak A.G. Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. RNA. 2003; 9: 1084-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Similarly to the RFN and THI elements, the B12 element has a set of unique stem-loops closed by a single base stem and highly conserved sequence regions, including the previously known B12-box (Fig. 2). In addition to seven conserved stem-loops, the B12 element has three additional facultative stem-loops and one internal variable structure. Since direct binding of Ado-CBL to the btuB mRNA leader was recently shown (18Nahvi A. Sudarsan N. Ebert M.S. Zou X. Brown K.L. Breaker R.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1043-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), it is interesting that all internal loops of the B12 element are highly conserved on the sequence level and, therefore, may be involved in Ado-CBL binding. By analogy to the model of regulation for riboflavin and thiamin regulons (20Rodionov D.A. Vitreschak A.G. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48949-48959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 21Vitreschak A.G. Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), a model of regulation of B12-related genes based on formation of alternative RNA structures involving the B12 elements is suggested (30Vitreschak A.G.

B12 Regulon: Identification of Genes and Regulatory Elements—Initially, orthologs of the cobalamin biosynthetic and transport genes (“CBL genes” below) in all available prokaryotic genomes were identified by similarity search (Table I). For further analysis, positional clusters (including possible operons) of the CBL genes are also described in Table I. The multifunctional gene cysG of E. coli, which encodes URO′III methyltransferase (CysGA) and precorrin-2 oxidase/ferrochelatase (CysGB) activities and is partially shared by the CBL and siroheme biosynthesis, was considered only if it was co-localized with other CBL genes.Table ICobalamin biosynthesis and transport genes and B12-elements in bacteria Then we scanned nearly 100 genomic sequences using the RNA-PATTERN program and the pattern of a novel, B12-specific RNA element (30Vitreschak A.G. Rodionov D.A. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. RNA. 2003; 9: 1084-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and found approximately 200 B12 elements unevenly distributed in 66 eubacterial genomes (Table I). All genomes with B12 elements, except Bacillus cereus, contain CBL biosynthesis and/or transport genes. Most obligate pathogenic bacteria (see below) as well as Aquifex aeolicus have neither CBL genes nor B12 elements. Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Bordetella pertussis, Magnetococcus, and all archaeal genomes lack B12 elements but have CBL genes. The detailed phylogenetic and positional analysis of the CBL genes and the B12 elements is given below. In attempt to analyze potential cobalamin regulons in archaea, a large phylogenetic group without B12 elements, we collected upstream regions of all CBL genes and applied the signal detection procedure to each archaeal genome (31Gelfand M.S. Koonin E.V. Mironov A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The same strongest signal, a 15-bp palindrome with consensus 5′-TGGATAantTATCCA-3′, was observed in candidate cobalamin regulons in three Pyrococcus genomes (Table I). To find new members of the regulon, the derived profile (named CBL-box) was used to scan the genomes. The cobalamin regulon in the pyrococci appears to include all CBL biosynthesis and transport genes except btuR. In addition, conserved CBL-boxes were identified upstream of the P. horikoshii genes PH0021, PH1306, PH0275, PH1928, and PH0272 and their orthologs in two other pyrococci. These genes are predicted to encode anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase NrdDG, two subunits of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase MutB, succinyl-CoA synthase SucS, and methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase MmcE, respectively. All of these genes are unrelated to the CBL biosynthesis or transport, but their co-regulation with the CBL genes seems to be rational because of their direct or indirect association with B12-dependent enzymes (see below). The same CBL-specific profiles were obtained for two other archaea, Aeropyrum pernix and Sulfolobus solfataricus, but not for the remaining archaeal species. The predicted CBL regulon of A. pernix again contains the B12 transport system and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Among all archaea in this study, only pyrococci and A. pernix are likely to be unable to synthesize CBL de novo but may uptake and transform CBL precursors to Ado-CBL. The CBL regulon of S. solfataricus includes, in addition to the cobT and btuFCD genes, the cbiGECHDTLF genes for the de novo CBL synthesis and predicted cobalt transporter hoxN. To select bacterial species that potentially require coenzyme B12 for their metabolism, we carried out a similarity search for all known B12-dependent enzymes in prokaryotic genomes. As a result, Chlamydia spp., Rickettsiae spp., Neisseria spp., Streptococcaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, Pasteurellaceae, ϵ-proteobacteria, Borellia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, and Xylella fastidiosa (obligate pathogenic bacteria) as well as A. aeolicus were found to have no B12-dependent enzymes (Supplementary Table VI). This finding is in agreement with the absence of the CBL biosynthetic and transport genes as well as with the absence of B12 elements in these microorganisms. However, two other bacteria without any known B12-dependent enzyme, Bacillus subtilis and S. aureus, were predicted to have the B12 transport system BtuFCD. Interestingly, btuFCD-pduO is the only B12 element-regulated operon in B. subtilis. This shows that other, currently unknown, B12-dependent enzymes may be present in these bacteria. Vitamin B12 Transporters—Nearly one-fourth of the B12-utilizing bacteria appear to have no complete pathway for the CBL biosynthesis and, therefore, should actively transport vitamin B12 or some precursor from the external medium. The only known transport system for vitamin B12 is the ABC transporter BtuFCD of enteric bacteria, which consists of periplasmic substrate-binding protein BtuF, two transmembrane subunits BtuC, and two peripheral ATP-binding subunits BtuD. In Gram-negative bacteria, the translocation of vitamin B12 across the outer membrane involves B12-specific receptor BtuB and the periplasmic energy-coupling proteins TonB, ExbB, and ExbD, which are shared between various TonB-dependent receptors. Thus, the B12-specific components of the transporters are BtuBFCD and BtuFCD in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. The corresponding components of ABC transporters involved in the uptake of ferric siderophores, heme, and vitamin B12 are similar and belong to the same families (32Koster W. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, a similarity search is not sufficient to dissect the B12 and ferric transporters in species distant from enteric bacteria. We combined a similarity search with identification of highly specific regulatory B12 elements and with positional analysis of genes. The phylogenetic trees for the protein families formed by various components of the B12 and ferric transporters revealed B12-specific subfamilies within each family (data not shown). The predicted transporters for vitamin B12 were found to be widely distributed in prokaryotes; among B12-utilizing bacteria with complete genomes, they were not found only in four cyanobacterial and three archaeal species, in Mycobacterium spp., and in Bacillus cereus (Supplementary Table VI). In most cases, components of B12 transporters are encoded by clusters of co-localized genes that are regulated by the B12 element (Table I). Interestingly, the regulatory B12 element was found upstream of the exbBD-tonB operon from Rhodobacter capsulatus encoding common components of the TonB-dependent receptors for ferric siderophores and vitamin B12. Various variants of incomplete B12 transport systems were revealed in some bacteria. The btuFCD genes were absent in Nitrosomonas europaea and Xanthomonas axonopodis, and the btuCD genes were absent in B. pertussis, Methylobacillus flagellatus, Azotobacter vinelandii, Listeria monocytogenes, and Leptospira interrogans. The btuB gene of N. europaea, M. flagellatus, A. vinelandii, and X. axonopodis is located within the btuB-btuM-btuR cluster, which is a single fused gene in the latter bacterium. The hypothetical protein BtuM is not similar to any known protein and has five predicted transmembrane segments, indicating that, in these bacteria, BtuM may be a new type of transmembrane component of the B12 transporter, substituting the BtuC and BtuD proteins. The btuB-btuN cluster, one more example of the conserved positional linkage between BtuB and another hypothetical transmembrane protein (BtuN has four predicted TMSs), was found in BtuCD-deficient B. pertussis, M. flagellatus, and X. axonopodis. Similarly to BtuM, BtuN may be involved in the BtuCD-independent transport of vitamin B12. The BtuFC system of S. aureus is another example of an incomplete transporter that does not include a specific ATPase, suggesting that it can share the ATPase component with some other ABC transport system. Cobalt Transporters—The cbiMNQO locus encoding an ATP-dependent transport system for cobalt was identified in the CBL-producing microorganisms from different taxonomic groups including enterobacteria, ϵ- and δ-proteobacteria, the Bacillus/Clostridium group, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, chloroflexi, and archaea (Table II). In most cases, the cbiMNQO genes were found either within large CBL operons or as separate operons and were preceded by regulatory B12 elements. However, among 56 CBL-producing bacteria in this study, only 24 possess this high affinity cobalt transport system. This indicates the existence of other cobalt-specific transporters required for the CBL biosynthesis. Analysis of possible operon structures and regulatory B12 elements allowed us to identify new candidate cobalt transporters (Table II).Table IIDifferences in the predicted cobalt transporters required for cobalamin synthesis in prokaryotesTaxGenomeCandidate cobalt transportersαMLO, BME, AUCbtABBJA, SM, PD, RSCbtCRPA, SARHoxNRCCbiMNQOβBPS, RSOHoxNγTY, KP, YECbiMNQOPP, PU, PY, PACbtABB/CBE, BI, HMO, DHA LMO, CA, CPE, CB, DFCbiMNQOActTFU, RKCbtEDI?MTCbtGSX, PICbiMNQOCyaPMA, CY, SNHupEAN, TELCbiMNQOCFBPG, BXCbtDCLCbiMNQOSPTDECbtFLI?ATVO, STOHoxNMAC, MJ, TH, AGCbiMNQOHSL, MK, PK?OtherGME, MCO, CAUCbiMNQOFNCbtF"

https://openalex.org/W2024852738,"5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors are cation-selective transmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop superfamily1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The single-channel conductance of human recombinant 5-HT3 receptors assembled as homomers of 5-HT3A subunits, or heteromers of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits, are markedly different, being 0.4 pS (refs 6, 9) and 16 pS (ref. 7), respectively. Paradoxically, the channel-lining M2 domain of the 5-HT3A subunit would be predicted to promote cation conduction, whereas that of the 5-HT3B subunit would not7. Here we describe a determinant of single-channel conductance that can explain these observations. By constructing chimaeric 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits we identified a region (the ‘HA-stretch’)10 within the large cytoplasmic loop of the receptor that markedly influences channel conductance. Replacement of three arginine residues unique to the HA-stretch of the 5-HT3A subunit by their 5-HT3B subunit counterparts increased single-channel conductance 28-fold. Significantly, ultrastructural studies of the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor11 indicate that the key residues might frame narrow openings that contribute to the permeation pathway. Our findings solve the conundrum of the anomalously low conductance of homomeric 5-HT3A receptors and indicate an important function for the HA-stretch in Cys-loop transmitter-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2167355903,"Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, which play an important role in signal integration, have been implicated in tumorigenesis in multiple lineages, including breast cancer. We demonstrate, herein, that Src kinases regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade via altering the function of the PTEN tumor suppressor. Overexpression of activated Src protein-tyrosine kinases in PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells does not alter AKT phosphorylation, an indicator of signal transduction through the PI3K pathway. However, in the presence of functional PTEN, Src reverses the activity of PTEN, resulting in an increase in AKT phosphorylation. Activated Src reduces the ability of PTEN to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositols in micelles and promotes AKT translocation to cellular plasma membranes but does not alter PTEN activity toward water-soluble phosphatidylinositols. Thus, Src may alter the capacity of the PTEN C2 domain to bind cellular membranes rather than directly interfering with PTEN enzymatic activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN is increased in breast cancer cells treated with pervanadate, suggesting that PTEN contains sites for tyrosine phosphorylation. Src kinase inhibitors markedly decreased pervanadate-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN. Further, expression of activated Src results in marked tyrosine phosphorylation of PTEN. SHP-1, a SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, selectively binds and dephosphorylates PTEN in Src transfected cells. Both Src inhibitors and SHP-1 overexpression reverse Src-induced loss of PTEN function. Coexpression of PTEN with activated Src reduces the stability of PTEN. Taken together, the data indicate that activated Src inhibits PTEN function leading to alterations in signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2016399150,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), the defective molecule in Tangier disease, mediates the apoAI-dependent efflux of excess cholesterol from cells. We recently showed that ABCA1 proteolysis by calpain was dependent on a PEST sequence in the cytoplasmic region of ABCA1 and was reversed by apoA-I interaction with ABCA1. We show here that phosphorylation of ABCA1 in HEK293 cells was reduced by 63 ± 2.4% after removal of the PEST sequence (ABCA1delPEST) or by incubation of cells with apoAI (58 ± 3.3%). By contrast, ABCA1delPEST showed no further decrease of phosphorylation upon apoAI treatment. To assess the hypothesis that PEST sequence phosphorylation could regulate ABCA1 calpain proteolysis, we mutagenized S/T residues in the PEST sequence and identified Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 as constitutively phosphorylated residues. The ABCA1-T1286A/T1305A mutant was not degraded by calpain and was not further stabilized upon apoA-I treatment. The T1286A/T1305A mutant showed a 3.1-fold increase in cell surface expression and a 2.3-fold increase of apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux compared with wild type ABCA1. In conclusion, we propose a mechanism of regulation of ABCA1 cell surface expression and function in which the interaction with apoA-I results in dephosphorylation of the ABCA1 PEST sequence and thereby inhibits calpain degradation leading to an increase of ABCA1 cell surface expression.

Atherosclerosis, the major cause of death in industrialized societies (1Assmann G. Carmena R. Cullen P. Fruchart J.C. Jossa F. Lewis B. Mancini M. Paoletti R. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1930-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), is initiated by the deposition of lipoprotein cholesterol in the artery wall and its subsequent uptake by macrophages, giving rise to cholesterol-engorged foam cells (2Williams K.J.

Knopp R.H. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), macrophage foam cell accumulation in various tissues, including arteries and susceptibility to atherosclerosis (10Schaefer E.J. Zech L.A. Schwartz D.E. Brewer Jr., H.B. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The phenotype of Tangier Disease is consistent with the proposed function of ABCA1 as a cell surface transporter that promotes the efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol to lipid-poor apolipoproteins, a process that constitutes the initial step in HDL formation (11Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Young S.G. Fielding C.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of ABCA1 expression may provide a key to HDL formation and promotion of foam cell cholesterol efflux. The cellular expression of ABCA1 is highly regulated both on transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (13Wang N. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The turnover of ABCA1 protein is rapid with a half-life of less than 1 h in murine macrophage-like cells and differentiated THP-1 cells (14Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that ABCA1 protein degradation is regulated by a PEST sequence in the cytoplasmic region of ABCA1 and mediated by calpain protease (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction of ABCA1 with extracellular apoA-I inhibits calpain protease degradation in a PEST sequence-dependent fashion and thereby increases ABCA1 protein level at the cell surface (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Arakawa and Yokoyama (15Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) independently discovered the stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I and suggested its degradation by a thiol protease. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the nature of the signal by which apoA-I can reverse the PEST-dependent ABCA1 degradation by calpain. We first observed that apoA-I promotes PEST sequence dephosphorylation. It has been reported that calpain-mediated degradation can be induced by the phosphorylation of a target protein (17Shen J. Channavajhala P. Seldin D.C. Sonenshein G.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which led us to the hypothesis that the ABCA1-PEST sequence phosphorylation might regulate ABCA1 calpain proteolysis. We identified Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 as constitutively phosphorylated sites in the ABCA1-PEST sequence and then examined the critical role of the Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 phosphorylation sites in the process of ABCA1 degradation by calpain. Chemicals and Reagents—Human apoA-I (BIODESIGN International, Saco, ME) was dialyzed against PBS. M2 anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); the polyclonal ABCA1[159-F11] antibody, directed to the amino acid sequence of mouse and human ABCA1 (CLTSFLQDEKVKESYV), was kindly provided by Dr. R. Barbaras (INSERM U563, Toulouse, France). A protease inhibitor mixture set was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Phosphatase inhibitor mixture set, purified μ-calpain, and calpeptin were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). All cell culture reagents were form Invitrogen. All other reagents (analytical grade) were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Plasmid Constructs and Cell Transfection—mABCA1-FLAG, deleted of the PEST sequence (amino acids 1283–1306), was constructed as described previously (18Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). mABCA1-FLAG mutation constructs on Thr-1286, Ser-1296, Ser-1302, and The-1305 to Ala were generated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. mABCA1-FLAG mutation constructs were further called: MutAAAA for mutation to Ala on T1286A/S1296A/S1302A/T1305A, MutTAAT for mutation to Ala on S1296A/S1302A, and MutASSA for mutation to Ala on T1286A/T1305A. HEK293 cells were grown in 6-, 12-, or 24-well collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum then transiently transfected as previously described (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 6-, 12-, and 24-wells plates were respectively transfected with 2, 1, and 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA per well. Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from male mice by peritoneal lavage with PBS 3 days after intraperitoneal injection with 1 ml of 3.85% thioglycollate (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD). The isolated cells were plated onto 6-well plates and allowed to adhere by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). After removal of nonadherent cells by washing with PBS, the cells were further incubated for 2 days in DMEM/10% FBS. To induce ABCA1 protein transcription, cells were incubated overnight with the specific synthetic LXR agonist, TO-901317 (0.5 μm). The day after induction, cells were used for phosphorylation experiments. 32P Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of ABCA1—Confluent 6-well plates, transfected with HEK293 cells or primary mouse macrophages, were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then labeled with 500 μCi/well [32-P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C. Following 32P labeling, cells were washed with fresh media, treated as indicated, and then lysed at 4 °C with RIPA buffer as previously described (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in the presence of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors. For mouse peritoneal macrophages, the cell lysis proteins were first preincubated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), then were incubated overnight with 20 μl of rabbit anti-ABCA1[159-F11] immunoserum followed by a 2-h incubation with protein A/G-agarose. For HEK293 cells transfected with mABCA1 constructs carrying the FLAG epitopes, the cell lysis proteins were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). For both cells type, the agarose beads were then washed three times with the RIPA buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of 2.5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Radioactivity associated with the immunoprecipitated ABCA1 was measured with a phosphorimaging screen. Immunoblots were generated by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h and incubating with 1:1000 rabbit anti-ABCA1[159-F11] immunoserum or 1:1,000 mouse anti-FLAG-monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in PBS overnight. Blots were washed with PBS/Tween 0.05% then incubated 1 h with 1:10,000 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody in PBS. Following three washes with PBS/Tween 0.05%, protein bands were visualized with ECL reagent. The relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry (ImageQuaNT® 2.2, Amersham Biosciences). FLAG Cell Surface Expression Assay—mABCA1 constructs carrying the FLAG epitopes were transfected into HEK293 cells in 6-well plates. The next day, cells were first biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then cells were lysed with RIPA buffer at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant of cell lysates was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Following centrifugation and washing, the collected agarose beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 2.5× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Cell surface ABCA1 was revealed by Western analysis with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and then total ABCA1 protein was probed with anti-FLAG antibody. Cellular Cholesterol Efflux Assays—The assays were carried out as in a previous study (18Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Generally, HEK293 cells were labeled by culturing overnight in media containing [3H]cholesterol (0.5 μCi/ml). The next day, cells were washed twice with warm PBS and allowed to incubate in DMEM (1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with fresh DMEM (1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin) with or without free apoA-I (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h. The medium was removed and clarified of cellular material, and effluxed cholesterol was quantitated by scintillation counting. The cell layers were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and the cellular cholesterol was quantitated by scintillation counting. The cholesterol efflux was expressed as the percentage effluxed (media counts/(media counts + cellular counts) × 100). Calpain-catalyzed Proteolysis of ABCA1—mABCA1 constructs carrying the FLAG epitopes were transfected into HEK293 cells in 12-well plates. The next day, cells were washed three times with fresh media and placed on ice for 10 min. Then cells were permeabilized by addition of 80 μg/ml digitonin in DMEM and incubated on ice for 15 min. Next, the cells were washed twice with fresh DMEM, and then purified μ-calpain in DMEM plus 2 mm CaCl2 was added at the indicated concentration and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then cells were lysed by addition of 1 ml of RIPA buffer with 40 μg/ml calpeptin. Total ABCA1 protein was determined by Western analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody, and the relative intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry (ImageQuaNT® 2.2). ApoA-I Promotes Dephosphorylation of the ABCA1 PEST Sequence—Transfected HEK293 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, then incubated with or without apoA-I in medium. ABCA1-FLAG was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by autoradiography and Western blotting. The level of phosphorylation was calculated from the ratio of 32P/ABCA1 mass in immunoprecipitates, avoiding errors due to differences in recovery. Incubation with apoA-I resulted in a time- and dose-dependent reduction in the phosphorylation of WT-ABCA1, resulting in a maximum decrease of phosphorylation of 58.0 ± 3.3%, p < 0.01, n = 3 (Fig. 1). The phosphorylation of ABCA1 was also reduced by removal of the PEST sequence (63.0 ± 2.4%, p < 0.01, n = 5), and in contrast to wild type ABCA1 incubation with apoA-I did not result in any further reduction in phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, right panel, and Fig. 1B, Time 0). After 1–2 h, apoA-I (10 μg/ml) reduced the phosphorylation level of WT-ABCA1 to that seen for ABCA1delPEST (Fig. 1B). ApoA-I treatment also appeared to increase ABCA1 protein level for WT-ABCA1 but not for ABCA1delPEST (Fig. 1A), a result consistent with our previous work that showed that stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I required the PEST sequence (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, differences in recovery of ABCA1 in immunoprecipitates led to variability in this response at individual time points. To provide further evidence for the apoA-I effect on ABCA1 phosphorylation in vivo, primary mouse macrophages were treated overnight with an LXR activator (TO-901317, 0.5 μm)to induce ABCA1 expression then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. As evident from Fig. 2, incubation with 10 μg/ml of apoA-I for 2 h decreased ABCA1 phosphorylation similar to the response in transfected HEK293 cells. The ABCA1 PEST Sequence Is Constitutively Phosphorylated on Threonine Residues—These results showing reduced phosphorylation of ABCA1 after removal of the PEST sequence led us to identify potential phosphorylation sites within the PEST sequence. Fig. 3 shows the conserved PEST sequence among ABCA1 proteins from various species. The PEST sequence contains four potential phosphorylation sites, i.e. Thr-1286, Ser-1296, Ser-1302, and Thr-1305. We generated three mutants in which all four S and T residues, both S residues, or both T residues were mutated to alanine (A) (designated MutAAAA, MutTAAT, and MutASSA, respectively, Fig. 3). Phosphorylation experiments were performed on transfected HEK293 cells expressing WT-ABCA1, ABCA1delPEST, or the S/T mutants. MutAAAA and MutASSA showed a reduction in phosphorylation level comparable to that observed for ABCA1delPEST, while MutTAAT showed similar phosphorylation to wild type ABCA1 (Fig. 4A, mean percentage decrease, for at least 3 different experiments, as compare with the WT-ABCA1 and after recovery protein correction: 57.8 ± 3.1, p < 0.01 for MutAAAA; 61.7 ± 4.9, p < 0.01 for MutASSA; 63.0 ± 2.4, p < 0.01 for ABCA1delPEST and no significant decrease for MutTAAT). Additional phosphorylation experiments using constructs containing point mutants of either Thr-1286 or Thr-1305 showed that both Thr contribute to phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 are constitutive phosphorylation sites within the ABCA1 PEST sequence.Fig. 4Mutation of Thr residues (1286 and 1305) decreases ABCA1 Phosphorylation. WT-mABCA1-FLAG, mABCA1delPEST-FLAG, mABCA1-FLAG mutated to Ala on T1286A/S1296A/S1302A/T1305A (MutAAAA), mutated to Ala on S1296A/S1302A (MutTAAT), or mutated to Ala on T1286A/T1305A (MutASSA), were transiently transfected in 6 wells of HEK-293 cells (2 μg of plasmid DNA per well). Cells were labeled with 500 μCi/well [32-P]orthophosphate as described under “Experimental Procedures,” then lysed. ABCA1 protein was immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated ABCA1 (32P-ABCA1) was revealed by autoradiography, then total ABCA1 protein was probed with FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PEST Phosphorylation Sites Modulate ABCA1 Cell Surface Expression and Function—We next examined the effect of the phosphorylation mutants on the cell surface expression and function of ABCA1. MutTAAT, which has been shown to still contain the PEST phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4), had the same cell surface ABCA1 protein level as WT-ABCA1, whereas mutants on the constitutively phosphorylated sites (MutAAAA and MutASSA), showed an increase of cell surface ABCA1 protein to a level similar to ABCA1delPEST (Fig. 5A; mean -fold increase as compared with WT-ABCA1, n = 3 different experiments: 3.4 ± 0.3, p < 0.001 for MutAAAA; 3.3 ± 0.4, p < 0.001 for MutASSA; 3.1 ± 0.2, p < 0.01 for ABCA1delPEST). In contrast to effects on cell surface expression, there was a smaller and less reproducible increase in recovery of MutAAAA and MutASSA in total cell lysates, suggesting a specific effect on cell surface ABCA1 concentration, as shown previously for the PEST deletion mutant (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that deletion of the PEST sequence results in increased cell surface concentration of ABCA1 with a proportionate increase in functional activity (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the stabilization of ABCA1 cell surface protein that resulted from mutation of the PEST sequence T residues was correlated with an increase of ABCA1 protein activity. The increase of cell surface ABCA1 protein obtained with MutAAAA and MutASSA (Fig. 5A) was associated with a more than 2-fold increase of apoA-I-dependent cellular cholesterol efflux as compared with the wild-type ABCA1 and reached a similar activity level to the ABCA1delPEST (Fig. 5B, mean -fold increased as compared with WT-ABCA1, n = 5: 2.3 ± 0.3, p < 0.01 for MutAAAA; 2.3 ± 0.4, p < 0.01 for MutASSA; 2.4 ± 0.3, p < 0.01 for ABCA1delPEST). In contrast, the construct with conserved PEST phosphorylation sites, MutTAAT, did not increase cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA-I as compared with WT-ABCA1 (1.0 ± 0.2, p < 0.01 for MutTAAT). This is consistent with the lack of increased cell surface expression observed with this mutant (Fig. 5A). The PEST Phosphorylation Sites Modulate ABCA1 Degradation by Calpain and Stabilization by ApoA-I—Our previous work indicated that apoA-I acts via the PEST sequence to counteract a calpain-dependent degradation pathway (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that PEST sequence phosphorylation could regulate ABCA1 calpain proteolysis. To address this issue, we performed experiments using calpeptin, a synthetic permeable calpain inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 6A, we confirmed that ABCA1 protein cell surface expression was significantly higher for MutASSA than for the WT-ABCA1. However, calpeptin treatment had no effect on cell surface MutASSA protein level, whereas a significant increase was observed for WT-ABCA1 (mean -fold increase upon 20 μg/ml calpeptin treatment, n = 3: 1.2 ± 0.3, p < 0.01 for MutASSA; 2.2 ± 0.4, p < 0.01 for WT-ABCA1). Furthermore, to show that PEST sequence phosphorylation modulates ABCA1 degradation by calpain, cells were permeabilized and then treated with purified μ-calpain protease, a ubiquitously expressed subtype of calpain proteases. For WT-ABCA1, this treatment resulted in efficient degradation (Fig. 6B, mean percentage decrease upon 0.4 μm calpain treatment: 80.2 ± 4.8%, p < 0.01, n = 3), as reported previously (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, there was no appreciable degradation of MutASSA, providing direct evidence that ABCA1-mediated calpain proteolysis depends on the phosphorylation state of the PEST sequence. Because we previously observed that free apoA-I increases the ABCA1 protein level in parallel with reduced phosphorylation of the ABCA1 PEST sequence (Fig. 1 and Ref. 16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of free apoA-I on the ABCA1 mutant for the PEST sequence phosphorylation sites (MutASSA). We observed that the ability of free apoA-I to increase WT-ABCA1 cell surface protein level in HEK293-transfected cells was abolished for MutASSA (Fig. 5A; mean -fold increased upon 10 μg/ml apoA-I incubation, n = 3: 2.31 ± 0.17, p < 0.01 for WT-ABCA1; 0.82 ± 0.21, p < 0.01 for MutASSA). This last result confirms that free apoA-I increases ABCA1 protein level in a process strictly dependent on the PEST sequence phosphorylation sites. CK2 and PKA Inhibitors Do Not Affect Phosphorylation of the PEST Sequence of ABCA1—Upon examination of the PEST sequence of ABCA1, we found that Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 are, respectively, potential CK2 and PKA phosphorylation sites (19Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if CK2 and PKA kinases could be involved in the PEST sequence phosphorylation, we examined the effect of the CK2 inhibitor, apigenin (17Shen J. Channavajhala P. Seldin D.C. Sonenshein G.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a PKA inhibitor, H-89 (20Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), on ABCA1 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7A, treatment of HEK293-transfected cells with 20 μm apigenin for 3 h does not alter phosphorylation of either WT-ABCA1 or Mut-ASSA. Increasing apigenin concentration (30 or 40 μm) or longer incubation time (8 h) also failed to change ABCA1 phosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest that CK2 does not mediate either phosphorylation of the PEST sequence of ABCA1, or of the whole ABCA1 protein. Treatment of HEK293-transfected cells with 20 μm H-89 PKA inhibitor for 3 h induces a significant decrease of the WT-ABCA1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B, mean percentage decrease as compared with the control without H-89: 35.4 ± 3.4%, p < 0.01, n = 3). Furthermore, we observed that H-89 PKA inhibitor does not affect cell surface expression of ABCA1 (data not shown). This result is consistent with two recent independent studies (20Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showing that PKA promotes ABCA1 phosphorylation and subsequent apoA-I-dependent phospholipid efflux in an independent fashion to ABCA1 protein stability. However, we observed a similar decrease in the phosphorylation of MutASSA upon H-89 treatment (Fig. 1B, mean percentage decrease as compare with the control without H-89: 29.6 ± 4.1%, p < 0.01, n = 3), which suggests that PKA is not involved in the phosphorylation of the PEST sequence of ABCA1 but act on other ABCA1 phosphorylation sites as suggested by Haidar et al. (20Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By mutating serine and threonine residues to alanine, we provide evidence for the basal phosphorylation of threonine residues (1286 and 1305) within the PEST sequence of ABCA1. Interestingly, phosphorylation of these residues is abolished by incubation with extracellular apoA-I, in a process that parallels the PEST-dependent stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that apoA-I stabilization of ABCA1 is mediated by reduced PEST sequence phosphorylation, which in turn leads to decreased calpain proteolysis of ABCA1. Mutation of the PEST phosphorylation sites leads to increased cell surface expression and functional activity of ABCA1, suggesting that modulation of kinase or phosphatase activity at the PEST sequence could represent a new therapeutic approach to up-regulation of cellular ABCA1 activity. Our findings indicate that phosphorylation of the PEST sequence has a key role in the stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I. The time course and dose response of apoA-I induced dephosphorylation of the PEST sequence paralleled the effects of apoA-I on stabilization of ABCA1 (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and mutants of the threonine residues that prevent phosphorylation produced similar effects to apoA-I on cell surface concentration of ABCA1 (Fig. 5) and were not additive to the effects of apoA-I (Fig. 6C), strongly suggesting that the effects of apoA-I on ABCA1 stabilization were mediated by decreased PEST phosphorylation. The phosphorylation defective mutant also was resistant to exogenous calpain (Fig. 6B) and showed no additional increase in level in the presence of calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, indicating that apoA-I reduces phosphorylation of PEST threonine residues and thereby abolishes calpain proteolysis. The mechanism linking the binding of extracellular apoA-I to changes in ABCA1 PEST phosphorylation is unknown. Our earlier work on the apoA-I-mediated stabilization of ABCA1 suggested that the mechanism involves either a conformational change in ABCA1 brought about by binding of apoA-I to ABCA1, or a local change in the membrane secondary to apoA-I-mediated phospholipid efflux. A mutant (ABCA1-W590S) showed normal levels of binding of apoA-I but decreased phospholipid efflux (22Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S. Ohnishi T. Aoki R. Morinaga G. Okuhira K.I. Ikeda Y. Kano F. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Murata M. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8815-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This mutant was not stabilized by apoA-I implying that phospholipids efflux is required for apoA-I-mediated ABCA1 stabilization (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, we could not exclude the possibility that apoA-I binds to this mutant in an incorrect orientation, preventing an appropriate conformational change. Thus, either a conformational change of ABCA1 brought about by binding of apoA-I, or a membrane alteration secondary to phospholipid efflux could lead to altered access of a kinase or phosphatase acting at the PEST sequence (i.e. kinase/phosphatase substrate availability). Alternatively, we cannot exclude the possibility that apoA-I binding or phospholipid efflux induces a signaling cascade that leads to altered kinase or phosphatase activity. It has been previously shown that phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 within the IκBα-PEST sequence promotes calpain-mediated degradation of IκBα, by enhancing the binding of calpain to the PEST sequence (17Shen J. Channavajhala P. Seldin D.C. Sonenshein G.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the relatively well defined mechanism by which PEST sequences can enhance ubiquitination of substrates (24Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), there is no general agreement on the mechanism by which PEST sequences enhance calpain activity on target proteins. Although the PEST sequence contained a potential CKII consensus sites, experiments using inhibitors excluded a role of CKII in PEST sequence phosphorylation. Two different groups have recently reported that ABCA1 was constitutively phosphorylated in vivo on RAW macrophages (21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and in transfected HEK293 cells (21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In both studies, protein kinase A (PKA) has been showed to be involved in the ABCA1 phosphorylation and See et al. (21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have suggested by in vitro kinase assay that Ser-1042 and Ser-2054, located in the nucleotide binding domain of ABCA1, are major phosphorylation sites for PKA. Furthermore, the authors reported that ABCA1 phosphorylation by PKA on Ser-2054 regulate apoA-I-dependent cholesterol and phospholipid efflux but do not affect apoA-I binding or ABCA1 protein stability. Here we confirmed that ABCA1 is constitutively phosphorylated in primary mouse macrophages and transfected HEK293 cells. We observed that phosphorylation of ABCA1 was decreased by about 60% after mutation of Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 residues in the PEST sequence domain of ABCA1. Therefore, the 40% of phosphorylation level maintained after mutation of Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 is consistent with other potential sites of phosphorylation outside the PEST sequence, such as Ser-1042 and Ser-2054. In contrast with the phosphorylation site on Ser-2054 that does not affect ABCA1 protein stability (21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we showed by mutagenesis that the phosphorylation on Thr-1286 and Thr-1305 residues in the PEST sequence domain of ABCA1, decreases ABCA1 protein stability and thereby ABCA1 cell surface levels and activity. Therefore, these data confirmed that PKA is involved in the phosphorylation of ABCA1 protein, but act on a different domain than the PEST sequence, possibly on Ser-1042 and Ser-2054 as previously suggested (21See R.H. Caday-Malcolm R.A. Singaraja R.R. Zhou S. Silverston A. Huber M.T. Moran J. James E.R. Janoo R. Savill J.M. Rigot V. Zhang L.H. Wang M. Chimini G. Wellington C.L. Tafuri S.R. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As in earlier studies of the PEST deletion mutant, the predominant effect of mutation of the threonine phosphorylation sites was to increase cell surface ABCA1 concentration, with a smaller increase in ABCA1 in total cell lysates. This suggests that PEST sequence-dependent degradation primarily involves ABCA1 in the plasma membrane. This could reflect targeting of calpain to plasma membrane ABCA1. An alternative possibility is that calpain cleavage of ABCA1 leads to exposure of an internalization motif that is normally involved in endocytic removal of ABCA1 from the plasma membrane. It is interesting to note the parallel effects of the different mutants on cell surface concentration and cholesterol efflux activity (Fig. 5). This suggests that lipid efflux is primarily mediated by cell surface ABCA1. However, other evidence suggests intracellular trafficking of both apoA-I and ABCA1 (25Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Orso E. Broccardo C. Kaminski W.E. Bottcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Gotz A. Chambenoit O. Diederich W.

Studies in ABCA1 transgenic and knock-out animals, as well as in humans with Tangier disease, suggest that macrophage ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux is anti-atherogenic (10Schaefer E.J. Zech L.A.

Up-regulation of ABCA1 expression mediated by LXR activators is also associated with anti-atherogenic effects (30Terasaka N. Hiroshima A. Koieyama T. Ubukata N. Morikawa Y. Nakai D. Inaba T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) but is complicated by fatty liver and hypertriglyceridemia (31Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I.

Thus, alternative ways to increase ABCA1 activity are being sought. The stabilization of ABCA1 by apoA-I occurs in vivo (16Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B.

Several approaches could be envisaged, such as peptides or antibodies that mimic the effect of apoA-I binding to ABCA1. The present results suggest a novel approach involving small molecules that would decrease phosphorylation of the threonine residues within the PEST sequence of ABCA1. There are a large number of kinases and phosphatases in the mammalian genome, and recent clinical development of kinase inhibitors in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (37Beham-Schmid C. Apfelbeck U. Sill H. Tsybrovsky O. Hofler G. Haas O.A. Linkesch W.

Kin selection predicts that caste determination should result from environmentally induced differences in gene expression, a prediction largely supported by empirical data. However, two exceptional cases of genetically determined caste differentiation have recently been found in harvester ants. Here we show that genetic caste determination evolved in these populations after complex hybridization events. We identified four distinct genetic lineages, each consisting of unique blends of the genomes of the parental species, presumably Pogonomyrmex barbatus and P. rugosus. Crosses between lineages H1 and H2 and between J1 and J2 give rise to workers, whereas queens develop from within-lineage matings. Although historical gene flow is evident, genetic exchange among lineages and between lineages and the parental species no longer occurs. This unusual system of caste determination seems to be evolutionarily stable."
https://openalex.org/W2141484704,"Thyroid hormone has profound effects on metabolic homeostasis, regulating both lipogenesis and lipolysis, primarily by modulating adrenergic activity. We generated mice with a point mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) gene producing a dominant-negative TRα mutant receptor with a proline to histidine substitution (P398H). The heterozygous P398H mutant mice had a 3.4-fold (p < 0.02) increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) concentrations were slightly elevated compared with wild-type mice. The P398H mice had a 4.4-fold increase in body fat (as a fraction of total body weight) (p < 0.001) and a 5-fold increase in serum leptin levels (p < 0.005) compared with wild-type mice. A 3-fold increase in serum fasting insulin levels (p < 0.002) and a 55% increase in fasting glucose levels (p < 0.01) were observed in P398H compared with wild-type mice. There was a marked reduction in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis, as reflected in reduced glycerol release from white adipose tissue isolated from P398H mice. Heart rate and cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis, mediated by thyroid hormone-catecholamine interaction, were also reduced in P398H mice. In conclusion, the TRα P398H mutation is associated with visceral adiposity and insulin resistance primarily due to a marked reduction in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. The observed phenotype in the TRα P398H mouse is likely due to interference with TRα action as well as influence on other metabolic signaling pathways. The physiologic significance of these findings will ultimately depend on understanding the full range of actions of this mutation.

Thyroid hormone stimulates basal metabolic rate and adaptive thermogenesis. Hyperthyroidism amplifies catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis and increases thermogenesis and oxygen consumption in adipose tissue (1Bilzikian J.P. Loeb J.N. Endocr.

Catecholamines bind at least five subtypes of adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, β1, β2, and β3) that are expressed in fat cells and are coupled with the adenylylcyclase system to activate (via β receptors) or inhibit (via α2 receptor) the cAMP-activated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; BAT, brown adipose tissue; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; RTH, resistance to thyroid hormone; T3, triiodothyronine; T4, thyroxine; TSH, thyrotropin; RIA, radioimmunoassay; α-GPD, α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase.

TRβ plays an essential role in inner ear, cerebellar, and retinal development, TSH regulation, and mediating the metabolic actions of T3 in the liver (25Gothe S. Wang Z. Ng L. Kindblom J.M.

TRα-knockout mice have reduced heart rate and basal body temperature, which is not normalized by T3 treatment. Hypothyroid mice treated with GC-1, a TRβ-selective agonist, had impaired adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue stimulated by cold exposure or catecholamine infusion, although uncoupling protein 1(UCP1) levels were normal (23Ribeiro M.O. Carvalho S.D. Schultz J.J. Chiellini G. Scanlan T.S. Bianco A.C. Brent G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We introduced a dominant negative mutation derived from a Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH)-associated TRβ mutation into the TRα gene (TRα P398H) (30Liu Y.Y. Tachiki K.H. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No offspring homozygous for the P398H mutation were identified. The P398H heterozygous mice had a pattern of thyroid hormone studies consistent with thyroid hormone resistance; slightly elevated serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and elevated serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations. The P398H mice had reduced fertility, high mortality rate, and reduced heart rate. These findings are similar to the results from two other TRα dominant negative point mutant mouse models (31Kaneshige M. Suzuki H. Kaneshige K. Cheng J. Wimbrow H. Barlow C. Willingham M.C. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15095-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 32Tinnikov A. Nordstrom K. Thoren P. Kindblom J.M. Malin S. Rozell B. Adams M. Rajanayagam O. Pettersson S. Ohlsson C. Chatterjee K. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition to these findings, however, the P398H mice had increased body fat, elevated serum levels of leptin, glucose, and insulin. Expression of T3-dependent genes in the liver mediating lipolysis and lipogenesis were reduced. We identified a marked impairment in sympathetic-mediated lipolysis in white adipose tissue. The phenotype of the TRα P398H mice likely reflects direct interference with TRα signaling, as well as additional influences of the mutation on other metabolic signaling pathways. Generation of TRα (P398H) Mutant Mice—The TRα gene targeting vector and the embryonic stem cell targeting strategy were previously described (30Liu Y.Y. Tachiki K.H. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a two-vector “hit and replace” approach was used, leaving only the cytosine to adenine mutation, changing codon 398 in the TRα gene from proline to histidine. No vector sequence was left in the targeted locus with this approach. Two positive clones, as determined by direct sequencing, were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeras that were identified by coat color. Two chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females. Germ line transmission of the P398H mutation was detected by direct sequencing of tail DNA from F1 offspring. The sequencing primers used were nucleotides 1438-1468 (sense primer) and nucleotides 1674-1701 (antisense primer). All animals studied were 3-month-old males, unless otherwise indicated. The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional committee for animal protection. Hormone Assays Serum—T4 and T3 concentration were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Diagnostic Products Co, Los Angeles, CA). The T4 assay required 25 μl of serum and the T3 assay 100 μl. TSH was analyzed by Dr. Roy Weiss (University of Chicago) using previously described methods (33Pohlenz J. Maqueem A. Cua K. Weiss R.E. Van Sande J. Refetoff S. Thyroid. 1999; 9: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Leptin levels in plasma were determined by RIA (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) using frozen sera (50 μl serum per assay). The intraassay variation was < 4% and lower-limits of detection was 0.2 ng/ml. Insulin levels were determined by sensitive RIA (Linco, Research, St. Charles, MO). The intra-assay variability was 2% and the lower limit of detection was 0.1 ng/ml. Glucose Assay—Plasma glucose level was determined using the method of glucose oxidation (Accu-Check Glucose Monitor, Roche Diagnostics Co). Mice were anesthetized (halothane inhalation) and blood samples (∼5 μl) were taken from the tail vein. The assay detects glucose concentrations from 10-600 mg/dL. The intra-assay variability was <10%. Mice were fasted for 18 h for the fasting glucose measurement. Metabolic Balance—Male mice were housed in “metabolic” cages (one animal per cage) with collecting devices for urine and feces. A fixed quantity of diet (Prolab RMH 2500) was supplied to each cage for a 24-h period. Urine, feces, and unconsumed diet were measured every 24 h for 72 h. Mice were weighed on a balance (sensitivity to 1:1000 g) at baseline and after 72 h. Adipose Tissue Mass—Adipose tissue mass was determined by weighing fat pads dissected from specific deposits (epididymal, inguinal, and interscapular fat pads) in 3-month-old male mice. The fat mass was expressed as a fraction of total body weight of each mouse. Heart Rate—Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) with mice placed on a heating pad maintained at 37 °C. The electrode probes were attached to front and back feet and ECG conductive cream applied. The heart rate was monitored using a portable ECG/Respiration monitor (Silogic International Ltd, UK). Each wild-type and mutant mouse was tested for 30 min. The heart rate and ECG was recorded by computer and the average rate analyzed. Cold Exposure—The mice were placed in a cold room with water, but without food, and were exposed to 4 °C for 8 h. The body temperature was measured at baseline and at 8 h using the thermoprobe system (4000 series, YSI Inc, Yellow Spring, OH). The body weight was determined before and after cold exposure. Real-Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA), digested with DNaseI (Ambion Inc, Austin, TX) and further cleaned using RNeasy (Qiagen Biotech, Valencia, CA). Before reverse transcription, RNA was analyzed on an agarose gel to determine the quality of RNA of each sample to be tested. RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The quantitative real-time PCR was performed on Opticon DNA Engine (M. J. Research, Incline Village, NV). The cDNA was diluted 1:5, 1:25, 1:125, and 1:625 to generate a standard curve. The samples to be tested were diluted 1:10 and were tested in duplicate. A standard curve was generated for each pair of primers. The mRNA level of β-actin was significantly greater than the tested genes, therefore, samples for β-actin were diluted at 1:10, 1:50, 1:250, and 1:1250 for the standard curve. The samples to be tested were diluted 1:25 and were tested in a group of four replicates. The dilution strategy was designed to perform quantitative measurements in the early linear portion of the standard curve. The data were normalized to β-actin mRNA level and expressed in arbitrary units. UCP1 Western blot—Brown fat was isolated as described previously (23Ribeiro M.O. Carvalho S.D. Schultz J.J. Chiellini G. Scanlan T.S. Bianco A.C. Brent G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane protein (40 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. The membrane was incubated with anti-UCP1 antibody (1:100 dilution) and the conjugated protein was detected by chemiluminescence using a Western blotting kit (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, San Diego, CA). α-Glycerol Phosphate Dehydrogenase (α-GPD) Activity—Liver tissue was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 mm sucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. Mitochondria were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline-sucrose buffer. The α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase activity was analyzed by adding 80 μg of mitochondrial protein into 500 μl of assay buffer consisting of 65 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 1 mm KCN, 50 mm l-α-glycerophosphate (Sigma) and 1.7 mm iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) and incubated at 35 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, the reactions were placed on ice and the red color was extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, vortexed briefly and spun at 4 °C for 1 min. A 500-μl aliquot of the upper phase (red color) was transferred into a cuvette and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Assays were performed in triplicate. Isolation of White Fat Cells—Epididymal adipose tissue was removed and washed in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (pH 7.4). Fat cells were isolated according to a previously described method (34Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, adipose tissue fragments (0.5-1.0 g) were incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase in KRB buffer containing 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 3 μmol glucose (pH 7.4). The same buffer was use for washing the fat cells. Fat cells were separated from stromal debris by centrifugation at 400 × g. Following three washes and centrifugation, the isolated fat cells were collected and resuspended in 6 ml of buffer. The density of fat cells was determined using a hemocytometer. Lipolysis Assay—The lipolysis assay has been described in detail elsewhere (4Hellstrom L. Wahrenebeerg H. Reynisdottir S. Arner P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Wahrenberg H. Lonnqvist F. Arenr P. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 36Lonnqvist F. Wahrenberg H. Hellstrom L. Reynisdottir S. Arenr P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2175-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, fat cells (500 cells/100 μl) were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate for two hours in KRB buffer containing 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 μmol of glucose and 0.1 mg/ml ascorbic acid. Pharmacologic agents utilized included norepinephrine, forskolin (activating adenylate cyclase), dibutyryl cAMP (dcAMP, a phosphodiesterase resistant cAMP analogue), terbutaline (β2-selective adrenergic agonist), and dobutamine (β1-selective adrenergic agonist). Incubations were run in duplicate. Glycerol release was determined by a standard kit assay (Sigma-Aldrich Co). The dose-response curve was analyzed for each lipolytic agent. Data Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis utilized ANOVA, unless otherwise noted, with significance at p < 0.05. Generation of P398H Mutant Mice—The TRα P398H mutation was based on the RTH-associated TRβ P449H mutation. The TRα P398H and TRβ P449H mutations were previously characterized in transient transfection assays and shown to function as dominant negative receptors (38Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Larsen P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The heterozygous P398H mutation, introduced into embryonic stem cells, showed a 50% reduction in nuclear T3 binding capacity and a significant reduction in T3-dependent gene expression in in vitro embryonic stem cell differentiation studies (30Liu Y.Y. Tachiki K.H. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2664-2672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting vector contained a single nucleotide mutation (cytosine to adenine), producing a change in amino acid from proline to histidine at codon 398. Germline transmission was achieved in the C57BL/6 strain (see “Materials and Methods”). The offspring carrying the mutation were identified by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of genomic DNA from tail samples. In greater than two years of breeding, homozygous offspring were not detected. Live-born mutant mice, as well as stillborn pups, were genotyped. The homozygous TRα P398H mutation is likely to be an embryonic lethal, as has been reported for the TRα PV mutation (31Kaneshige M. Suzuki H. Kaneshige K. Cheng J. Wimbrow H. Barlow C. Willingham M.C. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15095-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for the TRα R438C mutation died at 3 weeks of age (32Tinnikov A. Nordstrom K. Thoren P. Kindblom J.M. Malin S. Rozell B. Adams M. Rajanayagam O. Pettersson S. Ohlsson C. Chatterjee K. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Since no homozygous mice were available for study, the P398H heterozygous mice are referred to as P398H mutant mice. The P398H mice had a higher mortality rate and reduced fertility, similar to that reported for the TRα PV and R438C mutations (31Kaneshige M. Suzuki H. Kaneshige K. Cheng J. Wimbrow H. Barlow C. Willingham M.C. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15095-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 32Tinnikov A. Nordstrom K. Thoren P. Kindblom J.M. Malin S. Rozell B. Adams M. Rajanayagam O. Pettersson S. Ohlsson C. Chatterjee K. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The TRα PV mutant mice manifest dwarfism and the TRα R438C mice had delayed development (32Tinnikov A. Nordstrom K. Thoren P. Kindblom J.M. Malin S. Rozell B. Adams M. Rajanayagam O. Pettersson S. Ohlsson C. Chatterjee K. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the P398H mutant mice were normal in size for the first 2-3 months and then the males showed increased body weight. Female mice were normal in size. We observed that P398H mice frequently had delayed hair growth. In some cases, the mice had no body-hair for up to 8 weeks of age. Hormone Levels—RTH is associated with mutations in the TRβ gene, and is manifest by elevated serum T3 and T4 concentrations and an “inappropriately” elevated TSH, with reduced responsiveness to thyroid hormone in some target tissues. At 3 months of age, the serum T4 concentration was slightly elevated in P398H mice (4.0 ± 1.0 μg/dL), compared with wild-type (3.6 ± 0.9 μg/dL). Serum T3 was increased 14% in P398H (96 ± 9 ng/dL) compared with wild-type mice (84 ± 12 ng/dL) (Table I). The mean TSH level was significantly elevated in P398H mice (197 ± 92 mU/liter) compared with wild-type mice (58 ± 12 mU/liter) (p < 0.02), indicating impaired feedback of thyroid hormone at the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. These data are consistent with the levels of thyroid hormone in the TRα PV mice (31Kaneshige M. Suzuki H. Kaneshige K. Cheng J. Wimbrow H. Barlow C. Willingham M.C. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15095-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The severity of thyroid hormone resistance was reduced with increasing age (>10 months). The TSH level in P398H mice (>10 months) was reduced 46% compared with the levels at 3 months of age (Table I). Similar reductions in serum TSH concentration with age were also reported in the TRαo/o, TRβ-/-, and combined knockout mice (39Weiss R.E. Chassande O. Koo E.K. Macchia P.E. Cua K. Samarut J. Refetoff S. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone levels did not change significantly with age in the wild-type mice.Table ISerum hormone levels in male wild-type and TRα P398H mice3-Month-old10-18-Month-oldT3 (ng/dL)T4 (μg/dL)TSH (mU/L)T3 (ng/dL)T4 (μg/dL)TSH (mU/L)Wild-type84 ± 123.6 ± 0.958 ± 1287 ± 124.5 ± 0.653 ± 22P398H96 ± 94.0 ± 1.0197 ± 92ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.55 ± 17ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.2.2 ± 1.1ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.94 ± 43ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.a p < 0.05 compared to wild-type. Open table in a new tab Heart Rate—The chronotropic actions of thyroid hormone are thought to be mediated by TRα. In RTH (associated with TRβ mutations) and in TRβ knockout mice, increased heart rate is observed, indicating that cardiac sensitivity to elevated thyroid hormone levels is retained. In contrast, TRα knockout mice had a 20% reduction in heart rate (18Wikstrom L. Johansson C. Salto C. Barlow C. Campos Barros A. Baas F. Forrest D. Thoren P. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The heart rate in P398H mice (3-month-old), as determined by an average of a 30-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, was 420 ± 45 beats/min, 14% lower than that in wild-type mice (490 ± 41 beats/min) (p < 0.01). The lower heart rate in P398H mice is consistent with reduced cardiac sensitivity to thyroid hormone. Considering P398H mice have elevated serum thyroid hormone, the reduced heart rate reflects reduced sensitivity to both thyroid hormone and sympathetic stimuli. Fat Accumulation—At age >3 months, the male P398H mice weighed 15-20% more than age-matched wild-type littermates (Fig. 1). The total body adipose tissue (from epididymal, inguinal and interscapular fat pads combined) in male P398H mice expressed as a fraction of total body weight, was 4.4-fold greater than wild-type (1.7% versus 7.5%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). The majority of adipose tissue was found in the epididymal fat pad. Only a trace inguinal fat pad, which accounted for 23% of total fat in P398H mice, was found in wild-type mice (Table II).Table IIBody fat composition in male wild-type and TRα P398H mice3-Month-old10-18-Month-oldWild-typeP398HWild-typeP398HBody weight (g)25.40 ± 1.6530.0 ± 3.3532.40 ± 2.2042.90 ± 3.20Total fat (g)0.43 ± 0.082.25 ± 0.971.49 ± 0.217.11 ± 1.43Epididymal fat (g)0.36 ± 0.231.44 ± 0.190.72 ± 0.204.00 ± 0.72Interscapular fat (g)0.03 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.210.45 ± 0.261.43 ± 0.67Inguinal fat (g)0.04 ± 0.010.53 ± 0.400.32 ± 0.231.68 ± 0.60Total fat (% of total body weight)1.69 ± 0.237.48 ± 2.534.60 ± 0.2116.57 ± 1.40 Open table in a new tab To determine the basis of increased fat mass in P398H mice, we performed a metabolic balance study. The food intake, body weight, feces, and urine were quantified every 24 h for 72 h. The P398H mice consumed significantly less food (65% of wild-type) (p < 0.01) and produced less feces (48% of wild-type) (p < 0.05) and urine (37% of wild-type) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent with increased adiposity from a primary metabolic defect and not related to excess food intake. Leptin, Glucose, and Insulin Levels—Leptin is secreted by adipose tissue and plays a key role in regulating food intake, energy expenditure, and body weight homeostasis (40Jequier E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 967: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In general, serum leptin levels are proportional to adipose tissue mass. The serum leptin concentration in 3-month-old P398H mice was 5-fold greater than that in wild-type mice, consistent with the increased fat mass (Fig. 3A). Elevated serum leptin levels act as a feedback signal to reduce food intake, as was seen in the P398H mice. Serum leptin levels and fat mass, in both wild-type and P398H mice, increased with age. At 10-18 months of age, serum leptin was increased 1.93-fold in P398H mice (10.1 ± 3.2 ng/ml) and 5.26-fold in wild-type (5.3 ± 2.5 ng/ml) (Fig. 3A) compared with 3-month-old mice. Total fat increased 2.3-fold in P398H mice (16.7% ± 0.6) and 3.1-fold in wild-type mice (4.5% ± 0.2), compared with mice at 3 months of age. Excess white adipose tissue is associated with impaired insulin action and elevated serum glucose levels. The random glucose level in P398H mice was 179 ± 8 mg/dL, 26% higher than levels in wild-type mice (142 ± 7 mg/dL) (p < 0.01). After an 18-hour fast"

https://openalex.org/W1977158511,"Because insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor play a pivotal role in many cancers, it is an attractive target for the design of inhibitors. Here we present a new family of bioisostere inhibitors, based on the structure of AG 538. AG 538 is a substrate-competitive inhibitor of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), with an IC50 = 61 nM in a cell-free kinase assay (Blum, G., Gazit, A., and Levitzki, A. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 15705–15712). AG 538 is a low molecular weight compound containing two catechol rings, which are sensitive to oxidation in cells. We have therefore prepared and examined catechol bioisosteres of AG 538. These AG 538 bioisosteres possess similar biological properties to AG 538; they inhibit IGF-1R by a substrate-competitive mechanism and are non-competitive vis à vis ATP. They inhibit IGF-1R kinase activity in the sub-micromolar concentration range in cell-free assays. IGF-1 induced IGF-1R autophosphorylation; IRS-1 phosphorylation and protein kinase B activation are inhibited at a low micromolar concentration range when applied to intact cells. These inhibitors also block the formation of colonies in soft agar by prostate and breast cancer cells. The ability to replace catechol groups with a moiety that is more stable in cells may aid in developing non-catechol-containing substrate-competitive inhibitors targeted toward IGF-1R and possibly against other protein-tyrosine kinases.

Both receptors are α2β2 heterodimers where the β subunit contains the cytoplasmic kinase domain, which exhibits 84% identity between the two receptors. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular α-subunits, the β-subunits undergo trans-autophosphorylation, which leads to receptor activation and phosphorylation of downstream substrates (1Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R is essential for normal growth, development, and differentiation and mediates signals for the suppression of apoptosis, enhancement of mitogenesis, and anchorage-independent growth (2Brodt P. Samani A. Navab R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The main mechanism by which IGF-1R protects cells from apoptosis is via the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/PKB pathway. An additional pathway was found in which IGF-1R protects cells from apoptosis by interacting with 14.3.3 proteins, causing the translocation of c-Raf to the mitochondria (3Peruzzi F. Prisco M. Dews M. Salomoni P. Grassilli E. Romano G. Calabretta B. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7203-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition to these pathways, the IGF-1R promotes mitogenesis by activating the Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (4Kurihara S. Hakuno F. Takahashi S. Endocr. J. 2000; 47: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Malignant transformation is often associated with increased expression and/or constitutive activation of the IGF-1R (5Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the highly metastatic H-59 Lewis lung carcinoma cells express high IGF-1R levels, and this IGF-1R overexpression was found to be critical for the ability of these cells to form metastases in mice livers. H-59 cells expressing antisense RNA of the IGF-1R became non-invasive and failed to form metastases in the mice livers (6Long L. Rubin R. Baserga R. Brodt P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1006-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Also an IGF-1R-blocking antibody inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cells (7Werner H. Re G.G. Drummond I.A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher F.J.D. Sens D.A. Garvin A.J. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5828-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Arteaga C.L. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6237-6241PubMed Google Scholar) and the formation of colonies in soft agar of these cells (9Hailey J. Maxwell E. Koukouras K. Bishop W.R. Pachter J.A. Wang Y. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1349-1353PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies also inhibit the growth of Wilms tumor cells in culture and in nude mice (10Gansler T. Furlanetto R. Gramling T.S. Robinson K.A. Blocker N. Buse M.G. Sens D.A. Garvin A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 961-966PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative IGF-1R or expression of antisense RNA directed against the IGF-1R mRNA in various cancerous cell lines caused inhibition of the transformed phenotype as detected by the inhibition of colony formation in soft agar or the inhibition of tumor formation in nude mice. The cell lines inhibited include human cervical cancer (11Nakamura K. Hongo A. Kodama J. Miyagi Y. Yoshinouchi M. Kudo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 760-765PubMed Google Scholar), human prostate cancer (12Reiss K. D'Ambrosio C. Tu X. Tu C. Baserga R. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2647-2655PubMed Google Scholar), human gliomas cells (13Ambrose D. Resnicoff M. Coppola D. Sell C. Miura M. Jameson S. Baserga R. Rubin R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), Rat-1 fibroblasts (14Prager D. Li H.L. Asa S. Melmed S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2181-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (15Shapiro D.N. Jones B.G. Shapiro L.H. Dias P. Houghton P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Enhanced IGF-1R signaling has also been implicated in the development and progression of prostate cancer (16DiGiovanni J. Kiguchi K. Frijhoff A. Wilker E. Bol D.K. Beltran L. Moats S. Ramirez A. Jorcano J. Conti C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For all these reasons, we have been trying to generate IGF-1R kinase inhibitors as potential anti-neoplastic agents (17Parrizas M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Wertheimer E. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We reported previously (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) on a substrate-competitive inhibitor of the IGF-1R, AG 538. AG 538 inhibits the IGF-1R with an IC50 of 61 nM in a cell-free kinase assay, IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation, as well as the activation of the downstream targets PKB and Erk2 in intact cells. The catechol moiety present in AG 538 is unstable due to its vulnerability to oxidation (19Schweigert N. Zehnder A.J. Eggen R.I. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to generate substrate-competitive inhibitors in which the catechol moiety is replaced by bioisosteres (20Ucar H. Van derpoorten K. Cacciaguerra S. Spampinato S. Stables J.P. Depovere P. Isa M. Masereel B. Delarge J. Poupaert J.H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we report on the synthesis of a family of AG 538 analogs in which the catechol group was replaced with a benzoxazolone group on either side of the molecule. The benzoxazolone group can in principle function as a bioisostere of the catechol moiety, maintaining the bioactivity of the compound (21Ucar H. Van derpoorten K. Depovere P. Lesieur D. Isa M. Masereel B. Delarge J. Poupaert J.H. Tetrahedron. 1998; 54: 1763-1772Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The successful replacement of the catechol moieties in AG 538 with benzoxazolone groups are likely to be leads for the development of new class of IGF-1R kinase substrate-competitive inhibitors.

Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast cells overexpressing wild type IGF-1R at ∼700,000 receptors per cell (clones NWTc34 and NWTc43) or insulin receptor (clone WTIR) were a generous gift from Dr. D. LeRoith (22LeRoith D. Sampson P.C. Roberts Jr., C.T. Horm. Res. 1994; 41: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml geneticin (G418), in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C.

R+ cells were generated by stable transfection of IGF-1R to R- cells, and these cells express ∼1 × 106 copies of IGF-1R (23D'Ambrosio C. Valentinis B. Prisco M. Reiss K. Rubini M. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3264-3271PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml G418, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C.

Media of all cell lines were supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C. Partial Purification of the IGF-1R and IR—Purification of the IGF-1R and IR were performed based on the IR purification method described earlier (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Carter W.G. Sullivan A.C. Asamoah K.A. Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14340-14351Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Confluent R+ cells overexpressing the IGF-1R or WTIR cells overexpressing the IR were lysed in the presence of 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μm EGTA, 0.24 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The lysate was bound to immobilized lectin overnight at 4 °C and washed with 5 column volumes of HTN buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl). Additional washes were with 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl and then with 10% glycerol/HTN. Semi-purified IGF-1R or IR was eluted with 0.5 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine in 10% glycerol/HTN, frozen, and kept at -70 °C. Inhibition of IGF-1R or IR-catalyzed Substrate Phosphorylation— The general protein-tyrosine kinase substrate, poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1 (pGT), was coated onto a 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) by adding 125 μl of 0.1 mg/ml pGT in PBS to each well. Plates were sealed and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C, washed once with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), dried for 2–3 h, and stored at 4 °C. Semi-purified IGF-1R from R+ or IR from WTIR cells were prepared as described (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The receptor was incubated (10 ng/well) in 20 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnAc2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with or without inhibitors, for 20 min at 30 °C. The plate was then washed with TBS with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with 5% low fat milk (1%). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine serum (1:3000) was added to the plate, with incubation for 45 min at room temperature. The plate was washed repeatedly with TBST and then treated with anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate antibody for 30 min. Detection was carried out with a color reagent, 2,2′-azido-bis-3-ethylbenzithiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, in citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, with 0.004% H2O2 for 10 min and monitored at 405 nm, all at room temperature. IC50 values of inhibitors were calculated using the REGRESSION program. The assay was optimized with respect to the amount of IGF-1R or IR, reaction time, and ATP concentration. The signal was linear for 30 min in the range of IGF-1R/IR protein concentrations up to 35 ng/well (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IGF-1R Substrate Phosphorylation by Radioactive Methods—200 ng/sample of semi-purified IGF-1R from R+ cells was added to a solution containing inhibitor and pGT at various concentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.04 mm NaVO3, 5 mm Mn(Ac)2, 125 μm ATP, and 1.5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP, final concentration) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, pH 8, 0.1 m final concentration. Reaction samples were absorbed onto 3MM Whatman paper squares. The paper squares were then washed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate at room temperature and dried in ethanol. Cerenkov radiation was measured by a 1600CA TRI-CARB Packard liquid scintillation counter. The data were analyzed by a Lineweaver-Burk plot using the Microsoft Excel program (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Autophosphorylation of IGF-1R and IGF-1 Signaling in Intact Cells—Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β-subunit of IGF-1R and the IGF-1R signaling was assayed as described (18Blum G. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15705-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent NWTc43 or PC-3 or MDA MB-468 cells in 6-well polypropylene plates were incubated for 17 h with inhibitor at various concentrations in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml, 0.1% Me2SO, and 0.1% ethanol (this final concentration of Me2SO/ethanol was kept constant in all samples), in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were then starved by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM, containing inhibitors at the same concentration as before, in 0.1% Me2SO and 0.1% ethanol. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 for 5 min. After IGF-1 treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by the addition of boiling sample buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were boiled for 15 min, and clarified by a 10-s 18,000 × g centrifugation at room temperature. Equal amounts of protein per lane were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorius AG). Phosphorylated proteins were immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phospho-IRS-1, anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308), and anti-phospho-Erk antibodies. Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using the ECL system. Blots were then stripped of antibodies by incubating in 2% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 55 °C for 20 min, washed with TBS with 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST), and then blocked with TBST with 5% low fat milk and re-probed. Blots that had been probed with anti-phosphotyrosine were re-probed with anti-IGF-1Rβ. Other blots were re-probed with antibodies against the corresponding nonphosphorylated protein anti-IRS-1, anti-Akt1/2, and anti-Erk2 antibodies (e.g. the blots with anti-phospho-IRS-1 was re-probed with anti-IRS-1). Band intensities were quantified using the NIH image program. To determine IC50 values of inhibition of PKB activation, the PKB levels in these samples divided the amount of phosphorylated PKB. This value was normalized to the maximal activity (designated as 100%) detected in the samples treated with IGF-1 without inhibitor. IC50 values were calculated using the REGRESSION program. Activation of PKB Phosphorylation by PDGF in Intact Cells—The activation of PKB by PDGF was performed as described above for activation by IGF-1, with the following changes. Sub-confluent NIH-3T3 cells in 6-well polypropylene plates were incubated for 20 h with inhibitor at various concentrations in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml, 0.1% Me2SO (This final concentration of Me2SO was kept constant in all samples), in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were then starved by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM, containing inhibitors at the same concentration as before, in 0.1% Me2SO. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF for 5 min. After PDGF treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by the addition of boiling sample buffer. Lysates were boiled for 15 min and clarified by short centrifugation at room temperature. 50 μg of protein per lane were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated PKB was immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308). Detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using an ECL system. Blots were then stripped of antibodies, washed with TBST, blocked with TBST with 5% milk, and re-probed with anti-Akt1/2 and detected as above. Anchorage-dependent Growth Inhibition—For growth curves, R+ cells (450 cells/well), MDA MB-468 cells (2000 cells/well), and MCF-7 cells (2000 cells/well) were plated on 96-well plates in the appropriate media supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml, in a humidified atmosphere of 94% air and 6% CO2 at 37 °C. One day after seeding, cultures were treated with compounds 4 or 10 or AG 538 at various concentrations in growth medium. The final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO was kept constant in all samples. Triplicate samples were utilized for each concentration. Medium with and without inhibitors was replaced every day. Cell growth was determined by the micro culture methylene blue assay (25Ben-Bassat H. Vardi D.V. Gazit A. Klaus S.N. Chaouat M. Hartzstark Z. Levitzki A. Exp. Dermatol. 1995; 4: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde, 0.05% final concentration, for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the microplates were stained with 1% methylene blue in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.5, for 60 min at room temperature. The plates were then washed extensively and rigorously (8 times) to remove excess dye and dried. The dye taken up by cells was eluted in 0.1 m HCl for 60 min at 37 °C, and absorbance was monitored at 620 nm. Anchorage-independent Cell Growth Assay—Colony formation in soft agar was performed mainly as described previously (26Horowitz D. King A.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 244: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A suspension of separated MDA MB-468, PC-3, LNCaP, or MCF-7 cells was plated in agar at a density of 5000 cells/well in a 96-well plate in growth medium containing 0.3% agar (50 μl/well), on top of a layer of growth medium containing 1% agar (100 μl/well). One day later, 50 μl of growth medium supplemented with inhibitors at 4 times the final desired concentration was added on top of each cell line. The final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO was kept constant in all samples. 7–12 days after plating, cells were stained with MTT, photographed at 100 times magnification, and counted. The assays were performed twice in triplicate. Chemistry—The aldehyde benzoxazolones were prepared from the acetal protected nitro hydroxy aldehydes. The nitro group was reduced and benzoxazolone formed with phenyl chloroformate instead of urea (Scheme 1) (27Maleski R.J. Osborne E.C. Cline S.M. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1991; 28: 1937-1939Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition to the higher yields and less drastic conditions, this has the advantage of yielding the isomeric benzoxazolone aldehydes 3 and 9. Friedel-Crafts acetylation of benzoxazolone yields only the 6-acetyl isomer (28Yous S. Poupaert H. Lesieur I. Dereux P. Lesieur D. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 1574-1576Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The bromoacetyl benzoxazolone 13 was prepared by this route. The isomeric bromoacetyl 19 required the preparation of the 3-nitro-4-hydroxyacetophenone 16, which led to the 5-acetylbenzoxazolone isomer (Scheme 2). An attempt to obtain the bromoacetyl benzoxazolone 13 with N-bromosuccinimide or Br2 failed. Only ring bromination on the benzoxazolone occurred. The bromoacetyl benzoxazolone 13 was prepared by Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzoxazolone with bromoacetyl bromide. We failed to obtain compound 14 by condensation of cyanoacetic acid to benzoxazolone with PPA.Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The yields in the reactions of the bromoacetyl 13 and 19 with KCN were low or failed (11 and 0%, respectively). We therefore tried to improve the yield with LiCN (29Jons I.B. Dipietro H.R. J. Org. Chem. 1964; 29: 1970-1971Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and NaCN. The higher yields with LiCN (19 and 22% with 13 and 19) do not justify the preparation of LiCN and the anhydrous conditions, and the commercial NaCN gave compound 20 at 29% yield, so we chose this latter route. Tyrphostins were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of the appropriate aldehydes and α-cyano ketones in the presence of β-alanine. By this condensation 11 tyrphostins (compounds 4–6, 10–12, 15, 21, 23, 28, and 29) were prepared (Schemes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).Scheme 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme 5View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Workup procedures relevant to all compounds involve the addition of water, extraction with CH2Cl2, and evaporation.

This was attributed to high entrapment of lipoplexes in the extended lung vascular tree. To determine whether lipofection in other organs could be enhanced by increasing the degree of vascularization, we used a transgenic mouse model with tissue-specific angiogenesis in liver. Tail vein injection of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)/cholesterol lipoplexes resulted in increased lipoplex entrapment in hypervascularized liver but did not boost luciferase expression, suggesting that lipoplex delivery is not a sufficient condition for efficient organ lipofection. Because the intravenously injected lipoplexes migrated within seconds to lungs, we checked whether the effects of immediate contact with serum correlate with lung lipofection efficiency of different DOTAP-based formulations. Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex-serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mm NaCl or lipoplexes with high (>33 mol%) cholesterol were found to aggregate immediately. This aggregation process was irreversible and was inversely correlated with the percentage of lung cells that took up lipoplexes and with the efficiency of lipofection. No other structural changes in serum were observed for cholesterol-based lipoplexes. Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-based lipoplexes were found to give low expression, apparently because of an immediate loss of integrity in serum, without lipid-DNA dissociation. Our study suggests that efficient in vivo lipofection is the result of cross-talk between lipoplex composition, interaction with serum, hemodynamics, and target tissue “susceptibility” to transfection.

Cationic lipids, which are extensively employed as in vitro transfection agents, are promising agents for in vivo delivery of nucleic acids for a variety of applications from functional proteomics (1Shoshani T. Faerman A. Mett I. Zelin E. Tenne T. Gorodin S. Moshel Y. Elbaz S. Budanov A. Chajut A. Kalinski H. Kamer I. Rozen A. Mor O. Keshet E. Leshkowitz D. Einat P. Skaliter R. Feinstein E. Mol.

Obviously, the applications of cationic lipid-DNA complexes (lipoplexes) as in vivo delivery vehicles are useful only when the lipoplex-mediated transfection (lipofection) is high enough to modify the function of the protein/gene of interest. The most challenging route of in vivo administration of lipoplexes is the intravenous (i.v.) 1The abbreviations used are: i.v., intravenous(ly); DOTAP, N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; CF, carboxyfluorescein; CFPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(carboxyfluorescein); LRPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl); DOPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine; HCPE, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-hydroxycoumarin); EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; UHV, unsized (non-extruded) heterogeneous vesicles; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; cryo-TEM, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. route. Following mouse tail vein injection, most of the transgene expression occurs in the lungs, producing more than 80% of the total expressed protein in the animal (3Liu F. Qi H. Huang L. Liu D.

Despite significant efforts to optimize lipoplex performance following i.v. administration (4Mahato R.I. Anwer K. Tagliaferri F. Meaney C. Leonard P. Wadhwa M.S. Logan M. French M. Rolland A. Hum.

Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the “built-in” biological factors determining the efficiency of lung lipofection remain unclear. It has been shown that within minutes after injection, 60–80% of the lipoplexes are entrapped in the lungs (4Mahato R.I. Anwer K. Tagliaferri F. Meaney C. Leonard P. Wadhwa M.S. Logan M. French M.

Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This “first-pass” entrapment was ascribed to the highly extended lung capillary bed and was proposed to explain the predominant expression in the lungs (8Li S. Tseng W.C. Stolz D.B. Wu S.P.

Another factor thought to affect lung lipofection is the interaction of lipoplexes with serum. Incubation in pure serum or in serum-containing media can decrease the lipoplex delivery and alter intracellular processing (10Escriou V. Ciolina C. Lacroix F. Byk G. Scherman D. Wils P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Chen S. Huang L. Michalopoulos G.K. Liu Y.

However, the importance of the above mentioned serum effects for lung transgene expression following i.v. administration is in question because: (a) the injected lipoplexes are rapidly cleared from the circulation (4Mahato R.I.

Szoka Jr., F.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thus ruling out long-term exposure to serum; (b) the pre-incubation of DOTAP/cholesterol lipoplexes with serum for as long as 30 min does not significantly impair lipofection in the lungs (8Li S. Tseng W.C. Stolz D.B. Wu S.P. Watkins S.C. Huang L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Sakurai F. Nishioka T. Saito H. Baba T. Okuda A. Matsumoto O. Taga T.

In this work, we focused on formulations based on DOTAP, the most commonly used cationic lipid for various in vivo applications. Our goal was to clarify the mechanisms underlying murine lipofection, especially the role of organ vascularization and lipoplex-serum initial contact. To do this, we first checked whether the extent of vascularization is critical for the process of lipofection in the liver. We injected DOTAP/cholesterol lipoplexes into transgenic mice with VEGF-induced, liver-specific angiogenesis. Our results show that hypervascularization in the liver does not increase level of lipofection, despite increased entrapment of the lipoplexes. The fact that enlarging the vascular bed and increasing vascular permeability in liver are not sufficient to promote efficient lipofection leads to the conclusion that lungs might be an organ that is just more susceptible than liver to this process. Next, we checked the relevance of immediate lipoplex-serum interaction to the process of lung lipofection. We found that the first contact between injected lipoplexes and serum affects lipoplex structure, the mode of delivery, and lipofection efficiency in the lungs. Lipids and Fluorescent Probes—DOTAP, carboxyfluorescein-PE (CFPE), and lissamine rhodamine-PE (LRPE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). DOPE was purchased from Lipoid (Ludwigshafen, Germany). Cholesterol and spermidine base were purchased from Sigma. The pH-sensitive probe 7-hydroxycoumarin-PE (HCPE) was prepared in our laboratory. 2D. Hirsch-Lerner and Y. Barenholz, manuscript in preparation. DNA—pCMV-EYFPmito, a plasmid coding for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) carrying mitochondrial localization signal was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). pCMV-Luc coding for the luciferase gene was constructed by insertion of a 875-bp CMV promoter-enhancer fragment into pGL3-enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI). pCMV-p53, based on pcDNA3 was provided by Dr. Moshe Oren, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. All plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli and purified in sterile endotoxin-free form using the Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Mega kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were analyzed for purity and topology as described previously (15Even-Chen S. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Liposome Preparation—For all preparations we used water purified with the WaterPro PS HPLC/UV Ultrafilter Hybrid model (LABCONCO, Kansas City, MO), which delivers Type I 18.2-megaohm/cm sterile (pyrogen-free to 0.06 endotoxin unit/ml) water. Unsized (nonextruded) heterogeneous vesicles (UHV) were prepared by mixing lipids in tert-butyl alcohol (Baker, Deventer, Holland) in a sterile isopropylene tube. The lipids were freeze-dried overnight and rehydrated in sterile water with gentle vortexing to make a 20 mm DOTAP concentration. Extruded large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared from UHV by stepwise extrusion through polycarbonate filters of 400- and 30-nm pore size, as described elsewhere (16Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For fluorescent labeling, a fluorescently labeled phospholipid was added at concentrations of 0.25–0.5 mol % to the lipids before the freeze-drying step. Preparation of Lipoplexes—The lipoplexes were prepared under aseptic conditions. Briefly, volumes of DNA and cationic liposomes were made equal with sterile pure water, and DNA was added dropwise to the cationic liposomes with gentle agitation. The lipoplexes were prepared in 90% of the final volume, allowing for 9% NaCl or 50% dextrose in the remaining 10% of the volume to be added just before injection, to obtain an isotonic concentration of 5% dextrose or 0.9% NaCl in the formulations. When lipoplexes were prepared in different final volumes (200 or 800 μl), the volumes of DNA and lipid were correspondingly adjusted before the last mixing step, but the total dose of the components per animal was kept constant. When spermidine was used for pre-condensation of plasmid, it was added to plasmid solution at an amine/phosphate charge ratio of 0.5 10 min before adding the plasmid to the cationic liposomes. The lipoplexes were allowed to form for at least 15 min before injection. Transgene Expression and Function—The protocols for the experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hebrew University's Authority for Animal Facilities. For p53 efficacy study, B16-F10.9 melanoma cells (250,000 cells/mouse) were injected into the tail veins of C57BL syngeneic mice on day 1 at a constant volume of 0.25 ml/mouse, and pCMV-p53-based lipoplexes were administrated i.v. on day 5. Lipoplexes with pcDNA3 served as control. Twenty days after tumor cell injection the animals were sacrificed. The lungs were excised and weighed, and metastases were counted under a binocular microscope. For study of EYFP or luciferase expression, each BALB-C male mouse, weighing 20–30 g (Harlan Laboratories, Rehovot, Israel) received 40 μg of cationic lipid-complexed plasmid in different volumes of aqueous vehicle via the tail vein. Mice were sacrificed 10 s to 24 h post-injection by cervical displacement. When the animals were killed at 6 h or more post-injection, the organs were excised with prior perfusion with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove blood from the tissue. Luciferase activity was assayed and quantified as described (17Hong K. Zheng W. Baker A. Papahadjopoulos D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). For analysis of fluorescent cells, the freshly excised tissue was digested at 37 °C and prepared for FACS as described (18Lavnikova N. Prokhorova S. Helyar L. Laskin D.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The lung cell suspensions were analyzed on a FACScan cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Lung digests of mice treated with non-fluorescent lipoplexes were used for baseline fluorescence determination. A transgenic mouse system for tetracycline-dependent switching of VEGF expression in the adult liver was kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. E.

Fluorescent Lipid Quantification—For CFPE or LRPE quantification, the lipids were extracted from the homogenized tissues with 4 volumes of isopropanol/30% NH4OH (300:1, v/v), and the fluorescence intensity was measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter. Stock dilutions of fluorescent lipids in the extracts of untreated mice lungs served for calibration. The extracted fluorescent lipids were analyzed for integrity by thin layer chromatography as described elsewhere (20Simberg D. Hirsch-Lerner D. Nissim R. Barenholz Y. J. Liposome Res. 2000; 10: 1-13Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Light and Fluorescence Microscopy—For fluorescence microscopy, the formaldehyde-fixed tissues were frozen, embedded at –25 °C in Jung tissue-freezing medium (Leica Instruments, Nussloch, Germany), and cut into 5–10-μm thin sections. The slides were viewed on an Olympus FV300 laser-scanning microscope (Olympus Optical, Japan). For study of lipoplex aggregation in different media and in serum, lipoplexes were mixed with mouse serum at different ratios, and then immediately a drop of the lipoplex dispersion was placed on a slide, covered with a cover glass, and viewed in transmitted mode using Nomarsky contrast. For estimating size of aggregates, 3-μm latex beads (Sigma) were added to the formulations. Lipoplex-Serum Interaction—For comparison of serum protein association with different lipoplexes, the latter were added to the mouse serum at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v). After a 5-min incubation, the mixtures (total 150 μl) were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. At the end of the procedure, 98% of the lipoplexes were in the pellet according to TLC analysis of fluorescent phospholipid or DOTAP in the supernatant (20Simberg D. Hirsch-Lerner D. Nissim R. Barenholz Y. J. Liposome Res. 2000; 10: 1-13Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lipids from the pellet were extracted with 200 μl of isopropanol, and the pellet was redissolved in 100 μl of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The protein was quantified by a modified Lowry method (21Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). For free (non-esterified) cholesterol determination, the lipid extract from the previous procedure was assayed using the Free Cholesterol Determination kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) (22Shmeeda H. Petkova D. Barenholz Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H759-H766PubMed Google Scholar). Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM)—The cryo-TEM work was performed at the Hannah and George Krumholz Laboratory for Advanced Microscopy at the Technion, Haifa, Israel. Lipid dispersions and lipoplexes were prepared in exactly the same concentrations and conditions as throughout our study. For preparation of lipoplex-serum mixtures, lipoplexes were incubated in serum at a lipoplex/serum ratio of 1:2 for ∼5 min. The cryo-specimens were prepared, imaged, and processed as described (23Simberg D. Danino D. Talmon Y. Minsky A. Ferrari M.E. Wheeler C.J. Barenholz Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47453-47459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Physical Parameters of the Lipoplexes Before and After Incubation with Serum—The mass-weighted size distribution of the liposomes and lipoplexes in buffer/serum was determined at 25 °C using a non-invasive back-scattering particle size analyzer (ALV-NIBS, ALV, Linden, Germany). This technique allows one to measure size without diluting the sample. The ζ-potential of the lipoplexes and of lipoplex-serum aggregates was measured in 10 or 150 mm NaCl solution on a Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Viscosity of lipoplex dispersions was determined at 25 °C with a capillary semimicro viscometer (Cannon Instrument, State College, PA). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—The plasmid DNA for FRET experiments was labeled covalently with carboxyfluorescein (CF). 3D. Simberg and Y. Barenholz, manuscript in preparation. Such labeling only minimally affects plasmid topology and physical properties. Liposomes were labeled with LRPE. First, the emission spectra (excitation 490 nm, emission 510–600 nm) of DNA-CF or LRPE-labeled liposomes were measured separately on the spectrofluorimeter. In the next step, cationic liposomes with or without LRPE were added to DNA-CF at a charge ratio of 5 (+/–), and the spectra were recorded again. Finally, the spectra were recorded after the addition of various amounts of mouse serum to the lipoplexes. Monitoring Membrane Surface Electrical Potential (ψ 0)—The surface potential of both HCPE-labeled DOTAP/DOPE (1/1) and DOTAP/cholesterol (1/1) liposomes was calculated from dissociation curves of the 7-hydroxycoumarin moiety of HCPE by recording excitation of HCPE at 405 nm and 380 nm, using emission at 450 nm, as described (16Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The change of surface potential after the formation of lipoplexes and addition of serum was calculated from the change in degree of dissociation of the 7-hydroxycoumarin moiety of HCPE. Details and calculations are explained elsewhere (16Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1368: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We started our work using LUV DOTAP/cholesterol (1:1)-based lipoplexes (with pre-condensation of the plasmid with spermidine at an amine/phosphate charge ratio of 0.5) because these have been shown to exhibit high transfection efficiency after i.v. administration (17Hong K. Zheng W. Baker A. Papahadjopoulos D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Throughout the study, to decrease the number of variables and to avoid toxicity inherent in the dose of cationic lipid and DNA (2Dass C.R. Int. J. Pharm. 2002; 241: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we kept the plasmid dose constant at 40 μg/mouse (121 nmol DNA phosphate/mouse) and the DOTAP-to-DNA +/–charge ratio constant at 5 (605 nmol of DOTAP/mouse). We used a p53-coding plasmid to demonstrate that the gene phenotype and function of p53, which is a pro-apoptotic protein, indeed can be characterized in the lungs by lipoplex-mediated transfection. For this purpose, we injected the spermidine-based formulation, as described above, into mice with advanced lung metastases. Such treatment led to a significant decrease in the number of metastases (27.0 ± 1.4) compared with untreated animals (120.5 ± 13.4). The control group, in which the empty cassette pcDNA3 was used, also showed some regression of disease (78.5 ± 0.7), probably because of nonspecific, bacterial plasmid-dependent mechanisms (2Dass C.R. Int. J. Pharm. 2002; 241: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tail vein injection of pCMV-EYFPmito-based lipoplexes into normal mice produced visible EYFP expression predominantly in the lungs (Fig. 1A) and to a much smaller extent in the heart (Fig. 1B). The EYFPmito gene expression in lungs was confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 1A, inset) and quantified by FACS (1.4 ± 0.3% EYFP-positive cells). On the other hand, in the liver no detectable EYFP expression was observed at 6–24 h post-injection (Fig. 1C). To determine whether transgene expression in the liver could be boosted by means of increased vascularization, we injected LUV DOTAP/cholesterol (1:1)-based lipoplexes, containing either EYFP- or luciferase-expressing plasmid, into mice with VEGF-overexpressing livers (19Dor Y. Djonov V. Abramovitch R. Itin A. Fishman G.I. Carmeliet P. Goelman G. Keshet E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Such transgenic animals are characterized by extensive neovascularization and high vascular permeability, associated with greatly enlarged organ weight (up to 2.5 times). The results show that following tail vein injection, there was an increased liver accumulation of fluorescently labeled lipoplexes (Fig. 1D). Thus, as soon as 6 h post-injection, the normal livers contained on average 0.616 nmol of LRPE/organ, whereas VEGF-overexpressing livers contained on average 2.033 nmol of LRPE/organ. Despite more than a 3-fold boost in lipoplex entrapment, no visible EYFP expression was detected at 6–12 h post-injection. To increase the sensitivity of detection, we also measured luciferase expression levels. The expression was very low, 600 fg/mg tissue protein (about 100 times less than the corresponding values in the lungs) and did not differ from the normal transfected liver tissue. We varied the following formulation parameters. Presence and Nature of Helper Lipid— Table I shows the transfection efficiencies of the formulations prepared with different mole ratios of cholesterol or with DOPE instead of cholesterol. The optimal cholesterol mole fraction in the lipoplexes is ∼33%. Further increasing cholesterol content decreases transfection. Formulations based on DOTAP alone also showed inferior transfection efficiency (not shown). Replacing cholesterol with DOPE drastically decreases transfection (Table I).Table ITransfection efficiency, aggregation in serum, and delivery to lung of different DOTAP-based formulationsFormulationaFormulation numbers are boldface and enclosed in parentheses.Lung luciferase expressionInitial lipoplex sizeSize under “low serum” conditionsAggregation by microscopy, “high serum”Aggregation by microscopy, “low serum”Lipoplex-positive cells in lungsbQuantified by FACS.pg/mg of tissue proteinnmnm%200 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(2:1)/pLuc (1)85 ± 3.36041194 (2.0)c-Fold change from original size is shown in parentheses.++11.2200 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (2)57 ± 2.76201096 (1.8)++++++9.3200 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:2)/pLuc (3)6.6 ± 1.213665000 (3.7)+++++++3.4200 NaCl UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (4)5.5 ± 2.38306850 (8.3)++++++++3.1800 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (5)79.5520472 (1.0)NMNM10.2200 dext LUV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (6)11.3 ± 10.4142310 (2.2)NMNM4.4200 dext UHV DOTAP/DOPE(1:1)/pLuc (7)1.62 ± 0.24201190 (2.8)++++8.4a Formulation numbers are boldface and enclosed in parentheses.b Quantified by FACS.c -Fold change from original size is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Lipoplex Size—To determine the effect of lipoplex size in the “pre-injection state,” we kept lipid composition (DOTAP/cholesterol (1:1)) constant to avoid independent effects. We prepared lipoplexes of different sizes by: 1) starting from the ∼500-nm UHV or from the 120-nm LUV; and 2) preparing lipoplexes from UHV in a final volume of 200 μl (“high concentration”) or 800 μl (“low concentration”). According to Table I, the high concentration UHV-derived lipoplexes (Formulation 2) were ∼600 nm in size, whereas the corresponding LUV-derived lipoplexes (Formulation 6) were ∼160 nm. The low concentration UHV-based lipoplexes (Formulation 5) were of intermediate size, ∼380 nm. Lung transgene expression was highest for the high concentration UHV-based formulation and lowest for the LUV-based formulation (Table I). High Versus Low Ionic Strength Medium for Preparation of Lipoplexes—The effects of media of various ionic strengths on the size and transgene expression efficiency of UHV DOTAP/cholesterol (1:1)-based lipoplexes were investigated. The presence of electrolyte resulted in partial aggregation of lipoplexes, although the aggregates could be redispersed by pipetting. Transgene expression in lungs (Table I) with 150 mm NaCl-based lipoplexes (Formulation 4) was 10-fold less efficacious than with 5% dextrose-based lipoplexes (Formulation 2). This effect of lipoplex medium on transfection was not a consequence of viscosity differences between the formulations, given that those differences are small (Table II) and the viscosity values are lower than that of mouse serum (1.5–2 centipoise).Table IIPhysicochemical parameters of selected lipoplex formulationsFormulationViscosityψ0 potential before addition of serumψ0 potential in serumBound serum proteinsResidual cholesterol after incubation in serumcPmVmVμg/nmol DOTAP% of initial200 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (2)1.07169.2170.81.3395.6200 dext UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:2)/pLuc (3)NMNMNM1.0593.8200 NaCl UHV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (4)NMNMNM1.14NM200 dext LUV DOTAP/cholesterol(1:1)/pLuc (6)NM169.2170.81.22NM200 dext UHV DOTAP/DOPE(1:1)/pLuc (7)1.19157.3122.0NMNM Open table in a new tab We tracked the delivery and distribution of fluorescently labeled lipoplexes in the lung tissue at different times post-injection. For all UHV-based formulations, the greater part of the lipid dose (about 70%) reached the lung within the first 10 s post-injection, indicating a considerable first-pass effect. In the case of LUV-based lipoplexes, however, only 30% of the fluorescence was recovered in the lungs by this time. The reason for this might be that the smaller, LUV-based, lipoplexes are poorly entrapped in the lung vasculature. With time, the amount of fluorescence in lungs steadily decreased (40% after 30 min and 2% after 12 h for all UHV-based formulations; 15% after 30 min and 0.5% after 12 h for LUV-based lipoplexes). On the other hand, there was a significant dependence of UHV DOTAP/cholesterol-based lipoplex lung distribution on formulation parameters as early as 10 s post-injection. Thus, according to histological tissue examination, lipoplexes administered in 150 mm NaCl produced a very het"
https://openalex.org/W2075092037,"Rheb GTPases represent a unique family of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins. Studies on Rheb in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila have shown that this small GTPase is essential and is involved in cell growth and cell cycle progression. The Drosophila studies also raised the possibility that Rheb is involved in the TOR/S6K signaling pathway. In this paper, we first report identification of dominant negative mutants of S. pombe Rheb (SpRheb). Screens of a randomly mutagenized SpRheb library yielded a mutant, SpRhebD60V, whose expression in S. pombe results in growth inhibition, G1 arrest, and induction of fnx1 +, a gene whose expression is induced by the disruption of Rheb. Alteration of the Asp-60 residue to all possible amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of two particularly strong dominant negative mutants, D60I and D60K. Characterization of these dominant negative mutant proteins revealed that D60V and D60I exhibit preferential binding of GDP, while D60K lost the ability to bind both GTP and GDP. A possible use of the dominant negative mutants in the study of mammalian Rheb was explored by introducing dominant negative mutations into human Rheb. We show that transient expression of the wild type Rheb1 or Rheb2 causes activation of p70S6K, while expression of Rheb1D60K mutant results in inhibition of basal level activity of p70S6K. In addition, Rheb1D60K and Rheb1D60V mutants blocked nutrient- or serum-induced activation of p70S6K. This provides critical evidence that Rheb plays a role in the mTOR/S6K pathway in mammalian cells. Rheb GTPases represent a unique family of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins.

Initially Rheb was found as a gene whose expression was induced in the rat brain by the treatment involved in the long term potentiation scheme (4Yamagata K. Sanders L.K. Kaufmann W.E. Yee W.

Rheb proteins share features unique to this family including the presence of arginine at the position corresponding to the 12th residue of Ras and the conservation of the effector domain sequence. In addition, all known Rheb proteins end with the CAAX motif (C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is the C-terminal amino acid usually a Cys, Ser, or Met residue) required for farnesylation. The yeast and mammalian Rheb proteins have been shown to be farnesylated (1Urano J. Tabancay A.P. Yang W. Tamanoi F. J. Biol.

In Drosophila S2 cells, inhibition of Rheb expression by siRNA leads to small cells arrested at the G1 phase, while overexpression of Rheb causes an increase in cell size and accumulation of S phase cells (10Patel P.H.

These results suggest that Rheb regulates both cell cycle and cell growth. From experiments utilizing rapamycin (13Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L.

To further characterize Rheb function in a variety of organisms, we sought to identify dominant negative mutants of Rheb. This type of mutant has been valuable in examining the function of Ras superfamily GTPases including Ras (18Feig L.A. Nat.

However, introduction of an analogous mutation, S20N, into S. pombe and S. cerevisiae Rheb did not confer a dominant negative property (6Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. P. Tabancay, Jr. and F. Tamanoi, unpublished observation. In addition, expression of mammalian RhebS20N did not exhibit any phenotype in mammalian cells (12Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Rogers-Graham K. Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10608-10615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, taking advantage of the yeast system we undertook a screen to identify dominant negative mutants of S. pombe Rheb. We first developed an assay to identify such mutants based on the findings that the inhibition of S. pombe Rheb induces expression of fnx1 +, a gene that is activated during the entry into the G0 phase of the cell cycle (6Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dimitrov K. Sazer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we screened a randomly mutagenized SpRheb expression library and found a mutant, D60V, that exhibits dominant negative properties. Changing the Asp-60 residue to all possible amino acids identified dominant negative mutants with increased potency. Biochemical characterization of these dominant negative mutant proteins revealed that they have altered guanine nucleotide binding properties. We further demonstrate that introduction of analogous mutations into human Rheb leads to inhibition of p70S6K activation, providing the first evidence that Rheb plays a role in the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Strains and Reagents—SP223 (h – ura4 leu1–32 ade6) and JU101pΔ1 have been described previously (7Yang W. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). JU101pΔ1 was derived from SP223 and contains a disruption of the chromosomal rhb1 + gene. JU101pΔ1 also carries the wild type rhb1 + gene under the control of nmt81 promoter (24Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Growth of S. pombe cells in EMM media with appropriate nutrient supplement was carried out as described by Moreno et al. (25Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). All yeast transformations were carried out by lithium acetate method (26Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). X-gal and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were purchased from Invitrogen. Thiamine was obtained from Sigma. Construction of SpRheb Random Mutant Library—PCR-mediated generation of random mutant library was carried out essentially as described previously (27Mitsuzawa H. Esson K. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Diversify™ PCR random mutagenesis kit (Clontech) was used to generate a random mutant library of the rhb1 + gene. The template used for the PCR was pWHASpRheb (7Yang W. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer corresponded to the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence and contained a SalI site. The 3′ primer corresponded to the sequence encompassing the stop codon of rhb1 + and a BamHI site. The condition for mutagenesis was optimized by changing Mn2+ and dGTP concentrations to give at least one base change per 1000 base pairs. The amplified fragments were cloned into pREP1 vector, which provides the nmt1 + promoter for the expression of mutant Rheb. The resulting plasmid was called pREP1HArhb1m. The wild type version of this plasmid, pREP1HASpRheb, was constructed by introducing a HA epitope-tagged rhb1 + gene into pREP1. Screen for Dominant Negative Mutants of SpRheb—The SP223-127 strain used for the screen is SP223 carrying a plasmid containing lacZ under the control of fnx1 + promoter (pIM127). pIM127 was constructed as follows. S. pombe cosmid clone 21D10 (provided by The Sanger Center, Cambridge, UK) contains the entire fnx1 + gene. We amplified 1556 base pairs upstream of the start codon of this gene by PCR using primers that contained PstI and NdeI sites. This fragment containing the fnx1 + promoter was inserted into pREP2 (25Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) that had been digested with PstI and NdeI, thus replacing the nmt1 + promoter. The lacZ + gene was PCR-amplified from the plasmid pBI-GL (Clontech) using primers containing SalI and BamHI sites. This product was inserted downstream of the fnx1 + promoter resulting in the production of pIM127. SP223-127 was transformed with the random mutant library of rhb1 +, and transformants were grown on EMM plates containing adenine and 150 μm thiamine. Transformants were replica-plated on plates lacking thiamine but containing 0.1 mg/ml X-gal. Small blue colonies were picked, and the plasmids were recovered by a yeast miniprep kit (Qiagen) followed by transformation into Escherichia coli KC8 (hsdR leuB600 trpC9830 pyrF::Tn5 hisB463 lacΔϕ 74 strA galU galK) using leucine selection. The recovered plasmids were sequenced to identify the mutation in rhb1 +. Construction of sprhb1 + D60X Mutants—Residue Asp-60 of SpRheb was converted to all possible amino acids by site-directed PCR mutagenesis. pREP1HArhb1 + was used as the template in the PCR. Primers containing NNN (N is any nucleotide) at the codon 60 of rhb1 + were used in a two-step PCR mutagenesis to generate the D60X mutant fragments. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with SalI and BamHI and inserted into pREP1 digested with the same enzymes. This resulted in pREP1HArhb1 +D60X. Subsequent clones were sequenced and resulted in Asp-60 changed to 18 of the 20 possible amino acids. The last two amino acids, methionine and tryptophan, were constructed by PCR mutagenesis using primers encoding the exact codon changes to methionine and tryptophan. All pREP1HArhb1 +D60X plasmids were transformed into SP223 to screen for dominant negative properties. Characterization of S. pombe Cells—SP223 transformed with pREP1HArhb1 +D60X constructs were grown overnight in EMM + Ade. Cells were diluted to A 600 of 0.1 in EMM + Ade, and growth was followed over time. For spotting assays, cells from the same overnight cultures were diluted to A 600 of 1.0 and serially diluted 4-fold. 5 μlofthe diluted samples were spotted onto EMM + Ade and EMM + Ade + thiamine plates and allowed to grow 3 days at 30 °C. The ability of mutant SpRheb to complement the loss of SpRheb expression was examined in the following manner. First, the mutant rhb1 gene recovered from the screen was used to replace the wild type rhb1 + gene in the plasmid pRPUmycSpRhebpt described previously (11Yang W. Urano J. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid contained the mutant rhb1 gene under the control of the rhb1 + promoter. The vector, pREP2myc, was made by introducing a Myc tag downstream of the NdeI site of pREP2. These plasmids were transformed into JU109pΔ1, and the transformants were grown overnight in the absence of thiamine. The overnight culture was diluted to A 600 of 1, serially diluted 4-fold, and spotted onto a plate containing 150 μm thiamine. The plate was incubated for 72 h at 30 °C. Flow cytometric analysis of S. pombe cells was carried out as described by Yang et al. (11Yang W. Urano J. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were collected at 24 h and then fixed in 70% ethanol. After RNase digestion, propidium iodide was added, and cells were sonicated briefly. Cells were processed immediately on a BD Biosciences FACScan. Purification of SpRheb Protein—SpRheb proteins were purified as His-tagged proteins. In brief, wild type and mutant forms (SpRhebD60V, -D60K, and -D60I) of the rhb1 + gene were cloned into the vector pET28a (Novagen) by PCR amplification followed by ligation into pET28a digested with NheI and BamHI. These constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). SpRheb was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer, and sonicated. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with ProBond™ nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen). After binding at 4 °C, bound beads were washed several times followed by elution of the bound protein with buffer containing 350 mm imidazole. The resulting elution fractions were concentrated by Centricon columns (Amicon Bioseparations). The purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, which revealed a single band of ∼22 kDa. Protein concentration of purified fractions was determined by Bradford protein assay (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). Biochemical Activities of SpRheb—The guanine nucleotide binding assay was carried out as described previously (29Finlin B.S. Gau C.L. Murphy G.A. Shao H. Kimel T. Seitz R.S. Chiu Y.F. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Der C.J. Tamanoi F. Andres D.A. Perou C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.5 μg of His-SpRheb as purified above was incubated with 0.2 μCi of [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μm GTP, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C, and the binding was examined by filtering through 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Nucleotide specificity was assessed by performing the guanine nucleotide binding assay as described above with the addition of excess unlabeled competing nucleotides (GDP, GTP, CTP, ATP, or UTP) in the binding buffer. The GTPase assay was carried out as described previously (29Finlin B.S. Gau C.L. Murphy G.A. Shao H. Kimel T. Seitz R.S. Chiu Y.F. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Der C.J. Tamanoi F. Andres D.A. Perou C.M. J.

A. 1991; 88: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, 1.5 μg of SpRheb was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the binding buffer as described above containing [α-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and either 4 mm UTP or 2 mm UTP plus 2 mm GTP. After the binding, GTPase assay was initiated by the addition of 20 mm MgCl2 followed by incubation at 37 °C. 2-μl aliquots were taken at various time points and spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Selecto Scientific). TLC plates were developed in 1 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The amount of [α-32P]GDP and [α-32P]GTP was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Model 445 SI, Amersham Biosciences). The migration of unlabeled GDP and GTP standards was detected by UV light (254 nm). GDP dissociation was examined by prebinding [3H]GDP (11.5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 30 °C in the buffer used for guanine nucleotide binding and then adding excess unlabeled GTP after adjusting the Mg2+ concentration to 10 mm, and the amount of radioactivity remaining bound was determined by nitrocellulose filter assay. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were collected 36 h after transfection. In brief, the indicated DNA was incubated in serum-free media with Polyfect reagent for 10 min, diluted in serum-free media, and added to cells with fresh media. COS-7 cells were starved for nutrients by incubating in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Cells were stimulated with nutrients by changing to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone for 30 min or with growth factors by adding 20% fetal bovine serum for 15 min. The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, was used to treat cells at 20 nm for 1 h. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared as follows. Cells were collected from the plate in lysis buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaPPi, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein were then loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. For detection of phosphorylated p70S6K, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389) antibody (Cell Signaling). For detection of total p70S6K protein, membranes were stripped and immunoblotted with anti-p70S6K antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detection of HA-SpRheb or HA-HsRheb, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-HA (12CA5) (Roche Applied Science). Screen for Dominant Negative Mutants of S. pombe Rheb— Rheb has recently emerged as an important class of the Ras superfamily G-proteins that is critical for cell growth and cell cycle progression possibly through its involvement in the TOR/S6K signaling pathway (6Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang W. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Urano J. Tamanoi F. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, studies on Rheb have been hindered by the lack of dominant negative mutants. We first introduced S20N, a mutation analogous to the widely used S17N dominant negative mutation of Ras, into SpRheb. SpRhebS20N was expressed in the wild type strain, SP223, and growth of the cells was examined. No significant difference was observed compared with the growth of cells overexpressing the wild type protein (data not shown). This is in agreement with the results reported by Mach et al. (6Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to randomly mutagenize SpRheb and identify dominant negative mutants. The overall scheme for the assay we devised is shown in Fig. 1A. This assay seeks to identify SpRheb mutants whose expression leads to fnx1 + induction since the inhibition of SpRheb expression causes the induction of this gene (6Mach K.E. Furge K.A. Albright C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar). A strain, SP223-127, carrying lacZ under the control of the fnx1 + promoter was constructed. This strain was transformed with a random PCR-generated library of S. pombe rhb1 + mutants under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt1 + promoter. Transformants were first grown on a plate containing thiamine. The presence of thiamine represses the expression of mutant Rheb enabling all the transformants to grow. Transformants were replica-plated onto a plate containing X-gal but lacking thiamine. The absence of thiamine induces expression of the mutant SpRheb. The expression of a dominant negative SpRheb would cause growth arrest and induction of the fnx1-lacZ reporter construct. Therefore, colonies expressing a dominant negative SpRheb are expected to be smaller and blue. These colonies were picked, and the pREP1HASpRhebm plasmid was recovered. After retransforming the recovered plasmid into SP223-127 to confirm the induction of fnx1 +, the plasmid DNA was sequenced to identify the mutations. Two independent screens covering 25,000 transformants were carried out. This led to the identification of a mutant (mutant 22) that carries two amino acid changes, D60V and I98M. Expression of mutant 22 resulted in growth inhibition as well as the development of blue color, indicating the induction of the fnx1-lacZ reporter (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C compares the growth of cells expressing mutant 22 to that of cells expressing wild type SpRheb. As can be seen, expression of mutant 22 significantly affected growth; the cells expressing mutant 22 grew only to approximately A 600 of 1, while the cells expressing wild type SpRheb grew to more than A 600 of 7. Analysis of the cell cycle profiles of SP223-127 cells expressing mutant 22 or wild type SpRheb by flow cytometry revealed significant enrichment of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (1N) with mutant 22 (Fig. 1D). Mutant 22 was expressed at a level slightly less than that of the wild type (Fig. 1E). D60V Mutation Is Responsible for the Dominant Negative Property—As mentioned above, mutant 22 possesses two different amino acid changes, D60V and I98M. The D60V mutation occurs on a residue that is conserved in all known Rheb and Ras proteins (Fig. 2A). This residue is part of the G3 box, one of the motifs conserved in the Ras superfamily G-proteins"
https://openalex.org/W2170260309,"The purinergic P2X7 receptor not only gates the opening of a cationic channel, but also couples to several downstream signaling events such as rapid membrane blebbing, microvesicle shedding, and interleukin-1β release. Protein-protein interactions are likely to be involved in most of these signaling cascades; and recently, a P2X7 receptor-protein complex comprising at least 11 distinct proteins has been identified. We have studied one of these interacting proteins, HSP90, in human embryonic kidney cells expressing either human or rat P2X7 receptors as well as in rat peritoneal macrophages using biochemical (immunoprecipitation and Western blotting) and functional (membrane blebbing and currents) assays. We found that HSP90 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in association with the P2X7 receptor complex, but not in the cytosolic compartment. The HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 and produced a 2-fold increase in the sensitivity of P2X7 receptors to agonist. Protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of a mutant P2X7 receptor in which a tyrosine in the C-terminal domain was substituted with phenylalanine (Y550F) were not changed, but tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 associated with this mutant P2X7 receptor complex was significantly greater than that associated with the wild-type complex. P2X7-Y550F receptors showed a 15-fold lower sensitivity to agonist, which was reversed by geldanamycin. We conclude that selective tyrosine phosphorylation of P2X7 receptor-associated HSP90 may act as a negative regulator of P2X7 receptor complex formation and function.

Extracellular ATP activates both ligand-gated ion channels (P2X receptors) and G protein-coupled metabotropic receptors (P2Y). There are seven ATP-gated P2X receptor channels (P2X1–P2X7), which can form as functionally distinct homomeric and/or heteromeric channels (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). The P2X7 receptor, which is prominently expressed in many immune and epithelial cells, differs strikingly from the other P2X receptors in additionally coupling to numerous other signaling cascades (2Di Virgilio F.

It is reasonable to assume that additional proteins are directly involved with P2X7 receptor coupling to these events; indeed, in a recent proteomic study, we identified 11 proteins as members of a P2X7 receptor-protein complex (9Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). One of these proteins was a tyrosine phosphatase (receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-β); blockade of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-β activity with phosphatase inhibitors revealed a significant tyrosine phosphorylation of the P2X7 receptor itself and an increase in ATP-evoked membrane blebbing and ion current (9Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). During these experiments, we noted that one other protein in this complex was also tyrosine-phosphorylated; this was a 90-kDa protein that most likely represented HSP90 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate; Ab, antibody; rP2X7, rat P2X7; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. because HSP90 was one of three heat shock proteins identified in the P2X7 receptor complex (HSP90, HSP70, and HSC70). HSP90 accounts for 1–2% of total cytosolic protein content, and its role as a molecular chaperone able to prevent protein aggregation and to promote refolding of denatured proteins has been studied in much detail (10Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 129-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). More recently, interest in HSP90, in particular, has expanded to include an apparently mechanistically distinct function involving direct interaction with specific biochemical signaling pathways underlying apoptosis (11Nollen E.A.A. Morimoto R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Richter K. Bucher J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 13Beere, H. M. (2001) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/93/re1.Google Scholar). For example, the anti-apoptotic action of HSP90 has been linked to its direct association with Apaf-1 apoptotic protease activation factor-1, rendering Apaf-1 unable to bind to caspase-9, thus inhibiting the subsequent apoptotic “caspase cascade” (14Pandey P. Saleh A. Nakazawa A. Kumar S. Srinivasula S.M. Kumar V. Weicheselbaum R. Nalin C. Alnemri E.S. Kufe D. Kharabanda S.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). However, it has been difficult to provide firm evidence for HSP90 substrates or biochemical mechanisms of HSP90-substrate interactions in cell death signaling pathways. No signature sequence for substrate recognition in the HSP90 molecule has been identified, and most HSP90-substrate interactions are regulated by low abundance co-chaperones (e.g. Hop and p23). The HSP90-caspase axis may have potential relevance to P2X7 receptor function because activation of this purine receptor in human and/or rodent macrophages and microglia can result in increased levels of caspase-1, -3, and -8 with consequent apoptotic cell death (16Ferrari D.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17275-17280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there appears to be only a single report demonstrating tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 (20Brouet A. Sonveaux P. Dessy C. Maniotte S. Bolligona J.L. Feron O. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used biochemical and functional assays to examine the interaction between HSP90 and P2X7 receptors in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells heterologously expressing either human or rat P2X7 receptors as well as in rat peritoneal macrophages expressing native P2X7 receptors. We have specifically addressed the question of tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 in the P2X7 receptor complex and its possible functional role in HSP90-P2X7 receptor interactions. Our data suggest a non-chaperone role for tyrosine-phosphorylated HSP90 as a P2X7 receptor repressor. Materials and Cells—Geldanamycin (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO to obtaina2mm stock and then diluted in the appropriate buffer or in the culture medium. Potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate (Calbiochem) was dissolved in water and then used at the appropriate concentration in the different buffers. BzATP was from Sigma. Dodecyl β-d-maltoside was from Calbiochem. Immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and Immun-star substrate were from Bio-Rad. During the immunoprecipitation procedure, Gamma Bind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) were used. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). The following antibodies (Abs) were used for co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry: anti-rat P2X7 (rP2X7) and anti-P2X2 polyclonal Abs (Alomone Labs), anti-HSP90 and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) Abs (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Glu-Glu epitope tag (GLNEYMPME; referred to as EE) monoclonal Ab (BabCo), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Abs (Bio-Rad), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Abs (Sigma). The monoclonal Ab directed against the extracellular domain of rP2X7 was described previously (21Kim M. Spelta V. Sim J. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23262-23267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The anti-human P2X7 polyclonal Ab was kindly provided by Dr. J. Barden (University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia). HEK293 cells stably or transiently transfected with rat or human P2X7 receptors were used as detailed previously, and transient transfection was accomplished using LipofectAMINE 2000 and cotransfections with enhanced green fluorescent protein (22Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In all single cell experiments using transient transfections (electrophysiology and membrane blebbing), green fluorescent protein-positive cells were assumed to express also the P2X7 receptor; subsequent immunostaining for P2X7 receptors revealed that this was true for 85–95% of the green fluorescent protein-positive cells. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from young adult rats as described previously (21Kim M. Spelta V. Sim J. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23262-23267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All experiments on macrophages were carried out after a 4-h incubation with lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/ml), as this has been shown to up-regulate expression of P2X7 receptors (23Le Feuvre R.A. Brough D. Iwakura Y. Takeda K. Rotwell N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3210-3218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Immunohistochemistry—Cells were incubated in 500 μl of solubilization buffer (20 mm dodecyl β-d-maltoside in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors) for 2 h under gentle agitation, after which cell debris was discarded, and background proteins were pre-absorbed with 50 μl of Gamma Bind G-Sepharose. The appropriate Ab (anti-P2X7, 80 ng/ml; or anti-EE, 10 μg/ml) was applied, followed by 50 μl of Gamma Bind G-Sepharose; and immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Resin was then washed (three to five washes) with 10 volumes of solubilization buffer, and proteins were separated from the Sepharose by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Initial experiments used total cell lysates as positive controls for immunoblotting with the anti-HSP90 and/or anti-P2X7 antibody and for estimating comparable amounts of protein to load onto the gels for experiments as illustrated in Figs. 1C and 3B. They were obtained by lysing cells in 100 μl of solubilization buffer and denaturing in an equal volume of SDS loading buffer, after which 20 μl was loaded onto the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Therefore, the amount of samples loaded represented ∼50% of the total proteins from immunoprecipitation, but only 10% of the total proteins from crude cell lysates.Fig. 3Tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 complexed with P2X7 receptors and inhibition by geldanamycin occur in native cells and human P2X7 receptor-expressing cells. The experiments shown are identical to those illustrated in Fig. 2A, but were performed with rat peritoneal macrophages (A) or HEK cells transfected with the EE-tagged human P2X7 receptor (B). The two bands represent glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the receptor. Geldanamycin (GA; 5 μm) was present for 30 min. Examples are representative of at least five similar experiments. PY-Hsp90, tyrosine-phosphorylated HSP90.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were rinsed in 10 mm Tris and 250 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) (TBS) and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with TBS/Tween, and primary Abs were applied at the appropriate concentration and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed twice with TBS/Tween, and the secondary Ab was added to the blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times, and Immunstar substrate was applied for 5 min in the dark. In most experiments, membranes were stripped and reblotted to confirm directly tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90. The stripping procedure was as follows. Membranes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Restore Western blot stripping buffer for 1 h at 50 °C. They were then incubated in TBS/Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, and the standard procedure described above for Western blotting was repeated, but inverting the antibodies. The anti-rP2X7 receptor Ab (300 ng/ml), anti-HSP90 Ab (250 ng/ml), anti-phosphotyrosine Ab PY20 (200 ng/ml), and anti-human P2X7 receptor polyclonal Ab (1:250 dilution) were the primary Abs used. The secondary Abs were used at a 1:3000 dilution. Densitometric semiquantitation of Western blot bands was performed using the Gene Genius imaging system; images were acquired from films and analyzed using GeneSnap and Genetools software (Syngene). The data represent the ratio of the calculated density of each sample to the control untreated sample or the IgG band present on the same film. The total number of cells was constant for all conditions in a given experiment. Immunostaining methods have been described in detail previously (21Kim M. Spelta V. Sim J. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23262-23267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with Zamboni's buffer for 20 min at room temperature, blocked in 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated with the primary Ab (anti-P2X2, 0.6 μg/ml; anti-rP2X7, 0.12 μg/ml; or anti-HSP90, 0.5 μg/ml) for 2–3 h at room temperature, rinsed, and incubated with the secondary Ab (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, 0.25 μg/ml) for 1 h. Cells were viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus U-RFL-T) and photographed using a digital camera (SpotCam, Cambridge, UK). Numbers of blebs/cell were counted, and data represent a total of 300 cells measured from three separate experiments, in each of which 100 cells were examined. Confocal microscopy (Nikon PCM2000 with EZ 2000 software) was also used to examine plasma membrane versus intracellular localization of P2X7 receptors. ATP Secretion—Cells were plated on polylysine-coated 24-well culture plates and maintained until confluent (usually 2 days), at which time they were incubated for 30 min in the presence of test or control solution. The supernatant was removed, and the ATP concentration was determined by luciferin/luciferase assay using a Lucy Anthos-1 luminometer (Lab Tech International). Electrophysiology, Fura-2, and Blebbing Measurements—Standard whole-cell patch-clamp methods were used; all methods and internal/external solutions were identical to those detailed in several recent studies (9Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Kim M. Spelta V. Sim J. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To take account of the occasional “run-up” of agonist sensitivity at this receptor (25Surprenant A. Rassendern F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 26Chessell I.P. Simon J. Hibell A.D. Michel A.D. Barnard E.A. Humphrey P.P.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), BzATP concentration-response curves were obtained as follows. For each cell, two consecutive sets of agonist applications (from low to high concentrations) were carried out; results from the second set were used to plot control curves. However, in this series of experiments, significant run-up of responses was observed in <10% of the cells and so is unlikely to influence interpretations of the results obtained. Time to onset of membrane blebbing was measured as described in detail previously (22Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, changes in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration were measured with the fluorescent indicator Fura-2/AM. Cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min in the presence of 250 μm sulfinpyrazone, rinsed, and resuspended in physiological saline solution at a final concentration of 106/ml. Changes in cytosolic calcium concentrations were determined in a thermostat-controlled, magnetically stirred cuvette fluorometer (LS50, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, UK) with an excitation ratio of 340/380 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Data Analysis—All data are shown as means ± S.E. Tests of significance were carried out by Student's t test using GraphPAD Instat software; p values <0.005 were considered significant. HSP90 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated in the P2X7-associated Protein Complex—After immunoprecipitation with the anti-P2X7 Ab, immunoblotting with Ab PY20 revealed a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein at 90 kDa. After treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate, this band was unchanged, whereas a second band at 76 kDa was detected (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that the 76-kDa band present after tyrosine phosphatase inhibition is the P2X7 receptor itself (9Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with Ab PY20, followed by stripping and reprobing with the anti-HSP90 antibody, directly confirmed that the 90-kDa band was tyrosine-phosphorylated HSP90 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, no tyrosine phosphorylation of uncomplexed (cytosolic) HSP90 could be detected; Fig. 1C shows that, although the quantity of both P2X7 and HSP90 that we loaded onto the gel (see “Experimental Procedures”) was approximately the same in the cell lysates (lanes 1 and 3) and in the co-immunoprecipitated samples (lanes 2 and 4), tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 was detected only in the immunoprecipitated samples (lanes 2 and 4). This result was obtained with HEK cells stably expressing rP2X7 receptors using the anti-ectodomain rP2X7 Ab for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2) as well as with HEK cells transiently transfected with an EE epitope-tagged rP2X7 receptor and immunoprecipitated using the anti-EE Ab (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4), thus ruling out possible technical artifacts due to the anti-P2X7 Ab. Activation of P2X7 receptors with a near-maximal concentration of BzATP (30 μm for 5 min) produced no significant alteration in the amounts of HSP90 that co-immunoprecipitated with the P2X7 receptor or in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the precipitated HSP90, nor did treatment with various kinase inhibitors (the Src kinase inhibitor protein phosphatase-2, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine) (data not shown). Geldanamycin Inhibits HSP90 Tyrosine Phosphorylation— Geldanamycin specifically inhibits HSP90 by binding to the ATP hydrolysis site on the molecule with an affinity >500 times greater than for ATP, thus effectively displacing ATP and so disrupting HSP90-substrate interactions (27Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Horte F.U. Pavletich N. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 28Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Mol.

A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). We therefore examined P2X7 receptor and HSP90 profiles on Western blots after treatment for 0.5 and 16 h with geldanamycin (1–5 μm). Geldanamycin did not alter the total amount of HSP90 protein immunoprecipitated within the P2X7 receptor complex, but significantly decreased the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of HSP90 (Fig. 2B); geldanamycin also significantly increased the amounts of immunoprecipitated P2X7 receptor protein when the anti-ectodomain P2X7 Ab was used, but not when the anti-EE epitope tag Ab was used. The most likely explanation for this difference is that a proportion of the membrane-localized P2X7 receptor is in a conformation or complex unfavorable to immunoprecipitation by the anti-ectodomain Ab, whereas tyrosine dephosphorylation of the complexed HSP90 alters the conformation/complex of these P2X7 receptors in such a way as to allow more efficient binding to this Ab. Such an interpretation would be in keeping with known roles of HSP molecules to alter the folding and conformation of their client proteins (37Hoefeld J. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 885-890Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 38Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellomann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. J. Biol.

Confocal microscopic examination of immunostained cells using either the anti-ectodomain P2X7 Ab or the anti-EE Ab revealed that geldanamycin did not alter the plasma membrane localization of the receptor, nor did it reveal any increased intracellular (i.e. endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi) immunostaining or altered subcellular localization (see below and Fig. 4).Fig. 4Prolonged application of geldanamycin activates P2X7 receptors to cause membrane blebbing due to increased constitutive secretion of ATP. A, typical examples of rP2X7-expressing HEK cells immunostained with the anti-P2X7 Ab. Protein was localized to the plasma membrane in controls, after a 16-h treatment with geldanamycin (GA; no BzATP applied), or after 5 min of BzATP (no geldanamycin applied).

Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 31Lopez-Maderuelo M.D. Fernandez-Renart M. Moratilla C. Renart J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this regard, our previous proteomic study examined only heterologously expressed rP2X7 receptors, raising the possibility that HSP90-P2X7 receptor interactions may not even occur in native cells expressing endogenous P2X7 receptors (9Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, we repeated the above experiments on rat peritoneal macrophages because macrophage cells have been a focus of several studies on the actions of P2X7 receptors in immune cells (4Falzoni S.

Qualitatively similar results were obtained, as illustrated in the representative experiment shown in Fig. 3A. HSP90 co-immunoprecipitated with the native rP2X7 receptor, and this complexed HSP90 (but not the cytosolic fraction) was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Geldanamycin (5 μm, 30 min) produced small decreases in the levels of HSP90 tyrosine phosphorylation, but the changes were not significantly different from the control levels. In view of the known species differences in the pharmacology of P2X7 receptors (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 26Chessell I.P. Simon J.

We were not able to examine endogenous human P2X7 receptors from native cells because the anti-ectodomain P2X7 monoclonal Ab was species-specific for rat versus human in immunoprecipitation, whereas the other P2X7 Abs available for Western blotting and immunostaining were not effective for immunoprecipitation. 2E.

Here we show that several human LAG1 homologues can rescue the viability of lag1Δ lac1Δ yeast cells and restore acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide and sphingolipid biosynthesis. When tested in a microsomal assay, Lac1p and Lag1p had a strong preference for C26:0-CoA over C24:0-CoA, C20-CoA, and C16-CoA, whereas some human homologues preferred C24:0-CoA and CoA derivatives with shorter fatty acids. This suggests that LAG1 proteins are related to substrate recognition and to the catalytic activity of ceramide synthase enzymes.

Recent progress has resulted in the identification of yeast genes involved in all enzymatic steps that are required for their biosynthesis (4Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The intermediates in sphingolipid synthesis, dihydrosphingosine (DHS), phytosphingosine (PHS), and their 1-phosphorylated derivatives, as well as free ceramides, have been proposed to act as signal transduction molecules governing heat stress responses, endocytosis, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol protein transport, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of membrane channels, and progression through G1 (for review, see Ref. 4Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1583: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A key role in the sphingolipid pathway is played by ceramide synthase, as it not only catalyzes an essential biosynthetic reaction, but also influences the levels of long chain bases and ceramides, which have signaling function. The simultaneous deletion of LAG1 and its close homologue LAC1 eliminates all detectable acyl-CoA-dependent ceramide biosynthesis in yeast microsomes (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M.

Moreover, lag1Δ lac1Δ cells have a drastically reduced amount of normal ceramides and IPCs, but exhibit a marked accumulation of free DHS and a compensatory increase of C26:0 fatty acids, which seem to be used for making a new form of phosphatidylinositol (PI) that we call PI′ (5Guillas I.

Whereas the single deletion of LAG1 or LAC1 had no abnormal growth phenotype, the concomitant deletion of LAG1 and LAC1 caused osmotic fragility, calcofluor white hypersensitivity, and a significant decrease of the growth rate in the genetic background of W303 cells, and the same double mutation was lethal in the background of YPK9 cells (5Guillas I.

Lethality of YPK9 lag1Δlac1Δ (herein named YPK9.2Δ) can be overcome by overexpression of LAG1 homologues from man (LAG1Hs, also named LASS1) or Caenorhabditis elegans (LAG1Ce-1, also named hyl-1), two genes showing 26 and 32% identity to yeast LAG1, respectively (8Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A recent paper has shown that the murine UOG1, which has 81% identity with LAG1Hs, and 27% identity with yeast LAG1, strongly induces a C18-CoA-specific ceramide synthase activity, when overexpressed in a mammalian cell line (9Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill A.H.J. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35642-35649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the pivotal role of LAG1 proteins in the ceramide synthase reaction is established in both yeast and mammalian cells, but it presently is not understood whether LAG1 proteins are part of the catalytically active enzyme or are essential regulators of the ceramide synthase. This question has led us to investigate the substrate specificity of human and yeast LAG1 proteins. We found that expression of some human homologues of hitherto unknown function in YPK9.2Δ not only restored viability but also allowed the acyl-CoA-dependent synthesis of ceramides that are not usually made but can be used for IPC biosynthesis.

LASS2 (NCBI entry XM_041889) was from Origene Technologies Inc. (www.origene.com/home.html). The conditional expression of human cDNAs in yeast was achieved by the insertion of the open reading frames behind the GAL1,10 promoter of the vector pYES6/CT carrying as selective marker a blasticidin resistance gene (Invitrogen AG, Basel, Switzerland). Primers to amplify the cDNA open reading frames between suitable restriction sites are shown in Table II. Reverse primers included a stop codon so that the constructs remained without any tag in pYES6/CT. CLN8 and LASS2 were also inserted as a EagI/EcoRI fragment into a modified version of multicopy vector pRS425 obtained from R. Arkowitz (University of Nice, Nice, France). In this vector, the potent TPI1 promoter had been inserted between SacII and EagI and the LEU2 marker was replaced by ADE2. The sequences of the inserts of all vectors constructed were verified by sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotides usedTarget geneName of primerOligonucleotide sequenceSize of productClone 1 into pYES1FCGGGGTACCAAGCTTAAATAAAATGctccagaccttgtatgattacttctg11401RCCGCTCGAGTCAgtcattcttacgatggttgttattgaClone 4 into pYES4FCGCGGATCCAAAAAATGctgtccagtttcaacgagtgg11824RGCTCTAGACTAtgtggctgttgtgtgcctgtLASS2 into pYES2FCGGGGTACCAAATAAAATGgctgtcactgtggataaac7562RGCTCTAGATCAgtcattcttacgatggttgttatCLN8 into pYES8FCGGGGTACCAAATAAAATGaatcctgcgagcgat8588RGCTCTAGACTAtggcctcttcttccgcYeast LAG1LAG1Ftgttgtaattcgaccattca155LAG1RtcttgaacaaccacaaatcaLASS2 into pRS102.F1GCCGCGGCCGAATAAAatggctgtcactgtggataaa721102.R1GGGAATTCTAGAtcagtcattcttacgatggttgCLN8 into pRS101.F1GCCGCGGCCGAATAAAatgaatcctgcgagcg884101.R1GGGAATTctatggcctcttcttccgca Open table in a new tab Microsomal Ceramide Synthase Assay—Microsomes were prepared and resuspended in lysis buffer as described (13Canivenc-Gansel E. Imhof I. Reggiori F. Burda P. Conzelmann A. Benachour A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, assays contained the equivalent of 33 μg of protein (3.3 μl of microsomes or 33–50 μl of detergent extract), 6–10 μCi of [4,5-3H]DHS (2–3.3 nmol = 20–33 μm) and 10–13 nmol (100–130 μm) of acyl-CoA or free fatty acids in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Acyl-CoA or free fatty acids were added in 3 μl from a stock in 1% Zwittergent 3-16 so that assays contained 0.77 mm Zwittergent (critical micellar content = 0.01–0.06 mm). Unless stated otherwise, the assay buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 30 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and labeling reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 h. In some assays, the microsomes were first incubated for 15 min in 0.5 mg/ml delipidated BSA on ice, spun through a cushion of 0.8 m sorbitol, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the following assay was done in the same phosphate buffer instead of Tris-HCl using the protocol of Wang and Merrill (14Wang E. Merrill A.H.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the end the lipids were twice extracted with chloroform-methanol (1:1), and extracts were dried and desalted by butanol-water partitioning. Alternatively, ceramides were extracted by addition of 0.6 ml of 0.55 m aqueous NH4OH, followed by vortexing and centrifugation. The lower chloroform phase was washed twice with 0.6 ml of water and dried. Microsomes were lysed in 0.2 or 0.3% digitonin (critical micellar content = 0.075%) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 4 °C under shaking. Lysates were ultracentrifuged at 4 °C, 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final digitonin concentration in the assays using solubilized proteins was usually 0.1%. Lipids were analyzed by ascending TLC using solvents 1, 2, or 3 described previously (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected and quantified by one-dimensional radioscanning, and then the TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and exposed to film at –80 °C. Metabolic Labeling and Lipid Extraction—Cells harboring the human cDNAs were grown over night on SGaaUA, whereas control YPK9.2Δ.LAG1 cells were depleted of Lag1p on SDaaA for 30 h before being labeled. 10 OD600 units of exponentially growing cells were labeled with 60 μCi of myo-[2-3H]inositol, and 30 OD600 units with 100 μCi of [3H]serine for 2 h at 30 °C. Lipid extraction and desalting were done as described (15Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3506-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Lipids were deacylated by mild base treatment using monomethylamine (MMA) as described (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Microsomal Ceramide Synthase Assay—The ceramide synthase assay described previously (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) contained microsomes, [3H]DHS, divalent cations, an ATP-regenerating system, and C26:0-CoA. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, when the amount of crude microsomes was varied in such an assay, a maximal amount of [3H]ceramide was generated, when the assay contained 33 μg of microsomal protein. At higher protein concentrations, the amount of product formed decreased. This can be explained by surface dilution, i.e. the fact that these substrates partition into the membranes and their effective concentration, expressed as mol % of membrane lipids, decreases when more membranes are added. Similar findings were also obtained by Morell and Radin (16Morell P. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 342-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the reaction was linear with time for over 2 h, irrespective of the amount of [3H]DHS we added, and that the amount of [3H]ceramide formed was strictly proportional to the amount of radioactivity added. Thus, in our standard conditions (20 μm [3H]DHS, 2 h of labeling), [3H]DHS is limiting, as expected from the finding that the apparent Km value for DHS in detergent is very high (27 mol %) (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Digitonin was the only detergent that solubilized the activity in good yield. When using solubilized membrane proteins, we obtained ∼2-fold more activity/mg of protein than with crude microsomes. This may be explained by an enrichment of the enzyme when detergentinsoluble proteins are removed by centrifugation. When digitonin-solubilized microsomal proteins were used, the amount of product made increased with the amount of membrane proteins added into the assay up to 100 μg of protein/assay (Fig. 1C). The non-linearity at higher protein concentrations was expected, as most [3H]DHS was transformed into [3H]ceramide and, thus, [3H]DHS was exhausted. Maximal ceramide synthase activity could be observed over a broad pH range extending from pH 6.5 to 9.5 (Fig. 1D). The same broad pH profile was found in membranes from YPK9 lag1Δ and YPK9 lac1Δ single mutants, in which only either Lac1p or Lag1p is operating (data not shown). Thus, the two homologues cannot be distinguished in this respect. Although EGTA and EDTA, at 10 mm, had no effect on the assay, all divalent cations except for Mg2+ were strongly inhibitory. Thus, addition of Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ at 5 mm reduced the activity to 85, 37, 31, 26, and 7% of the activity found without divalent cations. 2-Mercaptoethanol, a reducing agent, was without any effect at 7.5 mm, caused a 50% inhibition at 30 mm, and completely inhibited the synthase reaction at 60 mm. Our initial microsomal system contained ATP to maintain ionic gradients (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, ATP also allows for biosynthesis of acyl-CoA from a free fatty acid and CoA. By consequence, in assays where ATP is present, free CoA, generated by the ceramide synthase itself or through hydrolysis of acyl-CoA, could be used to activate other free fatty acids present in the microsomes and the acyl-CoA that finally is used to make [3H]ceramide may not be the one we add into the assay. Here we find that ATP is not required in the yeast microsomal system and that as much [3H]ceramide is made in its absence as in its presence, although massive amounts of apyrase (20 units/ml) inhibited the enzyme by 50%. (This could be the result of a nonspecific effect, but ATP also may have an unidentified indirect effect.) Microsomes from lcb4 lcb5 cells lacking LCB kinase displayed a normal incorporation of [3H]DHS into ceramides in the presence of C26-CoA, further illustrating that ATP is not required in this system (data not shown). This result is in contrast to the findings of Funato et al. (30Funato K. Lombardi R. Vallee B. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7325-7334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), who found that lcb4 lcb5 microsomes could not incorporate [3H]DHS into ceramide. We have presently no explanation for this discrepancy. Thus, the yeast ceramide synthase is similar to the mammalian synthase in that it does not require a metal cofactor, ATP, or a thiol-protecting agent (16Morell P. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 342-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate Specificity of Lag1p and Lac1p—IPCs found in S. cerevisiae almost exclusively contain PHS or DHS linked to a very long chain fatty acid, mostly C26:0 but also some C24:0, both of which can be hydroxylated (17Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To check whether this prevalence of very long chain fatty acids is the result of the specificity of the ceramide synthase, we tested the ability of the ceramide synthase to use acyl-CoAs of different length. It appeared that C26-CoA was the best substrate, but slightly fewer hydrophobic ceramides were also generated in the presence of C24-CoA, C20-CoA, and C18-CoA (Fig. 2A). The quantification of these bands showed that, with C24-CoA, C20-CoA, and C18-CoA, the synthase generated 77, 19, and 4% of the amount it made with C26-CoA. This is in agreement with the finding that elo3Δ cells, making mostly C22 and C20, are viable and make a normal amount of IPC (18Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We further wanted to compare the fatty acid specificity of Lag1p and Lac1p. For this, the fatty acid preferences of microsomes from lag1Δ and lac1Δ single mutants were tested. After having repeated the experiment shown in Fig. 2B, we do not feel that there is any reproducible difference in the fatty acid preference between the two strains. The same specificity profile was also found in microsomes of lag1Δ lac1Δ double mutants overexpressing either Lag1p or Lac1p (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, Lag1p (operative in lac1Δ) seems to have stronger activity than Lac1p (operative in lag1Δ). This is in agreement with the finding that W303 lag1Δ show a higher sensitivity to calcofluor white than W303 lac1Δ (data not shown). To determine the apparent Km values for acyl-CoA, the standard labeling assay with YPK9 wild type (wt) microsomes was realized in presence of increasing amounts of the two preferred substrates C26-CoA and C24-CoA. Optimal rates of synthesis were attained at 0.33 and 0.14 mm, corresponding to 13 and 6 mol %, respectively (Fig. 3A). It appears that the preference for C26-over C24-CoA becomes more pronounced with higher concentrations of acyl-CoA than what is used in standard assays (5 mol %). Additionally, the lower activity of the synthase with C24-CoA could not be overcome by increasing the concentration of C24-CoA, as with higher concentrations of acyl-CoA the activity reached a maximum and even dropped, possibly because of a detergent effect of acyl-CoA. A similar inhibition at higher concentrations of C24-CoA were noted by Morell and Radin (16Morell P. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 342-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of this possible inhibition, Km values can only be estimated roughly but the linear increase of activity up to 13 mol % nevertheless argues that ceramide synthase has a Km value for C26-CoA, which is certainly higher than the concentration of 0.1–0.13 mm (4–6 mol %) that is used in our standard assay. According to our former studies (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the yeast ceramide synthase displays an apparent Km value for DHS of 27 mol % (when measured with the digitonin-solubilized enzyme). As mentioned above, the relatively high apparent Km values for DHS and acyl-CoA explain why we lost synthase activity in Fig. 1A, when high amounts of microsomes were added.Fig. 3Rate of formation of ceramide as a function of acyl-CoA concentration. 100 μg of microsomal proteins (crude microsomes) of YPK9 wt cells were incubated with 6 μCi of [3H]DHS in the presence of C26-CoA or C24-CoA at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 1.4 mm (0.6–39 mol %). Zwittergent concentration was the same in all assays (0.89 mm). Lipids were extracted, analyzed by TLC in solvent system 1, and quantified by radioscanning. Results were plotted as percentage of [3H]DHS-C26 formed as compared with total radioactivity in the corresponding lane versus mol % of acyl-CoA of total lipids (for definition see Fig. 1 legend).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LAG1Hs Induces Ceramide Synthase Activity in YPK9 —As expression of LAG1Hs (LASS1) rescues the lethality and restores the replicative life span of YPK9.2Δ cells (8Jiang J.C. Kirchman P.A. Zagulski M. Hunt J. Jazwinski S.M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1259-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we undertook to examine the lipid profile and ceramide synthase activity of the rescued YPK9.2Δ.LAG1Hs strain. As shown in Fig. 4, LAG1Hs could restore an IPC profile to YPK9.2Δ as quantitatively and qualitatively similar as that for yeast LAG1 (lanes 2 and 5 versus lanes 3 and 6). Moreover, the cells containing LAG1Hs did not make PI′, lipids a and b, or IPC/B, lipids that are typically found in cells lacking ceramide synthase (5Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2655-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Indeed, YPK9.2Δ.LAG1Hs cells grow at the same rate as YPK9.2Δ.LAG1 (not shown). Thus, it would appear that LAG1Hs can replace the activity of LAG1 in ceramide synthesis, although we cannot ensure that this would also be true, if LAG1Hs were not overexpressed. When analyzing the microsomal ceramide synthase of YPK9.2Δ.LAG1Hs cells, we found that they contained an acyl-CoA-dependent activity that preferentially uses C26-CoA and C24-CoA (Fig. 5). The preference for C26-CoA over C24-CoA was even more pronounced with LAG1Hs than with yeast LAG1. As human cells do not usually contain ceramides with C26 fatty acids, we wondered whether the membrane environment of the yeast cell may have an influence on the acyl specificity of the synthase, e.g. by recruiting acyl-CoAs of a certain chain length. We argued that, if this were the case, detergent solubilization may liberate the enzyme from its lipid environment and may thus change the acyl chain specificity. Therefore, the synthase of YPK9.2Δ.LAG1Hs was tested after solubilization in digitonin. As shown in Fig. 6, Lag1Hsp again showed a very pronounced preference for C26-CoA and this suggested that Lag1Hsp has an intrinsic specificity for very long chain fatty acids. However, YPK9 microsomes showed a relatively higher activity with C18-CoA after detergent solubilization (compare Fig. 6 to Figs. 5 and 8), indicating that detergent solubilization may allow for specificity changes in certain cases.Fig. 5In vitro ceramide synthase specificity in microsomes from cells expressing LAG1Hs. Crude microsomes (100 μg of microsomal proteins/assay) from exponentially growing YPK9.2Δ.LAG1 or YPK9.2Δ.LAG1Hs cells were incubated with 20 μCi [3H]DHS in the presence of the indicated acyl-CoAs (0.1 mm) or free fatty acids (0.1 mm).

Residues in TM1 cytoplasmic to Gly-94 were largely unaffected by Cys substitution, whereas the mutation of residues extracellular to Ile-93 variably diminished transport activity. TM1 Cys substitutions displayed differential sensitivity to MTS reagents, with residues more cytoplasmic to Asp-98 being largely insensitive to MTS inactivation. Aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) similarly and profoundly inactivated 5-HT transport by SERT mutants D98C, G100C, W103C, and Y107C. MTSEA uniquely inactivated transport activity of S91C, G94C, Y95C but increased activity at I108C. MTSEA and MTSET, but not MTSES, inactivated transport function at N101C. Notably, 5-HT provided partial to complete protection from MTSET inactivation for D98C, G100C, N101C, and Y107C. Equivalent blockade of MTSET inactivation at N101C was observed with 5-HT at both room temperature and at 4 °C, inconsistent with major conformational changes leading to protection. Notably, cocaine also protected MTSET inactivation of G100C and N101C, although MTS incubations with N101C that eliminate 5-HT transport do not preclude cocaine analog binding nor its inhibition by 5-HT. 5-HT modestly enhanced the inactivation by MTSET at I93C and Y95C, whereas cocaine significantly enhanced MTSET sensitivity at Y107C and I108C. In summary, our studies reveal physical differences in TM1 accessibility to externally applied MTS reagents and reveal sites supporting substrate and antagonist modulation of MTS inactivation. Moreover, we identify a limit to accessibility for membrane-impermeant MTS reagents that may reflect aspects of an occluded permeation pathway. To explore aqueous accessibility and functional contributions of transmembrane domain (TM) 1 in human serotonin transporter (hSERT) proteins, we utilized the largely methanethiosulfonate (MTS) insensitive hSERT C109A mutant and mutated individual residues of hSERT TM1 to Cys followed by tests of MTS inactivation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transport.

Notably, cocaine also protected MTSET inactivation of G100C and N101C, although MTS incubations with N101C that eliminate 5-HT transport do not preclude cocaine analog binding nor its inhibition by 5-HT. 5-HT modestly enhanced the inactivation by MTSET at I93C and Y95C, whereas cocaine significantly enhanced MTSET sensitivity at Y107C and I108C. In summary, our studies reveal physical differences in TM1 accessibility to externally applied MTS reagents and reveal sites supporting substrate and antagonist modulation of MTS inactivation. Moreover, we identify a limit to accessibility for membrane-impermeant MTS reagents that may reflect aspects of an occluded permeation pathway.

SERT proteins are also targets for psychoactive agents, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“ecstasy”), cocaine, and antidepressants (2Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R.

SERTs are members of a family of transport proteins (in humans designated SLC6A, SERT is SLC6A4) that support high affinity Na+- and Cl–-dependent uptake of amino acids and amino acid derivatives, and thus, it is likely that members of the family utilize common structural elements to catalyze transport. The 12 putative transmembrane domains (TMs) of SERT (4Blakely R.D. Berson H.E. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Peek M.M. Prince H.K. Bradley C.C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) are likely to contribute to a permeation pathway through the lipid bilayer, facilitating the coordinated movement of 5-HT and coupled ions (12Chen J.G.

Exactly which helices form the permeation pathway and how they interact to support transport and antagonist interactions remains a subject of active investigation. The 20 amino acids predicted to span TM1 in human SERT, Leu-89 to Ile-108 (4Blakely R.D. Berson H.E. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Peek M.M. Prince H.K. Bradley C.C.

Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), are highly conserved across the gene family. We have provided evidence that this region participates directly in antagonist and substrate interactions (13Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J.

A biogenic amine transporter-specific Asp in TM1, Asp-98 in hSERT, has been implicated as a possible coordination site for the aminoalkyl side chain of 5-HT (13Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), analogous to models originally proposed for dopamine binding in homologous DAT proteins (17Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Approximately one helical turn cytoplasmic to Asp-98 lies a Tyr residue, Tyr-95, that dictates species-selective recognition of both transport inhibitors (16Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, other residues in this TM have been implicated in Na+ interactions and in limiting uncoupled modes of ion flow (18Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Doron N.K. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chen J.G.

To probe the contribution of hSERT TM1 to a 5-HT permeation pathway, we tested the aqueous accessibility and functional importance of residues in this region using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (22Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Cook T.A. Archdeacon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14865-14868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A.

Thiolate anions such as those provided by aqueous accessible Cys side chains are a billion times more reactive with MTS reagents than their reduced derivatives, and their covalent modification by MTS reagents can be used to disrupt function through direct and indirect mechanisms (12Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Reith M.E.A. Berfield J.L. Wang L.C. Ferrer J.V. Javitch J. J.

In the current study, we first establish the sensitivity of residues in TM1 of hSERT to Cys substitution, and second we define the sensitivity of TM1 Cys mutants to MTS reagents. As a result, we define two zones within TM1 populated by the following: 1) residues largely insensitive to Cys substitution or MTS inactivation lying cytoplasmic to Gly-94 and Asp-98, respectively; and 2) residues extracellular to Val-97 that can be differentially accessed by MTS reagents. Alanine substitution experiments indicate that acquired MTS sensitivity likely reflects local inactivation at introduced Cys sites as opposed to indirect exposure of endogenous Cys side chains. The limited accessibility of residues cytoplasmic to Asp-98 and the protection to MTS inactivation afforded by 5-HT and cocaine to three residues (Asp-98, Gly-100, and Asn-101) in the adjacent region suggest that these regions support different aspects of 5-HT permeation. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Construction of Mutant Plasmids— Mutation of hSERT in pBluescript KSII–was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit as described previously (16Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M. Houlihan W.J. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A mutation was initially introduced to inactivate the site most likely supporting MTS inactivation of wild-type transporters, C109A, as described for rat SERT (20Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Following the successful reduction of MTS sensitivity with the C109A mutation, additional Cys mutations were designed to produce the following changes in TM1: I108C, Y107C, P106C, F105C, R104C, W103C, V102C, N101C, G100C, L99C, D98C, V97C, A96C, Y95C, G94C, I93C, V92C, S91C, L90C, and L89C followed by their subcloning into a C109A background via XbaI/NsiI restriction fragments. Additionally, Ala substitutions were performed at key reactive sites as noted in the text to explore possibilities for indirect exposure and inactivation of endogenous Cys residues. All mutations studied are thus in the C109A background, but for brevity and focus are designated in the text only as the specific, additional mutation. In some mutations, additional restriction sites were introduced as silent mutations to facilitate identification of mutagenic cDNAs. Subsequent sequencing (Center for Molecular Neuroscience Neurogenomics and Sequencing Core Facility) confirmed the presence of only the intended mutations. C109A, N101C, and W103C mutant cDNAs were also subcloned into pBABE (30Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar) to generate stable transformants in HEK-293 cells, achieved following selection in 2 μg/ml puromycin. 5-HT Transport Measurements—HeLa cells, maintained at 37 °Cina 5% CO2 humidified incubator, were grown in HeLa complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). For initial evaluation of mutant transporter activity, cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells per well in 24-well culture plates. Cells were infected with a vaccinia virus carrying the T7 RNA polymerase in Opti-MEM plus 55 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 37 °C, after which SERT constructs were transfected with 3 μl of Lipofectin or FuGENE 6 per μg of DNA, also in Opti-MEM medium as described previously (16Barker E.L. Perlman M.A. Adkins E.M. Houlihan W.J. Pristupa Z.B. Niznik H.B. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Following transfection (16 h), cells were washed with Krebs-Ringers-HEPES assay buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and assayed for [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxy[3H]tryptamine trifluoroacetate, Amersham Biosciences) transport as described previously (17Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed in assay buffer followed by a preincubation in 37 °C assay buffer containing 1.8 g/liter glucose. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 20 nm [3H]5-HT, 100 μm pargyline, and 100 μml-ascorbate. Assays maintained linearity under these conditions for up to 15 min. Saturation kinetics for derivation of 5-HT KM and Vmax values were established in 24-well plates as described above except serial dilutions (5 to 0.035 μm) of a hot/cold mix of 5-HT with constant specific activity was used. Transport assays were terminated by washing 3 times with ice-cold assay buffer, and cells were dissolved in OptiPhase or Microscint 20 (Packard) scintillation fluid or 1% SDS. Transport assays on stable cells were performed as described above for transient transfectants 1 day after plating of 20,000 cells in 96-well microwell plates or 100,000 cells in 24-well plates coated with 1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine. The extent of [3H]5-HT accumulated was determined by liquid scintillation counting on a Wallac Microbeta plate reader, a Packard TopCount System, or a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Uptake in mock-transfected cells was subtracted from SERT-transfected cells to determine specific uptake. Non-transfected cells exhibited comparable uptake to assays performed in the presence of 1 μm paroxetine or 1 μm RTI-55. KM and V max values obtained from evaluation of transport activity were derived using a nonlinear least squares curve fit as a function of 5-HT concentration (40 nm to 5 μm) (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software or Prism 3 for Mac, Graphpad Software). All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated in three or more separate assays. Statistical analysis to examine the effects of Cys substitution as compared with parental hSERT C109A was performed using a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test of significance, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Tests of Sensitivity of hSERT TM1 Cys Mutants to MTS Reagents— HeLa cells plated in 12-well tissue culture plates were transiently transfected as described above with the hSERT cDNA of interest. Following a 16-h incubation, cells were washed once with PBS/CM buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1.0 mm MgCl2), and cells were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of MTS reagent in PBS/CM buffer or buffer alone. The concentrations of MTS reagents for investigating accessibility of cysteine mutants were as follows: 1 mm MTSET, 0.25 mm MTSEA, and 10 mm MTSES (Toronto Research Chemicals). The initial concentrations of MTSET and MTSES were chosen to reflect the different reported reactivities of these reagents against free thiolates (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, the concentration of MTSEA used in these experiments is 10-fold lower than described by Karlin and Akabas (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), due to the marked sensitivity observed in preliminary studies for hSERT C109A to 2.5 mm MTSEA (data not shown). Following MTS treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS/CM and subjected to transport assays, as described above. Statistical evaluation of MTS sensitivity for different mutants utilized a one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test of significance, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are normalized to 100% to permit visualization of MTS sensitivity across different activity levels of the individual mutants. Protection assays were performed in a similar manner to the MTS treatments described above with the following changes. C109A and TM1 Cys mutants were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C with buffer, 50 μm cocaine, or 50 μm 5-HT followed by incubation in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of MTSET for 10 min. Saturating concentrations (2Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H Yang-Feng T. Chang A.S. Ganapathy V. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2542-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) of these ligands were used to ensure full occupancy of transporters during MTS incubations. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS/CM buffer to remove ligands and MTS reagents and then assayed for uptake activity as described above. A one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Dunnett multiple comparison test of significance was used to identify residues showing ligand modulation, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. MTSET protection assays by 5-HT at N101C were repeated with HEK C109A and N101C stable cells at 4 °C to explore conformational contributions to protection. Stable C109A and N101C lines exhibited similar 5-HT KM values and equivalent sensitivity to MTS reagents as transiently transfected HeLa cells. For these assays, the length of incubation with MTSET was adjusted to 30 min to achieve comparable inactivation of N101C as observed at room temperature. Graphical presentation of the topography of sensitive residues in TM1 was illustrated using an α-helical net representation provided by the Protean module within the DNAstar software package (Lasergene), running on an Apple Macintosh work station. Radioligand Binding Studies Using [125I]RTI-55—HEK293 cells stably expressing hSERT C109A or hSERT C109A/N101C were plated at a density of 500,000 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated 12-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with room temperature PBS/CMG buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2 and 1.8 g/liter glucose). Buffer was aspirated from each well and replaced with 1 ml of 0.1 mm MTSET in PBS/CMG and incubated for 10 min. Control wells were treated with PBS/CMG alone. Following MTSET treatment cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS/CMG and incubated at 4 °Cfor1h with a hot/cold mixture of 5 nm RTI-55 (4.5 nm cold RTI-55, 0.5 nm [125I]RTI-55 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 2200 Ci/mmol)). Cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS/CMG, solubilized with 1% SDS, transferred to 12 × 75-mm tubes, and counted using a Beckman Gamma 4000 counter. Nonspecific binding values were determined by co-incubation with 1 μm paroxetine, 1 μm unlabeled RTI-55, or 100 μm 5-HT and subtracted from test wells. A control plate treated identical to test plates was removed prior to addition of radiolabel and used in transport assays as detailed above to determine the level of MTSET inactivation under these conditions. Data points were normalized to percent untreated control and statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Bonferroni multiple-comparison test where p < 0.05 was considered as significant. The Bonferroni test allows for comparison among all test groups. Immunoblot Analysis of hSERT C109A and Cys Mutant Protein Levels—To establish levels and biosynthetic progression of hSERT proteins produced from mutant cDNAs, HeLa cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 500,000 cells per well and transfected 18–24 h later as described previously. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS/CM and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking in 400 μl/well RIPA solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (1.0 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Solubilized cells were transferred to prechilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and nonsolubilized material was pelleted at 15,000 rpm (20,000 × g) at 4 °C for 20 min. A fraction of the supernatant was assayed for protein (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel, followed by transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dried milk in 0.5% PBS/Tween and then probed with a monoclonal antibody (ST51–2) to hSERT (mAB Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at a concentration of 1:5000, followed by extensive washing in PBS/Tween. Blots were incubated at room temperature for 45 min with a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, The Jackson Laboratories, 1:25,000). After extensive washing in PBS/Tween, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Biotinylation of hSERT Cys Mutants—To determine whether the lack of transport activity observed in certain Cys mutants was due to an absence of SERT at the cell surface, labeling of surface proteins was performed using the lysine-directed, membrane-impermeant biotinylating reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) (31Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Ramamoorthy S. Melikian H.E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 296: 347-370Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were plated into 6-well dishes and transfected as described previously. Following 16 h of transfection, cells were washed 4 times with PBS/CM at 4 °C and then incubated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in PBS/CM for 30 min at 4 °C. After the sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin incubation, cells were washed twice with 100 mm glycine in PBS/CM and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in glycine/PBS/CM. The glycine buffer was removed and RIPA solubilization buffer containing protease inhibitors applied, followed by shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were cleared of insoluble material by pelleting at 15,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads (Pierce) were washed 3 times with 100 mm glycine/PBS/CM and then 4 times with the RIPA buffer, finally resuspending the beads in RIPA buffer. A portion of the supernatant that constituted total soluble protein was removed for subsequent analysis on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. 210 μl of bead/RIPA slurry was added to 750 μl of supernatant and gently mixed for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, the streptavidin beads were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer, and biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (5% β-mercaptoethanol) (20 min). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for hSERT immunoreactivity as detailed above. The experiments utilizing MTSEA-biotin to probe for cysteine accessibility were performed as detailed for sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin with the following exceptions. After 16 h of transfection, the hSERT Cys mutants were washed twice in PBS/CM. 1 mm MTSEA-biotin in PBS/CM was added to the cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed again in PBS/CM, and 400 μl of RIPA solubilization buffer was added. Streptavidin beads were prepared and used as described above to capture biotinylated SERTs prior to blotting of SDS-PAGE-resolved material. Construction of an MTS-insensitive hSERT—In order to examine the reactivity of engineered TM1 cysteines in hSERT to MTS reagents, we first needed to establish a background where extracellularly applied MTS reagents generated little or no inactivation. hSERT contains 18 native cysteine residues (1Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Bloom F.E. Kupfer D.J. Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 321-333Google Scholar, 5Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) complicating this effort. However, in rat SERT, residue Cys-109 (same designation in hSERT), located at the top of TM1, is responsible for the majority of the sensitivity for externally applied MTS reagents (20Chen J.G.

We tested the possibility that a similar pattern of MTS sensitivity might be evident with the human ortholog using 0.25 mm MTSEA (positively charged), 1 mm MTSET (positively charged), or 10 mm MTSES (negatively charged). As expected, we found that wild-type hSERT displays significant sensitivity to MTS reagents, tested under comparable conditions as utilized for rSERT (Fig. 1A), with a decrease in transport activity to 43 ± 2% for 0.25 mm MTSEA, 48 ± 6% for 10 mm MTSES, and 79 ± 3% for 1 mm MTSET, as compared with activity of vehicle-treated samples. We found that the functional activity and 5-HT transport kinetics of hSERT C109A were comparable with wild-type hSERT (C109A possessed 93 ± 4% of wild-type hSERT 5-HT uptake activity at 20 nm 5-HT although a significant reduction in 5-HT KM was evident; 5-HT KM for hSERT = 1.10 ± 0.13 μm; 5-HT KM for hSERT C109A = 0.31 ± 0.093 μm, n = 3). Most importantly, we found that hSERT C109A substantially diminished reactivity to all three MTS reagents (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2047422738,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play an important role in a variety of cellular functions, including phagocytosis. PI3Ks are activated during phagocytosis induced by several receptors and have been shown to be required for phagocytosis through the use of inhibitors such as wortmannin and LY294002. Mammalian cells have multiple isoforms of PI3K, and the role of the individual isoforms during phagocytosis has not been addressed. The class I PI3Ks consist of a catalytic p110 isoform associated with a regulatory subunit. Mammals have three genes for the class IA p110 subunits encoding p110α, p110β, and p110δ and one gene for the class IB p110 subunit encoding p110γ. Here we report a specific recruitment of p110β and p110δ (but not p110α) isoforms to the nascent phagosome during apoptotic cell phagocytosis by fibroblasts. By microinjecting inhibitory antibodies specific to class IA p110 subunits, we have shown that p110β is the major isoform required for apoptotic cell and Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis by primary mouse macrophages. Macrophages from mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of p110δ showed no defect in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and IgG-opsonized particles, confirming the lack of a major role for p110δ in this process. Similarly, p110γ-deficient macrophages phagocytosed apoptotic cells normally. Our findings demonstrate that p110β is the major class I catalytic isoform required for apoptotic cell and Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis by primary macrophages.

Phagocytosis is the process by which professional and non-professional phagocytes internalize large particles. It is a conserved mechanism that is critical for the immune system and that is implicated in host defense and the removal of dying cells (1Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Uptake of pathogens via various pattern recognition receptors and uptake of IgG-opsonized foreign particles via the receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcγRs) 1The abbreviations used are: FcγRs, receptors for the Fc portion of IgG; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: FcγRs, receptors for the Fc portion of IgG; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. allow their degradation as well as the subsequent presentation of foreign antigens to the cells of the adaptive immune system (1Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, phagocytosis allows the removal of cells dying by apoptosis in vivo, a process thought to be essential for the resolution of inflammation (2Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P.W. Westcott J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar) and the modulation of the immune system (3Albert M.L. Jegathesan M. Darnell R.B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).A variety of cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and Sertoli cells, are capable of engulfing their dying neighbors. However, professional phagocytes such as macrophages are thought to be responsible for uptake of the majority of dying cells (4Platt N. da Silva R.P. Gordon S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 365-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). An important feature of the apoptosis program is to make the apoptotic cells recognizable as targets for phagocytosis. Rapid engulfment is thought to avoid injury to surrounding tissues by preventing the dying cells from releasing their intracellular contents. Several receptors have been shown to play a role in apoptotic cell recognition, including the vitronectin receptor (an αVβ3 integrin), scavenger receptors, CD14, and the phosphatidylserine receptor (5Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R795-R805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian systems have identified some of the signaling pathways required for apoptotic cell uptake (5Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R795-R805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). An early step is the polymerization of actin to form plasma membrane extensions called pseudopods (6Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The pseudopods extend over the particle and close to form a phagosome. The process of actin cup formation requires the activation of tyrosine kinases (7Hu B. Punturieri A. Todt J. Sonstein J. Polak T. Curtis J.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 881-889PubMed Google Scholar) and the participation of members of the Rho GTPase family (6Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The closure of the actin cup is inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin, inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) (6Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The completion of other forms of phagocytosis such as FcγR- and complement receptor-3-mediated phagocytosis is also dependent on PI3K activity (8Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 9Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol.

Med. 2001; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, one or more isoforms of PI3K are required for the phagocytic process.PI3Ks are activated by a variety of signals and control cellular functions such as cytoskeleton reorganization, migration, vesicular trafficking, metabolic control, and cell survival and proliferation (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 12Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). PI3Ks form a family of three classes of enzymes that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids at the 3′-position (11Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 12Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Among the PI3Ks, class I (divided into two subclasses, IA and IB) has been shown to transmit signals from tyrosine kinase-coupled receptors and G protein-coupled receptors. In vivo, class I PI3Ks catalyze mainly the conversion of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3. Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric proteins consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit associated with a p85, p55, or p50 regulatory subunit (12Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Mammals have three forms of the class IA p110 subunit: p110α, p110β, and p110δ. Class IB consists of a p110γ catalytic subunit and a p101 regulatory protein. The main function of the class IA regulatory subunit is to recruit the p110 subunit from the cytoplasm to activated receptors at the plasma membrane, where the catalytic subunit phosphorylates its lipid substrate. The role of the p101 regulatory subunit in the regulation of p110γ activity is less clear at present. The 3-phosphorylated PI lipids are second messengers that interact with the lipid-binding domains of a variety of cellular proteins (13Cullen P.J. Cozier G.E. Banting G. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R882-R893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A number of PI-binding domains have been identified, and chimeras with such domains coupled to green fluorescent protein have been used to detect the levels of various PIs in live cells by fluorescence imaging during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Using this approach, it has been demonstrated that PI(3,4,5)P3 is produced at the plasma membrane in a PI3K-dependent way during phagocytosis (14Marshall J.G. Booth J.W. Stambolic V. Mak T. Balla T. Schreiber A.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3 localizes to the actin cup at an early stage, before closure of the phagosomal vacuole. This is in accord with the early recruitment of p85α to the FcγR (14Marshall J.G. Booth J.W. Stambolic V. Mak T. Balla T. Schreiber A.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 is transient, followed by the accumulation of PI(3)P concomitant with the sealing of the vacuole (15Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 16Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1631-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The class III PI3K group comprises one enzyme (human VPS34) that produces PI(3)P from PI and that is involved in intracellular trafficking (12Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). During the phagocytic process, human VPS34 is not essential for engulfment, but is required for the fusion of phagosomes with endosomes (15Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been shown that PI(3)P controls the early stages of phagosome maturation (16Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1631-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Finally, class II PI3K enzymes (PI3KC2α, PI3KC2β, and PI3KC2γ) are large enzymes characterized by a C-terminal C2 domain (17Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). They have the potential to produce PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2 and possibly PI(3,4,5)P3. Their contribution in phagocytosis has not been examined yet.In this study, we sought to examine the requirement for different class I PI3Ks during apoptotic cell and FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Our approach has been to study the recruitment of class IA p110 isoforms to the phagosome and to inhibit their lipid kinase activity by microinjecting specific inhibitory antibodies. Moreover, we have studied the phagocytic capabilities of macrophages expressing catalytically inactive p110δ and of macrophages lacking p110γ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrimary Macrophages and Cell Lines—Baf-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 6% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 5% WEHI-3B cell-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin-3 (18Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was induced by 20 h of growth factor deprivation as previously described (19Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Perkins G.R. Mangeney M. Collins M.K. Marvel J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Jurkat human leukemia T cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Apoptosis was induced by incubation for 2 h with staurosporine (1 μm; Sigma). Under these conditions, Jurkat cells were <5% trypan blue (Sigma)-positive and 50–70% annexin V (Sigma)-positive, indicating that they were at an early stage of apoptosis. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% donor calf serum (Invitrogen) and seeded at 2 × 104 cells/13-mm glass coverslips in 4-well multidishes 24 h before phagocytosis assay.Macrophages were isolated from 6–8-week-old mice from 129/Sv, C57BL/10, and C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of p110δ (p110δD910A/D910A) have been described in detail (20Okkenhaug K. Bilancio A. Farjot G. Priddle H. Sancho S. Peskett E. Pearce W. Meek S.E. Salpekar A. Waterfield M.D. Smith A.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Science. 2002; 297: 1031-1034PubMed Google Scholar). When comparing wild-type and p110δD910A/D910A mice, age- and sex-matched mice were used. Mice deficient in p110γ have been described (21Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar).Bone marrow macrophages were isolated as previously described (22Leverrier Y. Lorenzi R. Blundell M.P. Brickell P. Kinnon C. Ridley A.J. Thrasher A.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4831-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 11 × 106 femoral bone marrow cells were plated on 10-cm bacteriological Petri dishes (Falcon) in macrophage medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1× nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% L cell-conditioned medium as a source of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). After 3 days, non-adherent cells were collected and seeded at 105 cells/ml in bacteriological Petri dishes. Non-adherent cells from these cultures could be cryogenically stored at day 3. The differentiated macrophages were used after 2–4 weeks of culture. 4 × 104 cells were seeded on 13-mm glass coverslips prior to phagocytosis assay.To purify peritoneal macrophages, mice were killed; 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected into the peritonea; the abdomens were massaged; the PBS was withdrawn; and the cells were resuspended in macrophage medium and seeded at 2 × 105 cells on 13-mm glass coverslips. After 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed, and the adherent cells were cultured for an additional 20 h prior to phagocytosis assay.Antibodies and Microinjections—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl termini of p110α, p110β, and p110δ have been previously described (see supplementary information in Ref. 23Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E. Zicha D. Hooshmand-Rad R. Sawyer C. Wells C. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Preimmune IgGs were purified over protein A. For pre-blocking experiments, anti-p110β and anti-p110δ antibodies were preincubated for 15 min with a 15-fold molar excess of their cognate synthetic peptides (KVNWMAHTVRKDYRS and (C)KVNWLAHNVSKDNRQ, respectively; Alta Bioscience). Commercial rabbit IgGs (Sigma) were used as controls.Wild-type macrophages seeded on 13-mm glass coverslips were injected into the cytoplasm with 1 mg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibodies using an Eppendorf Transjector. After microinjection, cells were subjected to phagocytosis assays.Phagocytosis Assays and Quantification—Sheep red blood cells (ICN) were opsonized with a subagglutining concentration of rabbit anti-sheep red blood cell IgG (ICN), fluorescently labeled in the presence of 10 μm 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and resuspended in macrophage medium. 5 × 105 red blood cells were added to 4 × 104 macrophages for the indicated times.Prior to the induction of apoptosis, Baf-3 and Jurkat cells were fluorescently labeled by incubation for 10 min with 10 μm 5(6)-carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester. Cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/MgCl2) and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in PBS/MgCl2 containing 1 mg/ml biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccimide ester (Sigma) to biotinylate membrane proteins. Cells were washed with PBS/MgCl2 and then resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in culture medium. After apoptosis induction (see above), the cells were washed, and 5 × 105 cells were added to 4 × 104 phagocytes for the indicated times. To remove unbound cells but to preserve bound particles, coverslips were gently washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (BDH) in PBS for 10 min.To quantify apoptotic cell phagocytosis by macrophages, specimens were stained for 1 h at room temperature with rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin (10 μg/ml; Sigma) and a fluorescein-conjugated rat antibody against the macrophage cell-surface marker F4/80 (2 μg/ml; Serotec Ltd.) in PBS and then washed twice with PBS for 5 min. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and examined by epifluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). This procedure has been described in detail previously (6Leverrier Y. Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 195-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, the macrophages were immunodetected by the antibody against F4/80 and fluoresced green. The apoptotic cells fluoresced intensely green due to the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester staining. The non-internalized apoptotic cells also fluoresced red, as their plasma membrane was biotinylated and remained accessible to the rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin.To quantify apoptotic cell phagocytosis by NIH 3T3 cells, specimens were stained with rhodamine-conjugated streptavidin, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (BDH) in PBS for 5 min, and stained with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) to visualize the fibroblasts. To quantify opsonized red blood cell phagocytosis by macrophages, specimens were stained with fluorescein-conjugated antibody against F4/80 and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml; Southern Biotechnology) to detect non-internalized red blood cells.Phagocytosis was quantified by counting ∼100 phagocytes from 5 to 10 randomly selected fields. Apoptotic cells or red blood cells were counted as phagocytosed if they fluoresced only green and as bound if they fluoresced green and red. The phagocytic index (number of particles internalized per 100 macrophages) and binding index (number of particles bound per 100 macrophages) were determined. When required, microinjected macrophages were detected by a final step of permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 and staining with aminomethylcoumarin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (50 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.).Transfections and Immunofluorescence—2 × 104 NIH 3T3 fibroblasts plated onto coverslips for 24 h were transfected with Myc-tagged constructs coding for bovine wild-type p110α (pMT-SM-p110α-3′Myc), bovine kinase-dead p110α (pSG5–5′Myc-p110α-R916P; a kind gift from Jonathan Backer, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY), human wild-type p110β (pACCMV-5′Myc-p110β; a kind gift from Morris White, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and human wild-type p110δ (pMT-SM-p110δ-3′Myc) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. After 24–32 h, 5 × 105 apoptotic Baf-3 cells with biotinylated cell-surface proteins (see above) were added for 90 min. The specimens were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked for 30 min with 20% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS. Specimens were then incubated for 60 min with mouse anti-Myc antibody (1 μg/ml 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS containing 20% goat serum, followed by 30 min of incubation with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml; Southern Biotechnology), rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma), and Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (4 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol. Images of cells (single sections) were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope.RESULTSRecruitment of p110β and p110δ to Phagocytic Cups—To address the role of individual p110 isoforms during apoptotic cell phagocytosis, we first investigated their recruitment to the nascent phagosome. In the absence of antibodies sensitive enough to detect endogenous class IA p110 isoforms, we increased their expression levels in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts by transfection. Although these cells are not professional phagocytes, they are able to phagocytose apoptotic cells, albeit at low levels, using the phosphatidylserine receptor (24Hoffmann P.R. deCathelineau A.M. Ogden C.A. Leverrier Y. Bratton D.L. Daleke D.L. Ridley A.J. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The engulfment (but not the binding) of apoptotic cells by NIH 3T3 cells was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1), showing that the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by NIH 3T3 cells is PI3K-dependent. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with constructs coding for Myc-tagged p110 isoforms and then incubated with apoptotic cells. In the absence of bound particles, Myc-tagged p110α, p110β, and p110δ were detected mainly in the cytoplasm (data not shown). When NIH 3T3 cells engulfed apoptotic cells, F-actin accumulated to form an actin cup at the site of binding with the apoptotic cell (Fig. 2). Localized accumulation of p110β and p110δ (but not p110α) was observed in the actin cup (Fig. 2). When apoptotic cells were bound only to the NIH 3T3 cells without inducing the formation of an actin cup, p110β and p110δ did not localize to the site of binding (data not shown). This result indicates that p110β and p110δ can be specifically recruited at the site of apoptotic cell phagocytosis in transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.Fig. 2p110β and p110δ are recruited to the actin cup during apoptotic cell phagocytosis by fibroblasts. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with cDNAs encoding 5′Myc-p110αKD (A), 5′Mycp110β (B), and p110δ-3′Myc (C). Transfected cells were incubated for 24–32 h to allow expression and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h with biotinylated apoptotic Baf-3 cells. F-actin was detected using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (left panels). Apoptotic cells were detected using Cy5-conjugated streptavidin (middle panels). p110 isoforms were detected using mouse anti-Myc antibody, followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (right panels). Arrows indicate colocalization of the actin cup, the p110 isoform, and an apoptotic cell. Arrowheads indicate an actin cup surrounding an apoptotic cell, but devoid of p110α staining. Similar results were obtained with wild-type p110α-3′Myc (data not shown).

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the carboxyl termini of p110α, p110β, and p110δ were produced and characterized previously (see supplementary information in Ref. 23Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E.

Each antibody (but not preimmune IgG) selectively neutralized the lipid kinase activity of its specific p110 in vitro. In the BAC1.2F5 macrophage cell line, antibodies to p110β and p110δ were shown to inhibit CSF-1-induced chemotaxis, whereas antibody to p110α was shown to inhibit CSF-1-induced proliferation (23Vanhaesebroeck B.

Microinjection of control IgG or preimmune IgG did not affect apoptotic cell binding or apoptotic cell internalization by the macrophages (Fig. 3), indicating that the microinjection process did not affect the phagocytosis process. Macrophages microinjected with anti-p110α antibody phagocytosed apoptotic cells at levels similar to control macrophages, whereas macrophages microinjected with anti-p110δ antibody showed a small but significant reduction in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Macrophages injected with anti-p110β antibody were most severely blocked in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (70% inhibition). The effects observed were not due to impaired binding, as none of the antibodies blocked apoptotic cell binding significantly (Fig. 3B). Moreover, pre-blocking the anti-p110β and anti-p110δ antibodies with their cognate peptides fully reversed the phagocytosis inhibition (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3p110β is the major class IA isoform required for apoptotic cell phagocytosis by bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were microinjected in the cytoplasm with polyclonal rabbit antibodies (1 mg/ml) and incubated with apoptotic Baf-3 cells for 90 min. Apoptotic cell phagocytosis (A) and apoptotic cell binding (B) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are reported as percentage of non-injected neighboring macrophages.

The peculiarities of the cell cycle organization during Plasmodium falciparum schizogony suggest that the modalities of cell cycle control in this organism may differ from those in other eukaryotes. Indeed, existing data concerning Plasmodium cell cycle regulators such as cyclin-dependent kinases reveal structural and functional properties that are divergent from those of their homologues in other systems. The work presented here lies in the context of the exploitation of the recently available P. falciparum genome sequence toward the characterization of putative cell cycle regulators. We describe the in silico identification of three open reading frames encoding proteins with maximal homology to various members of the cyclin family and demonstrate that the corresponding polypeptides are expressed in the erythrocytic stages of the infection. We present evidence that these proteins possess cyclin activity by demonstrating either their association with histone H1 kinase activity in parasite extracts or their ability to activate PfPK5, a P. falciparum cyclin-dependent kinase homologue, in vitro. Furthermore, we show that RINGO, a protein with no sequence homology to cyclins but that is nevertheless a strong activator of mammalian CDK1/2, is also a strong activator of PfPK5 in vitro. This raises the possibility that “cryptic” cell cycle regulators may be found among the 50% of the open reading frames in the P. falciparum genome that display no homology to any known proteins.

Four to eight thousand people, most of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, die every day from malaria. The spread of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasitic protozoan responsible for the vast majority of lethal malaria cases, is a cause for grave concern with respect to disease control and renders the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents an urgent task (1Ridley R.G. Nature. 2002; 415: 686-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The identification of potential targets is now greatly facilitated by the availability of genomic data bases (2Kissinger J.C.

Stoeckert C.J. Roos D.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (see www.PlasmoDB.org) resulting from an international effort that led to the recent publication of the entire P. falciparum genome sequence (3Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherford K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J.

Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3404) Google Scholar).The life cycle of malaria parasites consists of a succession of developmental stages, some of which are characterized by intense cell proliferation, whereas in others the cell cycle is arrested. P. falciparum infection of the human host is initiated by injection of cell cycle-arrested sporozoites into the bloodstream by an infected Anopheles mosquito. The sporozoites rapidly gain the liver and invade hepatocytes, where asexual multiplication (exoerythrocytic schizogony) occurs, leading to the production of several thousand merozoites. These are released into the bloodstream and invade erythrocytes, which become the site of another round of asexual multiplication, producing 8–24 new merozoites/infected red blood cell. This phase of the infection (erythrocytic schizogony) is responsible for malaria pathogenesis. The molecular mechanisms through which some of the merozoites, upon red blood cell invasion, arrest their cell cycle and differentiate into male or female gametocytes instead of initiating a new round of schizogony are not understood. Ingestion of gametocytes by a mosquito is required for transmission to the insect vector, in the midgut of which these cells mature into gametes; for the male gametocytes, this requires sudden release from cell cycle arrest and three rounds of cell division to produce eight gametes. Fertilization in the mosquito midgut then yields a zygote, the only diploid stage in the life cycle of the parasite. Meiotic reduction occurs in the ookinete, the motile form into which the zygote rapidly develops. This ookinete crosses the peritrophic membrane and the midgut epithelium and immobilizes at the epithelium basal lamina. There it undergoes further development into an oocyst, a site of intense asexual multiplication producing several thousand sporozoites, which are cell cycle-arrested and accumulate in the salivary glands of the mosquito, ready to be injected into a vertebrate host during a subsequent blood meal (see www.malaria.org for more information on malaria).Obviously, the parasite must tightly regulate its cell division status in response to its environment to complete its life cycle. The organization of the Plasmodium cell cycle in the different developmental stages and the molecular mechanisms through which its progression is controlled are far from being understood (reviewed in Refs. 4Doerig C. Chakrabarti D. Kappes B. Matthews K. Prog Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and 5Doerig C. Chakrabarti D. Janse C.J. Plasmodium Genomes and Their Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Wymondham, UK2004Google Scholar). Erythrocytic schizogony has received more attention from researchers than other dividing stages of the life cycle of the parasite, because (i) this process is responsible for pathogenesis and (ii) it is comparatively easier to obtain biological material from infected red blood cells cultured in vitro than from other stages. A clear correspondence between cellular events occurring during Plasmodium schizogony and the G1, S, G2, and M phases of the “classical” cell cycle has not been established (6Arnot D.E. Gull K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The invading merozoite is presumably in G1, and DNA synthesis is initiated in the trophozoite ∼18 h post-invasion. Nuclear divisions ensue in the absence of cytodieresis, resulting in the formation of a schizont; nuclei in a given schizont appear to divide asynchronously (7Read M. Sherwin T. Holloway S.P. Gull K. Hyde J.E. Parasitology. 1993; 106: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which suggests that cell cycle progression is not dictated solely by fluctuations in the cytoplasmic abundance of cell cycle regulators. It is not clear whether a strict succession of S phases and nuclear divisions occurs, or whether segregation of newly replicated genomes into individual nuclei takes place in a different way. Plasmodial cell multiplication displays other atypical features, such as the absence of chromosome condensation, the maintenance of the nuclear membrane (cryptomitosis), and the presence of intranuclear spindles.The asynchrony of nuclear division in a given schizont renders biochemical analysis of cell cycle progression very difficult. A possible approach to gaining insight into molecular processes of cell cycle control in Plasmodium is to study the function, subcellular localization, and other properties of putative regulators such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; MBP, maltose-binding protein; CTD, C-terminal domain.1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; MBP, maltose-binding protein; CTD, C-terminal domain. Several enzymes related to CDKs have been characterized to date in P. falciparum (reviewed in Ref. 8Doerig C. Endicott J. Chakrabarti D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two of these enzymes have been shown to be activated by association with cyclins: PfPK5, a putative homologue of CDK1 (9Ross-Macdonald P.B. Graeser R. Kappes B. Franklin R. Williamson D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that can be activated in vitro by a variety of cyclin-related proteins including mammalian cyclin H and p25, and Pfcyc-1, the only Plasmodium cyclin characterized so far (10Le Roch K. Sestier C. Dorin D. Waters N. Kappes B. Chakrabarti D. Meijer L. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Hence PfPK5 appears to display promiscuity in its cyclin requirement. Another atypical functional feature of PfPK5, which to our knowledge has not been reported for CDKs from other organisms, is its ability to autophosphorylate in the presence of a cyclin (10Le Roch K. Sestier C. Dorin D. Waters N. Kappes B. Chakrabarti D. Meijer L. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Pfmrk, a protein kinase with maximal homology to CDK-activating kinases (CAKs) of the CDK7 family (11Li J.L. Robson K.J. Chen J.L. Targett G.A. Baker D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), can also be activated by Pfcyc-1 (12Li Z. Le Roch K. Geyer J.A. Woodard C.L. Prigge S.T. Koh J. Doerig C. Waters N.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The genome of P. falciparum encodes at least four additional protein kinases related to CDKs (8Doerig C. Endicott J. Chakrabarti D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional cyclins are present as well (in eukaryotes whose genome sequence is known, the number of cyclins is larger than that of CDK catalytic subunits). PCR-based approaches have failed in the identification of malarial cyclins (but not of CDK-related kinases), presumably because of the low level of conservation of Plasmodium cyclins with their counterparts in other eukaryotes. Indeed, Pfcyc-1 identification had to await the in silico search possibilities offered by the availability of genomic data bases (10Le Roch K. Sestier C. Dorin D. Waters N. Kappes B. Chakrabarti D. Meijer L. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe three novel P. falciparum open reading frames (ORFs) identified in the PlasmoDB data base on the basis of their relatedness to cyclins at the primary structure level. We demonstrate that these ORFs encode proteins whose abundance fluctuate during schizogony and that associate with protein kinase activity in parasite extracts, and we show that one of them is able to activate PfPK5 in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PfPK5 can be efficiently activated by RINGO, a Xenopus protein unrelated to cyclins but able to activate a subset of mammalian CDKs (13Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Karaiskou A. Perez L.H. Ferby I. Ozon R. Jessus C. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36028-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), pointing to the possibility that cryptic cyclin-like protein may be present in malaria parasites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning and Bacterial ExpressionPfcyc-2—Oligonucleotides were designed for amplification of a 1173-bp region (positions 2956–4129, carrying the cyclin-related sequence) from the 6846-bp ORF (gene PFL1330c in PlasmoDB). The primers contained BamHI (forward primer, GGGGGATCCATGAATGGTGGTGATTTGGTG) or SalI (reverse primer, GGGGTCGACAATAGTTGTATCATTTGTGTGGTC) restriction sites (single underline). After amplification from a P. falciparum cDNA library (kindly provided by A. Craig) with Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), the PCR product was digested with BamHI and SalI prior to insertion in the pGEX-4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The pGEX-4T3-Pfcyc-2 plasmid was electroporated into Escherichia coli BL21, and (for all three ORF discussed here) the insert was verified by sequencing prior to expression of the recombinant protein.Protein expression and purification were performed essentially as previously described for GST-Pfcyc-1 (10Le Roch K. Sestier C. Dorin D. Waters N. Kappes B. Chakrabarti D. Meijer L. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression was induced for 4 h at 30 °C with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactoside, after the 250-ml culture reached an A 600 value of 0.6 in 2× YT medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. All of the purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The bacterial pellets were lysed with lysosyme and by sonication in 5 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complex™ mixture protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (11000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min), and the soluble fraction was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C under mild agitation with 0.5 ml of glutathione-agarose resin (Amersham Biosciences). The slurry was washed in lysis buffer, and the GST-Pfcyc-2 fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm glutathione).Pfcyc-3—The entire ORF (PFE0920c in PlasmoDB) was cloned into the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of the pMALc2x vector (New England Biolabs) after amplification from P. falciparum 3D7 genomic DNA using the following primers (start and stop codons in double underline): GGGGGATCCATGGATTACGAGGTAGAGGGA (forward) and GGGGTCGACTTATTTATTTCCATGTTGATC (reverse). E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with pMALc2x-Pfcyc-3 plasmid by electroporation. Protein expression and purification was as described above for the GST fusion proteins, except that lysis buffer was 20 mm Tris, pH 7,5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complex™ protease inhibitors and that the MBP-Pfcyc3 fusion protein was eluted from amylose resin (New England Biolabs) with lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose.Pfcyc-4 —(gene PF13_0022 in PlasmoDB) was amplified from a cDNA library and cloned into the BamHI and SalI restriction sites of pGEX-4T3. Two constructs were made: the first one contained only the first exon (residues 1–75) as found in a previous version of PlasmoDB and was obtained by amplification from 3D7 (15Walliker D. Quakyi I.A. Wellems T.E. McCutchan T.F. Szarfman A. London W.T. Corcoran L.M. Burkot T.R. Carter R. Science. 1987; 236: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) genomic DNA using the primers GGGGGATCCATGATGAATGACATAGTTTTA (forward) and GGGGTCGACTTATTTTACGTTAACGTCAAAATC (reverse). The second construct contained the entire PF13_0022 ORF (5 exons), which was obtained by amplification from cDNA using the same forward primer and ACGCGTCGACCTATATACCTATTTTGTAAAGCTCCAATATTC (reverse). Recombinant protein expression and purification were performed as described above for GST-Pfcyc-2. Expression and purifi-cation of MBP-RINGO (ls26 clone) were performed as described elsewhere (13Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Parasite Extracts and Pull-down ExperimentsP. falciparum (3D7) pellets were sonicated in RIPA buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and Complex™ protease inhibitors). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C), and the total amount of proteins in the supernatant was measured by a Bio-Rad protein assay. The beads coated with GST, GST-Pfcyc-1, GST-Pfcyc-2, or GST-Pfcyc-4 were incubated in these parasite extracts or in RIPA buffer alone at 4 °C, under mild agitation for 90 min (100 μg of total parasite proteins for 10 μg of recombinant protein on beads). The beads were then washed three times in RIPA buffer, once in RIPA buffer with 0.1% SDS, and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). A kinase assay was then performed by adding 15 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 5 μg of histone H1 in kinase buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.RT-PCRTotal RNA samples were extracted from asexual cultures of clones 3D7 (15Walliker D. Quakyi I.A. Wellems T.E. McCutchan T.F. Szarfman A. London W.T. Corcoran L.M. Burkot T.R. Carter R. Science. 1987; 236: 1661-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) and F12 (16Alano P. Roca L. Smith D. Read D. Carter R. Day K. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and from Percoll purified 3D7 gametocytes (stages III, IV, and V) using the Qiagen Rneasy® Mini Kit and then treated with Promega RQ1 RNase-free DNase. RT-PCRs were performed with 100 ng of total RNA using the Invitrogen SuperScript™ One-Step™ RT-PCR system with 2 mm MgSO4 and 20 pmol of primers/reaction, with exception for Pfcyc-1, where 50 pmol of primers, and TaKaRa Ex Taq Polymerase were utilized. In control reactions reverse transcriptase was omitted, and only AmpliTaq Polymerase (TaKaRa for Pfcyc-1) was present. The reactions were incubated at 48 °C for 1 h; 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 5 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min; followed by 7 min at 68 °C.The sequences of oligonucleotides specific for Pfcyc-1, Pfcyc-2, and Pfcyc-3 are indicated above. Primers specific for genes MSP-1 and Pfg377 were as follows: MSP-1 dir, 5′-GAAGCTTTAGAAGATGCAGTATTGACAGG-3′; MSP-1 rev, 5′-GATATTTGAGTTCTTTAATAGTGAACAAG-3′; Pfg377 dir, 5′-TTATCAAACGATGATACTAATGAAAATGG-3′; and Pfg377 rev, 5′-ATATTTAAAATTCGAAAAGTCATAGGTAC-3′.AntibodiesThe following peptides were obtained from NeoSystems: Pfcyc-1, residues 312–326, (C)-KEDNVTEPNKKLQVS-COOH; Pfcyc-2, residues 376–391 of the cloned portion of the ORF, (C)-EIYSEQKYDHTNDTTI-C-terminal amide; Pfcyc-3, residues 51–66, SLKNYTERIGKYIGCS (C-terminal amide); and Pfcyc-4, residues 1–15, MMNDIVLINKKKTPS-(C) (C-terminal amide). The peptides were designed with a terminal cysteine residue (except for Pcyc-3, whose chosen peptide contains an internal cysteine) and coupled to rabbit albumin using 3-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (17Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Two chickens were immunized intramuscularly in the breast muscle with 200 μg of the peptide (as a conjugate) emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant on day 0 of the experiment and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 with conjugate emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (17Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Eggs were collected and labeled for 16 weeks after immunization and stored at 4 °C until processed. IgY was isolated from chicken yolks using the method of Polson et al. (18Polson A. Coetzer T. Kruger J. von Maltzahn E. van der Merwe K.J. Immunol. Invest. 1985; 14: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) involving a series of polyethylene glycol precipitations. The final IgY pellet was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.02% sodium azide and stored at 4 °C. IgY was isolated from eggs each week. Anti-peptide antibodies were affinity-purified by cycling the isolated antibodies over a SulfoLink-peptide affinity column prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The antibodies were eluted with glycine HCl, pH 2.8, and the pH of the eluant was neutralized with 10% volume of 1 m phosphate buffer at pH 8.5. Protein was measured at 280 nm, and the concentration was determined using the IgY extinction coefficient of 1.25.Western Blotting and ImmunoprecipitationP. falciparum 3D7 maintained in a modified erythrocyte culture (19Haldar K. Ferguson M.A. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4969-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synchronized by 5% sorbitol (20Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). The parasites were released from infected erythrocytes by saponin (0.1% w/v) lysis. Cell-free extracts were prepared by resuspending synchronized parasite pellets from different developmental stages of growth in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Following 15 min of incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was performed using Supersignal West pico kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using appropriate immunopurified primary and secondary antibodies. The relative intensities of the bands were quantified in a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 system using Quantity One software.For immunoprecipitation, parasite extract (100 μg) was incubated with immunopurified anti-Pfcyc-1, -Pfcyc-2, -Pfcyc-3, or -Pfcyc-4 chicken antibodies (1.5 μg) on ice for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Biosciences) was coated with anti-chicken IgY rabbit antibodies (Pierce) for 90 min under mild agitation at 4 °C in RIPA buffer and washed four times with RIPA buffer. The immunocomplexes in the parasite extract were then precipitated with 10 μl of protein A/anti-chicken rabbit antibody beads at 4 °C under mild agitation for 90 min. The following chicken IgY antibodies were used as negative controls: nonimmune, immunopurified anti-human C5a receptor (against the peptide sequence DSKTFTPSTDDTSPRKSQAV) and immunopurified anti-MIE-2, a Trypanosoma glucose transporter (against the peptide sequence MIEGSRNSSAVKKRLVAKPLEEC). Another negative control was performed by omitting the primary IgY altogether and incubating the extract only with anti-chicken/protein A beads. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in RIPA buffer, once in RIPA buffer with 0.1% SDS, and once in kinase buffer and finally suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase assays were performed in a standard reaction as described below.Kinase AssaysThe assays were performed in a standard reaction (30 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2 15 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μg of histone H1 (Invitrogen) or 2 μg GST-CTD. The reactions were initiated by addition of 0.5 or 1.0 μg each of the recombinant protein kinase and a cyclin partner, after both proteins had been allowed to form a complex at 30 °C for 15 min in kinase assay buffer. The kinase reactions proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C and were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled for 3 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and submitted to autoradiography.RESULTSIn Silico Identification of Three P. falciparum ORFs Related to CyclinsWe performed BLASTP searches of the PlasmoDB data base using as queries a variety of cyclin sequences from diverse organisms and also used the “text search” tool on the PlasmoDB website, using the word “cyclin” as a query. This enabled us to identify the previously characterized Pfcyc-1 gene (10Le Roch K. Sestier C. Dorin D. Waters N. Kappes B. Chakrabarti D. Meijer L. Doerig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8952-8958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), as well as three additional ORFs, all of which displayed maximal homology to various cyclins upon BLASTP analysis of generalist data bases (Table I).Table ICharacteristics of the cyclin-related proteins included in this studyPlasmoDB identifierPfam PF00134 scoreSize (amino acids)Maximal homologyExpected molecular masskDaPfcyc-1PF14_06052.2327 (1 exon)Cyclin H (20% identity)39.2Pfcyc-2PFL1330c82281 (2 exons)Plant mitotic cyclins (13% identity)273.5Pfcyc-3PFE0920c3.2229 (1 exon)T. brucei CYC2 (26% identity)26.8Pfcyc-4PF13_002213.4226 (5 exons)ania-type cyclins (33% identity)31.1 Open table in a new tab Pfcyc-2—The first novel ORF we identified in this search is located on chromosome 12 (gene PFL1330c in PlasmoDB), comprises two exons, and potentially encodes a large protein; the Pf annotation predicts a 2281-residue polypeptide, which includes a 390-amino acid sequence (residues 986–1376) that meets the criteria for recognition as a cyclin in the Pfam conserved domain data base (Table I). Indeed, performing a BLASTP analysis using this region as a query to screen generalist data bases, we found that all of the high score entries were cyclins from a variety of organisms, most of them mitotic (A and B type) cyclins. Despite this consistency, the homology is rather low (13% identity over the 390-residue cyclin-like region with a cyclin from Asterina pectinifera, increasing to 40% identity over the most conserved 80 residues within the cyclin box). An alignment of this region with two of the most closely related cyclins is shown in Fig. 1A.To verify that the Pfcyc-2 cyclin-like region was part of a much larger polypeptide, as predicted by the algorithms in PlasmoDB, we performed RT-PCR experiments (data not shown) with P. falciparum mRNA and primers designed from the predicted ends of the entire ORF. This enabled us to amplify the entire region (2.7 kb) lying 3′ to the cyclin-related sequence. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 5′ boundary of the intron is shorter than that predicted in PlasmoDB; in our cDNA the intron was located between positions 6170 and 6327 (counting from the initiation codon) instead of positions 6104 and 6327 as predicted in the data base. We were unable to obtain PCR product starting at the predicted translation initiation site, presumably because of the large size of the mRNA. However, we obtained a PCR product extending 1.3 kp upstream of the cyclin-related region. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the Pfcyc-2 mRNA is at least 5.2 kb in size (from nucleotides 1633 to 6846 in the PlasmoDB entry). Furthermore, sequence analysis showed that a continuous ORF embeds the cyclin-related region, as predicted on PlasmoDB (although we noticed a 1-base deletion in a stretch of As outside the cyclin region (position 4376), probably arising from polymerase slippage during reverse transcription; this is a common occurrence with the AT-rich malarial genes).Pfcyc-3—This single-exon ORF is located on chromosome 5 (gene PFE0920c) and potentially encodes a 229-amino acid polypeptide. The ORF is flanked on both sides by regions that are extremely AT-rich, which are characteristic of noncoding DNA in P. falciparum. The highest score obtained by BLASTP analysis of the Pfcyc-3 ORF on generalist data bases corresponds to the Trypanosoma brucei CYC2 gene, which was identified by complementation of a yeast G1 cyclin mutant (21Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwarz R.T. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pfcyc-3 shows 26% identity to TbCYC2 over the entire ORF and 44% identity over the most conserved region (residues 40–155; see Fig. 1B for an alignment). Most other BLASTP high score entries are cyclin-related proteins.Fig. 1Alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of the malarial cyclins. The cyclin boxes are underlined.

https://openalex.org/W2049182485,"A role for myeloperoxidase (MPO) in atherosclerosis has received considerable attention recently. To identify potential chlorinated lipid products in human low density lipoprotein (LDL), studies were designed to demonstrate that MPO-derived reactive chlorinating species (RCS) target the plasmalogen pool of LDL isolated from peripheral human blood in vitro. The vinyl ether bond of LDL plasmalogens was targeted by MPO-derived RCS, resulting in the release of the 16- and 18-carbon-containing α-chloro fatty aldehydes, 2-chlorohexadecanal and 2-chlorooctadecanal, respectively, from the plasmalogen glycerol backbone. Targeting of the LDL plasmalogen vinyl ether bond was dependent on the presence of MPO-derived RCS. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis of MPO-treated LDL demonstrated that a novel population of unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholine molecular species was produced by a phospholipase A2-independent mechanism. Unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholine molecular species elicited cyclic AMP response element binding protein phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, MPO-mediated targeting of both monocyte and LDL plasmalogen pools was demonstrated in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated human monocytes, resulting in the production of both 2-chlorohexadecanal and 2-chlorooctadecanal. In contrast, α-chloro fatty aldehydes were not produced in phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated mouse monocytes. Collectively, the present studies demonstrate a novel MPO-specific mechanism that mediates the production of a novel group of unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholine molecular species and chlorinated aldehydes from both LDL and monocyte plasmalogen pools that may have important effects during inflammatory reactions mediated by monocytes, most notably atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023646321,"Suprastructures of the extracellular matrix, such as banded collagen fibrils, microfibrils, filaments, or networks, are composites comprising more than one type of macromolecule. The suprastructural diversity reflects tissue-specific requirements and is achieved by formation of macromolecular composites that often share their main molecular components alloyed with minor components. Both, the mechanisms of formation and the final macromolecular organizations depend on the identity of the components and their quantitative contribution. Collagen I is the predominant matrix constituent in many tissues and aggregates with other collagens and/or fibril-associated macromolecules into distinct types of banded fibrils. Here, we studied co-assembly of collagens I and XI, which co-exist in fibrils of several normal and pathologically altered tissues, including fibrous cartilage and bone, or osteoarthritic joints. Immediately upon initiation of fibrillogenesis, the proteins co-assembled into alloy-like stubby aggregates that represented efficient nucleation sites for the formation of composite fibrils. Propagation of fibrillogenesis occurred by exclusive accretion of collagen I to yield composite fibrils of highly variable diameters. Therefore, collagen I/XI fibrils strikingly differed from the homogeneous fibrillar alloy generated by collagens II and XI, although the constituent polypeptides of collagens I and II are highly homologous. Thus, the mode of aggregation of collagens into vastly diverse fibrillar composites is finely tuned by subtle differences in molecular structures through formation of macromolecular alloys."
https://openalex.org/W2002761895,"Maintenance of glucose uptake is a key component in the response of hematopoietic cells to survival factors. To investigate the mechanism of this response we employed the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine mast cell line IC2.9. In these cells, hexose uptake decreased markedly upon withdrawal of IL-3, whereas its readdition led to rapid (t ½ ∼ 10 min) stimulation of transport, associated with an ∼4-fold increase in V max but no change in Km. Immunocytochemistry and photoaffinity labeling revealed that IL-3 caused translocation of intracellular GLUT1 transporters to the cell surface, whereas a second transporter isoform, GLUT3, remained predominantly intracellular. The inhibitory effects of latrunculin B and jasplakinolide, and of nocodazole and colchicine, respectively, revealed a requirement for both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in GLUT1 translocation and transport stimulation. Both IL-3 stimulation of transport and GLUT1 translocation were also prevented by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. The time courses for activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream target, protein kinase B, by IL-3 were consistent with a role in IL-3-induced transporter translocation and enhanced glucose uptake. We conclude that one component of the survival mechanisms elicited by IL-3 involves the subcellular redistribution of glucose transporters, thus ensuring the supply of a key metabolic substrate.

We conclude that one component of the survival mechanisms elicited by IL-3 involves the subcellular redistribution of glucose transporters, thus ensuring the supply of a key metabolic substrate. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells require extracellular stimuli for their survival, and in the absence of such stimuli they undergo apoptosis. By facilitating the rapid elimination of cells after they have served their function, this process plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the hematopoietic population. Recently, several oncogenes associated with human leukemias have also been shown to inhibit apoptosis, and the ability of preleukemic and leukemic cells to survive in the absence of stimuli required by normal cells is believed to be an important feature of this disease. The survival both of normal stem cells and of leukemic cells is thus regulated by the suppression of a latent cell suicide pathway, via signal transduction pathways activated by cytokines and oncogenes, respectively (1Chapman R.S. Gregory C.D. Dive C. Whetton A.D. Gordon J. Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 151-201Google Scholar). Although the involvement of particular signaling molecules depends on the form of stimulation (cytokine or oncogene) and the cellular background in which the pathways are being invoked, certain common components have been identified as having an important role in the resultant cell survival (1Chapman R.S. Gregory C.D. Dive C. Whetton A.D. Gordon J. Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 151-201Google Scholar, 2Matulonis U. Salgia R. Okuda K.

The maintenance of glucose uptake appears to play a key role in the suppression of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp.

Withdrawal of interleukin-3 (IL-3) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-3, interleukin-3; Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA, 4,4′-O-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[6-(biotinylamino)hexanoyl]amino]ethoxy]-ethoxy]ethoxy]-4-(1-azi-2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]amino-1,3-propanediyl-bis-d-mannose; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C. from such cells results in a steady reduction in glucose uptake in the period preceding irreversible commitment to apoptosis (3Kan O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17276-17282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that apoptosis induced in this fashion could be suppressed by activation of the oncogene v-abl in the IL-3-dependent murine mast cell line IC.DP and that this apoptotic suppression was associated with the stimulation of glucose transport (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of glucose uptake by transport inhibitors markedly increased the rate of apoptosis in these cells, an effect that could be reversed by the provision of alternative energy sources such as glutamine (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for a role of glucose transport regulation in the suppression of apoptosis was provided by Berridge et al. (5Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. McCoy K.D. Kansara M. Rudert F. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4092-4099PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that induction of apoptosis by a CD95 receptor-specific antibody in human T-lymphoblastic Jurkat cells caused a decrease in transporter affinity for substrate within minutes of CD95 receptor ligation. More recently, it has been shown that constitutive GLUT1 overexpression significantly retards IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis in FL5.12 cells (6Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Hence maintenance of glucose transport by cytokines/oncogenes appears to be an essential feature of the survival response of hematopoietic cells, and consequently disruption of glucose transport can have profound effects on cell survival. However, the mechanisms by which acute changes in glucose transport are regulated in hematopoietic cells remain poorly understood. IL-3 is one of the best characterized cell survival factors. Binding of this cytokine to its receptor leads to the stimulation of multiple signal transduction pathways, including the Jak/STAT pathway, the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway, and the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, the last probably involving the phospholipase C-mediated generation of the second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (7Rao P. Mufson R.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 777-783PubMed Google Scholar, 8de Groot R.P. Coffer P.J. Koenderman L. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Activated forms of both PI 3-kinase and PKB are sufficient to prevent apoptosis induced in RAT-1 fibroblasts by either serum deprivation or c-myc expression (9Kauffman-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Similarly, numerous reports have linked activation of these enzymes to cell survival in cytokine-dependent cells (10Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), although some studies have suggested that targets in addition to PI 3-kinase and PKB may be involved in suppression of apoptosis by cytokines in some hematopoietic cells (11Dijkers P.F. van Dijk T.B. de Groot R.P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Alterations in glucose transport in response to cytokines or growth factors have been speculatively attributed to several signaling molecules including PKC, protein-tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases (4McCoy K.D.

Nevertheless the involvement of specific signaling pathways has yet to be demonstrated directly. In the present study we investigated IL-3 stimulation of glucose transport in IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cells, with the aims both of establishing the mechanism of transport stimulation and of identifying the signaling pathways involved. We show that IL-3 stimulates GLUT1 translocation from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface, in a process dependent upon both the cytoskeleton and upon activation of PI 3-kinase. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant murine IL-3, LY294002, Gö 6850, Gö 6983, and PD98059, latrunculin B, jasplakinolide, and colchicine were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. FITC-phalloidin, nocodazole, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma, and 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (specific activity 7.35 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-GLUT1 antibodies used in this study have been described previously (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Anti-GLUT3 antibodies were raised in rabbit using an ovalbumin-conjugated 16-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of murine GLUT3 (15Nagamatsu S. Kornhauser J.M. Burant C.F. Seino S. Mayo K.E. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 467-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and affinity purified by chromatography on a column of immobilized peptide. Cell Culture—IC2.9 cells were cultured routinely as described previously (16Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% (v/v) CO2 in Fischer's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% (v/v) horse serum and 5% (v/v) X63-Ag-653 cell-conditioned medium containing IL-3. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Transport Assay—Cells from mid-log phase IC2.9 cultures were depleted of IL-3 by washing three times over a period of 3hat37 °C in Fischer's medium containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. They were then resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml in Fischer's/HEPES before incubation with the appropriate concentration of IL-3 and/or inhibitor for the time indicated. Before subsequent transport measurements, cells were washed twice in Krebs-Ringer/HEPES buffer (KRH buffer; 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to remove glucose. Transport experiments were performed on 50-μl samples at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in KRH buffer. Uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (0.1–10 mm, containing 2 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose) was measured over a period of 1 min at 37 °C. Under these conditions uptake was found to be linear for at least 3 min (data not shown). Previous studies had shown that transport, rather than phosphorylation, was rate-limiting for 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. 2A. D. Whetton, unpublished results. Uptake values were therefore considered to represent a true measure of initial rates of hexose transport. Carrier-mediated uptake rates were calculated by subtracting nonspecific uptake, measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B. Transport was terminated by the addition of ice-cold KRH buffer containing 200 μm phloretin and centrifugation through a layer of mixed oils consisting of Dow Corning 550 silicone fluid (BDH) and dinonylphthalate (Fisher Scientific) (1:1 v/v). The oil layer was washed three times, aspirated, and the resultant cell pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of 1 m NaOH for 1 h. Emulsifier safe liquid scintillant (Packard Bioscience BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) was then added and the radioactivity measured 16 h later. Estimation of the kinetic parameters of transport was performed by nonlinear curve fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program FigP (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Where indicated the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of results. Western Blotting—Cells were depleted of cytokine and then treated with or without recombinant IL-3 as described for 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport assays. After harvesting by centrifugation, they were lysed by sonication for 1 min at maximum amplitude (Ultrasonics W225-R) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin (each at 1 μg/ml) and 200 μm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples (20 μg of protein) of the resultant suspensions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), using affinity-purified anti-GLUT1 or anti-GLUT3 antibodies. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were depleted of cytokine and then treated with or without recombinant IL-3 as described for 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport assays. After washing briefly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 154 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, samples (8 × 104 cells) were prepared for microscopy by centrifugation onto Vectabond™-treated (Vector Laboratories) microscope slides using a Jouan CR312 centrifuge (50 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cells were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and PBS for 20 min, permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and PBS for 10 min, blocked in 10% (v/v) goat serum (Sigma) for 1 h, and then incubated with either 1 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-GLUT1 or anti-GLUT3 or 120 μg/ml mouse anti-tubulin in 1% (v/v) serum and PBS overnight. Slides were incubated for 1 h with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (Sigma) and mounted with Vectashield™ (Vector Laboratories). For visualization of actin filaments, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml FITC-phalloidin in PBS for 1 h. For imaging, 20 optical sections were captured at 0.2-μm intervals using a DeltaVision® system (Applied Precision, LLC, Issaquah, WA), comprising an Olympus IX70 microscope linked to a CCD camera and a work station, and processed using the manufacturer's deconvolution software. Both camera and deconvolution parameters were kept constant for each image. Photolabeling—Cells (2 × 107) were depleted of IL-3 by washing over a period of 3 h in Fischer's/HEPES and then incubated for 1 h in Fischer's/HEPES in either the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml recombinant IL-3 and/or 100 μm LY294002. Photolabeling was then carried out using a modification of the method published by Koumanov et al. (17Koumanov F. Yang J. Jones A.E. Hatanaka Y. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in KRH buffer and then resuspended in 200 μl of KRH containing 200 μm Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. They were then irradiated for 1 min in a Rayonet RPR 100 photochemical reactor (RPR-3000 lamps), washed three times in KRH and then once in TES buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). The photolabeled cells were homogenized in 1 ml of TES in a Potter homogenizer using 20 strokes, and membranes were isolated by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Membranes (500 μg) were solubilized in 1 ml of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and then precipitated by continuous mixing with 40 μl of a 50% (w/v) streptavidin-agarose bead slurry (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The precipitates were then washed four times in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, four times in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and finally twice in PBS. The washed pellets were eluted by heating at 95 °C for 20 min in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS. Samples were resolved on 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blotting was performed with either affinity-purified anti-GLUT1 or anti-GLUT3 using an Immun-Star goat anti-rabbit IgG detection kit (Bio-Rad). The resultant luminescence was detected by autoradiography and quantified by densitometric scanning using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) equipped with the Multianalyst program. Measurement of PI 3-Kinase and PKB Activity—Cells were depleted of IL-3 by washing three times in Fischer's medium, after which they were maintained in this medium for 4 h before stimulation with recombinant IL-3 and/or addition of LY294002 for the times indicated. They were then suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). The resultant cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies for the measurement of PI 3-kinase activity or PKB-specific anti-peptide antibodies for analysis of PKB activity as described previously (18Tang X.W. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14193-14199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability in the presence and absence of IL-3 and/or inhibitors was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation and trypan blue exclusion as described previously (20Owen P.J.

Effects of IL-3 on 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Transport in IC2.9 Cells—IL-3 has been reported to stimulate glucose uptake in a number of hematopoietic cell lines (3Kan O. Baldwin S.A. Whetton A.D. J. Exp.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the cytokine on the IL-3-dependent murine mast cell line IC2.9, using uptake of the poorly metabolized analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose as a measure of glucose transport activity. Cells were first deprived of the cytokine for 3 h and then incubated further for 1 h with a range of IL-3 concentrations. The addition of IL-3 to cytokine-deprived cells caused an increase in deoxyglucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner with maximal stimulation (typically 2.5-fold) occurring between 3 to 10 ng/ml IL-3 (Fig. 1A). To investigate the time courses of the responses to IL-3 withdrawal and readdition, cells were deprived of IL-3 for 3 h and then incubated for a further 3 h either in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IL-3. Withdrawal of IL-3 from cells previously cultured in the presence of cytokine was associated with a significant decrease in glucose transport over the initial 3-h deprivation period and a further decline in transport over the following 3 h (Fig. 1B). Readdition of IL-3 after a 3-h deprivation caused a rapid (t ½ ∼ 10 min) increase in the rate of deoxyglucose transport. After a 1-h treatment, the rate of transport was restored to that measured in cells cultured in the continuous presence of IL-3 and was ∼2-fold higher than that measured in cells from which IL-3 had been withdrawn for the equivalent time. The effects of IL-3 withdrawal on glucose transport therefore precede the observed commitment to apoptosis by more than 10 h (16Evans C.A. Owen-Lynch P.J. Whetton A.D. Dive C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1735-1738PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of IL-3 on the Kinetics of 2-Deoxy-d-glucose Transport—To elucidate the mechanism of the ∼2.5-fold increase in transport induced by the readdition of IL-3 to cytokine-deprived cells, we investigated the kinetic properties of transport by measuring 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake over a range of concentrations (0.1–10 mm). Fig. 2 shows a representative kinetic plot for IC2.9 cells incubated in the presence and absence of 10 ng/ml recombinant IL-3 for 1 h, after an IL-3 deprivation period of 3 h. The inset shows a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the same data for comparison. Estimates of the kinetic parameters Km and V max derived from three independent measurements showed that readdition of IL-3 to cytokine-deprived cells was associated with a significant increase (3.7-fold; p < 0.05) in V max (Table I). In contrast, the apparent Km calculated in the same experiments was not significantly altered. Thus, the reversible decrease in 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake rates seen after IL-3 deprivation of IC2.9 cells stemmed from a decrease in the V max for the transport process.Table IKinetic analysis of 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport in IC2.9 cellsTreatmentnKmVmaxmmnmol/min/106 cellsIL-3 (10 ng/ml)72.75 ± 0.255.03 ± 0.20No IL-332.15 ± 0.221.35 ± 0.06IL-3 (10 ng/ml) and LY294002 (100 μm)42.28 ± 0.171.34 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Effects of IL-3 on GLUT1 and GLUT3 Expression Levels—A possible explanation for the stimulation of transport in cytokine-deprived cells after readdition of IL-3 was that the cytokine enhanced the cellular expression of glucose transporters. Western blotting using transporter-specific antibodies had shown that IC2.9 cells expressed both the GLUT1 and GLUT3 glucose transporter isoforms but not GLUT2, GLUT4, or GLUT5 (data not shown). The total cellular levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 were therefore measured in the cells following a 3-h period of IL-3 deprivation and subsequent incubation in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml IL-3 for periods of up to 3 h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted using isoform-specific affinity-purified antibodies raised against GLUT1 and GLUT3 (Fig. 3). The levels of each immunodetected protein, determined by densitometric scanning, did not differ significantly between cells treated in the absence or presence of IL-3. Effects of IL-3 on the Subcellular Distributions of GLUT1 and GLUT3—Although the total cellular content of glucose transporters was not affected by IL-3 treatment of cytokine-deprived cells, a second potential explanation for the observed changes in the V max for transport was a redistribution of transporters between the cell interior and the surface. Alternatively, the turnover number of cell surface transporters might have been regulated by IL-3. To distinguish between these possibilities, the effects of IL-3 withdrawal and readdition on the subcellular distribution of GLUT transporters were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Examination of cells labeled with GLUT isoform-specific antibodies revealed that after a 3-h period of IL-3 deprivation GLUT1 was predominantly located intracellularly and that there was very little cell surface staining (Fig. 4a). Much of the intracellular transporter staining was concentrated in perinuclear vesicular structures. Double immunofluorescence staining for tubulin and GLUT1 demonstrated that these intracellular transporter-containing vesicles were located in the vicinity of the microtubule organizing center (data not shown). The readdition of IL-3 to deprived cells caused a very substantial decrease in the intensity of this intracellular staining for GLUT1 in most cells and enhanced staining for this transporter at the cell surface (Fig. 4b). Similar analysis using a GLUT3-specific antibody showed that this transporter, like GLUT1, was located mainly in intracellular structures close to the nucleus during IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 4c). However, GLUT3 localization did not alter significantly upon readdition of IL-3 (Fig. 4d). Therefore, IL-3 withdrawal was associated with a significant decrease in cell surface levels of GLUT1 but not GLUT3. Confirmation that readdition of IL-3 resulted in altered distribution of GLUT1 but not of GLUT3 in cytokine-deprived cells and quantification of this redistribution were achieved by using the biotinylated photoaffinity ligand Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA. Upon exposure to UV light, this membrane-impermeant reagent becomes covalently linked to the exofacial substrate-binding site of members of the GLUT family of glucose transporters, including GLUT1 and GLUT3, only when these are present at the cell surface (17Koumanov F. Yang J. Jones A.E. Hatanaka Y. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Precipitation of biotinylated proteins followed by quantitative Western blotting for individual GLUT isoforms revealed that cell surface levels of GLUT1 present in IL-3-treated cells were 3-fold higher than those in IL-3-deprived cells (310% ± 77% compared with 100% ± 25%; mean ± S.E.; n = 3) (Fig. 5). In contrast, the cell surface labeling of GLUT3 did not alter significantly after IL-3 deprivation or readdition (data not shown). The specificity of GLUT labeling was demonstrated by the profound inhibition caused by the presence of 500 mmd-glucose (illustrated for GLUT1 in Fig. 5). The specificity of this method for detecting cell surface glucose transporters was confirmed by the negligible signal obtained for samples UV irradiated in the absence of Bio-LC-ATB-BMPA (Fig. 5). Involvement of the Actin Cytoskeleton in IL-3-induced GLUT1 Translocation—IL-3-induced trafficking of GLUT1 from an intracellular, perinuclear location to the cell surface resembled the insulin-induced translocation of the homologous glucose transporter isoform GLUT4 from the cell interior to the surface in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (22Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In these cells, efficient GLUT4 translocation requires an intact cortical actin network (23Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wang Q. Bilan P.J.

To examine the possible involvement of actin filaments in IL-3-induced translocation of GLUT1 in IC2.9 cells, we used the actin monomer-binding toxin latrunculin B to destabilize actin filaments. This agent, at concentrations of 2 μm and above, completely abolished the stimulation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake by IL-3 in cytokine-depleted cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, when used at a concentration of 2 μm, it had no significant effect on the basal rate of hexose uptake by the cells. Staining of the cells using FITC-conjugated phalloidin revealed the presence of a cortical actin layer in the IC2.9 cells which was most pronounced after treatment of the cytokine-depleted cells with IL-3 (Fig. 6D, a and c). Incubation of cells with latrunculin B at a concentration, 2 μm, which prevented stimulation of hexose uptake by IL-3, led to essentially complete loss of cortical actin staining (Fig. 6D, b and d). Similarly, treatment of cells with this concentration of latrunculin B prevented the IL-3-induced translocation of GLUT1 seen in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 6C). In adipocytes, jasplakinolide, a cell-permeable agent that promotes the formation and/or stabilization of actin filaments, also inhibits GLUT4 translocation and the stimulation of glucose transport by insulin (26Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It has therefore been concluded that dynamic cortical actin rearrangements rather than stable cortical actin structures are required for the response to this hormone.

https://openalex.org/W2035439681,"The shells of the planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma have become a classical tool for reconstructing glacial-interglacial climate conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean. Palaeoceanographers utilize its left- and right-coiling variants, which exhibit a distinctive reciprocal temperature and water mass related shift in faunal abundance both at present and in late Quaternary sediments. Recently discovered cryptic genetic diversity in planktonic foraminifers now poses significant questions for these studies. Here we report genetic evidence demonstrating that the apparent 'single species' shell-based records of right-coiling N. pachyderma used in palaeoceanographic reconstructions contain an alternation in species as environmental factors change. This is reflected in a species-dependent incremental shift in right-coiling N. pachyderma shell calcite delta18O between the Last Glacial Maximum and full Holocene conditions. Guided by the percentage dextral coiling ratio, our findings enhance the use of delta18O records of right-coiling N. pachyderma for future study. They also highlight the need to genetically investigate other important morphospecies to refine their accuracy and reliability as palaeoceanographic proxies."

The sequence obtained shows that the N terminus of this fragment begins with Ser-652 of ErbB-4. When a 12-residue peptide corresponding to ErbB-4 residues 646–657 was incubated with recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, fragments representing residues 646–651 and 652–657 were obtained. These data indicate that ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 occurs between His-651 and Ser-652, placing the cleavage site within the ectodomain stalk region approximately 8 residues prior to the transmembrane domain. Several experiments have characterized other aspects of the m80 ErbB-4 fragment. Inhibition of ErbB-4 tyrosine kinase activity with pan-ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitors indicates that kinase activity is stringently required for heregulin-dependent, but not 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced, ErbB-4 ectodomain cleavage and formation of the m80 fragment. When the m80 ErbB-4 fragment is generated by cell treatment with heregulin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the fragment associates with intact ErbB-2.

However, this fragment does not associate with the intact ErbB-4 molecule. ErbB-4 is a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, which also includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB-1), ErbB-2, and ErbB-3 (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). ErbB-4 and ErbB-3 bind the neuregulin (heregulin) family of growth factors, and ErbB-4 also recognizes certain growth factors in the epidermal growth factor family of ErbB-1 agonists, such as betacellulin, epiregulin, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor. ErbB-4 heterodimerizes with ErbB-2 as do ErbB-1 and ErbB-3; however, ErbB-4 can also signal through the formation of ErbB-4 homodimers. Within the receptor tyrosine kinase family, ErbB-4 is uniquely processed (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The first step in this pathway involves the release of the ErbB-4 ectodomain by a cleavage that produces two fragments as follows: a 120-kDa ectodomain fragment and an 80-kDa membrane-associated fragment, designated m80 (9Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The latter fragment contains the ErbB-4 transmembrane domain and the entire cytoplasmic region, including the tyrosine kinase domain. Ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 in cells occurs at a low constitutive or basal level (10Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that can be increased by TPA (9Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or by heregulin or other growth factors that bind ErbB-4 (11Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also, cleavage is potentiated by the addition to cells of pervanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that provokes ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation (12Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 is sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors (10Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and does not occur in cells genetically deficient in tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), a transmembrane metalloprotease, also known as adisintegrin and metalloprotease or ADAM17 (13Rio C. Buxbaum J.D. Peschon J.J. Corfas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10379-10387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TACE participates in this cleavage is not understood. Interestingly, a splice form of ErbB-4 known as Jm-b is present in human and mouse tissues and is resistant to ectodomain cleavage (14Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26762-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Compared with the cleavable Jm-a isoform of ErbB-4, the Jm-b isoform contains a unique sequence within the ectodomain stalk region. The ErbB-4 m80 fragment that is generated by ectodomain cleavage is further processed by two competing protease activities. The fragment can be degraded by proteosome activity following polyubiquitination (10Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More importantly, the m80 fragment is also a substrate for γ-secretase activity (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.A. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a multicomponent proteolytic activity that cleaves proteins, such as Notch and APP, within their transmembrane domains and releases the cytoplasmic domains from the plasma membrane allowing them to relocalize within the cell (6Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the case of ErbB-4, as well as Notch and APP, the cytoplasmic domain is rapidly found in the nucleus (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 15Lee H.-J. Jung K.-M. Huang Y.A. Bennett L.B. Lee J.S. Mei L. Kim T.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6318-6323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the function of the ErbB-4 cytoplasmic domain in the nucleus is not known, evidence indicates that heregulin-dependent cell death in T47D cells requires γ-secretase activity (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The capacity of ErbB-4 to be processed by γ-secretase activity requires ectodomain cleavage as a prerequisite (2Ni C.-Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G. Science. 2001; 294: 2179-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). This is analogous to the processing of Notch and APP (5Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and is likely the point at which ErbB-4 processing is regulated by TPA or heregulin.

Anti-TACE, a purified monoclonal antibody to human TACE (M220), was generously provided by Roy Black, Immunex. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—T47-14 cells were grown to confluence in 10 15-cm culture dishes and were then treated with TPA (100 ng/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in cold buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml)), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min). Polyclonal antibody (50 μg) to the ErbB-4 C-terminal domain was then added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C before the addition of Protein A-Sepharose. After 2 h the resulting precipitate was washed in cold lysis buffer three times. The precipitate was then treated with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.5% SDS for 10 min at 100 °C to elute precipitated proteins. The eluate was then diluted 10-fold into lysis buffer. The diluted eluate was used for a second immunoprecipitation that employed a 2-h incubation with a monoclonal antibody to the ErbB-4 C-terminal domain and Protein G-Sepharose followed by washing with lysis buffer. This precipitate was placed on an SDS-PAGE, and after electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and a band at 80 kDa was cut out and eluted. Edman microsequencing using an Applied Biosystems 492 sequencer was performed by the Vanderbilt Peptide Sequencing and Amino Acid Analysis Shared Resource. Analysis of Peptide Cleavage—Two synthetic 12-residue peptides were used as substrates: a pro-TNFα peptide that contains a dinitrophenyl group at the N terminus and that contains the known cleavage site present in the TNFα precursor, and an ErbB-4 peptide that is acetylated at the N terminus. Each peptide was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period of time in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, with or without the indicated concentration of recombinant human TACE catalytic domain (16Plowman G.D.

To assess cleavage of the peptide substrates by mass spectrometry, an aliquot (∼1 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix and spotted on a sample plate for mass spectrometry. This matrix was made using a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50:50 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The samples were then assayed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Elite matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer utilizing the reflectron detector. Standardization of peptide masses was performed by utilizing a peptide mixture supplied by the Vanderbilt Mass Spectrometry Facility. Analysis was performed by the Vanderbilt Peptide Sequencing and Amino Acid Analysis Shared Resource.

T47-14 cells are NIH/3T3 cells that have been transfected to express human ErbB-4 and were provided by Matthias Kraus, University of Alabama-Birmingham. Both have been described previously (9Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Zhou W.

The cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used for experiments when nearly confluent. Prior to each experiment the cells were incubated for about 24 h in DMEM plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Immediately prior to the addition of growth factors or TPA at 37 °C, the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added. Cell Lysis and Immunologic Analysis—After each experimental treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed by the addition of cold TGH lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl), supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture P8340 (Sigma) and 50 mm NaF, for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min) and the supernatant used for immunologic measurement and determination of protein concentration (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent). For subsequent immunoprecipitations ∼1 mg of lysate was incubated with the indicated antibody for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking followed by the addition of Protein A- or Protein G-Sepharose as appropriate, and the incubation was continued for3hat4 °C. The precipitates were then washed with TGH lysis buffer three times. Laemmli sample buffer (1.5×) was then added, and the samples were heated (100 °C) for 5 min. Subsequently the samples were vortexed and centrifuged (8,000 rpm, 2 min) to remove the Sepharose beads. The samples were then loaded on SDS-PAGE (7.5%). After electrophoresis the separated proteins were transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The membranes were then washed twice with TBST buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibody in TBST buffer containing 1.0% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then washed four times with TBST, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A was added for 1 h at room temperature with rocking. The samples were washed four times with TBST, and bound horseradish peroxidase was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Where indicated, blots were stripped and reprobed with a second antibody. The stripping solution contained 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS. Ectodomain Cleavage Site—To obtain N-terminal sequence information regarding the m80 ErbB-4 fragment, a large number of cultures of T47-14 cells were treated with TPA for 30 min, and the m80 fragment was immunopurified by two rounds of antibody precipitation. A single Coomassie Blue-stained 80-kDa band was then eluted and subjected to automated Edman microsequencing. The first seven cycles yielded the sequence STLPQ(R/H)A. The alignment of this sequence with the known sequence of ErbB-4 is presented in Fig. 1. The sequence obtained for the N terminus of the m80 fragment aligns correctly with the ErbB-4 Jm-a isoform sequence (16Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.D. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) beginning with Ser-652 and is within the receptor stalk region between the second cysteine-rich domain and the transmembrane domain. Also presented in Fig. 1 are sequences for the stalk regions of the Jm-b ErbB-4 isoform, ErbB-1, ErbB-2, and ErbB-3. The above data indicate that ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 probably occurs between His-651 and Ser-652. However, it is possible that cleavage occurs prior to this point in the sequence and that the isolated m80 fragment involves a subsequent loss of N-terminal residues due to secondary proteolytic activity. To test the capacity of TACE to cleave ErbB-4 within the stalk region, a 12-residue peptide (YPWTGHSTLPQH) corresponding to residues 646–657 of ErbB-4 was incubated with recombinant TACE. Cleavage of the peptide was assessed by mass spectrometry. This approach has been used before with other cell surface molecules that are subject to TACE-mediated ectodomain cleavage. Since the TACE-dependent cleavage site of pro-TNFα has been well characterized by this approach (17Moss M.L. Jin S.-L.C. Milla M.E. Burkhart W. Carter H.L. Chen W.-J. Clay W.C. Didsbury J.R.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), a 12-residue peptide (SPLAQAVRSSSR) including the known cleavage site within stalk region of pro-TNFα was used as a control. The initial experiments utilized reaction conditions that have been reported previously to support the TACE-dependent cleavage of the pro-TNFα peptide substrate. The results, shown in Fig. 2A, demonstrate that under these conditions the pro-TNFα substrate peptide was cleaved following incubation with TACE and that two major products were detected, peptides a and b. These two peptides correspond to those expected for cleavage of the substrate between Ala-76 and Val-77, the known pro-TNFα cleavage site (17Moss M.L. Jin S.-L.C. Milla M.E. Burkhart W. Carter H.L. Chen W.-J. Clay W.C. Didsbury J.R. Hassler D. Hofman C.R. Kost T.A. Lambert M.H. Leesnitzer M.A. McCauley P. McGehan G. Mitchell J. Moyer M. Pahel G. Rocque W. Overton L.K. Schoenen F. Seaton T.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Under these same reaction conditions, however, the ErbB-4 peptide was not cleaved (data not shown). In view of the above result, the reaction conditions were readjusted to include the addition of more enzyme and a prolonged incubation time to test for less efficient TACE cleavage of the ErbB-4 peptide compared with the pro-TNFα substrate. Specifically, the amount of TACE was increased from 8 to 250 nm and the incubation time from 3 to 16 h. The results are shown in Fig. 2B. In the absence of added TACE no degradation products from the ErbB-4 peptide were detected. Under these conditions the presence of TACE did induce the cleavage of the ErbB-4 substrate peptide with the appearance of three peptide products. The peptide products denoted B and A correspond, respectively, to peptides having the sequence YPWTGH and STLPQH. These are the products expected by cleavage of the substrate between His and Ser residues corresponding to residues 651 and 652 of ErbB-4. Also, the sequence of peptide A corresponds to the N-terminal sequence obtained for the isolated m80 ErbB-4 fragment. Under these conditions in vitro a third peptide, denoted C, was also produced and corresponds to the sequence YPWTGHSTLP of the ErbB-4 peptide. This most likely arises from a second cleavage site in the substrate between residues Pro and Gln and would predict the presence of a fourth product, a dipeptide Gln-His, that was not detected in the chromatogram. Most likely this represents an in vitro cleavage that does not occur in vivo. Role of Tyrosine Kinase Activity in ErbB-4 Ectodomain Cleavage—A significant question in the ligand-induced proteolytic processing of ErbB-4 is whether its growth factor-dependent tyrosine kinase activity is required. One approach would be to transfect a kinase-negative ErbB-4 mutant into recipient cells and then assay heregulin-induced cleavage. However, we have reported previously that exogenously expressed ErbB-4, in several recipient cell lines, does not exhibit heregulin-induced proteolytic processing (11Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The reasons for this are not clear but preclude a mutagenesis approach. Several highly selective tyrosine kinase chemical inhibitors have been developed to ErbB-1 and can be used at higher concentrations to inhibit all ErbB tyrosine kinase activities. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, PD153035 (19Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) was used at a concentration experimentally determined to completely prevent heregulin-dependent ErbB-4 tyrosine kinase activity. When T47D cells were treated with heregulin or TPA, formation of the m80 ErbB-4 fragment was increased. When the cells were exposed to PD153035 and heregulin or TPA, the amount of m80 fragment formed was significantly decreased, particularly in the case of heregulin stimulation. Blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine shows that heregulin provoked autophosphorylation of ErbB-4, but TPA did not. Similar results also were obtained with a different ErbB kinase inhibitor CI-1003 (20Slichenmyer W.J. Elliott W.L. Fry D.W. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 80-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data show, somewhat surprisingly, that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate TPA induction of ErbB-4 ectodomain cleavage, although TPA does not induce a detectable level of ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation. In this experiment ErbB-4 cleavage was measured in T47D cells, a breast cancer line in which TPA also induces the shedding of endogenous heregulin from its cell surface precursor. 2G. Carpenter and Q.-C. Cheng, unpublished data. It seems possible, therefore, that this TPA-dependent autocrine circuit contributes to the TPA-induced cleavage of ErbB-4. Although TPA treatment does not produce a detectable level of ErbB-4 autophosphorylation, it is possible that autocrine stimulation occurs at a low level compared with the addition of a saturating quantity of exogenous heregulin. To test the T47-14 cells, an NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line that expresses exogenous ErbB-4 was treated with TPA in the presence and absence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous heregulin. The results, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrate that in this cell line TPA-induced cleavage was not sensitive to inhibitors of ErbB tyrosine kinase activity. In a previous study, we reported that ErbB-4 is rapidly translocated to a detergent-insoluble fraction following the addition of heregulin but not TPA (11Zhou W. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34737-34743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This event correlates with the sensitivity of ErbB-4-expressing cells to ectodomain cleavage initiated by heregulin. Therefore, we tested whether tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for heregulin-dependent translocation of ErbB-4 to the detergent-insoluble fraction in T47D cells. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 5A, demonstrate that tyrosine kinase activity is required for this translocation. To pursue the correlation between ectodomain cleavage of ErbB-4 and translocation to the detergent-insoluble fraction, we have measured the level of TACE found in the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The data, presented in Fig. 5B, indicate that significantly higher levels of TACE are present in the detergent-insoluble fraction compared with the soluble fraction. Although heregulin is required for ErbB-4 translocation to the insoluble fraction, the growth factor has only a small influence on the distribution of TACE. The addition of heregulin slightly increased (43%) the level of TACE in the detergent-soluble fraction and slightly decreased (30%) the amount of TACE in the insoluble fraction. Association of m80 and ErbB-2—A characteristic of ErbB receptors is their propensity to homo- and heterodimerize following the addition of ligand. ErbB-4 can homodimerize or heterodimerize with ErbB-2 (1Carpenter G. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ErbB-4 association with itself or ErbB-2 is not known. To test whether the m80 ErbB-4 fragment associates with the full-length ErbB-4 molecule, T47D cells were treated with heregulin or TPA, and lysates were prepared. One-half of each lysate was then incubated with an ErbB-4 antibody that recognizes an ectodomain epitope not present in the m80 fragment to selectively precipitate the full-length ErbB-4 molecule. The immunoprecipitates were then tested by Western blotting for ErbB-4-reactive material using an antibody to a C-terminal epitope present in both the full-length and m80 forms of ErbB-4. The results, shown in Fig. 6 (lanes 1–3), indicate that no m80 fragment could be detected. Although the level of full-length molecule is decreased by TPA or heregulin treatment, there is still a reasonable level available to potentially form an association complex with the m80 fragment. The remaining one-half of each lysate was used as a positive control. ErbB-4 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to the ErbB-4 C terminus and then blotted with the same antibody. The results (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6) show that in this experiment the m80 fragment was, in fact, generated by heregulin or TPA. To assess the possible association of the ErbB-4 m80 fragment with ErbB-2, the experiment shown in Fig. 7 was conducted. T47D cells were treated with either heregulin (Fig. 7A) or TPA (Fig. 7B) in the presence or absence of ALLN, a protease inhibitor, which we have shown previously prevents the metabolic degradation of the m80 ErbB-4 fragment (10Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After treating the cells, lysates were prepared and precipitated with an antibody to ErbB-2. The precipitates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with antibody to the C terminus of ErbB-4. The results show that following the addition of either heregulin or TPA to induce ErbB-4 ectodomain cleavage, the m80 fragment is found associated with ErbB-2, which is not cleaved. The presence of ALLN increases both the basal and agonist-stimulated levels of the m80 fragment associated with ErbB-2. In these experiments, the data from untreated cells (lane 1 in Fig. 7, A and B) show that ErbB-2 coprecipitates with ErbB-4 and implies the presence of preformed dimers or oligomers. Others have shown that the ErbB-1 receptor can self-associate in the absence of added ligand (21Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M. J.

Beneficial effects of androgen ablation, however, are often temporary and the cancer reappears as androgen-independent tumor, suggesting the existence of additional factors responsible for progression of the disease. Attention has focused on receptor tyrosine kinases as the growth mediators of androgen-independent prostate cancer; overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors or their ligand heparin-bound epidermal growth factor, for example, promotes transition to androgen independence. Emerging data demonstrate involvement of another class of cell membrane-anchored receptors, the heterotrimeric guanine-binding (G) protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in prostate cancer. In vitro, stimulation of many endogenous GPCRs induces mitogenic signaling and growth of prostate cancer cells. The GPCRs transduce mitogenic signals via activated G proteins in the form of Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits. Here, we show that expression of a Gβγ inhibitor peptide derived from carboxy terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 obliterates serum-regulated prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and prevents prostate tumor formation in vivo. We also demonstrate that inhibition of Gβγ signaling retards growth of existing prostate tumors by inducing cell death.

Keane T. Klotz L. Urology. 2002; 60: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Often, the hormonal therapy becomes ineffective as the tumor progresses into the androgen-independent (AI) state, and to date there is no cure for AI prostate cancer (2Chodak G.W. Keane T. Klotz L. Urology. 2002; 60: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Factors involved in the transition of the prostate tumor from AD to AI are not well established and represent a major hurdle to improving disease outcome. Recent evidence demonstrates that growth of AI prostate cancer cells is regulated by the androgen receptor (AR), even in the absence of added androgens (3Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 4Isaacs W. De Marzo A. Nelson W.

Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar), suggesting the AR may be activated by factors other than androgens.Peptide growth factors, including the insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have been suggested in the development and progression of the prostate cancer to androgen independence (6George D.J. Urology. 2002; 60: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Djakiew D. Prostate. 2000; 42: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These growth factors induce mitogenic responses by activating their cognate receptors, which possess ligand-activated protein tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand binding initiates a cascade of phosphorylation reactions that culminate in the activation of multiple intracellular signaling networks collectively responsible for the growth factor-regulated cell proliferation. For example, stimulation with EGF activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (8Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar), and prostate biopsies show increased levels of activated ERK in advanced stage tumors and tumors that have recurred after androgen ablation, compared with benign specimens (9Gioeli D. Mandell J.W. Petroni G.R. Frierson Jr., H.F. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar, 10Price D.T. Rocca G.D. Guo C. Ballo M.S. Schwinn D.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Urol. 1999; 162: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting ERK may contribute to disease progression. EGF could also participate in prostate tumorigenesis by regulating AR function; overexpression of EGFR family member HER2/neu in AD prostate cancer cells activates AR and synergizes with low concentrations of androgens to further activate the AR (11Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 12Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In xenograft models, transition to AI cancer is associated with increased expression of HER2/neu (11Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), implying cooperative cross-talk between HER2/neu and AR. Together, these data suggest that receptor tyrosine kinases contribute to pathologic growth of the prostate.Evidence is also accumulating for involvement of another class of membrane-anchored proteins, the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in neoplastic transformation of the prostate (13Daaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Yowell C.W. Daaka Y. Clin. Prostate Cancer. 2002; 1: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Malignant prostate specimens express elevated levels of GPCRs, including the orphan prostate-specific G protein-coupled (15Xu L.L. Stackhouse B.G. Florence K. Zhang W. Shanmugam N. Sesterhenn I.A. Zou Z. Srikantan V. Augustus M. Roschke V. Carter K. McLeod D.G. Moul J.W. Soppett D. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6568-6572PubMed Google Scholar), bradykinin 1 (16Taub J.S. Guo R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Madden J.F. Daaka Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2037-2041PubMed Google Scholar), and endothelin 1A receptors (17Nelson J. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), compared with benign tissue. In addition, prostate cancer patients express elevated levels of GPCR ligands in the prostate gland, including follicle-stimulating hormone (18Porter A.T. Ben-Josef E. Urologic Oncology. 2001; 6: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and endothelin (17Nelson J. Bagnato A. Battistini B. Nisen P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Thus, the malignant prostate expresses increased levels of GPCRs and their ligands, suggesting the GPCR system may be activated in prostate cancer and, therefore, contribute to initiation or progression of the disease.The GPCRs relay signals mostly via heterotrimeric G proteins in the form of Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits (19Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar, 20Gutkind J.S. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In particular, the Gβγ subunits of several G proteins promote mitogenic Ras-ERK signals via activation of multiple effectors, including phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and phospholipases (21Schwindinger W.F. Robishaw J.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which participate in regulation of cell growth and survival. Involvement of the Gβγ subunits in the GPCR-regulated ERK activation was determined by the use of a specific Gβγ-binding peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2ct) (22Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The GRK2ct binds free Gβγ subunits and effectively prevents them from activating their down-stream effectors (23Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Recently, we demonstrated that stimulation of endogenous GPCRs for lysophosphatidic acid (24Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J.

Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Daaka Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) could promote the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro in an ERK-dependent manner. Further, we showed that lysophosphatidic acid-regulated activation of ERK is mediated by Gβγ (24Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the role of Gβγ in serum-mediated growth of prostate cancer cells is not known. Here, we utilized adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of GRK2ct to examine whether Gβγ subunits contribute to serum-induced proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Also, we studied involvement of Gβγ subunits in prostate tumor growth in mice. Our results demonstrate critical role for the Gβγ subunits in growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and suggest their potential utility as targets effective for the treatment of this common disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—Androgen-insensitive human prostate cancer PC3 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, as described previously (24Kue P.F.

Adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) and green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) were used as controls. Ad-GFP-GRK2ct was engineered as a bicistronic construct that encodes separate GRK2ct and GFP polypeptides. The GRK2ct peptide encompasses 194 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of GRK2 that contains pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The GRK2ct binds Gβγ via the PH domain and effectively prevents Gβγ-dependent signaling. Infected cells were washed once with culture medium and allowed to recover overnight. In the case of PC3 cells infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-GRK2ct, cells expressing the GFP were enriched by selection on a fluorescent cell sorter (FAC-Star Plus, BD Biosciences). In all cases, infected cells were always incubated in medium containing 10% serum.In Vitro Cell Growth—PC3 cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-GRK2ct, and those expressing the GFP protein were selected by FACS. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to grow in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated times. Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed with PBS, and exposed to trypan blue, which stains damaged cells only (26Barki-Harrington L. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2001; 165: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of viable cells, those that excluded the dye, was counted using hemocytometer.Tumor Growth—Xenografts were established by injection of 1 × 106 cells suspended in a mixture of 50 μl of culture medium and 50 μl of Matrigel subcutaneously into the flanks of 6–8-weeks-old BALB/c athymic male mice. Tumors were measured using calipers and tumor volume was determined using the formula π/6 × larger diameter × (smaller diameter)2. Each experiment consisted of 10 mice/group and was repeated three times with independently isolated virus. Infection of existing tumors (approximate size 250 mm3) was done by direct injection of suspended virus (5 × 109 total viral particles in 100 μl of PBS/animal) into tumor mass. Control animals were injected with empty virus or PBS. Animals were injected twice, 5 days apart. Each experiment consisted of 10 animals/group and was repeated twice.Immunoblotting—Appropriately infected PC3 monolayers were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm Na3VO4, and protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. GRK2ct expression was determined using a 1:5,000 dilution of C5/1 anti-GRK2/3 antibody (30Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Blots were developed with a 1:7,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized with enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Cell Survival Assay—Cells were immunostained with Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) antibodies and examined by FACS, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Cells that are at an early stage of apoptosis are Annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative, whereas dead cells express both proteins.Immunohistochemical Staining—Tumors were surgically dissected and photographed using a Coolpix 995 digital camera (Nikon) attached to a dissection microscope (Bio-Rad). Paraffin-embedded tumor sections (5-μm thick) were stained by the avidin-biotin complex method, as described previously (16Taub J.S. Guo R. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Madden J.F. Daaka Y. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2037-2041PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by exposure to 0.3% H2O2/methanol, and antigen retrieval was performed by incubation in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.5, at 94 °C for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating tissue sections in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min at ambient temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1:200 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-CD-31 antibody. Tumor cell death was determined by immunostaining tissue sections to detect fragmented DNA using commercially available kits (FragEL DNA Fragmentation, VWR Scientific Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were washed twice with PBS, incubated with 5 mg/ml goat anti-rabbit biotinylated antibodies in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at ambient temperature, and then incubated with avidin-biotin complex reagent for 30 min. Specific immunostaining was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Slides were dehydrated and counter stained with hematoxylin. Specific staining was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens.RESULTSIn Vitro Adenoviral GRK2ct Gene Transfer—Protein immunoblotting of lysates obtained from androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells infected with the GRK2ct adenovirus revealed the dose- and time-dependent expression of the 30 kDa GRK2ct peptide, which was not present in cells infected with empty vector (Fig. 1, A and B). Maximal expression of the GRK2ct peptide occurred 3 days post-infection (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we observed that expression of endogenous GRK2 decreased on day four post-infection (Fig. 1B), perhaps due to decreased viability of the prostate cancer cells.In Vitro Effects of GRK2ct Expression on Cell Proliferation and Survival—Inhibition of Gβγ signaling attenuates GPCR- and serum-mediated activation of ERK (24Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Iaccarino G. Smithwick L.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Urol. 2001; 165: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the effect of GRK2ct expression on growth of cells cultured in medium containing 10% serum. Cells were infected with adenovirus that encodes individual GRK2ct peptide and green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP-GRK2ct). Control cells were infected with adenovirus that encodes the GFP alone. Exposure of cells to adenovirus at a 10 multiplicity of infection resulted in nearly 100% infection efficiency as determined by fluorescence signal of cells infected with the GFP virus (data not shown), consistent with previous data obtained using vascular smooth muscle cells (28Iaccarino G. Smithwick L.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3945-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and ventricular myocytes (31Drazner M.H. Peppel K.C. Dyer S. Grant A.O. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Infected cells that express GFP (Fig. 1C) were selected using FACS and were allowed to grow in 10% serum-containing medium. Growth rate was determined by counting cells (26Barki-Harrington L. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2001; 165: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a hemocytometer. As shown in Fig. 1E, expression of the GRK2ct peptide limited the serum-induced PC3 cell proliferation, compared with wild type uninfected and Ad-GFP-infected cells. The observed decrease in growth rate of PC3 cells expressing the GRK2ct is consistent with the finding that Gβγ subunits regulate ERK activation (13Daaka Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Kue P.F. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 2162-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which control growth factor-regulated prostate cancer cell growth (26Barki-Harrington L. Daaka Y. J. Urol. 2001; 165: 2121-2125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The reduced number of viable GRK2ct-expressing prostate cells may result from inhibition of cell growth or induction of cell death, apoptosis. Cell survival was determined by immunostaining for Annexin V and 7-AAD and analyzed by FACS. Transient expression of GRK2ct for 2 days promoted the dose-dependent increase in apoptotic PC3 cells, reaching 50% at a viral titer of 50 plaque-forming units (pfu) (Fig. 2). Infection with similar concentrations of control Ad-GFP showed no effect on the PC3 cell survival. Transient expression of the GRK2ct peptide for 2 days did not modulate the number of dead cells (Fig. 2), in agreement with cell proliferation data shown in Fig. 1. However, infection for longer periods promoted the time-dependent death of cells and no viable cells were detected after 1 week of infection. Importantly, these data were collected using cells cultured in serum, which demonstrates that Gβγ subunits are critical regulators of prostate cancer cell growth and survival under physiologically relevant conditions.Fig. 2Effect of GRK2ct expression on survival of PC3 cells. Cells were infected with the indicated virus and allowed to recover for 2 days in culture medium containing 10% serum. Annexin V and 7-AAD staining was used to determine the fraction of apoptotic and nonviable cells, respectively, and staining intensity was analyzed by FACS. Results are means ± S.E. for three independent experiments. *, p < 0.01 compared with Ad-GFP-infected samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vivo Effects of Gβγ Inhibition on Prostate Tumor Growth—To further implicate the Gβγ subunits in prostate cancer cell growth, we established a xenograft model to assess effect of GRK2ct expression on PC3 tumor formation in mice. PC3 cells were infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-GFP-GRK2ct at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and cells expressing the GFP protein were sorted by FACS. Selected cells were suspended in Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic male mice. Tumors from wild type and Ad-GFP-expressing PC3 cells were detectable 6–10 days after implantation (Fig. 3A) and were highly angiogenic (Fig. 3, B and C). On the other hand, PC3 cells expressing the Gβγ inhibitor GRK2ct showed a delayed tumor formation response; tumors were not visible until thirty days after injection (Fig. 3A). Moreover, whereas most animals injected with wild type or Ad-GFP-expressing PC3 cells formed tumors (27 tumors out of 30 injected animals), only 6 out of 30 mice injected with the Ad-GFP-GRK2ct-infected PC3 cells formed tumors. These tumors were retrieved and tested for expression of the GRK2ct by immunoblotting. No tested tumor showed expression of the GRK2ct peptide, suggesting they most likely originated from cells that did not express the Gβγ inhibitor.Fig. 3GRK2ct expression prevents tumor formation in mice. PC3 cells infected with the indicated adenovirus were selected for GFP expression by FACS and injected together with Matrigel into the flanks of athymic male mice. A, tumor volume was measured using calipers and calculated using the formula: v = π/6 × (long dimension) × (short dimension)2. Shown are curves representing the average tumor size of 30 mice for each of the NI and Ad-GFP groups. Note that for the GRK2ct group only 6 mice developed tumors and values shown are their average. PC3 tumors display blood vessel formation as determined by visual inspection (B) and increased expression of angiogenic marker CD-31 (C). CD-31 expression was visualized by immunostaining paraffin-embedded tumor sections, as described. Blood vessels are stained brown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of GRK2ct Expression on Growth of Existing Prostate Tumors—To begin to assess the role of Gβγ subunits as potential effective targets to limit growth of existing prostate tumors, we established PC3 tumors in mice and tested the effect of expressing the GRK2ct peptide on the rate of tumor growth. The mice were randomly divided into two groups when tumor volume reached about 250 mm3. In the first group, animals were injected intratumorally with Ad-GRK2ct and in the second group equal number of animals were similarly injected with control adenovirus that expresses Ad-β-Gal. Both groups received two injections that were 5 days apart. Results show that tumors injected with the Ad-GRK2ct displayed a retarded growth rate, compared with tumors injected with Ad-β-Gal (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, significant differences in tumor volume between the two groups were not noticeable until about 1 week after the second treatment. Moreover, there was no actual reduction in tumor size; rather expression of the Gβγ inhibitor suppressed the further tumor growth. These data mirror the in vitro results showing that expression of the GRK2ct peptide prevented growth of the prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1E).Fig. 4Expression of GRK2ct inhibits tumor growth. PC3 tumors were established in male athymic mice and randomly selected to receive either control Ad-β-Gal or Ad-GRK2ct virus. Tumors were injected twice, 5 days apart, and tumor volume was determined using calipers, as described. *, p < 0.05 compared with control tumors. Arrows indicate date of injections. Tumors injected with Ad-GRK2ct (B) and Ad-β-Gal (C) were surgically removed and analyzed for their content of cell death by immunostaining to detect fragmented DNA. Dead cells are stained black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of the GRK2ct peptide caused tumor cytostasis (Fig. 4A), suggesting the inhibition of Gβγ signaling may promote tumor cell death. To verify this possibility, tumors were excised and their content of fragmented DNA, an index of apoptosis, determined. Tumors that were harvested from animals injected with the Ad-GRK2ct showed clear positive staining for fragmented DNA (Fig. 4B), whereas those obtained from control animals did not (Fig. 4C). The reason for the circular appearance of apoptotic centers likely reflects the limited diffusion of injected virus and inability of the adenovirus to further replicate and infect adjacent tumor cells. Thus, only initially infected cells express the GRK2ct, which induces apoptosis. We also observed that the apoptotic regions displayed reduced blood vessel density as determined by decreased expression of the angiogenic marker CD-31 (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that expression of the Gβγ inhibitor regulates prostate tumor size by promoting cell death.DISCUSSIONProstate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and it is commonly observed the cancerous gland contains multiple independent tumors (32Bostwick D.G. Urology. 1989; 34: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of distinct mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of the disease. The major finding of this study is that Gβγ subunits exert a critical role in prostate cancer cell growth and survival, and that targeted inhibition of Gβγ signaling results in significant reduction in rate of tumor growth in vivo. These observations provide an added dimension to the diversity of signals involved in prostate tumorigenesis and cellular responses controlled by Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The inhibition of Gβγ signaling was achieved by expression of a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of GRK2, which contains specific Gβγ-binding domain (22Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F.

https://openalex.org/W2050846830,"Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a zinc-dependent, membrane-associated endoproteinase of the metzincin family. The enzyme regulates extracellular matrix remodeling and is capable of cleaving a wide variety of transmembrane proteins. The enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP is regulated by endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). To date, four variants of mammalian TIMP have been identified. Whereas TIMP-2-4 are potent inhibitors against MT1-MMP, TIMP-1 displays negligible inhibitory activity against the enzyme. The rationale for such selectivity is hitherto unknown. Here we identify the surface epitopes that render TIMP-1 inactive against MT1-MMP. We show that TIMP-1 can be transformed into an active inhibitor against MT1-MMP by the mutation of a single residue, namely threonine 98 to leucine (T98L). The resultant mutant displayed inhibitory characteristics of a typical slow, tight binding inhibitor. The potency of the mutant could be further enhanced by the introduction of valine 4 to alanine (V4A) and proline 6 to valine (P6V) mutations. Indeed, the inhibitory profile of the triple mutant (V4A/P6V/T98L) is indistinguishable from those of other TIMPs. Our findings suggest that threonine 98 is critical in initiating MMP binding and complex stabilization. Our findings also provide a potential mechanistic explanation for MMP-TIMP selectivity.

MMP-14) is a member of the zinc-dependent endopeptidases of the metzincin family. The enzyme is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix components and tissue remodeling (1Galvez B.G.

Among the six membrane-type MMPs identified, MT1-MMP is the most studied not only because of its role in activating other MMPs such as pro-MMP-2 (pro-gelatinase-A) and pro-MMP-13 (4Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar, 5Knäuper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As with other members of the matrixin family, MT1-MMP is a multidomain enzyme with clear structural compartmentation. Preceding the catalytic domain is a propeptide that contains a cysteine switch that regulates the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The catalytic domain displays a tertiary fold typical of an enzyme of the metzincin family (7Bode W. Maskos K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 45-77PubMed Google Scholar). Succeeding the catalytic domain are a short hinge, a hemopexin domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytotail of 2.5 kDa. A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP was first reported by Fernandez-Catalan et al. in 1998 (8Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To date, this is the only known variant of membrane-associated MMP to be crystallized and published. The activity of MMPs is regulated by their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). There are four mammalian TIMPs, namely TIMP-1-4. TIMP inhibit MT1-MMP by forming a tight, non-covalent 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the catalytic domain of the enzyme. The binding constants (K iapp) of wild type TIMP-2-4 with MT1-MMP are in the low picomolar range (9English W.R. Puente X.S. Freije J.M. Knäuper V. Amour A. Merryweather A. Lopez-Otin C. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14046-14055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although TIMP-2-4 are superb inhibitors against MT1-MMP, TIMP-1, on the contrary, is not capable of forming a tight binding complex with MT1-MMP. The molecular masses of TIMP vary from 21 to 28 kDa. Crystallography and protein NMR studies carried out on TIMP-1 and -2 revealed that the molecules are folded into two very discrete domains (10Williamson R.A. Martorell G. Carr M.D. Murphy G.

The N-terminal domain of the TIMPs (N-TIMP) is ∼14 kDa and encompasses the first two-thirds of the molecule. The architecture of N-TIMP is typical of a β-barrel scaffold, reminiscent of the oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding (OB) motif. The C-terminal domain, on the other hand, consists mainly of β-sheets and is structurally less well defined. There are three disulfide bonds in each domain of TIMP. Mutagenesis and kinetic analysis on the full-length and N-terminal forms of TIMP-1-3 showed that the MMP-inhibitory function of TIMP resides exclusively at the N-terminal domain (13Huang W. Suzuki K.

Despite the fact that the co-crystal structure of MT1-MMP/TIMP-2 has been available for some time, hitherto there is no explanation as to why TIMP-1 is not capable of inhibiting MT1-MMP. Here we report a novel strategy adopted by our laboratory in approaching this conundrum. We succeeded in identifying the surface epitopes that render TIMP-1 inactive against MT1-MMP. By exchanging these “obstructive” epitopes with those of other TIMP, we created a N-TIMP-1 mutant that exhibited inhibitory potency indistinguishable from those of other TIMPs. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase for PCRs were obtained from New England Biolabs. The fluorometric substrate for the MT1-MMP assay (QF-24: Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2) has been described in our previous papers (16Lee M.H. Knäuper V. Becherer J.D. Murphy G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Lee M.H. Verma V. Maskos K. Nath D. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Amour A. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinetic assays were performed at 27 °C in fluorescence assay buffer (10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Brij-35, 1% Me2SO, 0.02% NaN3) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with thermostatic cuvette holders. MT1-MMP enzyme was expressed, refolded, and purified as described in our previous paper (18Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of N-TIMP-1—TIMP-1 mutants in this work were created by PCR using Vent DNA polymerase. Mutations were incorporated into full-length and N-terminal domain forms of human TIMP-1 cDNAs (in pRSET-c Escherichia coli expression vector, Invitrogen) by either forward or reverse primers, depending on the locations. All constructs have been sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutation had been introduced during the mutagenesis process. Protein Refolding and Assessment of Activity by Titration—N-TIMP-1 mutants were expressed in E. coli and refolded as described previously (19Lee M.H. Maskos K. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Murphy G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Full-length wild type and V4A/P6V/T98L mutant were refolded essentially as with N-TIMP-1 with the exception that 0.5 m arginine was included in the refolding buffer. The concentration and activity of active TIMP in each preparation were assessed and determined by titration against MMP-2 as reported in our previous paper (19Lee M.H. Maskos K. Knäuper V. Dodds P. Murphy G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2493-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) on N-TIMP-1 engineering. With the exception of T98F, all N-TIMP-1 mutants retained full inhibitory activity against MMP-2, irrespective of their loci. Refolded full-length TIMP-1 and its V4A/P6V/T98L mutant were highly active against MMP-2, their association rates with MMP-2 (k on) being over 10 -8m-1 s-1. The amount of T98F was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Inhibition Constant Measurement (K iapp )—MT1-MMP (0.15 nm) was pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of N-TIMP-1 mutants, ranging from 0 to 500 nm, depending on the potency of the inhibitors. Incubation was allowed at room temperature for 3 h before steady state (V s) measurement. Quenched fluorescent peptide QF-24 was added to a final concentration of 1 μm to initiate the assays. Measurements of enzyme activities were performed at 27 °C throughout this work. All data were fitted into competitive tight binding equations with the computer program Grafit to obtain an estimation of K iapp values with Equation 1, Vs=(V0/2Et)×(Et-It-Kiapp)+(Kiapp+It-Et)2+4EtKiapp)1/2)(Eq. 1) where V 0 is the rate in the absence of inhibitor; E t is the total enzyme concentration; and It is the total inhibitor concentration. Association Rate Constant Measurement (k on )—k on measurements were performed by adding N-TIMP mutants (3-50 nm) to MT1-MMP enzyme (0.05 nm). The rate of inhibition was followed using a continuous fluorometric assay at 27 °C until steady state was reached. The progress curve was analyzed using Equation 2, P=Vst+(V0-Vs)(1-e-kt)/k(Eq. 2) where p is the product concentration; V 0 is the initial velocity; V s = steady state velocity; and k is the apparent first order rate constant of equilibrium between enzyme and TIMP complex. k on values were calculated by linear regression of k on TIMP concentrations. Strategy for TIMP-1 Mutagenesis—Although members of the TIMP family are well conserved in both primary and tertiary conformation, the inability of TIMP-1 to inhibit MT1-MMP has been a long standing conundrum for protein engineers interested in the mechanism of TIMP-MMPs selectivity (20Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 21Nagase H. Brew K. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2002; 4: 51-61Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). First and foremost, there is no obvious contrast between the amino acid distribution of TIMP-1 and those of TIMP-2-4 that could account for its inability to inhibit MT1-MMP (Fig. 1). Hypothetical docking of MT1-MMP and TIMP-1 models in our laboratory also failed to reveal significant interfacial clashes that could satisfactorily explain the lack of ability of TIMP-1 to form tight binary complex with MT1-MMP. The most challenging aspect, in our view, is that although the structures of TIMP-1 and -2 and MT1-MMP have been delineated by protein NMR and crystallography for a considerable length of time, all the hypotheses regarding the inactivity of TIMP-1 against MT1-MMP remained hitherto speculative. Taken together, we propose that the lack of TIMP-1 activity against MT1-MMP is not due to simple incompatibility between the surface topology of the two molecules. Instead, we believe that TIMP-1 is not capable of inducing conformational changes in MT1-MMP, an isomerization process that needs to be overcome for tight enzyme-inhibitor (EI) complex formation (22Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 201-301Google Scholar). The reason for this, we hypothesize, is the presence of some “obstructive epitope(s)” that prevent TIMP-1 from initiating conformational changes with the enzyme. These obstructive epitope(s), in our view, must be rather subtle and are not readily identifiable by primary sequence alignment and structural examination. Hence, to approach this problem in a precise manner, we decided to confine our investigation to the N-terminal domain forms of TIMP (N-TIMP) and the catalytic domain form of MT1-MMP. Structural delineation of stromelysin-1·TIMP-1 and MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complexes by x-ray crystallography showed that the TIMPs inhibit MMPs by inserting an “MMP-binding ridge” into the catalytic site grooves of the enzymes (8Fernandez-Catalan C.

Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This MMP-binding ridge, by and large, is composed of the very N terminus, the AB-loop, the CD-loop and the EF-loop of the molecule (Fig. 2). In our opinion, the obstructive epitope(s) are more likely to be located at these loci rather than the OB-core of the molecule. Based on this hypotheses, we divided the MMP-binding ridge of TIMP-1 into five “divisions,” namely the “N terminus” division, the “Pro6” division, the “AB-loop” division, the “CD-loop” division, and finally the “EF-loop” division (Fig. 2). In turn, each of these divisions is sub-divided into independent entities termed “epitopes.” These epitopes could either be a single or multiple amino acids, depending on the locus. Systematically, residues constituting these epitopes were swapped with the corresponding amino acids of TIMP-2-4, and the kinetic profiles of the resultant mutants were monitored throughout the mutagenesis process. Kinetic Analysis of Wild type N-TIMP-1-4 against the Catalytic Domain of MT1-MMP—Before any mutagenesis work was carried out, we started by examining the binding affinities of wild type N-TIMP-1-4 with the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP. The binding constant (K iapp) and association rate (k on) are shown in Table I. Clearly, N-TIMP-2-4 have far superior affinities than N-TIMP-1, their K iapp values being in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 nm. In comparison, N-TIMP-1 is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher in value (K iapp 178 nm). In term of association rate, N-TIMP-2 is slightly superior to N-TIMP-3 and N-TIMP-4 (k on N-TIMP-2, 10 × 10-5m-1 s-1, and N-TIMP-3 and -4, 3-6 × 10-5m-1 s-1) (Table I). N-TIMP-1, on the other hand, is not capable of establishing tight binding complexes with MT1-MMP.Table IApparent inhibition constant (Kiapp) and association rate (kon) of MT1-MMP with wild type N-TIMP-1-4Wild typeKi app (× 10−9m)k on (× 10−5m−1s−1)N-TIMP-1178 ± 20NAN-TIMP-21.30 ± 0.1310.1 ± 3.8N-TIMP-31.38 ± 0.066.04 ± 0.70N-TIMP-40.30 ± 0.023.25 ± 0.35 Open table in a new tab N-terminal Mutants—The side chains of the second and the fourth residues of TIMP (also termed P1′ and P3′ subunits) are critically important in the determination of the selectivity profile of the inhibitor. The residues dock directly into the S1′ and S3′ catalytic pockets of MMPs. The second residue of TIMP-1 and -3 is threonine and that of TIMP-2 and -4 is serine (Fig. 1). Hence, we created only one mutant at the position of Thr2 (T2S). The fourth residue of TIMP-1 is valine. The corresponding residues in TIMP-2-4 are either serine or alanine (Fig. 1). Therefore, two mutants were created at this locus, namely V4S and V4A. The results of the mutagenesis are shown in Table II. Among the three mutants of the N terminus division (T2S, V4A, and V4S), V4A exhibited substantial improvement in binding affinity with MT1-MMP (K iapp 66 nm versus wild type N-TIMP-1 of 178 nm), closely followed by V4S (K iapp 81 nm). Nonetheless, none of the mutants was capable of potentiating tight complex formation with MT1-MMP.Table IIApparent inhibition constant (Kiapp) of MT1-MMP with the first generation N-TIMP-1 mutantsKi app (×10−9 M)N-terminal mutantsT2S220 ± 20V4A66 ± 6V4S81 ± 24Pro6 mutantsP6V78 ± 4P6S95 ± 5P6A165 ± 13AB-loop mutantsT2-AB-loop77 ± 6Long T2-AB-loop117 ± 18T3-AB-loop106 ± 7T4-AB-loop170 ± 13CD loop mutantsM66K462 ± 103M66D>500M66L237 ± 18M66I146 ± 10M66V183 ± 13M66A199 ± 20M66G254 ± 28V69L259 ± 30EF-loop mutantsT98L11.1 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab Pro6 Mutants—Pro6 is located at the junction between the N terminus and the first α-helix loop of TIMP-1 (Fig. 2). TIMP-1 is unique as it is the only TIMP to have a proline at this locus. In TIMP-2-4, the corresponding residues are valine, serine, and alanine (Fig. 1). Substitution of Pro6 by a smaller residue might arguably release the constraints and bring about more relaxed local dynamics, although none of the crystal or NMR papers on TIMP published so far have emphasized the significance of this residue. Here we mutated Pro6 to valine (P6V), serine (P6S), and alanine (P6A) to mimic TIMP-2-4, respectively. Despite the 2-fold reduction in the K iapp value (K iapp 78-95 nm) for P6V and P6S mutants, there was no manifestation of tight binding inhibition. Surprisingly, replacement of Pro6 by alanine produced no significant changes in binding affinity with MT1-MMP. AB-loop Mutants—The next set of mutants centered around the AB-loop of TIMP-1 (Figs. 1 and 2). MT1-MMP contains a cavity at the far “left” edge of its molecule, a result of the strategic alignment between its MT-loop and the side chains of Asp212, Ser189, and Phe180 (8Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1BUV) shows that this cavity functions as a receptacle for Tyr-36, a conspicuous residue at the tip of the AB-loop of TIMP-2. Although Williamson et al. (23Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knäuper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) did confirm that the Tyr-36 residue is crucial for TIMP-2 to establish tight binding complex with MT1-MMP, the findings did not explain why TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 are equally good inhibitors against MT1-MMP despite the complete lack of a tyrosine (or an amino acid of similar nature) at the tip of the AB-loop. Hence, the rationale of grafting the entire AB-loops of TIMP-2-4 onto TIMP-1 was not to find out if any of the residues on the AB-loop of TIMP-3 and -4 could interact with the MT1-loop “receptacle” of MT1-MMP. Rather, we were interested in finding out whether the TIMP-1 AB-loop “obstructs” the molecule from initiating conformational changes with MT1-MMP. Our data indicated that TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 AB-loops were slightly beneficial in enhancing the affinity of TIMP-1 mutants against MT1-MMP (K iapp of 77-106 nm) (Table II and Fig. 3). Disappointingly, none of the mutants could be considered tight binding inhibitor in MT1-MMP inhibition. CD-loop Mutants—The fourth group of mutants consisted of the CD-loop mutants. Only two residues were considered important at this site, namely Met-66 and Val-69. We know from the crystal structures of free and TIMP-1-bound forms of stromelysin-1 (Protein Data Bank codes 1QIA and 1UEA) that Met-66 was capable of inducing some degree of conformational change in stromelysin-1 (11Gomis-Rüth F. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Hence, a series of mutants were created to replace Met-66 at this site. The mutations included amino acids of different characteristics, ranging from acidic to basic as well as those hydrophobic in nature (M66K, M66D, M66L, M66I, M66V, M66A, and M66G). On the other hand, given that leucine is the only variant at the Val-69 locus (Fig. 1), only one mutant was created to replace the residue (V69L). Subsequent kinetic analysis showed that the majority of the mutations only impaired the affinity against MT1-MMP (K iapp from 146 nm to an excess of 500 nm) (Table II). EF-loop Mutants—The last mutant in the series was the Thr98 to leucine mutant (T98L) from the EF-loop division. Thr98 is situated right before the second disulfide bond (Cys3-Cys99) of TIMP-1. Interestingly, TIMP-1 is the only member of the TIMP family that has a threonine at this locus (Fig. 1). The corresponding residue in TIMP-2-4 is leucine. Indeed, replacement of threonine by leucine vastly enhanced the affinity of the resultant mutant against MT1-MMP (K iapp 11 nm) (Table II and Fig. 4). Indeed, the K iapp value is 16-fold lower than that of the wild type N-TIMP-1. The most striking effect is that the T98L mutant clearly manifested inhibitory profiles reminiscent of a slow, tight binding inhibitor (Fig. 4). Throughout the series, T98L is the first mutant exhibiting inhibitory profiles akin to those of N-TIMP-2-4. Thr98 Point Mutants—So far, we have identified Thr98 to be the key obstructive residue that renders TIMP-1 inactive against MT1-MMP. It would be interesting to find out the effects of other amino acids on MT1-MMP inhibition. With the exception of cysteine, we mutated Thr98 to all the available amino acids, and the kinetic profiles of the mutants are shown in Table III. Not surprisingly, isoleucine produced the same potentiation effect as leucine, the K iapp value of T98I mutant (12 nm) being indistinguishable from that of T98L. The next two most potent amino acids are valine and methionine (K iapp T98V and T98M ∼30 nm). Glutamine and tyrosine were slightly poorer, the affinity of the T98Q and T98Y mutants (90-120 nm) being marginally better than the wild type protein. Replacement of Thr98 by serine, on the other hand, produced no apparent effect on the activity of N-TIMP-1. The remaining amino acids severely impaired the affinity of N-TIMP-1 against MT1-MMP (Table III).Table IIIThr98 point mutants, apparent inhibition constant (Kiapp) with MT1-MMPKi app (× 10−9m)SmallT98G>1000T98A>1000NucleophilicT98S181 ± 17HydrophobicT98V30.7 ± 1.6T98I12.0 ± 0.8T98M27.1 ± 1.5T98P>1000AromaticT98F>1000T98Y119 ± 13T98W>1000AcidicT98D>1000T98E597 ± 37AmideT98N237 ± 12T98Q94 ± 6BasicT98H530 ± 40T98K>1000T98R>1000 Open table in a new tab Combination of Good Epitopes—Even though T98L was much more active than wild type N-TIMP-1, the mutant was still not as potent as N-TIMP-2, -3, or -4. Hence, in the second phase of this work, we combined four of the major positive epitopes in an attempt to study their effects on MT1-MMP inhibition. Two multiple mutants were made: 1) V4A/P6V/T98L triple mutant, and 2) V4A/P6V/TIMP-2 AB-loop/T98L quadruple mutant. The results of the combination are shown in Table IV. First of all, incorporation of V4A and P6V significantly improved the affinity of the T98L mutant. The affinity of the V4A/P6V/T98L triple mutant (K iapp 1.66 nm) was practically equal to those of N-TIMP-2 (K iapp 1.30 nm) and N-TIMP-3 (K iapp 1.38 nm). The association rate of the mutant (k on 1.48 × 10-5m-1 s-1) exceeded 10-5m-1 s-1, closely resembling N-TIMP-3 and -4 (k on 3-6 × 10-5m-1 s-1). Unexpectedly, the incorporation of the TIMP-2 AB-loop significantly impaired the affinity of V4A/P6V/T98L (K iapp of V4A/P6V/TIMP-2 AB-loop/T98L being 5.2 nm). The association rate, however, did not seem to be affected (Table IV).Table IVApparent inhibition constant (Kiapp) and association rate (kon) of MT1-MMP with N-TIMP-1 mutants of combined epitopesKi app (× 10−9m)k on (× 10−5m−1s−1)Combined mutantsV4A/P6V/T98L1.66 ± 0.121.48 ± 0.35V4A/P6V/T2-AB-loop/T98L5.22 ± 0.201.45 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab Effects of the C-terminal Domain on V4A/P6V/T98L Activity—So far, we have succeeded in identifying the obstructive epitopes on the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 that hinder the inhibitor from establishing a tight binding complex with MT1-MMP. What are the effects of the C-terminal domain on MT1-MMP association? To address this issue, we introduced V4A/ P6V/T98L mutations into full-length TIMP-1, and the results are summarized in Table V. At first sight, it appeared that the C-terminal domain might improve the affinity of TIMP-1 against MT1-MMP, because full-length wild type TIMP-1 displayed significantly better affinity than its N-terminal counterpart (K iapp, full-length wild type TIMP-1 91 nm versus N-TIMP-1 of 178 nm). Subsequent comparison of the V4A/P6V/T98L mutant, however, revealed that the C-terminal domain has no beneficial effects on MT1-MMP inhibition (K iapp full-length V4A/P6V/T98L 1.86 nm). Furthermore, the association rate of the full-length mutant (0.9 × 10-5m-1 s-1) was slightly lower than the N-terminal version (Table V and Fig. 5).Table VFull-length wild-type TIMP-1 and V4A/P6V/T98L mutant, apparent inhibition constant (Kiapp) and association rate (kon) against MT1-MMPKi app (× 10−9m)k on (× 10−5m−1s−1)Wild-type TIMP-190.6 ± 5.4NAFull-length V4A/P6V/T98L1.86 ± 0.170.89 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab Not only are TIMP the endogenous inhibitors of MMPs, they also modulate the enzymatic activities of the ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase) and ADAM-TS (ADAM with thrombospondin-like repeats) proteinases (reviewed in Ref. 20Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Membrane-type MMPs, in general, are poorly inhibited by TIMP-1. What is the physiological significance of such inactivity and can protein engineers ever fully understand the ultimate molecular mechanism of TIMP-metalloproteinases selectivity? Contradicting previous perceptions, our study shows that Thr98 is the pivotal obstructive epitope that renders TIMP-1 inactive against MT1-MMP. Thr98 is TIMP-1-specific, and other TIMPs have leucine at the equivalent position. How does leucine potentiate the binding of TIMP-1 to MT1-MMP? Re-examination of the available TIMP/MMP structures failed to provide a satisfactory answer to the question. In the stromelysin-1 (MMP-3)-TIMP-1 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1UEA), Thr98 is situated right before His211 (HEXX- HXXGXX H 211) of the enzyme, the last of the three conserved histidines that forms the catalytic zinc-binding ligands. Distance-wise, the two MMP-3 residues closest to Thr98 are His211 and Pro221, the amino acids being ∼4 Å from the side chain of Thr98 (Fig. 6). This aside, Thr98 does not seem to be in close contact with any particular hydrophobic residue on the surface of stromelysin-1. The TIMP-2 equivalent of Thr98 is Leu100 (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of the MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1BUV) again shows that Leu100 is located before the third conserved histidine (His249) of the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXX H 249) (Fig. 6). The two MT1-MMP residues closest to Leu100 are His249 and Pro259, almost a spitting image of the setting found in TIMP-1·MMP-3 mentioned above (Fig. 6). Hence, could this “His249/Pro259 pair” in MT1-MMP be a deciding factor in its rejection of TIMP-1? As part of our modeling simulation, we replaced the TIMP-2 molecule in MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 (Protein Data Bank code 1BUV) complex with TIMP-1 bearing a Thr98 to leucine mutation. Our study suggests that substitution of Thr98 by leucine does not enhance the interfacial contact between TIMP-1 and MT1-MMP enzyme (not shown). Thr98 is not the only residue we considered that is unique to TIMP-1. As mentioned earlier, Pro6 was also featured prominently on our list of mutagenesis study. Substitution of the residue by valine or serine improved the binding affinities against MT1-MMP significantly. Yet again, examination of the stromelysin-1/TIMP-1 structure suggests that the residue is not directly involved in MMP association. Why should leucine and isoleucine be the best residues? Table III demonstrates that the activity of N-TIMP-1 is critically dependent on the biophysical characteristics of the amino acids occupying the Thr98 position. The best amino acids are those similar in nature to leucine, namely isoleucine, valine, and methionine. Too bulky and hydrophobic (tryptophan and phenylalanine) or minute (glycine and alanine) a side chain resulted in complete abrogation of activity. Strangely, even though phenylalanine is poorly tolerated, tyrosine is beneficial, notwithstanding its similar size with phenylalanine. In general, acidic (aspartate and glutamate) or basic residues (lysine and arginine) are poorly tolerated. Throughout this work, we were intrigued by the fact that some of the individual positive epitopes identified are not always mutually complementary as hoped. Incorporation of V4A and P6V mutations into T98L, for example, enhanced the affinity of N-TIMP-1 against MT1-MMP to a level essentially equal to those of N-TIMP-2-4. The effect is additive. The same could not be said for the TIMP-2 AB-loop; the epitope is clearly incompatible with T98L mutation. The problem is again highlighted by our findings on the full-length forms of the V4A/P6V/T98L mutant. In comparison with wild type N-TIMP-1, full-length TIMP-1 is marginally superior in MT1-MMP binding. Subsequent study on the V4A/P6V/T98L mutant, however, suggests that the C-terminal domain was either inert or slightly detrimental to the affinity and association rate against MT1-MMP. Taken together, it is highly unlikely that the findings in this work could be explained satisfactorily by steric reasons alone. The true answer, we believe, lies in the molecular dynamics of TIMP-1 and MT1-MMP that governs the course of their interaction. Crystallographic studies of MMP·TIMP complexes only portray static representations of the enzymes and their inhibitors. Undeniably, the parts of TIMP with the closest intimacy with MMPs are the N terminus, the AB-loop, and the CD-loop. Here, we show that the key to TIMP/MMPs selectivity might in fact, lie elsewhere. What is most striking is that the pivotal amino acid, Thr98, is a rather “insignificant” residue that has never been emphasized in any of the literature on TIMP analysis and engineering so far (21Nagase H.

As mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” with the exception of T98F, all Thr98 mutants were highly active against MMP-2 regardless of the nature of the amino acids occupying the position. What about other MMPs, ADAM and ADAM-TS proteinases? We are currently evaluating the activity profiles of our TIMP mutants with these proteinases, and the findings will be presented in the near future. This paper is the first in which a variant of inactive TIMP has been successfully transformed into a fully active one against a specific MMP backdrop.

Recently, we have also discovered a novel oxidase that acts on 1-dephosphorylated lipid A species to generate the unique 2-aminogluconate moiety found in the proximal unit of R. leguminosarum lipid A (43Que-Gewirth N.L.S.

We now report the expression cloning of the R. leguminosarum gene that encodes the lipid A 1-phosphatase (see Fig. 1). A hybrid cosmid capable of directing the overexpression of 1-phosphatase activity was identified by assaying cell lysates of individual clones of a R. leguminosarum 3841 genomic DNA library (45Ronson C.W.

The 1-phosphatase, which can be detected with either E. coli Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA or its precursor [4′-32P]lipid IVA as substrates (see Fig. 1) (39Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Sequencing of a 7-kb DNA insert derived from the hybrid cosmid permitted the identification of the structural gene (designated lpxE from the German eins) encoding the 1-phosphatase (see Fig. 1). The R. leguminosarum lpxE gene, which encodes a protein of 244 amino acid residues, can be overexpressed in E. coli behind the T7lac promoter, and the enzyme is catalytically active. The expression of lpxE in Sinorhizobium meliloti confers resistance to polymyxin. The availability of the lpxE gene should facilitate the re-engineering of lipid A structures in Gram-negative bacteria and enhance our understanding of the biological functions of 1-dephosphorylated lipid A species.

https://openalex.org/W2012574008,"The binary Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin consists of two individual proteins, the transport component C2II (80 kDa) and the enzyme component C2I, which ADP-ribosylates G-actin in the cytosol of cells. Trypsin-activated C2II (C2IIa) forms heptamers that bind to the cell receptor and mediate translocation of C2I from acidic endosomes into the cytosol of target cells. Here, we report that translocation of C2I across cell membranes is accompanied by pore formation of C2IIa. We used a radioactive rubidium release assay to detect C2IIa pores in the membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Pore formation by C2IIa was dependent on the cellular C2 toxin receptor and an acidic pulse. Pores were formed when C2IIa was bound to cells at neutral pH and when cells were subsequently shifted to acidic medium (pH < 5.5), but no pores were detected when C2IIa was added to cells directly in acidic medium. Most likely, acidification induces a change from “pre-pore” to “pore” conformation of C2IIa, and formation of the pore conformation before membrane binding precludes insertion into membranes. When C2I was present during binding of C2IIa to cells prior to the acidification step, C2IIa-mediated rubidium release was decreased, suggesting that C2I interacted with the lumen of the C2IIa pore. A decrease of rubidium efflux was also detected when C2I was added to C2IIa-treated cells after the acidification step, suggesting that C2I interacted with C2IIa in its pore conformation. Moreover, C2I also interacted with C2IIa channels in artificial lipid membranes and blocked them partially. C2I was only translocated across the cell membrane when C2IIa plus C2I were bound to cells at neutral pH and subsequently shifted to acidic pH. When cell-bound C2IIa was exposed to acidic pH prior to C2I addition, only residual intoxication of cells was observed at high toxin concentrations, and binding of C2I to C2IIa was slightly decreased. Overall, C2IIa pores were essential but not sufficient for translocation of C2I. Intoxication of target cells with C2 toxin requires a strictly coordinated pH-dependent sequence of binding, pore formation by C2IIa, and translocation of C2I.

Bacterial protein toxins, which target substrates in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells, have developed sophisticated delivery mechanisms to transport their active components across lipid membranes into the cytosol. Bacterial AB-type exotoxins consist of a binding (B-) domain, which binds to a specific receptor on target cells and mediates translocation of the enzymatic (A-) domain into the cytosol (1Olsnes S. Wesche J. Falnes P.O. Aktories K. Just I. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Binary toxins are special type AB toxins, which have individually separated enzyme and binding components that have to assemble on the surface of target cells to act cytotoxic (for review, see Ref. 2Barth H.

C2 toxin consists of the enzyme component C2I (16Ohishi I. Morikawa Y. Baba T. J. Biochem.

Immun. 1980; 30: 668-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like PA, C2II has to be activated by proteolytic cleavage (18Ohishi I. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting C2IIa forms ring-shaped heptamers (∼420 kDa), which have an outer diameter of ∼15 nm and an inner diameter of ∼1–2 nm (15Barth H.

C2I assembles with C2IIa, and the complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (20Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 251: 1223-1228PubMed Google Scholar). C2I translocates from early acidic endosomes into the cytosol, a process that can be blocked by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vesicular H+-ATPase (15Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). C2I is directly transported across the cell membrane via C2IIa when endosomal conditions are mimicked by extracellular acidification (15Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the role of the C2IIa heptamer in the translocation of C2I across membranes is still not clear. Because C2IIa forms channels in artificial lipid bilayer membranes (21Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed the question of whether C2IIa also forms pores in membranes of intact cells and whether these pores are involved in translocation of the enzyme component C2I into the cytosol of target cells. We found a pH-dependent pore formation by C2IIa in cell membranes and showed that C2I interacted with C2IIa pores in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, translocation of C2I into the cytosol was only observed under conditions that induced pore formation of C2IIa in cell membranes and when both C2I and C2IIa were already bound to cells at the time of acidification. Materials—The glutathione S-transferase gene fusion system and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Biosciences. Cell culture medium was purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), and fetal calf serum was obtained from PAN Systems (Aidenbach, Germany). Thrombin was obtained from Sigma. Trypsin and trypsin inhibitor were from Roche Diagnostics. Bafilomycin was from Calbiochem. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) contained 0.185 g/liter CaCl2, 0.089 g/liter MgSO4, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.06 g/liter KH2PO4, 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.048 g/liter Na2HPO4, and 1 g/liter glucose to which 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) was added. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 8 g/liter NaCl, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 1.15 g/liter Na2HPO4·2H2O, and 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4 (pH 7.4). Pierce IODO-BEADS were purchased from VWR International, GmbH (Bruchsal, Germany), and Na125I-solution was from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial sources. Rubidium-86 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Expression, Purification, and Labeling of Proteins with Alexa488 and Na125I—Recombinant C2 proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 cells and purified as described previously (15Barth H.

C2II was activated with 0.2 μg of trypsin per microgram of protein for 30 min at 37 °C. Because C2I wild type does not provide a linkage site for Alexa488, C2I-S16C was used for labeling. C2I-S16C and C2II were incubated with Alexa488 at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Excess of free Alexa488 was removed by washing with PBS in a Microcon 10 concentrator. Labeled proteins were stored at 4 °C (protected from light) and used within 2 weeks. Biological activity of labeled proteins was analyzed as described previously (23Barth H. Roebling R. Fritz M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5074-5081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Iodination of C2I was performed using IODO-BEADS according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) protocol using 100 μCi of Na125I per 100 μg of C2I. In vivo activity of 125I-C2I was checked by incubation of cells with 125I-C2I together with C2IIa. Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assays—All cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and were routinely trypsinized and reseeded three times a week. CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Hams' F12 (1:1), containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Vero cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as described above. For cytotoxicity assays, cells were grown as subconfluent monolayers and treated with different concentrations of C2 proteins and the respective drug in serum-free medium. Binding Experiments with Fluorescence-activated Cytometry—Cells were detached from culture dishes with 50 mm EDTA in HBSS lacking Ca2+/Mg2+ and washed with ice-cold HBSS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). One million cells per tube were pelleted by centrifugation (600 × g) and resuspended in 50 μl of HBSS or medium. Various concentrations of C2I and/or C2IIa were added to cells and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. For extracellular acidification experiments, cells were incubated with medium at pH 7.5 and 4.8, respectively, for 5 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBSS-BSA and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Binding Experiments with Radiolabeled C2I—Vero cells (12-well plate) were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 500 ng/ml C2IIa at 4 °C for 2 h to allow binding of C2IIa on the cell surface. Cells were washed two times with 1 ml of cold PBS per well. A pH shift was performed. Serum-free DMEM at pH 4.5 and 7.5 (3 ml/well), respectively, was added, and cells were kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min. Cells were washed once with cold PBS and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with serum-free DMEM, pH 7.5, containing 400 ng/ml 125I-C2I for the binding of 125I-C2I to C2IIa. After two washing steps with cold PBS, cells were collected in 40 μl of boiling Laemmli sample buffer. 15 μl of cell lysate were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and 125I-C2I was detected with a PhosphorImager from Amersham Biosciences. 86Rb + Efflux Measurements— 86Rb+ efflux experiments were performed as described previously (24Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated in 24-well culture plates. 6 h after plating, fresh medium containing 1 μCi/ml of 86Rb+ was added, and cells were incubated for a further 18 h. C2II proteins were added in a serum-free medium, and cells were incubated on ice for 1 h to allow toxin binding. Subsequently, the cells were washed two times with cold medium to remove unbound toxin. To initiate membrane insertion of the toxin, cells were treated with serum-free medium (pH 4.5–7.5) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were further incubated at 4 °C, and after 60 min the medium was removed and 86Rb+ release was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Black Lipid Bilayer Experiments—Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed as described previously (25Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The instrumentation consisted of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments connected by a small circular hole with a surface area of ∼0.5 mm2. Membranes were formed across the hole by painting onto a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster AL) in n-decane. The single channel recordings were performed using silver/silver chloride electrodes (with salt bridges) connected in a series to a voltage source and a current amplifier. The amplified signal was monitored on a storage oscilloscope (Tektronix 7633) and recorded on a strip chart or tape recorder. The temperature was maintained at 20 °C during all experiments. Titration measurements were performed with membranes containing 100–500 C2IIa channels as described earlier (21Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titration Experiments—The C2IIa channels were reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes by the addition of small amounts of concentrated stock solution (50 ng/μl) to the cis-side of the Teflon chamber. The applied voltage was 20 mV at the cis-side. The measurements were performed in 150 mm unbuffered NaCl solution. ∼30 min after the start of the reconstitution experiments, the rate of C2IIa channel insertion in the membranes became very small. Then a concentrated solution of C2I was added either to the cis- or the trans-side of the membrane while stirring to obtain a uniform toxin distribution within the aqueous compartments. Activated C2IIa Forms Pores in Membranes of Intact Cells—We wanted to test whether C2IIa forms pores in cell membranes of CHO cells. Therefore, we used a radioactive assay to detect the release of 86Rb+ from preloaded cells (24Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of CHO cells with trypsin-activated C2IIa resulted in pore formation in cell membranes under acidic conditions. For these experiments, C2IIa was bound to CHO monolayer cells at 4 °C and, after a pulse with acidic medium (37 °C), the released 86Rb+ was determined in the medium by scintillation counting. The morphology of CHO cells was not altered under these conditions. An acidic pulse (pH ≤ 5.5) was necessary to induce C2IIa pore formation (Fig. 1). Non-activated C2II did not form pores in membranes of intact cells under the same conditions (data not shown). Pore formation was dependent on the interaction of C2IIa with its receptor. CHO wild type cells and C2 toxin receptor-deficient mutant CHO-RK14 cells (26Fritz G. Schroeder P. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2334-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were tested for C2IIa-mediated rubidium release. Pore formation was only observed in CHO wild type cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that binding of C2IIa to its receptor was an essential prerequisite for pore formation and that pores did not result from nonspecific insertion of C2IIa into membranes. We characterized the conditions leading to pore formation by C2IIa in CHO wild type cells in more detail. It was essential that C2IIa was bound to cells at neutral pH prior to acidification. When cells were incubated with C2IIa in medium at pH 5.2, no pore formation was observed (Fig. 2). We found that insertion and pore formation of C2IIa in cell membranes was not reversible. When C2IIa was bound to cells at 4 °C and pH 7.5, and, thereafter, cells were shifted for 5 min at 37 °C to pH 5.2 and then back to fresh medium with pH 7.5 at 4 °C, 86Rb+ was still released from these cells (Fig. 2). Taken together, pore formation in cell membranes by C2IIa did result from a well defined sequence of events. First, C2IIa heptamers had to be bound to cell receptors at neutral pH, and then an acidic shift led to a conformational change of C2IIa and to insertion into membranes and pore formation. Most likely, C2IIa heptamers underwent a non-reversible conformational change after acidification and insertion into the membrane as pores. Interaction of C2I with the C2IIa Pore in Vivo and in Vitro— Next, we studied the role of C2IIa pores for translocation of the enzyme component C2I. If the C2IIa pore is directly involved in translocation of C2I across cell membranes, C2I should interact with the lumen of the C2IIa pore and decrease efflux of rubidium from cells. To test this, CHO cells were incubated with C2IIa together with C2I at 4 °C to allow binding and, subsequently, cells were shifted for 5 min to acidic medium (pH 5.2) at 37 °C to initiate pore formation. During this acidification step, C2I was present in the medium. Cells were further incubated on ice at pH 5.2, and, after 10 min the medium was analyzed for 86Rb+. After a 10 min incubation period, pore formation by C2IIa was observed (Fig. 3; C2IIa, 10 min). The presence of C2I decreased the efflux of 86Rb+ from cells (Fig. 3; C2IIa + C2I, 10 min). Fresh medium (4 °C, pH 5.2) was added, and cells were incubated for further 20 min at 4 °C. The efflux of rubidium from cells, which have been treated with C2IIa together with C2I, was completely blocked to control level (Fig. 3; C2IIa + C2I, 30 min). In the same experiment, we analyzed the influence of C2I on C2IIa pores when C2I was added to C2IIa-treated cells after the acidification step. Therefore, cells were treated as described above, and, immediately after the acidification step (pH 5.2, 37 °C), C2I was added to C2IIa-treated cells, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C at pH 5.2 for a further 10 min. The release of rubidium from cells after 10 min was decreased compared with C2IIa (Fig. 3; C2IIa → C2I, 10 min), but not as much as when C2I was present during cell binding and acidification (Fig. 3; C2IIa + C2I, 10 min). Fresh medium (pH 5.2) was added and analyzed for rubidium efflux from cells after another 20 min of incubation at 4 °C. The efflux of rubidium from cells was more decreased than after 10 min (Fig. 3; C2IIa → C2I, 30 min), but impairment was not as complete as that detected for C2IIa + C2I (i.e. when C2I together with C2II was allowed to bind to cells). Our results clearly demonstrate that C2I is able to interact with cell-bound C2IIa under acidic conditions and reduce its channel activity. Based on this result, we tested the interaction of C2I with C2IIa channels in artificial black lipid bilayer membranes. Titration Experiments of C2IIa-mediated Multichannel Conductance with C2I—The addition of C2IIa to one or both sides of a diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine/n-decane membrane resulted in a strong conductance increase of the lipid bilayer membranes within ∼20–30 min (21Schmid A. Benz R. Just I. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16706-16711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gibert M. Popoff M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When C2I (60 ng/ml) was added after this time (when no more channels were inserted into the membrane to the trans-side of the membrane, i.e. the side opposite to the addition of C2IIa) no influence on the C2IIa-mediated membrane conductance was observed (left-hand side arrow of Fig. 4). This feature did not change when C2I was added at a higher concentration (240 ng/ml) or when the membrane conductance was followed over a longer period of time (up to 20 min). However, a strong effect on membrane conductance was observed when C2I was added at the same concentration (60 ng/ml) to the cis-side (right-hand side arrow in Fig. 4). Immediately after the addition of C2I, the membrane conductance started to decrease and was diminished to ∼30–40% of its initial value. Simultaneously, the current noise showed a dramatic increase, indicating rapid flickering of the C2IIa channels. Further addition of C2I did not result in a further decrease of the current. This effect may be explained by a binding of C2I to the C2IIa heptamers, thus partially blocking the translocation of ions through the channel. Obviously, binding is only possible to the cis-side of the C2IIa heptamers but not to the trans side. This result represents a further argument for the oriented insertion of the C2IIa heptamers into lipid bilayers (27Bachmeyer C. Benz R. Barth H. Aktories K. Gibert M. Popoff M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the C2IIa channels are not completely closed under these conditions, because they still conduct ions when C2I is bound. Single-channel Studies—The results described above suggest a blockage of the C2IIa channel by C2I. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we performed single-channel studies under similar conditions. For these experiments we mixed concentrated solutions of C2IIa (50–100 ng/μl) and C2I (100 ng/μl) in a ratio of 1:4 and incubated them for 12–24 h at 4 °C. When lipid bilayer membranes were in the black state, small aliquots (2–5 μl) of C2IIa pre-incubated with C2I were added to the 5-ml 1 m KCl solution at the cis-side of the membranes. Single channels occurred after some time. Fig. 5 shows a typical experiment observed under these conditions. The left-hand side arrow (Fig. 5) indicates the reconstitution of a C2IIa heptamer into the black lipid bilayer. After ∼1 min the channel became blocked by its interaction with C2I (middle arrow; Fig. 5). After about another 1.5 min a second channel occurred, which was already blocked by a C2I molecule (right-hand side arrow; Fig. 5). Fig. 5 clearly indicates that the block of the C2IIa channel by C2I was not a permanent one. Instead, the channels showed partial closure and exhibited considerable current noise. On average, the single C2IIa showed closure by ∼60%. Taken together, the results of the multi-channel titration experiments (Fig. 4) showed perfect agreement with the single-channel data. Both are consistent with partial closure of the C2IIa channel by C2I and confirm the finding of the in vivo experiments that C2I decreases C2IIa-mediated rubidium efflux from cells. pH-dependent C2I Translocation into the Cytosol—C2 toxin enters the cytosol of target cells in a pH-dependent manner from an endosomal compartment (15Barth H.

However, the precise mechanism of membrane translocation of C2I has not yet been described. Several models are currently discussed; either the channel, which is formed under acidic conditions, is capable of transporting several enzyme components into the cytosol, or the process of membrane insertion and subsequent channel formation is the driving force for membrane translocation of C2I. To elucidate the role of the acidic pH-dependent pore formation in C2I transport into the cytosol, we performed experiments in which endosomal conditions were mimicked by extracellular acidification (15Barth H. Blöcker D. Behlke J. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18704-18711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To block toxin uptake by its normal route via an endosomal compartment, we pretreated Vero cells with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vesicular type H+-ATPase. The cells were pre-chilled and incubated with C2IIa or C2IIa plus C2I, respectively, for 20 min at 4 °C to allow toxin binding. Thereafter, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with prewarmed medium at pH 7.5 or 4.8, respectively. The cells were washed, fresh medium at pH 7.5 (with or without C2I) was added, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, cells only exhibited C2 toxin morphology when both C2IIa and C2I were present at the time point of low pH medium addition. In the absence of C2IIa, C2I did not induce cell round up under these conditions, i.e. C2IIa was absolutely essential for pH-induced delivery of C2I into cells across cell membranes. Cells to which C2I was added after the acidification step did not round up. However, although our rubidium efflux experiments indicate that the C2IIa pore is not closed at neutral pH, a pH gradient across the cell membrane might be a necessary prerequisite for C2I translocation into the cytosol. Therefore, we performed a second set of experiments in which we incubated the cells with acidic medium for 5 min as usual and then added C2I directly into the low pH medium and incubated the cells for a further 5 min. The cells were washed and incubated in pH 7.5 medium for 2 h. Again, cells did not round up when C2I was added after C2IIa had been exposed to the acidic pH medium (Fig. 6B). Cell round up was detected only when the cells were incubated with extremely high concentrations of C2IIa. As s"

Recent studies in Arabidopsis showed that the cytosolic form of the precursor binding protein Toc159 is targeted to its receptor at the import machinery, Toc33, via heterodimerization of their GTP-binding domains. Toc33 may also form GDP-bound homodimers, as suggested by the crystal structure of its pea ortholog. Moreover, the structural data suggested that arginine 130 (Arg130) of Arabidopsis Toc33 may function as a GTPase-activating “arginine-finger” at the other monomer in the Toc33 dimer. Here, we demonstrate that Arg130 of Toc33 does not function as an Arginine-finger. A mutant, Toc33-R130A, binds and hydrolyzes GTP like the wild type. However, we demonstrate that Arg130 is involved in both homodimerization of Toc33 and in heterodimerization with the GTP-binding domain of Toc159. The dependence of Toc33 homodimerization on Arg130 is mutual, requiring the presence of Arg130 at both monomers. As the GTPase is not activated by dimerization, it may be activated independently at either monomer, possibly even before dimerization. Independent regulation of GTPase activity may serve to coordinate the interactions of the GTPases during the import of proteins into the chloroplast.

As the GTPase is not activated by dimerization, it may be activated independently at either monomer, possibly even before dimerization. Independent regulation of GTPase activity may serve to coordinate the interactions of the GTPases during the import of proteins into the chloroplast. Chloroplast biogenesis requires the import of ∼2,000 nuclear-encoded proteins from the cytosol (1Cline K. Nature. 2000; 403: 148-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are synthesized as cytosolic precursors with cleavable N-terminal transit sequences specifying targeting to the chloroplast. Translocation of precursors across the chloroplast envelope membranes requires the activity of translocon complexes located at the outer (Toc 1The abbreviations used are: Toc, translocon at the outer chloroplast membrane; Tic, translocon at the inner chloroplast membrane; wt, wild type; PEI, polyethyleneimine; Ni-NTA, Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid; G-domain, GTP-binding domain. complex) and inner membrane of the chloroplast (Tic complex) (2Jarvis P.

The Arabidopsis Toc complex consists of at least Toc159, Toc33, and Toc75 (5Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.-A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, the Arabidopsis Toc complex may also contain the homolog of Toc33 (Toc34) as well as those of Toc159 (Toc120, -132, and -90) (6Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jackson-Constan D. Keegstra K. Plant Phys. 2001; 125: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Toc159 and Toc33 are GTPases sharing similarity in their GTP-binding domains (G-domains) (8Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The GTP-binding domains of both proteins are exposed to the cytosol consistent with their known functions as precursor binding proteins. Toc75 is deeply embedded in the outer membrane of the chloroplast (9Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and shares homology with channel proteins in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (10Bölter B. Soll J. Schulz A. Hinnah S. Wagner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15831-15836Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Reumann S. Davila-Aponte J. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, Toc75 has channel properties upon reconstitution into lipid bilayers, consistent with a function as part of a protein-conducting channel (12Hinnah S.C. Hill K. Wagner R. Schlicher T. Soll J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7351-7360Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A large body of experimental evidence supports the role of Toc-GTP-binding proteins in chloroplast protein import, but their precise mode of action remains largely unknown. Recent results have contributed to a more detailed understanding of the Toc-GTPase system: Both Toc33 and Toc159 interact directly with precursors (13Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on sequential chemical cross-linking to transit sequences (13Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and antibody inhibition of precursor binding to isolated chloroplasts (15Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), precursor recognition by Toc159 is likely to precede binding to Toc33 (16Sveshnikova N. Soll J. Schleiff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is therefore assumed that Toc159 functions as a primary import receptor. Moreover, Toc159 exists in an abundant soluble form (5Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.-A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), supporting an early role of Toc159 as a cytosolic precursor receptor. Targeting studies of cytosolic Toc159 to the outer chloroplast membrane indicate that Toc33 functions as part of a docking site for Toc159 (17Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.-A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In vivo analysis indicates that targeting requires the GTP-binding site of Toc159 to bind and hydrolyze GTP as a mutant of Toc159, unable to bind and hydrolyze GTP, remains trapped in the cytosol (17Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.-A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A recent reconstitution study suggests that Toc159 may utilize a sewing machine mechanism to “stitch” precursor proteins across the outer membrane (19Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism is analogous to that of SecA, which reversibly inserts into the bacterial membrane during the transport process (20Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). GTP-dependent targeting of Toc159 to the outer chloroplast membrane constitutes an essential switch in chloroplast biogenesis (17Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.-A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of guanosine nucleotide requirements, demonstrated that docking of Toc159 at Toc33 and insertion of Toc159 into the outer membrane are stimulated by GDP and thus are likely to depend on the conversion of GTP into GDP in situ (18Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A possible role of GDP in dimerization is supported by the recently solved crystal structure of psToc34, the pea ortholog of Toc33, which forms GDP-bound homodimers (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Dimer formation involves a dimerization motif, D1, conserved in the G-domains of Toc33 and Toc159. Two critical arginine residues in psToc34, Arg128 (corresponding to Arg125 of Arabidopsis Toc33) and Arg133 (corresponding to Arg130 of Arabidopsis Toc33), have been implied in self-dimerization of psToc34. R128A makes a number of interactions with amino acid residues of the other monomer. The mutant R128A had reduced GTPase activity and failed to dimerize. Arg133, on the other hand, makes contact with the GDP molecule as well as several amino acids at the other monomer. Its positioning resembles that of the arginine-finger of GTPase-activating proteins, leading to the suggestion that Arg133 may function as such (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The structural data suggested that dimerization may activate the GTPase resulting in GDP-bound dimers (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). But a corresponding mutant has not been characterized so far. In this study, we used the Arabidopsis ortholog of psToc34, Toc33, to address the interdependency of GTPase activity and dimerization. We analyzed the mutant Toc33-R130A (Arg133 in psToc34) and compared it to the wild type, Toc33-wt. The data indicate that Arg130 is not required for GTPase activity and therefore does not function as an arginine finger. Instead, Arg130 appears to be necessary for dimerization. The data also address heterodimerization of Toc33 with Toc159, demonstrating that Arg130 is required for heterodimerization of Toc33 with Toc159. DNA Constructs used for Bacterial Overexpression and in Vitro Transcription/Translation—The cloning of pET21d-Toc331–265H6 (Toc33-wt) has previously been described (5Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.-A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This construct was used to mutate Arg130 via site directed mutagenesis. Toc331–265H6R130A (Toc33-R130A) was amplified in two pieces from pET21d-Toc331–265H6 using PCR with the following primer pairs: forward primer 5′-GAA ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCC AAG CTT GAG CTC ATC GAC TGC ATA CAC ATC CAA ACG ATC A-3′, including a SacI site and forward primer 5′-CAT GGA GCT CGA TAA GCA AGT TGT TAT AG-3′, including a SacI site, and reverse primer 5′-TTA TGC TAG TTA TTG CTC AG-3′. PCR fragments were then ligated into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pET21d-Toc331–265H6 in a triple ligation. pET21d-Toc159 has previously been described (23Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbrunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Toc159727–1093 (Toc159G) was amplified from pET21d-Toc159 using primers including a BspHI (5′-CAT GTC ATG ACT AGT CAG GAT GGT ACG-3′) and a NotI site (5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CTT AAA CTC GGA AAC CAA ATA CTT TAC G-3′), respectively. Ligation of the BspHI/NotI digested fragment into the NcoI/NotI site of pET21d resulted in pET21d-Toc159727–1093. For bacterial overexpression, the constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and the overexpressed protein was purified under nondenaturing conditions using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) chromatography. The bound protein was eluted with an imidazole step gradient ranging from 50 to 250 mm. Fractions containing the protein were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm MgCl2. The dialysate was centrifuged at 15000 × g to remove insoluble aggregates. The protein concentration of the purified recombinant protein was determined using the Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 255: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217389) Google Scholar). GTP Binding Assays—GTP binding to Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A was determined as follows: 1 μm recombinant protein was incubated on ice for 60 min in the presence of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 50 μm MgCl2, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mm ATP) containing 0.1 μm [α-32P]GTP (3 Ci/μmol) in a final volume of 10 μl. 2 μl of the reaction were spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, which had been preincubated in binding buffer and air-dried. The membrane was washed three times with 10 ml ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3% Tween 20) and air-dried. Bound [α-32P]GTP was detected and quantified using a phosphorimager. To determine [α-32P]GTP (50 nm) binding to Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A in the presence of non-labeled GTP or GDP, the binding buffer was supplemented with increasing concentrations of unlabeled GTP and GDP, respectively. Quantification was done as described above. From this the binding of [α-32P]GTP to Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A (expressed as the percentage of binding without competition) in presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled GTP or GDP was calculated and plotted against the ratio of unlabeled nucleotide versus [α-32P]GTP. GTP Hydrolysis Assay—GTP hydrolysis of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A was measured using a method adapted from a recently published protocol (25Liang Z. Mather T. Li G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 0.5 μm recombinant protein was incubated at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 25 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 50 nm [α-32P]GTP (3 Ci/μmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. After 0, 60, 120, and 240 min of incubation 10 μl of the reaction was removed and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.4% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 8 mm GTP, 8 mm GDP and heated to 65 °C for 5 min. 2 μl of the samples were spotted onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel). GTP and GDP were separated using 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.5 as the solvent. The plates were air-dried and the spots corresponding to GTP and GDP, respectively, were quantified using a Phosphorimager. To determine k cat of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A the same approach was used. 10 μm recombinant protein was incubated as described above, but additionally increasing concentrations of non-labeled GTP (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 750, and 1000 μm) were added to the reaction. Samples were removed after 0, 30, 60, and 120 min and quantification was done as described above. From this, nanomoles of [α-32P]GTP hydrolyzed per minute were calculated and plotted against the concentration of unlabeled GTP. The catalytic constant k cat was calculated according to k cat = V max/[E]. Blue Native PAGE—5.5–16% polyacrylamide gradient gels, as well as the buffers used for electrophoresis, were prepared according to Schägger and von Jagow (1991) (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A (15–22.5 μg) were loaded. Bovine serum albumin (10 μg) was used as a standard. Electrophoresis, performed at 4 °C, was started at 80 V and increased to 200 V after the proteins had reached the separating gel. The gels were additionally stained with Coomassie Blue prior to analysis. After blue native PAGE, the protein bands corresponding to the monomers and dimers of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A were excised from the gel. The gel pieces were destained and the protein eluted from the pieces with 200 μl of 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and precipitated using the chloroform/methanol method (27Wessel D. Flügge U.-I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar). Then it was used for SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blotting. The blot was probed with antibodies recognizing Toc33 (5Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.-A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and developed using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—[35S]Toc159 and [35S]Toc159G used in the pull-down assays were in vitro synthesized directly from the plasmid described above using a reticulocyte-based coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), following the instructions of the supplier. Templates for in vitro synthesis of wild-type and mutant Toc33 lacking a His6 tag were obtained by PCR amplification from the respective constructs containing a His6 tag using the primers 5′-GAA ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GG-3′/5′-CCC AAG CTT GAC GTC TTA CTT TCC TTT ATC ATC AGA G-3′. Soluble Phase Binding Assay—His6-tagged proteins were purified as described above and incubated, at the concentrations indicated, with 10 μl of the respective [35S]Met-labeled protein in import buffer (final concentrations: 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 330 mm sorbitol, 40 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 25 μm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm GTP, 4 mm ATP, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min on ice. 10 μl of packed Ni-NTA agarose equilibrated in import buffer was added, and the incubation continued for 30 min at 4 °C under constant mixing to reisolate the His6-tagged proteins. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml import buffer, once with 40 mm imidazole and then eluted with 200 mm imidazole. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining followed by autoradiography and quantification on a Phosphorimager. Expression and Purification of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A—We expressed wild-type Toc33 (Toc33-wt) and the mutant R130A (Toc33-R130A) as soluble proteins encompassing amino acids 1–265, but lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which was replaced by a hexahistidinyl tag (His6) (Fig. 1A). Both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A were expressed at high levels (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 6). The proteins were largely soluble (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 7) suggesting correct folding and functionality. The proteins were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8) from soluble bacterial protein fractions using Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography. Guanosine Nucleotide Binding to Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A—Arg130 has been predicted to function as a GTPase-activating arginine-finger. To test this hypothesis, we determined both GTP binding and hydrolysis properties of Toc33-R130A and compared the results to those of Toc33-wt. In the GTP binding assay, we incubated the recombinant proteins with radioactive [α-32P]GTP. Aliquots of the reactions were applied to nitrocellulose and washed with buffer. Protein together with bound radioactive nucleotides remained attached to the nitrocellulose. Bound [α-32P]GTP was quantified using a phosphorimager (Fig. 2A). At 100 nm [α-32P]GTP both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A bound [α-32P]GTP with similar efficiency (Fig. 2A). The binding appeared to be specific as a bovine serum albumin control failed to retain [α-32P]GTP. These results suggest that both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A bind GTP with high affinity. To determine the affinity of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A for GDP and GTP, respectively, the recombinant proteins were incubated with 50 nm [α-32P]GTP in the presence of increasing concentrations of either unlabeled GTP or GDP. Aliquots of the reactions were applied to nitrocellulose and [α-32P]GTP remaining bound to the nitrocellulose after washing was quantified using a phosphorimager (Fig. 2B). Both GDP and GTP were considered competitive inhibitors of [α-32P]GTP binding. Competitive inhibition indicates that both proteins bind GDP (Toc33-wt: Kd = ∼4.5 μm; Toc33-R130A: Kd = ∼8.8 μm) with a slightly lower affinity than GTP (Toc33-wt: Kd = ∼2.6 μm; Toc33-R130A: Kd = ∼3.8 μm), Toc33-R130A having a slightly lower affinity than Toc33-wt for both nucleotides. The GTP dissociation constants obtained for Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A are higher than those measured for Ras (Ras: Kd = ∼0.0001–0.1 μm), but in the range of those of SRP/SRα (SRP/SRα: Kd = ∼1–10 μm). At saturating concentrations of GTP (∼30 μm) close to 100% of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A had bound GTP indicating that most of the protein was functional with regard to GTP-binding (data not shown). Furthermore, the data suggest that GTP-binding to Toc33 may be saturated at cellular concentrations of GTP (≥ 0.1 mm) (28Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar). As dimerization of the Toc-GTPases may depend on binding of guanosine nucleotides, we point out that binding affinities of both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A for GTP and GDP are comparable. GTP Hydrolysis by Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A—GTP hydrolysis measurements of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A were carried out to determine whether Arg130 functions as an arginine-finger. Toc-GTPases appear to dimerize preferentially in the GDP-bound state. It is therefore of interest whether Toc33-R130A is able to convert GTP to GDP. First, we analyzed the ability of Toc33-R130A to hydrolyze GTP at low concentration over time and compared it to the wild type, Toc33-wt (Fig. 3A). Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A were incubated with 50 nm [α-32P]GTP. After the incubation, guanosine nucleotides contained in an aliquot of the reaction were separated by polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3A). Radioactive spots corresponding to either GDP or GTP were quantified using a phosphorimager. The results suggest that both Toc33-wt (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4) and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8) hydrolyze GTP, at a low concentration, with similar efficiencies. To determine catalytic rates of GTP hydrolysis by Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A, the recombinant proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of non-radioactive GTP in the presence of 50 nm [α-32P]GTP (Fig. 3, B and C). After incubation, guanosine nucleotides contained in an aliquot of the reaction were separated by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography. Radioactive spots corresponding to either GDP or GTP were quantified using a phosphorimager, and the k cat were calculated for both recombinant proteins. Toc33-wt (Toc33-wt: k cat = 0.013 min–1) and Toc33-R130A (Toc33-R130A: k cat = 0.019 min–1) had similar catalytic constants (Fig. 3, B and C). The results indicate that Arg130 in Toc33 probably does not function as the predicted, GTPase-activating arginine-finger. Furthermore, the measured hydrolysis rate of Toc33-wt is low, comparable to the basal activity of Ras (0.008–0.03 min–1) (29Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar), suggesting that Toc33 is probably not a self-activated GTPase. As Toc33-R130A converts GTP to GDP with kinetics similar to the wild type, it was of interest to determine whether homo- and heterodimerization properties of Toc33-R130A were affected by the point mutation. Homodimerization of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A—Though R130A does not function as an arginine-finger, the residue has previously also been implied in dimerization by forming hydrostatic bonds with the GDP molecule bound to the other monomer. We analyzed dimerization of recombinant Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A using blue native PAGE (Fig. 4) as well as a pull-down assay (Fig. 5). Blue native PAGE of preparations of purified Toc33-wt resulted in two bands, one migrating below (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5, monomer) the bovine serum albumin standard (Fig. 4A, lane 1), the other above (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5, dimer), suggesting that the lower band (∼30 kDa) corresponds to the monomer and the upper band (∼70 kDa) to the dimer. Higher molecular mass bands were not observed suggesting that other oligomers than the dimer are not present in detectable quantities. In contrast to Toc33-wt, the putative 70-kDa dimer band of Toc33-R130A was much weaker (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–9, dimer), suggesting reduced dimerization when compared with Toc33-wt. To confirm that the upper, putative dimer band, indeed contained Toc33-wt or Toc33-R130A, both the lower and upper bands were excised from the gel. Protein was eluted from the excised bands and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 4B). SDS-PAGE of the lower bands of both Toc33-wt (Fig. 4B, lane 1, m) and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 4B, lane 3, m) resulted in ∼31 kDa proteins as visualized by Amido Black staining after transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose. The upper bands of both Toc33-wt (Fig. 4B, lane 2, d) and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 4B, lane 4, d) resulted in much weaker bands of about 31 kDa when stained with Amido Black. To confirm that the proteins stained by Amido Black were indeed Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A, respectively, the blot was probed with antibodies recognizing Toc33 (αatToc33). The lower bands of both Toc33-wt (Fig. 4B, lane 1) and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 4B, lane 3) were recognized by αatToc33, giving strong signals, suggesting that the lower bands indeed contained Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A, respectively, most likely as monomers. The upper bands of both Toc33-wt (Fig. 4B, lane 2) and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 4B, lane 4), analyzed by Western blotting, also reacted with αatToc33. The result suggests that the upper bands also largely consist of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A, respectively, most likely as dimers. However, the upper band of Toc33-R130A gave a much weaker signal than that of Toc33-wt, likely due to reduced dimer formation and/or streaking of the protein across the length of the gel (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–9).Fig. 5Homodimerization of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A. A, increasing concentrations of hexahistidinyl-tagged Toc33-wt (wt H6) or Toc33-R130A (R130A H6) (0–40 μm) were incubated with 35S-labeled Toc33-wt ([35S]wt) or Toc33-R130A ([35S]R130A) in the four possible permutations. Recombinant, hexahistidinyl-tagged protein together with any bound radioactive protein was captured using Ni-NTA chromatography, washed with buffer, and eluted with imidazole. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining followed by autoradiography. B, PhosphorImager quantification. The amount of 35S-labeled Toc33-wt bound to 40 μm recombinant, hexahistidinyl-tagged Toc33-wt was defined as 100% binding. Binding in absence of recombinant, hexahistidinyl-tagged protein was adjusted to zero.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results of the native gel experiments were substantiated by pull down experiments (Fig. 5) in which the recombinant, hexahistidinyl-tagged Toc33-wt or Toc33-R130A were incubated, in increasing concentrations, with synthetic, radioactively labeled Toc33-wt ([35S]wt) or Toc33-R130A ([35S]R130A) lacking the hexahistidinyl tag. Upon incubation of the hexahistidinyl-tagged protein with its radioactive binding partner, Ni-NTA agarose was added to reisolate the tagged protein together with any radioactive binding partner. The Ni-NTA agarose was washed and bound proteins were eluted with imidazole. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Bound radioactive proteins were quantified using a phosphorimager (Fig. 5B). Although the nature of the pull-down experiments does not allow exact determination of the binding constants, qualitatively significant effects of the R130A substitution on homo- and heterodimerization were observed: Whereas recombinant Toc33-wt pulled down around 20% of the synthetic, radioactive wild-type protein ([35S]wt) (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–6), recombinant Toc33-R130A pulled down only trace amounts of its radioactive equivalent (Fig. 5A, lanes 7–9). Moreover, recombinant Toc33-wt pulled down similarly low amounts of radioactive Toc33-R130A (Fig. 5A, lanes 10–12) and vice versa (Fig. 5A, lanes 13–15). These results demonstrate that Arg130 must be present in either monomer to allow for stable homodimerization. Thus, Toc33-R130A, while not dramatically affected in its GTP binding and hydrolysis properties, appears to be strongly compromised in dimerization, suggesting that GTP-hydrolysis may be uncoupled from dimerization. Heterodimerization of Toc33 and Toc159 involves Arg130 of Toc33—Toc33 has been proposed to function as a receptor for Toc159 at the chloroplast surface. We therefore also tested the ability of recombinant Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A to interact with soluble, radioactive Toc159 ([35S]Toc159) (Fig. 6) or its GTP-binding domain ([35S]Toc159G) (Fig. 7) lacking hexahistidinyl tags. Hexahistidinyl-tagged Toc33-wt or Toc33-R130A were incubated with either [35S]Toc159 (Fig. 6) or [35S] Toc159G (Fig. 7). Ni-NTA agarose was added to reisolate hexahistidinyl-tagged protein and any radioactive protein bound to it. The Ni-NTA agarose was washed and bound proteins were eluted with imidazole. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Figs. 6A and 7A). Radioactive proteins bound to Toc33-wt or Toc33-R130A were quantified using a phosphorimager (Figs. 6B and 7B).Fig. 7Binding of [35S]Toc159G to Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A. A, increasing concentrations (0–10 μm) of Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A were incubated with [35S]Toc159G. Recombinant, hexahistidinyl-tagged protein together with any bound radioactive protein was captured using Ni-NTA chromatography, washed with buffer and eluted with imidazole. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining followed by autoradiography. B, PhosphorImager quantification. The amount of [35S]-Toc159G bound to 10 μm Toc33-wt was defined as 100% binding. Binding in absence of recombinant protein was adjusted to zero.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the pull-down assay, Toc33-wt (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–4) bound more efficiently to soluble [35S]Toc159 (∼5% of the total radioactive protein) than Toc33-R130A (∼2% of the total radioactive protein) (Fig. 6A, lanes 5–8) suggesting that heterodimerization of Toc33 and Toc159 may also require Arg130 of Toc33 (Fig. 6, A and B). Heterodimerization of Toc33 and Toc159 has been reported to involve the GTP-binding domain of Toc159 (Toc159G). We therefore analyzed the ability of [35S]Toc159G to interact with both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A (Fig. 7, A and B). Toc33-wt pulled-down [35S]Toc159G far more efficiently (up to 5% of the total radioactive protein) than Toc33-R130A (up to 1% of the total radioactive protein). These results indicate that Arg130 is also critical for heterodimerization of Toc33 with the GTP-binding domain of Toc159. Furthermore, the results suggest that homo- and heterodimerization of the Toc-GTPases may rely on the same molecular mechanisms. The GTP-regulated heterodimerization between atToc159 and atToc33 likely plays a key role in chloroplast protein import (5Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.-A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.-A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J.

The physiological significance of Toc33/Toc159 heterodimerization is underscored by its essential role in chloroplast biogenesis in vivo (17Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.-A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results shed light on the role of the amino acid Arg130 in both homodimerization of Toc33 and its heterodimerization with Toc159 and allow conclusions regarding the Toc-GTPase dimerization mechanism. An earlier model suggests that dimerization may stimulate GTP hydrolysis by the insertion of the Arg130 arginine-finger into the GTP-binding pocket (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results however suggest that stable dimerization could possibly occur after GTP hydrolysis at the monomers. We compared the guanosine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis properties of wild-type Toc33 (Toc33-wt) with the alanine mutant of Arg130 (Toc33-R130A). Toc33-R130A binds to GTP and GDP with affinities comparable to those of Toc33-wt (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the GTP hydrolysis catalytic constants of both the mutant and wild type are similar suggesting that GTP hydrolysis by Toc33-R130A is not compromised (Fig. 3). On the one hand, these results provide direct evidence against the role of Arg130 as an arginine-finger. On the other hand, the data show that Toc33-R130A is able to convert GTP to GDP. This is significant as heterodimerization of Toc33 and Toc159 appears to occur preferentially in the GDP-bound state. 1) The crystal structure of pea Toc34 revealed GDP-bound homodimers (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). 2) Heterodimerization of Toc33 with Toc159 was stimulated by GDP (18Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 3) Self-dimerization of Toc33 was stimulated by GDP over GTP (30Jelic M. Soll J. Schleiff E. Biochem. 2003; 42: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The GDP dissociation constants of both Toc33-wt and Toc33-R130A are slightly higher than those for GTP but still suggest that GDP is tightly bound, possibly stabilizing Toc-GTPase dimers (21Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li H. Tu S. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Arg130 has not only been postulated to function as an arginine-finger but, due to its interactions with the GDP molecule and amino acids of the other monomer, to play a role in dimerization. Using blue native PAGE (Fig. 4) and pull-down assays (Figs. 5, 6, and 7), we found that Toc33-R130A has a strongly reduced ability to form stable dimers either with itself, with Toc33-wt, with Toc159 or the isolated GTP-binding domain of Toc159. Together with GTP binding and hydrolysis data, these findings indicate that Arg130, though not functioning as a GTPase-activating arginine-finger, plays a key role in both homo- and heterodimerization. Moreover, Arg130 must be present in both monomers as dimerization is reduced to near background levels if Arg130 is replaced by an alanine in just one of the two monomers (Fig. 5). Given that Toc33-R130A is compromised in dimerization but binds and hydrolyzes GTP with kinetics comparable to the wild type and that Toc-GTPase dimers preferentially form in the GDP-bound state, we propose that Toc-GTPases may be able to hydrolyze GTP prior to dimerization. These experiments were done in the absence of precursor proteins or other potential interacting proteins. Thus, these results reflect the “idling” protein import machine. However, the findings suggest dynamics of the protein translocation process. Hydrolysis rates of both Toc33 and Toc159 are low and have potential for activation. Independent GTPase activating events occuring at Toc159 in the cytosol and Toc33 at the outer membrane may convert the GTPases into what may be their dimerization-competent GDP-bound forms. Preferential binding of Toc159 to Toc33 over homodimerization of Toc33 may be key to targeting of the soluble receptor to the outer membrane and this hypothesis will need to be tested. Likely, precursor proteins play a key role in GTPase activation as precursor proteins stimulate GTPase activity of psToc34 by up to 100-fold (31Schleiff E. Soll J. Sveshnikova N. Tien R. Wright S. Dabney-Smith C. Subramanian C. Bruce B.D. Biochem. 2002; 41: 1934-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Other components of the Toc complex, such as Toc75, may potentially exert effects on GTP hydrolysis or binding. We envisage that GTP-driven dynamic interactions may function to orchestrate transfer of cytosolic precursors from Toc159 to Toc33 and finally to the protein-conducting channel component, Toc75. We thank colleagues in our laboratory and M. Stadler and Prof. N. Amrhein (ETH Zürich) for their continued support and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W1974698404,"The major role of hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBV pol) is polymerization of nucleotides, but it also participates in protein priming and the packaging of its own genome into capsids. Therefore, HBV pol may require many assistance factors for its roles. Previous reports have shown that Hsp60, a molecular chaperone, activates HBV pol both in vitro and ex vivo, such as inside insect cells. Moreover, HBV pol binds to Hsp60 in the HepG2 host cell line. In this report, we show that Hsp60 plays a role in the in vivo replication of HBV. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (A-ODNs) specifically directed against Hsp60 induced its down-regulation, severely reducing the level of replication-competent HBV without influencing cell proliferation and capsid assembly under these conditions. Furthermore, we found that Hsp60 did not encapsidate into nucleocapsids. Our results indicate that Hsp60 is important for HBV replication in vivo, presumably through activation of HBV pol before encapsidation of HBV pol into HBV core particle. In addition, A-ODNs specific for Hsp60 also inhibit replication of a mutant HBV strain that is resistant to the nucleoside analogue 3TC, which is the main drug used for HBV treatment, and we suggest that A-ODNs directed against Hsp60 are possible reagents as anti-HBV drugs.

Acute infections can produce serious illness, and ∼0.5% of patients terminate with fatal, fulminant hepatitis. Chronic HBV infection causes liver diseases, such as liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as other serious consequences. Nearly 25% of patients with chronic infections terminate in untreatable liver cancer (2Beasley R.P. Cancer. 1988; 61: 1942-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Annual deaths from liver cancer caused by HBV infection exceed one million worldwide. An effective vaccine has been available for 20 years, and attempts for universal vaccination are now underway in developed countries (3Parkin D.M. Pisani P. Munoz N. Ferlay J. Cancer Surv. 1999; 33: 5-33Google Scholar). However, vaccination is not effective for established infections and only prevents transmission, such as from mother to newborn (4Stevens C.E. Beasley R.P. Tsui J. Lee W.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1975; 292: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Following infection of hepatocytes, the partially double-stranded DNA genome of hepadnavirus is converted into covalently closed circular DNA in the nucleus (5Mason W.S. Halpern M.S. England J.M. Seal G. Egan J. Coates L. Aldrich C. Summers J. Virology. 1983; 131: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hepadnavirus produces four RNA transcripts for replication in the infected cells (1Seeger C. Mason W.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Among the transcripts, pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) acts as an mRNA that encodes the HBV core protein and the polymerase (pol); pgRNA also acts as the template for genome synthesis after it is packaged into a capsid. Binding of pol to a stem-loop structure, ϵ, which is close to the 5′-end of pgRNA, is necessary for nucleocapsid assembly and replication initiation (6Knaus T. Nassal M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3967-3975Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This binding of pol to the 5′ ϵ stem-loop region is important because, after binding, to initiate replication of the HBV genome pol incorporates three to four nucleotides at tyrosine residue 63, a process called “priming” (8Wang G.H.

To study the biochemical aspects of HBV pol, many researchers have tried to produce in vitro HBV pol systems. However, HBV pol is not active in cell-free systems, and producing HBV pol in Escherichia coli is difficult. Only HBV pol fusions with large proteins, such as maltose binding protein, can be expressed in E. coli (10Lee H.J. Kwon Y.T. Rho H.M. Jung G. Biotechnol.

However, pol is very unstable and highly degradable; therefore, reconstitution experiments of pol are complicated. Mechanistic questions have become tractable only after the establishment of a model system, the duck HBV model, which provides active pol in a cell-free system (12Howe A.Y. Elliott J.F. Tyrrell D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During priming in vitro, duck HBV pol requires a chaperone complex, such as the Hsp90 complex, to change its conformational states (13Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 14Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Hu J. Toft D. Anselmo D. Wang X. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These changes enable duck HBV pol to bind to the ϵ stem loop region in pgRNA, after which pol shows priming activity. Although much information has been obtained from the duck HBV pol model, many mechanistic details of HBV pol are still unknown. Recently, HBV pol was shown to bind to Hsp60 and activate pol in vitro (16Park S.G. Jung G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, HBV pol was shown to bind to Hsp60 in HepG2 cells, which are human hepatocytes (17Park S.G. Lim S.O. Jung G. Virology. 2002; 298: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Hsp60 assists HBV pol in vivo. To probe the role of Hsp60 for HBV pol in vivo, we used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (A-ODNs) to down-regulate Hsp60. Generally, A-ODNs targeting a specific gene are used to knock-out a gene without exerting other effects (18Pak J.H. Manevich Y. Kim H.S. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49927-49934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Ranganathan G. Song W. Dean N. Monia B. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38669-38675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that protein kinase C α and RAF1 are important in the translational regulation of lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes through down-regulation of protein kinase C α and RAF1 by using A-ODNs (19Ranganathan G. Song W. Dean N. Monia B. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38669-38675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The most commonly used ODNs are phosphorothioate ODNs. These oligonucleotide analogues are very resistant to nucleases (20Cohen J.S. Crooke S.T. Lebleu B. Antisense Research and Applications. CRC press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 205-221Google Scholar) but hybridize with a slightly lower efficiency than the binding efficiency of unmodified ODNs (21Uhlmann E. Peyman A. Ryte A. Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 313: 268-284Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using A-ODNs directed against Hsp60 (22Steinhoff U. Zugel U. Wand-Wurttenberger A. Hengel H. Rosch R. Munk M.E. Kaufmann S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5085-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we reduced the level of cytoplasmic Hsp60 in HepG2 cells, thereby blocking HBV replication. In this report, it was shown that Hsp60 is essential for HBV replication in vivo. This aspect is indicated by the loss of interaction between HBV pol and Hsp60 that is due directly to lowered Hsp60 levels by the A-ODNs directed against Hsp60 without the influence of other changes. In addition, Hsp60 can be targeted for anti-HBV drug development, because down-regulation of Hsp60 in infected cells blocks replication of HBV and mutant HBV (M550V) that is resistant to the nucleoside analogue 2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), the main drug for HBV treatment (23Allen M.I. Deslauriers M. Andrews C.W. Tipples G.A. Walters K.A. Tyrrell D.L. Brown N. Condreay L.D. Hepatology. 1988; 27: 1670-1677Crossref Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Constructions and Oligonucleotides—The pHBV1.2× construct is similar to a previously described construct (24Guidotti L.G. Matzke B. Schaller H. Chisari F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6158-6169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that supports HBV replication by providing all required HBV transcripts. Briefly, one copy of the HBV genome having sequences of subtype adr (25Kim K.T. Hyun S.W. Kim Y.S. Rho H.M. Korean J. Biochem. 1988; 21: 319-331Google Scholar) was inserted into the pUC18 plasmid at the BamHI site (nucleotide 1397). A fragment spanning the BamHI site (nucleotide 1397) to the end of the pgRNA (nucleotide 1987) was added to this plasmid (Fig. 1A). The pCMV/Core plasmid was constructed by inserting the HBV core open reading frame into the pRc/CMV vector (Fig. 1A) (Invitrogen). The phosphorothioate ODNs, A-ODN #1, A-ODN #2, sense ODN (S-ODN), FITC/A-ODN #1, and FITC/S-ODN, were synthesized by Hokkaido System Sciences Co. (Hokkaido, Japan) (Fig. 1B). Cells and Transfections—HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected by using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the manufacturer. The transfection efficiency in each sample was normalized by cotransfecting the pCMV/β-gal plasmid. Detecting Cytoplasmic Capsids by the Endogenous Polymerase Assay—Transfected HepG2 cells were lysed by using 0.7 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 per 6-cm dish. After 15 min on ice, the lysates were clarified by 20,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. Nucleocapsids were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with rabbit anti-HBc antibody (Dako) and protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by a short spin, transferred to reaction tubes, and washed twice with 1 ml of 1× PBS. For the endogenous polymerase assay, all liquid was removed, and 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm dATP, 0.4 mm dGTP, 0.4 mm dTTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added and then incubated at 37 °C overnight. After the reaction, 20 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The labeled viral genome was isolated by addition of 50 μl of 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), and 0.8 mg/ml tRNA, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. This mixture was extracted once with 0.1 ml of phenol-chloroform (1:1). DNA was separated from unincorporated radioactive dCTP by precipitating samples with 25 μl of 10 m ammonium acetate and 250 μl of ethanol, incubating for 15 min at room temperature, and spinning for 15 min in a desktop microcentrifuge. The pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA, and the DNA was precipitated again as described. The DNA pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer and applied to a 1% agarose-Tris acetate-EDTA gel for electrophoresis. The gel was transferred to Whatman paper, dried by vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji). Detecting Cytoplasmic Capsids by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis— Cleared lysates (2.5 ml) were layered on sucrose gradients (1 ml of 40% sucrose and 1.5 ml of 20% sucrose in 1× PBS), and the capsids were sedimented by centrifugation at 20 °C for 19 h at 240,000 × g in a PST55Ti rotor (Hitachi). The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 1× PBS by sonication (three strokes, 1 s per stroke). Of each sample, 50 μl was mixed with 6× loading buffer containing 0.25% bromphenol blue and 30% glycerol and separated through 1% agarose in 40 mm Tris acetate and 1 mm EDTA. Following electrophoresis, gels were blotted overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary transfer in 10× SSC. HBV core particles on the membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-HBc antibody (DAKO). Quantifying Nucleocapsids by Quantifying Encapsidated HBV DNA—After separation, the capsid particles (50 μl of resuspended samples) were mixed with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the anti-HBcAg rabbit polyclonal antibody (DAKO). Immunoprecipitated capsid particles were washed three times in 1× PBS. Of these samples, one half was dissolved in 1× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Hsp60 (N-20) antibody. Encapsidated HBV nucleic acids were isolated from the other half of the immunoprecipitated capsid particles by treatment with 10 mm MgCl2 and 500 μg/ml DNase I for1hat37 °C.The isolated viral DNAs were quantified by using a “real-time” fluorescent-based PCR with primers (forward primer HBV1F: 5′-CCG TCT GTG CCT TCT CAT CTG-3′; reverse primer HBV1R: 5′-AGT CCA AGA GTY CTC TTA TGY AAG ACC TT-3′) and a fluorescent probe (HBV1TAQ: 5′-CCG TGT GCA CTT CGC TTC ACC TCT GC-3′) as previously described (26Loeb K.R. Jerome K.R. Goddard J. Huang M. Cent A. Corey L. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As the negative control, HepG2 cells not transfected with pHBV1.2× were used using the above methods. For each sample, the same volume was the same as that in the above nucleocapsid preparation steps. Fluorescent Microscopy—HepG2 cells were seeded on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), treated with 0.5 μm FITC/A-ODN #1 or FITC/S-ODN, and incubated for 3 h. After incubation, coverslips were briefly washed twice with 1× PBS and then incubated with 1× PBS containing 5 μm A-ODN #1 or S-ODN for 5 min at room temperature. The washed coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed for 10 min with quenching solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl, followed by two brief washes in 1× PBS. The washed coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides with mounting medium (Sigma) and secured by rubber cement. Micrographs at 100× magnification were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse E600™ fluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescein filter set (excitation filter 450–490 nm, emission filter BP 520–560) linked to an Olympus C4040 digital camera. Subcellular Fractionation—HepG2 cells were fractionated by differential pelleting (27Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cells were harvested and washed briefly with ice-cold 1× PBS. After washing, the cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and2mm EDTA and then homogenized by using a Dounce homogenizer with a type B pestle (20 slow strokes). Cell debris and nuclei were removed from the lysed cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Postnuclear supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 1 h into pellets (mitochondria fraction) and supernatants (postmitochondrial fraction). The postmitochondrial supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h into pellets (microsome fraction) and supernatants (cytosol fraction). The pellets were dissolved in homogenization buffer by sonication, and the amount of protein in each sample was determined by Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). The same amount of each fractionated protein sample was separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Hsp60 (N-20) goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Metabolic Labeling—For metabolic labeling of HepG2 cells with l-[35S]methionine, cells were cultured for 1.5 h in l-methionine-free minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation, 0.1 mCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the culture media and incubated for 3 h. Cells were treated with 1 μm A-ODN #1 or 1 μm S-ODN at 24 h prior to l-methionine starvation, during l-methionine starvation, and during the metabolic labeling period. Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis Assays—MTS assay for cell proliferation was performed with the CellTiter 96®AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega). Caspase-3 assay for detection of cell apoptosis was performed with the CaspACE™ assay system, colorimetric kit (Promega). The above two assays were performed as instructed by the manufacturer. Hsp60 Antisense ODNs Block HBV Replication—To determine whether Hsp60 is necessary for HBV pol function in vivo, we used A-ODN #1 for down-regulation of the Hsp60 level in HepG2 cells. The ODNs had been chemically modified to phosphorothioate ODNs by substituting the oxygen molecules of the phosphate backbone with sulfur for longer half-lives. To exclude nonspecific effects of the A-ODNs, we used two controls, S-ODN and A-ODN #2. The S-OND is against A-ODN #1 and is used to determine the effect of phosphorothioate ODNs on cells (Fig. 1B). A-ODN #2 (Fig. 1B) was directed against a sequence that has only four overlapping bases with A-ODN #1. It was used to test whether the sequence of A-ODN #1 nonspecifically affects the cells. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 1 μm A-ODN #1 to down-regulate Hsp60 severely reduced the endogenous polymerase assay activity of HBV, similar to treatment with 1 μm 3TC. However, treatment with 1 μm S-ODN did not affect endogenous polymerase assay activity (Fig. 2A). This concentration for A-ODN #1 was obtained during our experiment in which 1 μm A-ODN #1 was sufficient for almost complete reduction of endogenous polymerase assay activity (Fig. 3A). Treatment of HepG2 cells with A-ODN #2 also resulted in reduced endogenous polymerase assay activity, but this reduction was not as efficient as the reduction seen with A-ODN #1. This result might be due to A-ODN #1 having a higher T m (48 °C) than the T m (46 °C) of A-ODN #2. In addition to the above result found after 2.5 days, HBV replication was also blocked by A-ODNs #1 treatment for 5 and 7.5 days (Fig. 2A).Fig. 3Dose response of A-ODNs against Hsp60. 12 h after transfection, HepG2 cells harboring pHBV1.2× were treated with serial dilutions of A-ODN #1 (A) and 3TC as a control (B). And then 2.5 days after treatment, HBV replication efficiency was estimated by endogenous polymerase assay. C, comparison of HBV replication inhibition efficiency with 3TC. Intensities of endogenous polymerase assay products on x-ray film were determined by 1D Image Analysis software (Kodak Digital Science). ND, not determined. D, HepG2 cells harboring pHBV1.2× were treated with serial dilutions of A-ODN #1 or 3TC, and secreted HBV was estimated by HBV DNA quantification. From samples of culture media, HBV nucleic acids were isolated after DNase I treatment (10 mm MgCl2 and 500 μg/ml DNase I) for 1 h at 37 °C. HBV DNA was quantified by using “real-time” fluorescence-based PCR. This experiment shows the average values of data from duplicate or triplicate reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Down-regulation of Hsp60 Does Not Affect Capsid Assembly—After A-ODN #1, A-ODN #2, and 3TC treatment, levels of the assembled HBV core particles were lower than that of the control (Fig. 2B, top panel). To test whether down-regulation of Hsp60 affected capsid formation, we examined capsid formation in HepG2 cells, where Hsp60 was down-regulated by treatment of A-ODN #1. To express the HBV core, we transfected HepG2 cells with the pCMV/Core plasmid and then treated the transfected with A-ODN #1. Assembled capsid particles were separated by ultracentrifugation 2.5 days after transfection. In Fig. 2B, the bottom panel clearly shows that, although Hsp60 was down-regulated, the level of HBV capsid formation was the same for both A-ODN #1-treated and untreated pCMV/Coretransfected cells. These data indicate that loss of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids by A-ODN #1 treatment is not due to inhibition of HBV core assembly and HBV core protein expression, but that the loss might be due to inactivation of HBV pol. We also examined expression of HBV core proteins in insect cells and found that HBV core proteins did not bind to Hsp60 (data not shown). Hsp60 Does Not Encapsidate in the Nucleocapsid—A previous report showed that ATP synergistically activates HBV pol (16Park S.G. Jung G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This result indicates that HBV pol might be liberated from the Hsp60 complex after activation, because the Hsp60 complex requires ATP for the release of the substrate (28Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hsp60 associates with capsid particles, we quantified nucleocapsids where pol is found. If one Hsp60 complex (composed of 14 subunits) associates with one nucleocapsid, 10 fmol of Hsp60 complexes (∼8 ng) should be present in 10 fmol of nucleocapsid (∼50 ng). Also, it is reported that HBV pol can be encapsidated into capsids without pgRNA (29Lott L. Beames B. Notvall L. Lanford R.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11479-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Even if Hsp60 associates with HBV pol in capsids without pgRNA, at least 10 fmol of Hsp60 complex should be present in the capsid. We were unable to detect Hsp60 in ∼10 fmol of nucleocapsids, even though 0.6 fmol of the control Hsp60 complexes (∼0.5 ng) was detected in the analysis (Fig. 2C). In addition, we were unable to detect Hsp60 by an immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp60 (N-20) antibodies on the stripped nylon membrane, which was used previously for detecting native nucleocapsid particles (about 10 fmol; data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that Hsp60 does not encapsidate in the nucleocapsid. Down-regulation of Hsp60 Blocks Mutant HBV Resistant to 3TC—To test the potential of using A-ODN #1 as an anti-HBV drug, we tested A-ODN #1 in a mutant, 3TC-resistant HBV (M550V), which has mutations of HBV pol that change the YMDD motif to YVDD. This mutant virus produces severe problems during 3TC treatment, because it is highly resistant to 3TC and thus is the primary cause of treatment failure. To test the effect of down-regulation of Hsp60 by A-ODN #1 treatment in this mutant virus, we constructed the pHBV1.2× (M550V) plasmid for producing a 3TC-resistant virus in HepG2 cells. In a previous report, the activity of this mutant HBV pol was shown to be lower than the activity of wild-type pol (30Ono-Nita S.K. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Masaki T. Lan K.H. Carrilho F.J. Omata M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, the replication efficiency of the mutant virus was also lower than the efficiency of the wild-type virus (Fig. 2D). Treatment with A-ODN #1 blocked replication of the mutant virus, but treatment with 3TC did not block its replication. This result indicates that inhibition of HBV replication by A-ODN #1 appears to be effective against the 3TC-resistant mutant virus. Reduction of HBV Replication by A-ODN #1 Treatment Is Dose-dependent—HepG2 cells harboring the pHBV1.2× plasmid were treated with serial dilutions of A-ODN #1 or 3TC. We estimated the level of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids in these cells 2.5 days after treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, to quantify levels of secreted HBV, we harvested culture media from treated cells and estimated the presence of viral genome DNA. The results show that reduction of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids in cells by treatment with A-ODN #1 is dose-dependent, similar to the result shown for 3TC treatment. Importantly, reduction of HBV secretion by A-ODN #1 treatment is dose-dependent, again similar to the result shown for 3TC. Fig. 3D indicates that A-ODN #1, in comparison to 3TC, inhibits HBV replication efficiently within a limited time range. HepG2 Cells Uptake FITC-conjugated Hsp60 A-ODN #1—To test whether HepG2 cells uptake A-ODN #1, we used FITC-conjugated A-ODN #1. Previously, FITC conjugation was shown to have no affect on uptake of ODNs in cells (31Sogos V. Ennas M.G. Mussini I. Gremo F. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 32Sommer W. Hebb M.O. Heilig M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 277: 261-275Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were treated with 0.5 μm FITC-conjugated A-ODN #1 for 3 h. Fig. 4 clearly shows that HepG2 cells uptake both A-ODN #1 and S-ODN. For the control, HepG2 cells were treated with FITC-conjugated A-ODN #1 for 15 s. No signal was observed in this control (data not shown), indicating that the uptake shown in Fig. 4 is specific. Fig. 4 also shows that almost all cells uptake FITC-conjugated ODNs (FITC/A-ODN #1 and FITC/S-ODN). Down-regulation of Cytoplasmic Hsp60 Levels by A-ODNs Is Not Mediated by Degradation of Hsp60 mRNA—Metabolic labeling of cells shows that treatment with A-ODN #1 inhibits Hsp60 synthesis (Fig. 5A). The level of labeled β-actin protein was similar in the samples, which indicates that translation of β-actin was not affected by treatment with A-ODN #1. Also, β-galactosidase activities for normalizing transfection efficiency were similar in the samples (data not shown), suggesting that treatment with A-ODN #1 affects neither protein synthesis nor the function of other proteins in the cells. To check Hsp60 levels in different regions of the cell, we treated extracts of cells with A-ODN #1 and fractionated treated extracts through differential pelleting by ultracentrifugation. Such methods have been well defined in many studies. Three fractions of mitochondria, microsome, and cytoplasm were fractionated by pelleting. Equal amounts of fractionated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblotting with the anti-Hsp60 (N-20) antibody. Fig. 5B clearly shows that reduction of newly synthesized Hsp60 mainly affected the level of Hsp60 in cytoplasm, which is the site of HBV replication. This treatment did not affect the Hsp60 level in mitochondria, the main site of Hsp60 activity. These results suggest that down-regulation of Hsp60 in cytoplasm strongly affects HBV replication. To test whether down-regulation of Hsp60 is due to mRNA degradation, we examined levels of Hsp60 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Some A-ODNs are able to activate RNase H and induce target mRNA degradation (33Dean N.M. Mckay R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 22: 11762-11766Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 34Hijiya N. Zhang J. Ratajczak M.Z. Kant J.A. DeRiel K. Herlyn M. Zon G. Gewirtz A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4499-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this experiment, we found that the level of Hsp60 mRNAs in cells was not affected by treatment with A-ODN #1 (1, 0.1, and 0.01 μm A-ODN #1). This result indicates that down-regulation of the Hsp60 protein is not due to mRNA degradation by RNase H activation but due to inhibition of Hsp60 translation. Therefore, Hsp60 down-regulation is not irreversible, and the blocking of translation might be controlled by the concentration of A-ODNs. Down-regulation of Hsp60 in the Cytoplasm Does Not Affect Cell Viability—Normally, Hsp60 is an abundant and essential protein for cell survival. Down-regulation of Hsp60 in cytoplasm, however, does not affect cell viability. To examine the viability of the cell, the MTS assay to check for cell proliferation and caspase-3 assay to check for cell apoptosis were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the MTS assay, treatment of serial concentration of A-ODNs #1 to HepG2 cells does not show a certain pattern (Fig. 6A). Even though treatment of A-ODNs #1 10-fold higher in concentration (10 μm) than normally used (1 μm) in this report, proliferation of the treated cells did not differ from the control (Fig. 6A). Caspase-3 assay shows that treatment of A-ODNs #1 (10 μm)to HepG2 cells does not induce apoptosis as in treatment of S-ODNs (10 μ M), A-ODNs #2 (10 μm), and 3TC (10 μm) (Fig. 6B). The above results indicate that down-regulation of Hsp60 in cytoplasm does not affect cell functions during the limited times. HBV pol participates in its genome replication, but mechanistic details have not yet been fully discovered. The obstacle for studying HBV pol has been its low expression level in HBV-infected hepatocytes and in heterologous expression systems. However, when pol was expressed in insect cells, it was very resistant to degradation and showed priming activity. Host factors for HBV pol in insect cells might be similar to the factors in hepatocytes, enabling stabilization and function of pol. Previous reports have indicated that Hsp60 activates HBV pol in insect cells and binds to HBV pol in hepatocytes (16Park S.G. Jung G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Park S.G. Lim S.O. Jung G. Virology. 2002; 298: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such results suggest the possibility that Hsp60 might have an actual role in HBV replication. To probe the effects of Hsp60 on HBV replication in vivo, we used phosphorothioate A-ODNs to down-regulate the Hsp60 level in cells. With A-ODNs directed against Hsp60, we were able to show that Hsp60 participates in HBV replication and is essential for replication because down-regulation of Hsp60 severely reduced the levels of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids but did not inhibit capsid formation. Furthermore, Hsp60 synthesis was reduced by treatment with A-ODN #1, and Hsp60 levels were reduced mainly in the cytoplasm, which is the site of encapsidation of HBV pol and pgRNA into capsids. To determine that the result is not caused by other effect such as viability and A-ODNs #1-cellular protein interaction, some experiments are carried. In these experiments, viability of cells treated with A-ODN #1 did not decrease, and apoptosis was not induced by treatment. Despite the requirement of Hsp60 for cell function, inhibition of Hsp60 synthesis did not affect cell viability, because Hsp60 localized in mitochondria is more than 95% in HepG2 cells and mitochondria are its main functional region. Even though HepG2 cells were treated with a high concentration of A-ODN #1 (10 μm), viability was not affected. This result means that the reduction of replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids was not caused by an abnormality of cell functions. At each transfection, the transfection efficiencies that were normalized by measuring β-galactosidase activity were not affected by treatment with A-ODN #1. This result indicates that down-regulation of Hsp60 in the cytoplasm affects neither protein synthesis nor the function of other proteins. Sense phosphorothioate ODNs did not affect HBV replication. A-ODN #2, which is directed against another site of the Hsp60 gene, also blocks HBV replication, indicating that blocking is Hsp60-specific. Under in vitro conditions, ATP synergizes Hsp60 function for HBV pol (16Park S.G. Jung G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6962-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Generally, ATP is required for release of substrate from the Hsp60 complex (28Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). This requirement indicates that Hsp60 might bind to HBV pol transiently and that bound Hsp60 might be liberated from the HBV pol-Hsp60 complex after activation. In this report, we found that Hsp60 is not encapsidated in the HBV nucleocapsid, meaning that HBV pol detaches from the Hsp60 complex before encapsidation, a result that coincides with our in vitro data. Confirming Hsp60 function in vivo, our report also suggests A-ODN #1 as a drug for HBV treatment. Established drugs for HBV treatment have problems. Treatment of patients with chronic HBV infections with interferon α (35Niederau C. Heintges T. Lange S. Goldmann G. Niederau C.M. Mohr L. Haussinger D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) is limited by side effects, incomplete efficacy, restriction to patients with compensated disease, and the requirement for parenteral administration (36Foster G.R.

Whereas direct administration of ODNs in vitro is not an effective delivery method, phosphorothioate ODNs administered intravenously without delivery reagents in animal models have shown effective and specific antisense inhibition. These surprising results helped revive antisense technology and have encouraged researchers to perform more clinical trials (38Wagner R.W. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1116-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Crooker S.T. Bennet C.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 107-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The use of A-ODNs as antiviral agents has also emerged as a powerful new approach (40Wagner R.W. Flanagan W.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1997; 3: 31-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Veal G.J. Agrawal S. Byrn R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5670-5675Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Many A-ODN drugs are now being widely developed. Forvirsen, an A-ODN used against cytomegalovirus, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (42de Smet M.D. Meenken C.J. van den Horn G.J. Ocul. Immunol. Inflamm. 1999; 7: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this report, replication inhibition of the HBV mutant by Hsp60-directed A-ODNs implicates Hsp60 as a possible novel target for combinational antiviral therapy with 3TC. In conclusion, A-ODNs targeted against Hsp60 blocks HBV replication without HBV core assembly. This result shows that Hsp60 is required for HBV replication in vivo, possibly through activation of HBV pol. Our study also found that the Hsp60-HBV pol interaction is required before HBV pol encapsidation into HBV nucleocapsid. We are grateful to John E. Tavis for critical reading of the manuscript."

We have investigated the basis for this enhanced activity by producing recombinant analogues of the linked dimer that assess the effects of protein size and the number and area of the ice-binding site(s). The recombinant dimer connected by a peptide linker had twice the activity of the monomer. When one of the two ice-binding sites was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, the linked dimer was only 1.2 times more effective than the monomer. When the two monomers were linked through a C-terminal disulfide bond in such a way that their two ice-binding sites were opposite each other and unable to engage the same ice surface simultaneously, the dimer was again only 1.2 times as active as the monomer. We conclude from these analyses that the enhanced activity of the dimer stems from the two ice-binding sites being able to engage to ice at the same time, effectively doubling the area of the ice-binding site.

Fish are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins (AFPs), 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, antifreeze protein; wlwAFP, wild type-linker-wild type AFP; wlxAFP, wild type-linker-knockout AFP; wsswAFP, disulfide-linked wild type AFP homodimer; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol. which bind to the surface of nucleating ice crystals in their body fluids, thereby reducing their freezing point below that of the ocean (1Raymond J.A.

AFPs create a local curvature of the ice between adsorbed AFPs, which makes it energetically unfavorable for liquid water to join the ice surface (4Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). This process, known as the Kelvin effect, produces a non-equilibrium reduction of the freezing point of ice below the melting point (5Wilson P.W. Cryo Lett. 1993; 14: 31-36Google Scholar). The difference between the melting and freezing points is the thermal hysteresis gap, and it is within this temperature range that ice growth is prevented and fish are protected from freezing. Type III AFPs belong to one of several structurally distinct antifreeze protein families found in fishes (6Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have localized the ice-binding residues to a flat, amphipathic surface on the protein (11Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This ice-binding face includes several conserved hydrophilic residues (Gln9, Asn14, Thr15, Thr18, Gln44) that potentially form hydrogen bonds with water molecules on the ice surface (10Sonnichsen F.D.

Altogether, these residues are thought to make favorable van der Waals contacts with the ice surface (10Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D.

In addition, there may also be stabilizing entropic effects from bringing this somewhat hydrophobic surface into contact with ice (10Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Type III AFP was first reported to bind to the primary prism plane {10-10} of ice (22Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. di Prisco G. Life Under Extreme Conditions. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). However, Antson et al. have recently shown it can bind to several planes lying parallel with or at an acute angle to the c-axis of the ice crystal (9Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. Caves L.S. Verma C.S. Buckley S.L. Lillford P.J. Hubbard R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Approximately 20 type III isoforms from five species of zoarcid fishes have now been sequenced, with an overall 50% sequence identity. One isoform (designated RD3) from the Antarctic eel pout (Lycodichthys dearborni) has two type III AFPs joined in tandem by a nine-amino acid linker peptide (23Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This duplicated AFP with two similar AFP domains has been referred to in the literature as an intramolecular dimer (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) although there is no suggestion that the tandemly repeated AFPs contact each other. NMR analysis of the 14.7-kDa RD3 isoform indicates that the linker region is fairly flexible and may allow both ice-binding faces to engage the ice surface at the same time (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RD3 was reported to have twice the molar activity of the monomeric isoforms RD1 and RD2 (23Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and anywhere from 1.5 to six times the activity of the recombinant N-terminal domain alone depending on the concentration tested (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biosynthetic trimers and tetramers of type III AFP show a further modest increase in activity (25Nishimiya Y. Ohgiya S. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32307-32312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the basis for the increased activity of a recombinant type III AFP dimer modeled on the RD3 isoform. The dimer was made using two identical copies of the Macrozoarces americanus HPLC-12 isoform derivative (Swiss Protein ID P19614). Currently, this is the best characterized type III AFP isoform. Its 1.15-Å x-ray structure has been solved independently by two groups (9Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. Caves L.S. Verma C.S. Buckley S.L. Lillford P.J. Hubbard R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a high precision NMR structure is available (10Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 4: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and its ice-binding site has been defined by site-directed mutagenesis (11Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 15DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2346-2355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Baardsnes J. Davies P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As a result of these findings, the activities of numerous mutants and derivatives have been determined as a function of protein concentration. The intramolecular dimer was made by connecting two monomers in a tandem, head-to-tail arrangement by an RD3-type linker sequence. This construct was termed wlwAFP, for wild type-linker-wild type AFP, and its activity was compared with that of the HPLC-12 monomer. Fusions of AFPs with non-antifreeze proteins can enhance activity simply through an increase in size (26DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To quantify this effect, one of the ice-binding sites in the dimer was eliminated by the triple mutation N14S/T18N/Q44T (16Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to produce wlxAFP. Thus, a comparison between wlwAFP and the dimer with one ice-binding site knocked out (wlxAFP) could determine how much of the increased activity of the dimer is because of an increase in the overall size of the protein and how much is because of doubling of the area of the ice-binding surface. Finally, to determine whether enhancement in activity results from increasing the number of ice-binding sites, irrespective of the orientation of these faces relative to a planar ice surface, an intermolecular homodimer (wsswAFP) was created through the formation of a disulfide bond between C-terminal Cys residues of an A65C variant. On the basis of modeling, the ice-binding faces of this tail-to-tail dimer are sterically inhibited from simultaneously interacting with the same ice surface. When the two AFPs were joined in tandem by the 9-amino acid RD3 linker sequence (wlwAFP), their antifreeze activity was twice that of the type III monomer. However, when the two AFPs were joined tail-to-tail by the C-terminal disulfide bond their AFP activity was only 1.2-fold higher than the monomer (wsswAFP). The main difference between these dimers is that the tail-to-head version can potentially engage both ice-binding sites to the same ice surface, whereas in the tail-to-tail dimer the two sites cannot simultaneously dock to a single plane ice. When one of the ice-binding sites of the tail-to-head dimer was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis (wlxAFP), the net antifreeze activity also decreased to 1.2-fold that of the monomer. Thus, the higher activity of the head-to-tail dimer is attributable in part to its increased size but is mainly because of the flexible linker allowing a doubling of the protein surface in contact with ice. Construction of Head-to-Tail Dimers wlwAFP and wlxAFP—Clone pT7-7f rQAE contains the synthetic gene for the N-terminally modified HPLC-12 isoform of type III AFP (27Chao H. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1411-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Its modification is the replacement of the signal sequence with an N-terminal methionine residue for expression in Escherichia coli. To construct wlwAFP (Fig. 1), pT7-7f rQAE was digested with BglII and BstEII to release the insert from upstream of the T7 promoter (BglII site) to the 3′-end of the antifreeze gene (BstEII site). The BglII/BstEII fragment was used to encode the N-terminal domain of the recombinant dimer. Clone pT7-7f m1.1, which encodes a C-terminal modification of rQAE (rQAEm1.1) where the YPPA C-terminal sequence is replaced by YAA (27Chao H. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1411-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was digested with BglII and NdeI to remove the upstream promoter region. The linker sequence was constructed from complementary oligonucleotides and had compatible BstEII and NdeI sites at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively (Fig. 1). Approximately 50 ng each of the BglII/BstEI gene insert and the NdeI/BglII gene + vector sequence and 75 pmol of annealed linker were ligated overnight using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The ligated products were transformed into E. coli JM-83, and positive clones were selected based on the appearance of a 500-bp NdeI/PstI digestion fragment, indicating a successful triple ligation. Positive clones encoding wlwAFP were verified by DNA sequencing (Cortec, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). To make wlxAFP, the same procedure was followed using an inactive triple mutant (N14S/T18N/Q44T) of the rQAEm1.1 gene (16Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to supply the NdeI/BglII gene + vector fragment. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Dimers—Recombinant intramolecular dimers were expressed and purified following protocols used for the monomers (16Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with a few minor changes. To limit proteolysis within the flexible linker region, the protein was refolded for 2 h in an ice bath with the inclusion of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 mm EDTA to both the refolding and dialysis buffers. The protein was purified using S-Sepharose FPLC with an increasing NaCl concentration gradient in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.7). The FPLC-pure protein was dialyzed with 10 mm NH4HCO3 and subsequently lyophilized. The purified protein was resuspended in H2O, and concentrations were verified by amino acid analysis (Alberta Peptide Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Samples were prepared for thermal hysteresis measurements in 100 mm NH4HCO3. Generation of the wsswAFP Intermolecular Dimer—The A65C mutant of rQAEm1.1 was constructed by primer-directed mutagenesis (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using the sequence 5′-TAAAGGTTACGCTTGTTAAGAATTCGGAT-3′ as described previously (27Chao H. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1411-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed and purified from E. coli inclusion bodies following standard protocols except for the addition of 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol to the 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.7) used as the refolding, dialysis and FPLC buffers. This allowed the protein to remain monomeric and prevented irreversible aggregation of the protein with the cell lysate. The FPLC-purified A65C was dialyzed into 5 mm NH4HCO3 at 4 °C and lyophilized. Approximately 5 mg of AFP was resuspended into 0.5 ml oxidization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl (pH 8.0)) in a 1-ml Eppendorf tube and incubated at 4 °C for 48 h. No other cysteine residues are present in the AFP; therefore alternate inter- or intramolecular disulfides cannot be formed. After 2 days in the oxidizing buffer, disulfide-linked A65C (wsswAFP) was separated from monomer by C18 semi-preparative HPLC (Vydac, Inc.). Samples were loaded at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min onto the column pre-equilibrated in 35% acetonitrile:isopropanol (2:1) containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted by a linear acetonitrile:isopropanol (2:1) gradient of 1%/min. The peak containing wsswAFP was identified by 10% SDS-PAGE run in the absence of reducing agents, with standard type III monomer and broad range molecular weight marker (New England Biolabs, Inc.) as standards. Protein samples (∼1-5 μg) were reacted with 5 μl of 2.5 m iodoacetate (pH 8.0) to alkylate free cysteinyl residues. Samples were mixed with 5 μl sample loading dye without β-mercaptoethanol to retain the integrity of the disulfide bonds. Protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The HPLC-purified dimer was lyophilized and resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 3.7). The exact concentration of purified dimer was determined by amino acid analysis (Alberta Peptide Institute). Reduction of Intermolecular Dimer—Reduction of the disulfide-linked dimer by dithiothreitol (DTT) was done in situ to accurately assess the antifreeze activity of the disulfide-linked dimer compared with reduced monomer from the same stock sample. Stock wsswAFP solutions were adjusted to 200 mm NH4HCO3 with (reduced) or without (oxidized) 50 mm DTT. Reduction was achieved at 4 °C overnight. The oxidized and reduced wsswAFP samples were assayed for thermal hysteresis activity, and their integrity was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Thermal Hysteresis Assays and Ice Morphology Determination—Thermal hysteresis is defined as the temperature difference (°C) between the melting point and non-equilibrium freezing point of an AFP solution. Mutant and wild type AFPs were assayed for thermal hysteresis activity as described previously (29Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ice crystals were observed using a Leitz 22 microscope, and ice gap growth of more than 0.2 μm/s signifies that the solution freezing point has been reached or exceeded. Molecular Modeling of wlwAFP and wsswAFP—The initial wlwAFP model was constructed by submitting the entire sequence to Swiss-MODEL (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) using the RD3 NMR structure (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1C8A) as a template. Compared with RD3, wlwAFP has an additional amino acid (Ala) at the C-terminal end of the dimer linker and four residues (MNQA) at the N terminus of the second AFP of the dimer. (Fig. 1). This segment generated an unrealistic loop in the Swiss-MODEL structure. However, PredictProtein (Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Columbia University) predicted a small α-helix within this region. Therefore, the Swiss-MODEL structure was manually refined using SYBYL (version 6.5, Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) to include this potential helical structure. The structure was then minimized (<0.05 kcal/mol gradient terminated) using a Tripos force field, Gasteiger/Marsilli charges, and distant dependent dielectric. Side chain conformations were verified using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The wsswAFP model was constructed using the molecular modeling software SYBYL, by replacing Ala65 to Cys in two type III AFP models (Protein Data Bank code 1MSI) and then creating a disulfide bond between them using the Biopolymer module. Rotational freedom about the disulfide bond of the new dimer was explored by using a short SYBYL Programming Language (SPL) script, which systematically performed every torsion angle combination at 10° increments about the central disulfide bond and the two adjacent sulfur-carbon bonds. Each combination was minimized briefly (250 iterations, Tripos force field, Gasteiger/Marsilli charges, distant dielectric constant), and final energy values were recorded. The ice-binding faces of the 120 most energetically favorable conformations were superimposed to indicate the possible orientations of the two ice-binding faces with respect to one another (Fig. 2C). wlwAFP Is Twice as Active as Monomeric Type III AFP—The recombinant dimers that were overexpressed in E. coli predominantly partitioned to the insoluble cell pellet (not shown). The refolded dimer proteins from this fraction eluted from ion-exchange FPLC as sharp peaks at the same NaCl concentration as the monomer (27Chao H. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1411-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the pI values for wlwAFP/wlxAFP and the AFP monomer being so similar (6.1 and 6.0, respectively). SDS-PAGE showed that the purified dimers had the expected 14-kDa mass (not shown). Thermal hysteresis activity for wlwAFP was 0.53 °C at 0.07 mm compared with 0.26 °C for the monomer (Fig. 3). Across the concentration range of 0 to 0.20 mm, the wlwAFP dimer gave a 2-fold enhancement in activity compared with the monomer. This augmentation is in close agreement with the original findings of Wang et al. (23Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), where the native RD3 isoform at 0.7 mm increased activity by ∼1.8-fold on a molar basis compared with the RD1 and RD2 monomer isoforms. This level of enhancement was also reported by Miura et al. (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for recombinant RD3 at a concentration of 0.5 mm when compared with the novel RD3-N1 monomer. In the wlxAFP dimer, the ice-binding site in the C-terminal domain has been eliminated by the triple mutation N14S/T18N/Q44T. This loss of one of the two ice-binding sites consistently reduced the activity of the dimer by ∼40% compared with wlwAFP across the concentration range studied (0 to 0.20 mm) (Fig. 3). However, the wlxAFP dimer levels of activity were still higher than the monomer. The small but constant 20% increase in activity of wlxAFP compared with monomer is consistent with data previously reported by DeLuca et al. (26DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), where increasing the size of type III AFP by fusion to other proteins increased its AFP activity (Fig. 4). Fusion proteins of 50 kDa (type III AFP with a maltose-binding protein fusion), and 20 kDa (type III AFP with a thioredoxin fusion) generated thermal hysteresis activity values of 0.60 and 0.36 °C, respectively, at 0.07 mm. The wlxAFP, at 14 kDa, follows this trend with a thermal hysteresis value of 0.31 °C at 0.07 mm. The activity curve of this protein falls between the type III monomer and 20-kDa thioredoxin-AFP fusion protein across the concentration range tested (0 to 0.25 mm). Tail-to-Tail Disulfide-linked Dimer—During separation of the disulfide-bonded dimer of A65C (wsswAFP) from the monomer on C18 semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC, two sharp peaks of approximately equal area eluted with retention times of 35 and 40 min (Fig. 5). The proteins in the first and second peaks were identified using nonreducing SDS-PAGE as the monomer and dimer, respectively. There was no cross-contamination of the peaks nor any change in disulfide bonding after peak separation. The order of elution by HPLC was as expected, with the larger dimer protein binding more tightly to the C18 column. Based on the area of the HPLC peaks, ∼50% of the starting material (2.5 mg) formed a dimer. A portion of the purified wsswAFP was reduced by the addition of DTT. The complete reduction of the newly formed disulfide bond was possible when an alkaline pH was maintained with NH4HCO3 (data not shown). This allowed parallel analyses of the same sample in both the monomer and dimer states with absolute confidence in the relative protein concentrations (Fig. 6). After reduction, the molar concentration of the reduced A65C monomer was exactly twice that of the starting wsswAFP. Thermal hysteresis activity measurements showed that the oxidized wsswAFP dimer had 20% more activity than the reduced A65C monomer at protein concentrations of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.2 mm (Fig. 7). This activity augmentation is much less than that seen with the wlwAFP head-to-tail dimer but is similar to the activity enhancement seen for the wlxAFP dimer with one inactive ice-binding surface.Fig. 7Thermal hysteresis activity of wsswAFP. Thermal hysteresis activity curves of A65C + DTT (squares) and wsswAFP -DTT (circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Conformation of the wsswAFP Dimer—In the absence of a structure for the wsswAFP, the relative orientation of the two ice-binding sites was established by modeling. Both AFP domains were systematically rotated by 10° increments around the disulfide bond and adjoining carbon-sulfur bonds followed by energy minimization at each interval. This allowed for a large sampling of the total possible conformers that could be adopted by the two AFP domains about the disulfide bond. The central Ala16 residues of each ice-binding face are placed nearly 40 Å apart in the most energetically favorable dimer structure (shown in blue in Fig. 2C). The superimposed trace of the 120 most energetically favorable conformations reveals that both ice-binding faces will occupy opposite surfaces of the dimer and are incapable of simultaneously engaging the same ice surface. Activity of wlwAFP Is Analogous to That of RD3—The recombinant dimer wlwAFP shows an approximately 2-fold increase in antifreeze activity as compared with the monomer. This activity increase is equivalent to the value for the natural dimer reported by Wang et al. (23Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and is within the range of values determined by Miura et al. (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for recombinantly produced RD3. By confirming this enhancement using a de novo designed dimer made from identical monomers that are structurally and functionally well characterized, we show that this property is not a peculiarity of RD3. It can be reconstituted using AFPs that differ slightly in sequence from the AFPs present in the RD3 dimer. The doubling of antifreeze activity for a protein of the same molarity has potential applications in biotechnology (31Griffith M. Ewart K.V. Biotechnol. Adv. 1995; 13: 375-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Zachariassen K.E. Lundheim R. Margesin R. Schinner F. Biotechnological Applications of Cold-adapted Organisms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 319-332Crossref Google Scholar) and is of mechanistic interest. We have considered and investigated several explanations for this phenomenon. Specifically we have examined the effects of the size number of ice-binding sites and the total area of ice-binding site in contact with ice. Activity Enhancement of wlxAFP Is Based on Size—As predicted by previous observations (26DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), there was a small gain in activity for the recombinant dimer containing an inactive domain (wlxAFP). Inactivation of the second domain was based on the type III rQAEm1.1 variant, N14S/T18N/Q44T, which was shown previously to be completely inactive from 0 to 0.7 mm (16Chao H. Sonnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1760-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 20% gain in activity could not be attributed to antifreeze activity in the C-terminal domain. This activity increase does, however, fit well with the data showing enhanced activity based on size increases using N-terminal fusion proteins (26DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fact that the inactive partner in the wlxAFP fusion is on the C-terminal side does not seem to affect the result. The wlxAFP activity curve fits between the activity curves of the monomer (7 kDa) and thioredoxin fusion (20 kDa). Indeed, there is such a good correlation between fusion protein mass and activity that it is possible to confirm the mass of wlxAFP by interpolation of the data from the activity curves of the monomer and the 20- and 50-kDa fusion proteins. Overall, it is clear that only a small component (∼20%) of the dimer activity is due to the increased size of the AFP. Two Ice-binding Sites Are Not Necessarily Better than One—We considered the possibility that the enhanced activity of the type III AFP dimers might be due in part to two ice-binding sites increasing the probability of binding to ice. The A65C intermolecular dimer was constructed to place the two ice-binding sites at opposite ends of the protein. The cysteine residue is at the C terminus of the monomer, and an intermolecular disulfide bond should form a dimer that is constrained from having both AFP domains simultaneously engage the ice surface. Molecular modeling confirmed that none of the energetically favorable structures would allow simultaneous engagement of both sites to a flat ice surface. The 20% increase in activity of the A65C dimer is comparable with that obtained with wlxAFP and can be accounted for by the increase in size of the AFP. The A65C dimer essentially serves as a fusion protein, and there is no advantage to the extra ice-binding site if it cannot be bound simultaneously to ice. It is important to note that reduction of the disulfide bond allowed for a built-in internal control between the monomer and dimer concentrations. This is especially important at low AFP concentrations where small changes in concentration have a large effect on antifreeze activity, and accurate concentrations are essential for a meaningful comparison between AFP molecules with similar activity. Ice-binding Site Area Is the Key to Increased Antifreeze Activity—The wlwAFP dimer has the same mass and number of ice-binding sites as the A65C dimer, wsswAFP, but is considerably more active. The critical difference is the head-to-tail arrangement of the two domains and their flexible linker, which permits the two AFPs to bind the ice surface simultaneously. On the basis of the solution structure of RD3, Miura et al. (24Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) determined that only a small fraction of the total RD3 conformers would be oriented to engage both ice-binding sites simultaneously to the {1 0-1 0} primary prism plane ice surface. This is based on the observation that only one of the NMR solution structures is correctly aligned to accomplish this. However, Antson et al. (9Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. Caves L.S. Verma C.S. Buckley S.L. Lillford P.J. Hubbard R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have recently reported that type III AFP can bind to a set of similar crystallographic planes. This includes secondary prism planes ({2-1-1 0}) and primary pyramidal planes ({2 0-2 1}) in addition to the primary prism plane. Therefore, a larger array of potential ice-binding sites exists for RD3 than previously identified, and this will increase the number of active AFP conformations in solution. The second ice-binding face will not be required to bind to the exact same ice plane as the first, allowing for greater flexibility in ice-binding site selection. Verification of the modeled wlwAFP structure using PROCHECK revealed that both ice-binding faces of the derived structure have the potential to engage a flat ice surface simultaneously while satisfying all geometric constraints. AFP Activity as a Function of Ice-binding Site Area—There is increasing evidence now that antifreeze activity can be enhanced by increasing the length/area of the ice-binding site. The type I AFP9 isoform from winter flounder serum at 52 amino acids in length (4.3 kDa) has an extra 11-amino acid repeat compared with the common serum isoforms HPLC-6 and -8 and therefore has a larger ice-binding face (33Baardsnes J. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. Chao H. Kay C. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It demonstrates higher antifreeze activity, almost twice that of the more commonly studied 37-amino acid HPLC-6 isoform (3.3 kDa) (34Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The same trend is also observed with antifreeze glycoproteins from Antarctic cod (35DeVries A.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1982; 73: 627-640Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These glycoproteins comprise Ala-Ala-Thr repeating units with an O-linked disaccharide on the Thr residue. On a weight basis, AFGP-5, with a molecular weight of 10,500, has approximately twice the activity of AFGP-7 and -8, both of which have an approximate molecular weight of 3000. Another example of increasing antifreeze activity with increasing ice-binding site area is the spruce budworm AFP. A 12-kDa isoform (501) with two additional coils of β-helix is more than twice as active as the shorter 9-kDa isoform (36Leinala E.K. Davies P.L. Doucet D. Tyshenko M.G. Walker V.K. Jia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33349-33352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As the disulfide-bonded A65C dimer has demonstrated, there is little activity gained from simple dimerization of the AFP domains. Maximal increase in activity requires the ability to increase contact with the ice surface. Because type I AFPs, AFGPs, and spruce budworm AFP are highly repetitive linear proteins, simply lengthening the protein will increase the size of the ice-binding face contacting the ice surface. However, because the type III AFPs are globular proteins with a well defined ice-binding face, the surface area cannot be increased simply by increasing the size of the monomer. Dimerization via the flexible linker is an efficient way to accomplish this task. As mentioned previously, antifreeze proteins are thought to bind to the ice surface, forcing the ice to grow into a convex surface between bound AFPs. The enhancement seen with fusion proteins is thought to be due to the larger protein reducing the radius between bound molecules, which in turn makes it more difficult for water to join the ice lattice (26DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By the same token, AFPs with larger ice-binding sites (i.e. a larger “footprint” on the ice) will decrease the area between bound proteins, thereby reducing the radius of the curved ice fronts. Recombinant dimers based on the type III RD3 isoform have shown that activity enhancement arises primarily from an increase in the size of the ice-binding surface in contact with ice, with just a small component attributed to the increase in the size of the protein. Amino acid analysis was performed by the Alberta Peptide Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton."

In addition to recycling between a naïve, chaperone-associated cytoplasmic complex and a liganded chaperone-free nuclear form, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been observed to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear export of GR and other nuclear receptors has been proposed to depend on direct interactions with calreticulin, which is predominantly localized to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We show that rapid calreticulin-mediated nuclear export of GR is a specific response to transient disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum that occurs during polyethylene glycol-mediated cell fusion. Using live and digitonin-permeabilized cells we demonstrate that, in the absence of cell fusion, GR nuclear export occurs slowly over a period of many hours independent of direct interaction with calreticulin. Our findings temper expectations that nuclear receptors respond rapidly and directly to cytoplasmic signals in the absence of additional regulatory control. These results highlight the importance of verifying findings of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking using techniques in addition to heterokaryon cell fusion.

These results highlight the importance of verifying findings of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking using techniques in addition to heterokaryon cell fusion. Nuclear hormone receptors are dynamic transcription factors that move rapidly through the nucleus and that, based on the results of heterokaryon fusion assays, are believed to shuttle or exchange rapidly between nucleus and cytoplasm. Shuttling offers the potential for rapid modulation of receptor function in response to cytoplasmic signaling pathways. Nuclear receptors are imported into the nucleus through the karyopherinα/β pathway (1Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J.

Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The naïve glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a cytoplasmic protein, which is held in a chaperone complex anchored by hsp90 and containing hsp70, immunophilins, and other factors, including p23, where it is poised to bind ligand (6Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the chaperone complex is dissociated, and the receptor moves rapidly to the nucleus to regulate specific gene transcription (7McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, the receptor becomes localized to specific sites but exchanges very rapidly with chromatin and remains highly mobile (8McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Ligand binding and transcriptional regulation are transient events, with molecular chaperones also being involved in the disassembly of regulatory complexes (9Freeman B.C. Felts S.J. Toft D.O.

Heterokaryon fusion assays have indicated that, while localized to the nucleus, nuclear receptors, including liganded GR, traffic continuously and transiently to the cytoplasm (11Guiochon-Mantel A.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11237-11245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Upon withdrawal of steroid, shuttling continues for GR as the receptor reassembles into chaperone complexes and slowly reaccumulates in the cytoplasm over a period of several hours (17DeFranco D.B.

Depending on the cell type, the time required for reaccumulation of GR in the cytoplasm following steroid withdrawal varies from 6 to 24 h. By contrast, we have reported that treatment of cells with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 results in a receptor that appears to remain permanently localized to the nucleus upon the withdrawal of treatment despite continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, suggesting differential effects of agonists and antagonists on GR that communicate differences in localization subsequent to loss of ligand (15Haché R.J. Tse R. Reich T. Savory J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1432-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). How rapid shuttling of GR is reconciled with slow redistribution to the cytoplasm remains to be determined. CRT has been identified as a repressor of transcriptional activation by GR and other nuclear receptors (20Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M.

It has been shown in vitro and in transient heterokaryon fusion assays that nuclear export of these nuclear receptors is mediated through direct contact between CRT and the receptor DNA binding domain (DBD) through a region of the DBD that includes the DNA recognition helix (3Holaska J.M.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1749-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, the redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm following steroid withdrawal is compromised in CRT-deficient cells (3Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptor binding and the stimulation of nuclear export by CRT appear to be dependent on calcium binding (23Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Rastinejad F. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6286-6297Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear given the localization of CRT to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), how CRT accesses the receptor in vivo One explanation proposed is that there may be sufficient CRT normally present in the cytoplasm to allow for a role in nuclear export (3Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24Holaska J.M. Paschal B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14739-14744Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined, in a series of assays in live cells, that the transfer of GR across the nuclear membrane to the cytoplasm occurs only very slowly in native cells through a process that is independent of direct binding to CRT. By contrast CRT-mediated GR nuclear export is an inducible pathway for the rapid transfer of GR to the cytoplasm that is transiently activated during polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated cell fusion. These results change our understanding of the accessibility of nuclear hormone receptors to cytoplasmic signaling molecules. Additionally, our results provide an important caution for all reports of rapid nuclear export independent of the CRM1 pathway relying on heterokaryon fusions and suggest that CRT-mediated nuclear export is a specific response to breaches in the integrity of the ER.

Similarly, pGFPGRNL1-/F463,4A was cloned using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit using the pGFP-GRNL1- construct (2Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) as a template. Mutations were confirmed by restriction digest and sequencing. pRevGR was derived from pRevΔ NES (25Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length GR coding sequence was PCR-amplified with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using primers encoding BglII and XbaI restriction sites and inserted into pRevΔ NES to produce pRevGR. Sequencing of the N-terminal junction was performed to verify that the GR cDNA was cloned in the correct reading frame. Western blotting using the GR MAI-510 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) was performed to verify that the expression product was of the correct size. Transcriptional activity of the pRevGR expression construct in 293T cells was verified using the pMMTVCAT reporter. FRAP and Quantification of Subcellular Distribution—COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and non-essential amino acids. Cells were seeded onto 40-mm round coverslips (Bioptechs) and transfected with 1 μg of the indicated expression construct using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen). Following overnight incubation in Opti-MEM™ reduced serum media (Invitrogen) the transfection was stopped by addition of charcoal-stripped serum. Cells were cultured in complete serum for 8 h and then in serum-free medium for 16 h prior to treatment. 20 μg/μl cycloheximide was then added 1 h prior to FRAP. For FRAP experiments, treatment with ligand at 1 μm or leptomycin B at 10 nm was initiated 1 h prior analysis. Steroid withdrawal was performed as previously described (2Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Coverslips were visualized on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope in a Bioptechs FCS2 environmental chamber maintained at 37 °C. Nuclei were photobleached by using 5–10 rapid laser pulses at full power. Each experiment included a minimum of three independent trials performed over several months with each involving 10–50 individual repetitions of FRAP. Recovery of the fluorescent signal within the bleached nucleus was quantified using the LaserSharp software package (Bio-Rad). The average pixel intensity within both nuclei was quantified and corrected for background fluorescence. Signal recovery in the bleached nucleus was calculated by expressing the fluorescent signal within the bleached nucleus as a percentage of the total fluorescent signal within both nuclei. For direct analysis of subcellular distribution, COS7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ as described for FRAP experiments. Following transfection cells were cultured in complete serum overnight and then seeded onto 22-mm square coverslips. Cells were allowed to attach for 8 h and then withdrawn from serum for 16 h. Cells were treated with ligand at 1 μm for the indicated time period, and the ligand was then removed for the specified time period. Following ligand withdrawal, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C followed by incubation with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine for 10 min at 20 °C. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides, overlaid with 50% glycerol in PBS, and sealed with nail polish. Cells were visualized on a Nikon TE300 microscope and were scored into five categories ranging from exclusively nuclear (N) to exclusively cytoplasmic (C) as previously described (2Savory J.G. Hsu B.

Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using double-blind encryption with individual data points derived from a minimum of 1000 cells quantified over four independent experiments performed in duplicate. HIV Rev Complementation Assay—Analysis of HIV Rev cotransport of CAT encoding RNA in 293T cells was performed as described by Johnson et al. (25Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected by calcium phosphate with 1 μg of the indicated RevΔ NES fusion constructs (IκB NES, HIV Rex NES, and GR), 200 ng of pRSV β-galactosidase and 200 ng of the pDM128 CAT reporter. Cells were treated with 1 μm dexamethasone as indicated for 24 h. CAT activity was measured by liquid scintillation counting (29Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity to account for potential variations in transfection efficiency. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of a minimum of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Digitonin Permeabilization Export Assay—Digitonin permeabilization was performed essentially as described by Groulx et al. (30Groulx I. Bonicalzi M.E. Lee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8991-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE™ for 16 h with the indicated expression constructs as for FRAP assay. The cells were maintained in complete media for a further 24 h and then treated with 1 μm cortisol. The cells were then rinsed three times in ice-cold transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 5 mm NaOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin). Digitonin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were then rinsed three times in transport buffer, incubating 5 min at 4 °C between each wash. HeLa cell lysate containing 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm GTP was then added to each plate. Cells were placed at 20 °C, and export was monitored on a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope equipped with an Empix digital charge-coupled device camera using Northern Eclipse software. Homokaryon Cell Fusion—COS7 cells were separately transfected with the dsRed-C1 expression construct or the indicated GFP constructs. Following transfection, cells were cultured in complete serum overnight and harvested by trypsinization. Cells expressing dsRed-C1 were mixed 1:1 with cells expressing the indicated GFP construct and seeded onto 40-mm round coverslips at high density. Cells were allowed to attach for 8 h and then withdrawn from serum for 16 h. Cell fusion was initiated by incubation with 50% w/v PEG-4000 in Ca2+/Mg2+ free Hanks' balanced salt solution for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed five times in Ca2+/Mg2+ free Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated at 37 °C with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h. The coverslips were then placed in a Bioptechs FCS2 environmental chamber maintained at 37 °C, and the cells were visualized on a Nikon TE300 microscope. Live cell images were obtained using an Orca ER camera (Hamamatsu) and SimplePCI software (Compix). Analysis of Calreticulin and Calnexin Exposure—Selective permeabilization experiments were performed using a modification of the protocol of Du et al. (31Du X. Stoops J.D. Mertz J.R. Stanley C.M. Dixon J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 585-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 22-mm square coverslips, treated as described, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by incubation with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine for 10 min at 20 °C. Permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.5% in PBS) was for 30 min at 20 °C. For streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization, cells were incubated with 250 units/ml SLO in BBII buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 75 mm KOAc) for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed once in cold BBII to remove unbound SLO and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following permeabilization, cells were pre-blocked with 5% IgG-free bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 20 °C. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies to calreticulin (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or calnexin (H-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) diluted 1/150 in PBS containing 5% IgG-free bovine serum albumin. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated at 20 °C for 45 min with rhodamine red X-conjugated donkey-anti-goat antibody (1/150, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were washed three times in PBS and then mounted on microscope slides. Images were recorded with an Orca ER camera (Hamamatsu) on a Nikon TE300 microscope using SimplePCI software (Compix). For each primary antibody the optimal exposure time required to record an image following Triton X-100 permeabilization was determined. This exposure time was used to gather all subsequent images within that repetition. Liganded GR Is Statically Localized to the Nucleus in Live and Digitonin-permeabilized Cells—To examine the mechanism for nuclear export of GR in situ we developed a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay that takes advantage of the significant proportion of cells in many established mammalian tissue culture cell lines that are stably maintained in a multinucleated state (Fig. 1). As demonstrated by examination of the trafficking of a series of synthetic control proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), nucleocytoplasmic protein shuttling in this assay is reflected by the rapid reappearance of fluorescence in the photobleached nucleus of a multinucleated cell (Fig. 1A). Thus for a GSTGFP fusion protein with an SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and an HIV Rev nuclear export sequence (NES) that mediates nuclear export by the CRM1 pathway (32Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), recovery of fluorescence in photobleached nuclei of multinucleated COS7 cells occurred within 10 min. This recovery was prevented by the CRM1-inhibitor leptomycin B and was dependent on the Rev NES. Similar results were obtained in other cell lines including HeLa cells (data not shown). By contrast, we were unable to detect rapid nucleocytoplasmic exchange of GR in this assay (Fig. 1B). In the presence of cortisol or the steroid antagonist RU486, modest movement of GFPGR between nuclei was observed, with less than 20% transfer of fluorescent GFPGR detected 4 h after the initial ablation of signal from the acceptor nucleus. Steroid withdrawal also failed to stimulate rapid nuclear export, initiating only a slow redistribution of the receptor to the cytoplasm. Again we obtained the same results in HeLa cells (data not shown), emphasizing that the rate of GR export was not cell type-dependent. Although a contrast to the rapid nuclear export of GR observed previously in heterokaryon fusion assays, the slow rate of GR export obtained by FRAP closely matched the export rates for GR obtained previously in indirect immunofluorescence assays (2Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 3Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A.

The inclusion of cycloheximide and controls demonstrating that GFP fluorescence was not recovered following photobleaching of mononucleated cells, verified the significance of the slow transfer of GR observed with FRAP. The observation of similar slow movement of GR between nuclei in the absence of cycloheximide excluded nonspecific effects resultant from the inhibition of protein synthesis (data not shown). Receptor movement was also unaffected by the level of GFPGR expression or the positioning of the GFP at the N or C terminus of GR. Furthermore, a GFP-mineralocorticoid receptor fusion protein exhibited similarly restricted movement (data not shown). Although GFPGR transferred only very slowly between nuclei, directed ablation of fluorescence from a small portion of the nucleus in fluorescence loss in photobleaching experiments (FLIP) confirmed that GFPGR was highly mobile within the nucleus (Fig. 1C) (8McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FLIP of the GFP signal within one nucleus of a multinucleated cell also failed to induce a reduction of the GFPGR signal from the second nucleus (Fig. 1C, middle row). The slow rate of nuclear export observed for GR in FRAP was confirmed in a HIV Rev-RNA cotransport assay (Fig. 2A). In this assay, which reports the rapid nuclear export of proteins in live cells, CAT activity is detected when the nuclear export of an HIV RevΔNES fusion protein·RNA complex mediates the export of an unspliced RNA message containing the CAT coding sequence (33Kim F.J. Beeche A.A. Hunter J.J. Chin D.J. Hope T.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5147-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this instance, the rapid nuclear export of the RevΔNES·RNA complex directed by the IκB or HIV Rex CRM1-dependent NESs occurred rapidly prior to RNA splicing as reflected by strong CAT activity. By contrast, a RevΔNES-GR fusion protein failed to induce CAT activity in the same assay (Fig. 2A), even though the RevΔNES-GR fusion protein was expressed at levels comparable to the control Rev fusion proteins and was transcriptionally active in response to steroid (data not shown). In a third assay (Fig. 2B), digitonin treatment to permeabilize cell membranes allows for observation of the rapid export of proteins from nuclei incubated with cytosolic extracts by allowing for nuclear export in the absence of re-import (30Groulx I. Bonicalzi M.E. Lee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8991-9000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Yang J. Liu J. DeFranco D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 523-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus fluorescence from a control protein containing pyruvate kinase fused to the HIV Rev NES is lost to the cytosolic extract within 5 min of treatment in a manner that is blocked by leptomycin B treatment. By contrast, GFPGR again failed to export from the nucleus, remaining nuclear over at least 45 min, in agreement with previous observations by Yang et al. (34Yang J. Liu J. DeFranco D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 523-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rapid Nucleocytoplasmic Exchange of GR Is Induced through Transient Exposure of CRT following Cell Fusion—To ensure that the difference between our results and previous reports of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of GR was not due to our reagents or the nature of the systems employed in the other studies, we assessed the nuclear export of GR in a homokaryon fusion assay in which COS7 cells expressing dsRed were fused using polyethylene glycol (PEG) with cells expressing nuclear GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 3). Nuclear export of GSTGFP, marked by the rapid transfer (t½ < 30 min) of green fluorescence to a red fluorescent nucleus was again observed to be dependent on the HIV Rev NES. However, in this instance we also observed accelerated nuclear export of liganded GFPGR, with receptor transfer between heterokaryon nuclei also occurring with of t1/2 of less than 30 min in over 80% of the cells examined. One possibility suggested by these findings was that PEG mediated cell fusion affected the endoplasmic reticulum in a way that promoted the mobilization of CRT for nuclear export. To begin to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of mutations in GR (F463, 464A) that abrogate CRT-GR binding and CRT-dependent transport of GR (4Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Rastinejad F.

Ubiquitination is mediated by the concerted action of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubcs or E2s) and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). In the present study we have examined the enzymology of ubiquitination of endogenous InsP3Rs in muscarinic agonist-stimulated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, focusing our attention on two mammalian E2s, MmUbc6 and MmUbc7, that have been implicated in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and are homologous to the yeast ERAD E2s, Ubc6p and Ubc7p. Analysis of SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing these enzymes and their dominant-negative mutants revealed that MmUbc7 mediates InsP3R ubiquitination and down-regulation, but that MmUbc6 does not. These data indicate that InsP3Rs are processed by a component of the ERAD pathway and suggest that MmUbc7 may be employed selectively to ubiquitinate proteins, like InsP3Rs, that are subject to regulated ERAD. Additional studies showed that the Zn2+ chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine blocked InsP3R ubiquitination, suggesting that a RING finger domain-containing E3 is also involved in this process. Finally, muscarinic agonist-induced InsP3R ubiquitination was seen in rat brain slices, indicating that the results obtained from SH-SY5Y cells reflect a physiological process.

Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), the substrate destined for destruction is covalently modified by the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain in a multistep process. First, in an ATP-dependent reaction, ubiquitin is covalently bound to a cysteine residue of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, via a thiol-ester bond. Next, ubiquitin is transferred to the “active site” cysteine residue of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2), again employing a thiol-ester bond. The Ubc then conjugates ubiquitin to a lysine residue of either the substrate or a previously linked ubiquitin moiety via an isopeptide bond, forming a polyubiquitin chain. The specific recognition of substrates to be degraded as well as the transfer of ubiquitin from Ubc to substrate is facilitated by a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), of which there are three major families. The HECT ligases (HECT-E3s), which contain a domain homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus, form an intermediate thiol-ester bond with ubiquitin (17Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). In contrast, the RING ligases (RING-E3s), whose activity is dependent upon a Zn2+-binding RING finger domain (17Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 18Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), appear to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin directly from Ubc to substrate. Finally, the 20 S core of the 26 S proteasome complex degrades the substrate after recognition of the polyubiquitin chain by the 19 S cap structure (17Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). InsP3Rs are the only mammalian ER proteins for which ubiquitin/proteasome pathway-mediated degradation induced by cell-surface receptor activation has been described. The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, however, is known to mediate the degradation of other substrates in the ER, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the T-cell antigen receptor subunits, TCRα and CD3-δ (17Glickman M.H.

The process by which these substrates are destroyed is known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which is primarily considered to be a “quality control” system that functions to specifically degrade misfolded proteins and unassembled subunits of multimeric complexes (24Jarosch E. Lenk U. Sommer T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 223: 39-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that certain functional, native ER proteins can also be degraded by ERAD, but in a regulated manner, the prototype for this being 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) (26Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12944-12948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies indicate that ubiquitination and degradation of HMGR is initiated by metabolites of the mevalonate pathway (27Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin.

With regard to the Ubcs that mediate ERAD, the enzymes Ubc6p and Ubc7p have often been implicated in this process in yeast, with Ubc7p playing the dominant role in regulated degradation of HMGR (24Jarosch E. Lenk U. Sommer T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2003; 223: 39-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 26Hampton R.Y. Bhakta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, in studies with exogenously expressed substrates in mammalian cells, a mammalian homologue of Ubc6p, hereafter termed mamUbc6, has been implicated in the ERAD of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and TCRα (23Lenk U. Yu H. Walter J. Gelman M.S. Hartmann E. Kopito R.R. Sommer T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3007-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a mammalian homologue of Ubc7p, hereafter termed mamUbc7, has been implicated in the ERAD of TCRα and CD3-δ (22Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). With regard to the endogenous expression of these Ubcs, mamUbc7 is expressed ubiquitously in all human tissues examined, including brain (36Katsanis N. Fisher E.M.C. Genomics. 1998; 51: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and although mamUbc6 distribution has not been studied, a chick homologue of Ubc6p is expressed in all avian tissues, again including brain (37Lester D. Farquharson C. Russell G. Houston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined whether the ERAD-linked Ubcs, mamUbc6 and mamUbc7, mediate GPCR-initiated ubiquitination and down-regulation of endogenous InsP3Rs in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We accomplished this by creating SH-SY5Y cell lines stably expressing murine homologues of Ubc6p and Ubc7p (MmUbc6 and MmUbc7), and their respective “dominant-negative” (DN) mutants, in which the active site cysteine residues have been mutated to serine (22Tiwari S.

Iwai K. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14823-14830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that mamUbc7 mediates InsP3R ubiquitination and down-regulation and thus suggests that some of the same machinery that is responsible for the ERAD of misfolded and misassembled proteins also degrades InsP3Rs. Additionally, we provide evidence for the involvement of a RING-E3 in InsP3R ubiquitination and down-regulation, and demonstrate that muscarinic receptor activation can induce InsP3R ubiquitination in rat cerebral cortex. Plasmids—cDNAs encoding HA-MmUbc6, HA-MmUbc6DN(C94S), myc-MmUbc7, and myc-MmUbc7DN(C89S) (GenBank™ accession nos. AF296656 and AF296657), with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) and the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) tags at the NH2 termini (22Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), were ligated into the EcoR1/SalI sites of the multiple cloning region of the pIRES2-EGFP plasmid (Clontech). The amino acid sequences of the MmUbcs used in this study are each ∼60% identical to yeast Ubc6p and Ubc7p (22Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MmUbc6 is ∼95% identical to its human homologue (22Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and MmUbc7 is 100% identical to its human homologue (accession no. NM_003343). Cell Culture and Transfection—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in monolayers as described (7Zhu C.C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured with 10 mm Hepes, 155 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (HBS-E), and medium was routinely changed every other day. Cells (∼75% confluent) were transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 8 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Cells were then subcultured and grown in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. GFP-expressing colonies were identified by fluorescence microscopy of living cells and selected using sterile cloning cylinders. A second round of clonal selection followed to ensure that each clonal cell line was independently derived from a single transfected cell. Stock cultures were maintained in 250 μg/ml G418, whereas cells to be used in experiments were cultured in the absence of G418. Antibodies—CT1 was produced from a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 19 residues of the rat type I InsP3R and is specific for type I InsP3Rs (5Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Anti-c-myc epitope clone 9E10 (α-myc) and anti-ubiquitin clone Ubi-1 (α-Ub) were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; anti-HA epitope clone HA.11 (α-HA) was from Babco; rabbit polyclonal anti-transaldolase (α-tal) was a kind gift from Drs. Andras Perl and Katalin Banki (39Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); and anti-human p53 clone DO-1 (α-p53) was from Santa Cruz. Cell Fractionation—Cells were harvested in HBS-E, centrifuged at ∼700 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris base, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 (hypotonic buffer) containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Cells were then disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant was collected and represented the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer and represented the membrane fraction. Membrane fraction protein (10 μg) and an equivalent volume of the cytosolic fraction were then electrophoresed and processed in immunoblots. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on 8-chamber glass slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, and then washed three times in PBS. Fixed cells were then incubated in blocking solution (10% goat serum, 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS) containing 0.01% digitonin for 1 h, and then incubated overnight in blocking solution containing primary antibody (α-myc or α-HA) at 4 °C. Next, cells were washed six times in PBS and incubated for 2 h in blocking solution containing rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells were then washed six times, and coverslips were mounted with anti-fade mount (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope using a 60× oil immersion objective. The 568-nm line and the 488-nm line of the krypton/argon laser were used to excite rhodamine and GFP, respectively. Emission was collected between 589 and 621 nm for rhodamine and between 506 and 538 nm for GFP. Preparation of Lysates for Immunoblots—Cells were grown to confluence and were stimulated, harvested in HBS-E, centrifuged (700 × g for 3 min), and lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0 (lysis buffer), for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min), and supernatants were collected, electrophoresed, and processed in immunoblots with CT1, α-HA, α-myc, α-Ub, or α-p53. For ubiquitin thiol-ester analysis, cells were lysed in non-reducing lysis buffer and electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions (in the absence of DTT). InsP3 Receptor Immunoprecipitation and Detection of Ubiquitination—Supernatants obtained from centrifuged lysates were collected, protein concentrations were equalized, and equal volumes of these supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with CT1 and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. Immunoprecipitated InsP3Rs were then electrophoresed and processed in immunoblots, first with α-Ub to assess polyubiquitin content, and then reprobed with CT1 to determine InsP3 receptor levels. When comparing between different clonal cell lines, the amount of polyubiquitin immunoreactivity associated with InsP3Rs was defined as the ratio of α-Ub immunoreactivity to CT1 immunoreactivity (α-Ub/CT1). This accounted for minor differences in InsP3R content between samples. This procedure accurately reflected ubiquitination, because the α-Ub/CT1 ratio remained constant when a range of amounts of ubiquitinated InsP3Rs from untransfected SH-SY5Y cells were analyzed (data not shown). Ubiquitination in Rat Cerebral Cortex—Rat cerebral cortex slices (350 × 350 μm) were prepared and incubated as described (40Challis R.A.J. Mistry R. Gray D.W. Nahorski S.R. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Slices were collected by centrifugation (700 × g for 2 min) and homogenized in lysis buffer, lysates were centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min), and InsP3Rs were immunoprecipitated with CT1, probed in immunoblots with α-Ub, and reprobed with CT1. Measurement of InsP3 Formation and Ca2 + Mobilization—SH-SY5Y cells were grown to confluence, harvested in HBS-E, washed, and resuspended in Krebs-Hepes buffer as described (7Zhu C.C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For InsP3 measurements, triplicate 100-μl aliquots of cell suspensions were incubated without or with carbachol and incubations were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m trichloroacetic acid. InsP3 mass was then determined using a radioreceptor assay as previously described (41Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For [Ca2+] i measurements, cell suspensions were incubated with 10 μm Fura2-AM for 60 min at 37 °C and then excited at 340 and 380 nm, and emission intensity at 510 nm was recorded with a computerized LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). [Ca2+] i was calculated as described (42Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm EGTA as calibrating agents. Materials—Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen; G418 was from CellGro; T4 DNA ligase, EcoRI, and XhoI were from New England Biolabs; peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), carbachol, and atropine were from Sigma; protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Life Sciences; DTT and SDS-PAGE gel supplies were from Bio-Rad; and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was from Alexis. Miscellaneous—Data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. Quantitation of immunoreactivity was accomplished using a GeneGnome Imager and GeneTools software from Syngene. Combined quantitated data from immunoblots are mean ± S.E. of results from ≥3 independent experiments. Establishment of SH-SY5Y Cell Lines Stably Expressing Exogenous MmUbcs—The cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged MmUbc6 and MmUbc7 and their DN mutants (22Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were ligated into the pIRES2-EGFP vector, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with the resulting plasmids, and G418-resistant, GFP-expressing clones were isolated. Expression of exogenous MmUbc6 and MmUbc6DN (HA-tagged), and MmUbc7 and MmUbc7DN (myc-tagged) was confirmed in immunoblots with α-HA and α-myc, which identified, respectively, ∼31-kDa proteins (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 4 and 6) and ∼19-kDa proteins (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 3–6). The clonal cell lines depicted in Fig. 1 were those that expressed the highest levels of MmUbcs; these and other independently derived cell lines expressing equivalent amounts of MmUbcs were used throughout the course of this study. GFP and exogenous MmUbc expression remained stable throughout, as determined by periodic fluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis, respectively (data not shown). Localization of Exogenous MmUbcs—To show that the exogenous MmUbcs were appropriately localized in SH-SY5Y cells, membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared from control and transfected cells. The efficiency of fractionation was established using the type I InsP3R as a marker for membranes, and transaldolase (an entirely cytosolic enzyme of the pentose-phosphate pathway) (39Banki K.

Based on a three-dimensional model of the antagonist docked into the receptor, hypothetical ligand-receptor interactions were investigated by replacing the residues potentially involved in the binding of the antagonist into cysteines and designing analogues of SR49059 derivatized with isothiocyanate or α-chloroacetamide moieties. The F225C, F308C, and K128C mutants of the V1a receptor were expressed in COS-7 or Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their pharmacological properties toward SR49059 and its sulfydryl-reactive analogues were analyzed. We demonstrated that treatment of the F225C mutant with the isothiocyanate-derivative compound led to dose-dependent inhibition of the residual binding of the radio-labeled antagonist [125I]HO-LVA. This inhibition is probably the consequence of a covalent irreversible chemical modification, which is only possible when close contacts and optimal orientations exist between reactive groups created both on the ligand and the receptor. This result validated the three-dimensional model hypothesis. Thus, we propose that residue Phe225, located in transmembrane domain V, directly participates in the binding of the V1a-selective nonpeptide antagonist SR49059.

In addition, AVP modulates the adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion through V1b pituitary (V1bR) receptors. These different receptor subtypes along with the oxytocin receptor (OTR), which is classified in the same subfamily, possess distinct pharmacological profiles and intracellular second messengers (1Jard S.

Moreover, AVP belongs to the family of vasoactive and mitogenic peptides involved in physiological and pathological cell growth and differentiation (3Van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E.

AVP has been shown to be one of the most powerful in vitro vasoconstrictor substances, and its vasoconstrictor and mitogenic actions may contribute to the pathogenesis of arterial hypertension, heart failure, and atherosclerosis (4Johnston C.I. J. Hypertens. 1985; 3: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Goldsmith S.R. Am. J. Med. 1987; 82: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). AVP plays a role in the maintenance of blood pressure in several conditions, including upright posture, dehydration, hemorrhage, adrenal insufficiency, cardiac failure, and during surgery (6Cowley Jr., A.W. Int. Rev. Physiol. 1982; 26: 189-242PubMed Google Scholar, 7Share L. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 1248-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). An abnormal vascular reactivity specific for AVP has been noted in models of genetic and experimental hypertension, and AVP is instrumental in the genesis and maintenance of several models of experimental hypertension (4Johnston C.I. J. Hypertens. 1985; 3: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Goldsmith S.R. Am. J. Med. 1987; 82: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Share L. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 1248-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). AVP implication in the development or maintenance of hypertension, or both, is based on measurements of plasma and urinary AVP levels and responses to specific AVP antisera or peptide or nonpeptide antagonists (8Sladek C. Blair M.L. Sterling C. Mangiapane M.L. Hypertension. 1988; 12: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Burrell L.M. Phillipps P.A. Stephenson J.M. Risvanis J. Rolls K.A. Johnston C.I.

The first potent and selective V1aR antagonist to be synthesized is a cyclic peptide, d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP (11Kruszynski M. Lammek B. Manning M. Seto J. Haldar J. Sawyer W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1980; 23: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclic peptide antagonists, linear peptide antagonists have been developed, such as HO-phenylacetyl1-d-Tyr(Me)2-Phe3-Gln4-Asn5-Arg6-Pro7-Arg-8NH2 (HO-LVA) (12Barberis C. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Tribollet E. Arsenijevic Y. Dreifuss J.J. Bankowski K. Manning M. Chan W.Y. Schlosser S.S. Holsboer F. Elands J. J. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 135-146Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life of these peptide compounds have limited their use in clinical medicine. During the last decade, nonpeptide AVP antagonists were discovered through random screening of chemical libraries (13Yamamura Y. Ogawa H. Chihara T. Kondo K. Ongawa T. Nakamura S. Mori T. Tominaga M. Yabuuchi Y. Science. 1991; 252: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Serradeil-LeGal C. Wagnon J. Guillon G. Garcia C. Lacour C. Cantau B. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Barberis C. Villanova G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.P. Jard S. LeFur G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The availability of these orally active compounds now facilitates the assessment to the potential therapeutic applications of AVP receptor blockade in human diseases. One of these compounds, SR49059 ((2S)1-{(2R, 3S)-5-chloro-3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzene-sulfonyl)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-2-carbonyl}pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide), is presently the most potent and selective orally active V1aR antagonist described so far (14Serradeil-LeGal C. Wagnon J. Guillon G. Garcia C. Lacour C. Cantau B. Guiraudou P. Christophe B. Barberis C. Villanova G. Nisato D. Maffrand J.P. Jard S. LeFur G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It has a marked affinity, selectivity, and efficacy toward both animal and human V1aR and is devoid of partial agonist activity. In healthy human volunteers, SR49059 inhibits exogenous AVP-induced platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction (15Brouard R. Laporte V. Serradeil-LeGal C. Pignol R. Jang H.F.D. Lockwood G. Fournie D.

Up to now, identification of the binding site of the SR49059 into the V1aR has not been investigated at a molecular level. Several studies based on a combination of receptor three-dimensional modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have suggested that an AVP-binding pocket is buried into a 15–20-Å-deep central cavity of the V1a receptor, defined by the transmembrane helices and surrounded by the extracellular loops (17Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

Mouillac B. Ala Y. Balestre M.N. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Elands J. Hibert M. Manning M. Jard S. Barberis C.

Binding domains for synthetic peptide antagonists overlap those for peptide agonists into the AVP/OT receptors; however, discrimination of agonist versus antagonist ligands is achieved by conserved aromatic residues (Trp304, Phe307, and Phe308) located at the bottom of the binding pocket in the transmembrane helix VI (21Cotte N. Balestre M.N. Aumelas A. Mahé E. Phalipou S. Morin D. Hibert M. Manning M. Durroux T. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Eur. J.

Although the binding mode of SR49059 into the V1aR is not yet defined, nonconserved residues Thr333 and Ala334 located in transmembrane region VII have been shown to control the V1aR/V2R receptor binding selectivity for SR49059 and for cyclic peptide antagonists as well (21Cotte N. Balestre M.N. Aumelas A. Mahé E. Phalipou S. Morin D. Hibert M. Manning M. Durroux T. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To precisely investigate the SR49059-V1aR binding interactions at a molecular level, we first constructed a three-dimensional model of the antagonist docked into the receptor based on the x-ray crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (25Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5001) Google Scholar). To validate or invalidate the hypotheses of potential ligand-receptor interactions, we developed a site-directed irreversible labeling strategy that combines mutagenesis of the receptor and binding of chemically reactive probes derived from SR49059. This approach generates a chemical bond between the nucleophilic moiety of a cysteine residue incorporated into the receptor and the electrophilic moiety of a sulfydryl-reactive group (isothiocyanate or an α-chloroacetamide) in the SR49059 analogue. Because such a chemical bond formation is only possible when a close contact exists between reactive elements created both on the ligand and on the protein, the covalent link can be taken as a proof of direct interaction versus a long range effect (26Foucaud B. Perret P. Grutter T. Goeldner M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 170-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This strategy combines the advantages of three-dimensional modeling and site-directed mutagenesis techniques with those of a direct unambiguous identification of contact regions between a receptor and a specific ligand, like in photoaffinity labeling studies. This is an elegant complement to receptor photolabeling; however, it is much easier to develop than photolabeling, because it does not require the use of a radiolabeled ligand and the overproduction of the target receptor. However, this strategy necessitates introduction of a mutation in the receptor, which could be by itself detrimental to the overall structure of the protein. In this study, we demonstrated that the use of cysteine mutants of V1aR as chemical sensors for sulfydryl-reactive ligands allows unambiguous localization of the SR49059 nonpeptide-binding site and offers a reliable molecular model of the V1a receptor. Materials—SR49059 and its affinity probe derivatives were synthesized according to a SANOFI Recherche Montpellier patent (27Garcia, G., Nisato, D., Roux, R., Serradeil-LeGal, C., and Valette, G. (February 1, 1995) European Patent 636,608Google Scholar). The synthesis will be published in a paper to come. 2C. Tahtaoui, M. N. Balestre, P. Klotz, D. Rognan, C. Barberis, B. Mouillac, and M. Hibert, manuscript in preparation. [3H]AVP (60–80 Ci·mmol–1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HO-LVA was kindly provided by Dr. M. Manning (Toledo, OH) and was radioiodinated in our laboratory as previously described (12Barberis C. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Tribollet E. Arsenijevic Y. Dreifuss J.J. Bankowski K. Manning M. Chan W.Y. Schlosser S.S. Holsboer F. Elands J. J. Neuroendocrinology. 1995; 62: 135-146Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Alignment of Amino Acid Sequences—The amino acid sequences of the three human AVP receptor subtypes and that of the OT receptor were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot data base (accession numbers were as follows: V1a receptor, P37288; V1b receptor, P47901; V2 receptor, P30518; and OTR, P30559) and aligned to the sequence of bovine rhodopsin (accession number P02699) using the ClustalW multiple alignment program (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55399) Google Scholar). A slow pairwise alignment using BLOSUM matrix series (29Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar) and a gap opening penalty of 15.0 were chosen for aligning the amino acid sequences to the sequence of bovine rhodopsin. Because the disulfide bridge occurring between the third transmembrane segment (TM III) and the second extracellular loop (E II) in the structure of bovine rhodopsin is conserved in all AVP/OT receptors, we manually adjusted the alignment of E II to align the corresponding cysteines. Preparation of Starting Protein Coordinates—The three-dimensional model of the human V1a receptor was constructed by mutating the side chains of the amino acids in rhodopsin. Standard geometries for the mutated side chains were given by the BIOPOLYMER module of SYBYL (SYBYL 6.8, Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Whenever possible, the side chain torsional angles were kept to the values occurring in bovine rhodopsin. Otherwise, a short scanning of side chain angles was performed to remove steric clashes between the mutated side chain and the other amino acids. The third intracellular loop between helices V and VI, which shows a high degree of variability, was not included in any of the three models. This loop is not involved in direct interactions with the ligand (31Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. Cheung A.H. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16439-16443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assume that omitting this loop should not influence our docking results. Insertions/deletions occurred only in loops but not in secondary structure elements (α-helix and β-sheet). The insertions/deletions in the loops were achieved through a simple knowledge-based loop search procedure using the LOOPSEARCH module of the SYBYL package. In this procedure, a set of 1478 high resolution x-ray structures was searched for loops of similar length and similar distance between the Cα atoms of the residues delimiting the loop window. The loop showing the highest sequence identity and the lowest root mean square deviation was then selected for insertion in the model. Special caution had to be given with E II, which has been described in bovine rhodopsin to fold back over transmembrane helices (25Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5001) Google Scholar) and thereby limit the size of the active site. Hence, amino acids of this loop could be involved in direct interactions with the ligands. A driving force to this peculiar fold of the E II loop might be the presence of a disulfide bridge between cysteines in TM III and E II. Because this covalent link is conserved in all receptors modeled in the current study, the E II loop was modeled using a rhodopsin-like constrained geometry around the E II-TM III disulfide bridge. After the heavy atoms were modeled, all of the hydrogen atoms were added, and the protein coordinates were then minimized with AMBER (32Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz J.K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER 5.0 computer program. University of California, San Francisco, CA1997Google Scholar) using the AMBER95 force field (33Cornel W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz J.K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.M. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11497) Google Scholar). Topology and charge parameters for the nonpeptide V1a antagonist were computed using a previously described procedure (34Rognan D. Mukhija S. Folkers G. Zerbe O. J. Computer-Aided Mol. Design. 2001; 15: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The minimizations were carried out by 1,000 steps of steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient minimization until the root mean square gradient of the potential energy was less than 0.05 kcal/mol·Å. A twin cut-off (10.0 and 15.0 Å) was used to calculate nonbonded electrostatic interactions at every minimization step, and the nonbonded pair list was updated every 25 steps. A distance-dependent (ϵ = 4r) dielectric function was used. Modeling the Antagonist-bound V1a Receptor Model—To obtain an “antagonist-bound” model of the V1a receptor, the above-described coordinates were refined by the following procedure. Conivaptan, a known V1a antagonist (35Yatsu T. Tomura Y. Tahara A. Wada K. Tsukada J. Uchida W. Tanaka A. Takenaka T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 321: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was first manually docked into the putative active site (21Cotte N. Balestre M.N. Aumelas A. Mahé E. Phalipou S. Morin D. Hibert M. Manning M. Durroux T. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) so that its shape optimally fit in that of the binding pocket. The resulting protein-ligand complex was then refined by minimization using the above-described AMBER parameters. Removing the ligand atoms from the minimized complex finally yielded one set of coordinates for an antagonist-bound receptor model. Automated Docking of a Selective V1a Antagonist (SR49059)—The Gold 1.2 docking program (36Jones G. Wilett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-74837Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) was used to automatically dock the selective V1a antagonist SR49059. For each of the 10 independent genetic algorithm (GA) runs, a maximum number of 1,000 GA operations was performed on a single population of 50 individuals. Operator weights for cross-over, mutation, and migration were set to 100, 100, and 0, respectively. To allow poor nonbonded contacts at the start of each GA run, the maximum distance between hydrogen donors and fitting points was set to 5 Å, and nonbonded Van der Waals energies were cut off at a value equal to the kij well depth of the van der Waals energy for the atom pair i and j). To further speed up the calculation, the GA docking was stopped when the top three solutions were within 1.5 Å root mean square deviation. If this criterion is met, we can assume that these top solutions represent a reproducible pose for the ligand. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Human V1aR—Point mutations F225C, Y300C, F308C, and K128C introduced in the cDNA sequence of the human V1aR vasopressin receptor were directly achieved on the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV (37Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T. Granger G.A. Lentz R. Raab H. Kohr W.J. Goeddel D.V.

All of the mutations were verified by direct dideoxynucleotide sequencing (T7™ sequencing kit; Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture, Receptor Expression, and Membrane Preparations— The wild-type human V1aR and its mutants were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells or Chinese hamster ovary cells by electroporation as previously described (17Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cells were suspended in electroporation buffer (107 cells/0.3 ml) and incubated with plasmid DNA (20 μg of carrier DNA and 1–4 μg of expression vector containing the mutant cDNA insert) for 10 min at room temperature before being pulsed (280 V, 950 microfarads; GeneZapper system, Kodak Scientific Imaging). After electroporation, the cells were plated in Petri dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 500 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin each, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in an environment containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To increase the level of expression of some mutants, the cells were treated overnight with 5 mm sodium butyrate (38Kassis S. Henneberry R.C. Fishman P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4910-4916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Park C. Chamberlin M.E. Pan C.J. Chou J.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9807-9814Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As already published, this treatment does not modify the pharmacological properties of the receptors (22Phalipou S. Cotte N. Carnazzi E. Seyer R. Mahé E. Jard S. Barberis C. Mouillac B. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were harvested 48–72 h after electroporation, and the membranes were prepared as already described (17Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In short, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Polytron-homogenized in lysis buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA), and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were suspended in a small volume of Buffer A, and the protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Aliquots of membranes were used immediately for binding assays or stored at –80 °C. Radioligand Binding Assays—The binding assays were performed at 30 °C using [125I]HO-LVA or [3H]AVP as the radioligands and 1–3 μg (for assays with [125I]HO-LVA) or 10–15 μg (for assays with [3H]AVP) of membrane proteins in standard radioligand saturation and competition binding assays as previously described (17Mouillac B. Chini B. Balestre M.N. Elands J. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Hibert M. Jard S. Barberis C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25771-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were incubated in Buffer A supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) and with radiolabeled and displacing ligands for 30 min (with [3H]AVP) or 60 min (with [125I]HO-LVA). Affinities (Kd) for [125I]HO-LVA (concentrations from 50 to 800 pm) as well as for [3H]AVP (concentrations from 0.1 to 20 nm) were directly determined in saturation experiments. Affinities (Ki) or apparent affinities (apparent Ki) for the unlabeled ligands were determined by competition experiments using [125I]HO-LVA (100–500 pm) or [3H]AVP (1–2 nm) as the radioligands. The concentration of the unlabeled ligands varied from 1 pm to 10 μm. In saturation and competition experiments, depending on the radiolabeled peptide, nonspecific binding was determined by adding unlabeled AVP (10 μm) or HO-LVA (400 nm). Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters presoaked in a 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution (with [3H]AVP) or in a 0.5% polyethylenimine solution (with [125I]HO-LVA) for 3–4 h. The ligand binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression using the computer program Ligand (40Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). All of the assays were performed in triplicate on at least three separate batches of electroporated cells. Chemical Modification of the Mutant Receptors and Measure of Residual Radioligand Binding—To covalently and irreversibly label the cysteine mutants of the human V1aR, membrane preparations of COS-7 cells were first incubated with sulfydryl-modifying antagonist ligands (100 nm-10 μm), their nonreactive analogues (1–10 μm), or vehicle (Me2SO) in binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The protein content was controlled before this treatment. Next, the membranes were pelleted at 21,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed, and centrifuged four times with binding buffer without the ligands. The protein content of the pelleted and washed membranes was checked again before the radioligand binding assays. Residual binding of V1aR was assessed by incubating the homogenate with different concentrations of [125I]HO-LVA (from 50 to 800 pm) or [3H]AVP (from 0.1 to 20 nm) depending on the mutant (saturation experiments). Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel assays using saturating concentrations of HO-LVA (400 nm) or AVP (10 μm). Protein concentrations used in the receptor irreversible labeling assays are not equivalent to the ones used in classical binding assays (1–3 μg for assays with [125I]HO-LVA and 10–15 μg for assays with [3H]AVP). Indeed, because several washes of the membranes are necessary for eliminating the irreversible ligand after preincubation of the receptors, more than half of the protein content is lost during this protocol. Thus, 25–40 μg of proteins are preincubated with the ligand when using the F225C mutant. Only 5–10 μg of proteins are preincubated with the irreversible ligand when using the wild-type V1a r"
https://openalex.org/W2037901246,"l-Nucleoside analogs are a new class of clinically active antiviral and anticancer agents. The phosphorylation of these analogs from diphosphate to triphosphate metabolites is crucial for their biological action. We studied the role of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, a glycolytic enzyme, in the metabolism of l-nucleoside analogs, using small interfering RNAs to down-regulate the amount of this enzyme in HelaS3 and 2.2.15 cells, chosen as models for studying the impact of the enzyme on the anticancer and antihepatitis B virus activities of these analogs. Decrease in the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase led to a corresponding decrease in the formation of the triphosphate metabolites of l-nucleoside analogs (but not d-nucleoside analogs), resulting in detrimental effects on their activity. The enzyme is important for generating as well as maintaining the steady state levels of l-nucleotides in the cells, thereby playing a key role in the activity of l-nucleoside analogs against human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and cancer. This study also indicates a structure-based distinction in the metabolism of l- and d-nucleoside analogs, disputing the classic notion that nucleoside diphosphate kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation of all classes of nucleoside analog diphosphates. l-Nucleoside analogs are a new class of clinically active antiviral and anticancer agents. The phosphorylation of these analogs from diphosphate to triphosphate metabolites is crucial for their biological action. We studied the role of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, a glycolytic enzyme, in the metabolism of l-nucleoside analogs, using small interfering RNAs to down-regulate the amount of this enzyme in HelaS3 and 2.2.15 cells, chosen as models for studying the impact of the enzyme on the anticancer and antihepatitis B virus activities of these analogs. Decrease in the expression of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase led to a corresponding decrease in the formation of the triphosphate metabolites of l-nucleoside analogs (but not d-nucleoside analogs), resulting in detrimental effects on their activity. The enzyme is important for generating as well as maintaining the steady state levels of l-nucleotides in the cells, thereby playing a key role in the activity of l-nucleoside analogs against human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and cancer. This study also indicates a structure-based distinction in the metabolism of l- and d-nucleoside analogs, disputing the classic notion that nucleoside diphosphate kinases are responsible for the phosphorylation of all classes of nucleoside analog diphosphates. l-Nucleoside analogs are an emerging class of anticancer and antiviral agents that are being used clinically or are under advanced clinical trials (1Cheng Y.-C. Cancer Lett. 2001; 162: S33-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Cheng Y.-C. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 2001; 12: 5-11PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, l-nucleoside analogs are mirror images of the natural d-nucleosides. Despite the unnatural l-configuration, these analogs are able to utilize the salvage pathway of deoxynucleoside metabolism to be phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form (3Bridges E.G. Cheng Y.-C. Prog. Liver Dis. 1995; 13: 231-245PubMed Google Scholar, 4Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similar to the d-nucleoside analog counterparts, l-nucleoside analog triphosphates exert their pharmacological activity through incorporation into cellular or viral DNA, leading to chain termination or inhibition of viral reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase (5De Clercq E.

In the past decade, the realization that l-nucleosides are capable of being activated in cells has led to the discovery of several antiviral pyrimidine l-deoxynucleoside analogs.

Chem. 2002; 9: 899-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although several d-deoxynucleoside analogs such as gemcitabine and cytarabine are used as anticancer agents, troxacitabine (l-OddC) is the only l-nucleoside analog with anticancer properties. It is currently under phase II and III clinical trials for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and acute myelogenous leukemia, respectively (20Tsimberidou A.M. Alvarado Y. Giles F.J. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2002; 2: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Ecker G. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1533-1538PubMed Google Scholar, 22Giles F.J. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2002; 2: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The first two steps in the metabolism of l-nucleoside analogs seem to be similar to those of its d-nucleoside counterparts. The cytidine analogs, 3TC, l-OddC, l-Fd4C, and gemcitabine, are phosphorylated by cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase to the monophosphate metabolite, whereas l-FMAU can be phosphorylated by both deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase (4Van Rompay A.R.

The cytidine analogs are then phosphorylated by cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase to the respective diphosphates, and thymidine analogs are phosphorylated by thymidylate kinase (4Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 26Balzarini J. Herdewijn P. De Clercq E. J. Biol.

The last step of pyrimidine nucleoside analog metabolism was assumed to be carried out by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK); however, its role in the phosphorylation of l-nucleoside analog diphosphates remained doubtful (29Schneider B. Xu Y.W. Sellam O. Sarfati R. Janin J. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11491-11497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Bourdais J. Biondi R.

Faraj A. Sommadossi J.P. Veron M. Deville-Bonne D. Antiviral Res. 2002; 50: 147-156Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We examined this in further detail by studying the phosphorylation of pyrimidine d-deoxy, d-dideoxy, and l-deoxy nucleoside analog diphosphates by nucleoside metabolizing enzymes isolated from HepG2 cells (human hepatoma cell line). We showed that only d-nucleoside analogs containing 3′-hydroxyl groups are likely to be phosphorylated by NDPKs. The d-dideoxy nucleoside analogs are better substrates for creatine kinase, and l-nucleoside analogs are selectively phosphorylated by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (32Krishnan P. Fu Q. Lam W. Liou J-Y Dutschman G. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The primary function of PGK, a 46-kDa glycolytic protein, is the utilization of 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as a phosphate donor to generate one molecule of ATP during glycolysis. The observation that l-nucleoside analog diphosphates are preferentially phosphorylated as compared with the d-nucleoside analog diphosphates, analyzed using recombinant human PGK and its active site mutants, was unexpected. The preference for l-nucleoside analog diphosphates was attributed to the higher k cat values for their phosphorylation to triphosphates, which is a consequence of favorable orientations of the sugar and diphosphate moieties in the active site of the enzyme (33Krishnan P. Liou J.-Y. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31593-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although cell-free models support phosphorylation of l-nucleoside analogs by PGK, the model does not account for the possible regulation of activity or substrate specificity of PGK by other proteins. Moreover, enzymes other than NDPKs, PGK, creatine kinase, or pyruvate kinase may also be capable of phosphorylating l-nucleoside analog diphosphates in the cells. The formation of triphosphate metabolites is critical for the activity of l-nucleoside analogs, warranting further investigation. We carried out this study to assess the role of PGK in the metabolism of l-nucleoside analogs and to thereby analyze the physiological and clinical implications of the involvement of this enzyme in the activity of this class of drugs. We have used siRNA technology to down-regulate PGK in cell lines relevant to the activity of the nucleoside analogs. The purpose is to evaluate the effect of down-regulation of PGK on the metabolism (specifically phosphorylation of diphosphates to triphosphates) and the subsequent effect on the pharmacological activity. The HelaS3 cell line (human cervical carcinoma) serves as a model for evaluating metabolism and cytotoxic activities of l-OddC and gemcitabine. 2.2.15 cell line (HBV-producing cells derived from HepG2 cells) has been used to evaluate the metabolism and anti-HBV activities of 3TC and l-FMAU. Chemicals—[3H]3TC, [3H]l-FMAU, [3H]l-OddC, and [3H]gemcitabine were purchased from Moravek Chemicals (Brea, CA). 2′-OH deprotected and annealed siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). siRNAs with the following sequences were used: Seq 1, 5′-CCAGAGGAUUAAGGCUGCUdTdT, dTdTGGUCUCCUAAUUCCGACGA-5′; Seq 2, 5′-UGGAGCCAAGUCGGUAGUCdTdT, dTdTACCUCGGUUCAGCCAUCAG-5′; Seq2-con, 5′-CUGAUGGCUGAACCGAGGUdTdT, dTdTGACUACCGACUUGGCUCCA-5′. siRNA Transfection—2 × 105 HelaS3 cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (dFBS), were plated into 6-well plates, 1 day before transfection (day 0). The next day (day 1), cationic lipid complexes were prepared by incubating 200 pmol/liter siRNA with 6 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in 200 μl of OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen) for 15 min. The complexes were added to the cells to a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation for 5 h, 0.5 ml of RPMI supplemented with 30% dFBS was added to each well. The transfection was repeated on day 2. On day 3, cells from each well were replated in the absence of siRNA, based on the experimental requirements. (a) Cells were plated into 6-cm dishes for carrying out the metabolism experiments; (b) Cells were replated at 60% confluency into fresh 6-well plates for immunoblotting; (c) 2.5 × 104 cells were plated in 8-chambered collagen coated culture slides (BD Labware) for immunofluorescence; (d) 1 × 105 cells were plated into 6-well plates for clonogenic assays. The respective experiments were carried out 72 h after the first transfection on day 4. 2.2.15 cells grown in MEM-E supplemented with 10% dFBS were transfected similar to HelaS3 cells, on days 1, 3, and 4. Immunoblotting and metabolism of nucleoside analogs was carried out on day 6. Cells were plated and transfected into 2-chambered collagen coated slides at a similar schedule for immunofluorescence experiments. Anti-PGK Antibody and Immunofluorescence—Antibody to human PGK was generated by subcutaneously injecting 200 μg of recombinant human PGK (produced and characterized in our laboratory previously as described in Ref. 33Krishnan P. Liou J.-Y. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31593-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) mixed with equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant in New Zealand White rabbits. Booster shots with 100 μg of PGK and Freund's incomplete adjuvant were administered twice, at 2-week intervals. Serum was collected 6 weeks after the first injection, and anti-PGK antibody was affinity-purified with N-hydrosuccinimide-Sepharose beads conjugated to PGK according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the antibody was evaluated by a competition experiment in which the antibody was allowed to bind to the recombinant human PGK prior to its use in immunoblots. This led to a dose-dependent decrease in the detection of PGK. In addition, nonspecific bands were not observed even at a 20-fold higher concentration of antibody in immunoblots of crude cell lysates (data not shown). The monospecific antibody was therefore suitable for detection of PGK in immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Fix and Perm kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were blocked with 10% FBS in permeabilization buffer, and all antibody dilutions were also prepared in similar buffers. Cells were incubated with anti-PGK for 1 h followed by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody for another hour. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline between treatments. Samples were fixed in Slow Fade light anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM510. Metabolism of Nucleoside Analogs—The cells were treated with the respective compounds at the indicated concentrations and radiospecificity (24Dutschman G.E. Bridges E.G. Liu S.-H. Gullen E. Guo X.

Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 833-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μm dipyridamole (Sigma) and extracted with 15% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min on ice. The supernatant containing the nucleoside and its phosphorylated forms was extracted with a 45/55 ratio of trioctylamine and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluroethane (32Krishnan P. Fu Q. Lam W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31593-31600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The trichloroacetic acid insoluble pellet representing the nucleotide incorporated into the DNA was washed twice and resolubilized in Me2SO prior to evaluation on a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. The nucleoside analog metabolites were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Braintree, MA) connected to radiomatic detector (Flow Scintillation Analyzer, 150TR, Packard) using Partisil SAX column (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). All results are means and standard deviations from at least three independent transfections. Clonogenic Assay—1 × 105 cells were treated with l-OddC and gemcitabine for 24 h. 1 × 103 cells were replated in 6-well plates in fresh medium. The colonies were counted 7 days later by staining the colonies with methylene blue. The results are means and standard deviations from three independent transfections. Southern Analysis of HBV DNA—The cells were treated with 3TC and l-FMAU for 3 days. DNA was extracted using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested with HindIII. HBV DNA was analyzed by Southern blots by hybridization of the blots with HBV DNA specific probes followed by autoradiography (34Pai B.S. Liu S.-H. Zhu Y-L Chu C.K. Cheng Y.-C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 380-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fu L. Cheng Y.-C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inhibition of viral DNA in drug-treated cells as compared with untreated cells was assessed by analysis on Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant software. The results are means and standard deviations from three independent transfections. Effect of Down-regulation of PGK on Anticancer Activity of l-Nucleoside Analogs—Two siRNAs, seq 1 and seq 2, have been used to down-regulate PGK in HelaS3 cells. Use of control siRNA, seq2-con, which has the inverse sequence of seq 2, helps to rule out the nonspecific effects of the siRNAs on PGK expression. PGK down-regulation by siRNA treatment was monitored by immunoblots using an anti-PGK antibody (Fig. 1A). Seq 1 and seq 2 decrease PGK expression by 2.5- and 6.6-fold, respectively, whereas seq2-con does not affect PGK content in the cells. To rule out differences due to transfection efficiency, the cells were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B). The transfection efficiency of both seq 1 and seq 2 is around 90%, indicating that the down-regulation of PGK is a property of the siRNA itself. The intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated PGK visually correlates with the protein levels evaluated by immunoblotting. Seq 2 was selected to study the effects of down-regulation of PGK on the metabolism of l-OddC and gemcitabine. Cells transfected with seq2-con siRNA served as the experimental control. The period of incubation was selected based on the linearity of uptake of the drugs with respect to time. The siRNA-transfected cells were exposed to 1 μm (2.2 Ci/mmol) [3H]l-OddC for 24 h. The formation of l-OddCTP is lower in seq 2-treated cells, leading to a specific 2.5-fold increase in l-Odd-CDP to l-OddCTP ratio (Fig. 2A and inset). The total amount of l-OddC metabolites in seq 2-transfected cells is lower than in the control cells. The amount of l-OddCTP incorporated into the DNA of cells treated with seq 2 is also significantly lower than in the control cells (Fig. 2B). Cells were similarly transfected and exposed to 0.25 μm (0.9 Ci/mmol) [3H]gemcitabine for 30 min. The gemcitabine metabolite levels remain unaffected by PGK content in the cells; therefore, the gemcitabine diphosphate to triphosphate or monophosphate ratios are also similar in seq 2- and seq2-contransfected cells (Fig. 2C and inset). The amount of gemcitabine triphosphate incorporated into the DNA of both seq 2 and seq2-con transfected cells remains constant (Fig. 2D). The effect of down-regulation of PGK on the cytotoxic activity was evaluated using a clonogenic assay. siRNA-transfected cells were incubated with l-OddC and gemcitabine for 24 h. After treatment with l-OddC, the colony-forming ability of seq 2-treated cells is 2-fold higher as compared with seq2-contransfected cells (Fig. 2E). This increase in LC50 is also consistent with the decrease in the generation of l-OddCTP corresponding to the down-regulation of PGK. Lower expression of PGK in seq 2-transfected cells does not change the inhibitory effects of gemcitabine on its colony-forming ability (Fig. 2F). Effect of Down-regulation of PGK on Anti-HBV Activity of l-Nucleoside Analogs—The study of anti-HBV activity of nucleoside analogs in 2.1.15 cells requires the addition of drugs to a confluent culture aged for a period of 6 days. Such cultures produce optimal levels of HBV that facilitate evaluation of inhibitory effects of drugs after a treatment-period of 3 days. The transfection conditions have been optimized such that PGK is down-regulated by 6.6-fold on the 6th day after three transfections with seq 2 siRNA. Down-regulation of PGK by seq 1 is lower than that achieved by seq 2, whereas seq2-con does not affect PGK expression (Fig. 3A). In addition, PGK levels remain low for another 3 days even in the absence of seq 2 in the medium (Fig. 3B). Analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy established the transfection efficiency to be at least 95% (Fig. 3C). In addition, the intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated PGK is visually consistent with the protein levels determined by immunoblots. The effect of down-regulation of PGK on the metabolism of 3TC and l-FMAU was examined. The periods of incubation of cells with the drugs was again selected based on linearity of uptake of the drug with respect to time. The seq 2- and seq2-con-transfected cells were treated with 1 μm (2.2 Ci/mmol) [3H]3TC for 8 h. The amount of 3TCMP and 3TCDP remain constant; however, the levels of 3TCTP in seq 2-treated cells are lower (Fig. 4A). This leads to a specific 4-fold increase in the 3TCDP to 3TCTP ratio in seq 2-transfected cells as compared with the control cells (Fig. 4A, inset). Due to differences in the formation of triphosphates, the cells transfected with seq 2 show a net decrease in the accumulation 3TC metabolites. The metabolism of 1 μm (2.2 Ci/mmol) [3H]l-FMAU was evaluated by treating the siRNA-transfected cells for 2 h (Fig. 4B). There is an approximate 2-fold decrease in the formation of l-FMAUTP in seq 2-transfected cells, whereas the levels of other phosphorylated metabolites remain unaffected as compared with the control. As a consequence, there is a specific 2-fold increase in the diphosphate to triphosphate ratio, whereas the diphosphate to monophosphate ratio remains unchanged (Fig. 4B, inset). These data indicate that down-regulation of PGK correlates well with disturbances in the metabolism of 3TCDP and l-FMAUDP to the respective triphosphates. To correlate the efficiency of generation of triphosphates with the pharmacological activities of 3TC and l-FMAU, their anti-HBV activities were evaluated in seq 2- and seq2-contransfected cells. The cells were treated with drugs for 3 days, and HBV DNA content was then measured as an indication of anti-HBV activity (Fig. 4C). l-FMAU and 3TC were used at a concentration of 1 μm, similar to that used in the metabolism studies. In seq 2-transfected cells, inhibition of HBV DNA production by both analogs is ∼2-fold lower than in the control cells. Role of PGK in Maintenance of Triphosphate Metabolite Levels—To evaluate the role of PGK in maintaining the levels of triphosphate metabolites, a model was designed to simulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of 1 μm (2.2 Ci/mmol) of [3H]3TC and [3H]l-FMAU. siRNA- and mock-transfected 2.2.15 cells were exposed to 3TC for 8 h followed by removal of the drug and replacement with fresh medium for different intervals of time (Fig. 5A). The content of the phosphorylated metabolites is an indication of the catabolism of nucleotides as a function of time. In seq 2-transfected cells, after 8 h (time 0) of incubation, there is an expected 4-fold increase in the 3TCDP to 3TCTP ratio as compared with the control cells. On the removal of 3TC, the ratios remain constant for around 8 h, but 3TCMP levels decrease gradually, and by 16 h, seq 2-treated cells only contain 3TCDP. In seq2-con-transfected cells, 3TCMP reduces gradually such that by 16 h, only 3TCDP and 3TCTP remain, but their levels and ratios remain constant at least up to 24 h after drug treatment. The dephosphorylation process of 3TCDP is slow, leading to its stability in the cells. siRNA-transfected cells were treated with l-FMAU for 2 h (time 0) followed by replacement with fresh medium for the indicated periods of time (Fig. 5B). The triphosphate, diphosphate, and monophosphate metabolites of l-FMAU decrease progressively up to 8 h such that the diphosphate to triphosphate metabolite ratio remains constant. In seq 2-transfected cells, the amount of triphosphate metabolite diminishes rapidly after 16 h, leaving only the monophosphate metabolite at 24 h after drug treatment. In the control cells, the triphosphate is the major metabolite at 16 h, and the equilibrium between diphosphate and triphosphate metabolite is maintained even at 24 h after drug treatment. These data indicate that the metabolites are catabolized stepwise to the respective nucleosides, which can freely diffuse out of the cells. Although the triphosphate metabolites are catabolized rapidly, they are rephosphorylated by PGK, indicating the importance of the enzyme in the maintenance of steady state levels of triphosphate metabolite. siRNA technology is useful for evaluating intracellular drug specificity and mechanism of action (36McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nature Rev. 2002; 3: 737-746Crossref Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 37Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). An added advantage to this technology is that the transient and specific targeting of the desired protein decreases the probability of selecting cells that can develop compensatory mechanisms for the protein function. Our strategy here was to down-regulate the expression of PGK to inhibit the phosphorylation of l-nucleoside analog diphosphate to triphosphate. Based on our previous results that showed preference of the enzyme for l-over d-nucleoside analogs, we also predicted that the metabolism of d-nucleoside analogs would be unaffected by changes in PGK content. The importance of PGK in l-nucleoside metabolism was tested in two representative cell lines, selected on the basis of their pharmacological activities: anticancer activity in HelaS3 and anti-HBV activity in 2.2.15 cell lines. All the experiments also included mock-transfected cells, and as expected, the metabolism and activity of nucleoside analogs in these cells were similar to those in seq2-con-transfected cells (data not shown). However, comparison of results obtained from seq 2- and seq2-con-transfected cells is more appropriate since the effects of siRNA duplexes on the activity of nucleoside analogs cannot be predicted. Down-regulation of PGK in HelaS3 cells specifically affected formation of triphosphate metabolites, leading to increases in the diphosphate to triphosphate ratio of l-nucleoside analogs. In the case of l-OddC, the 2.5-fold decrease in the formation of l-OddCTP led to a decrease in the amount incorporated into the DNA. The lower expression of PGK correlated well with the subsequent decrease in the activity of l-OddC against the clonogenic activity of cells. The metabolism of gemcitabine, a d-deoxy nucleoside analog that is phosphorylated by NDPKs in cell-free models, was not affected by down-regulation of PGK; therefore, inhibition of the colony-forming ability of the cells remained unaffected. In 2.2.15 cells, siRNA-induced decrease in PGK led to a specific increase in 3TC and in the l-FMAU diphosphate to triphosphate metabolites ratio. The change was due to a decrease in the formation of triphosphate metabolite; this was, however, not accompanied by a corresponding accumulation of diphosphate metabolites. One possible explanation is that the concentration of phosphorylated metabolites is in equilibrium, so the diphosphates are catabolized to the nucleosides, facilitating their diffusion out of the cells, thus preventing the accumulation of the diphosphate metabolites (38Galmarini C.M. Mackey J.R. Dumontet C. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 39Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore, when PGK was down-regulated, the total amount of 3TC/l-FMAU and its phosphorylated metabolites in the cells also decreased, indicating that the phosphorylation of diphosphate metabolites is the bottleneck for the total uptake of l-nucleoside analogs into the cells. These changes in metabolism consequently led to a decreased inhibition of HBV DNA production by 3TC and l-FMAU as well as l-Fd4C (data not shown). Metabolism of 3TC was also studied in the HelaS3 cell line transfected with siRNAs (data not shown). The amount of 3TCTP formation decreased 4- and 2-fold with seq 2 and seq 1, respectively, consistent with down-regulation of PGK in the HelaS3 cell line. This supports the important role of PGK in the phosphorylation of l- but not d-nucleoside analog diphosphates in cells. The role of PGK in maintaining the levels of triphosphate metabolites was also examined. The dephosphorylation of nucleotides catalyzed by undefined enzymes and 5′-nucleotidases results in the catabolism of nucleoside analog triphosphates to the respective nucleosides, which can diffuse out of the cells. It was therefore conceivable that PGK may affect the stability of triphosphate metabolites in the cells. Results indicated that in the cells with a decreased amount of PGK, removal of drug eventually leads to a rapid reduction in the amount of triphosphate metabolites, whereas in the control cells, the diphosphate to triphosphate ratio is retained, indicating constant regeneration of triphosphates by PGK. Since in cells lacking PGK, l-nucleoside triphosphates are catabolized but not regenerated, enzymes other than PGK may be involved in the reverse reaction. PGK is not only important for initial phosphorylation but also for the maintenance of steady state levels of l-nucleotides in the cells. This report demonstrates that PGK phosphorylates l- but not d-nucleoside analog diphosphates in the cells. The siRNAs used in the study, however, did not knock out the expression of PGK, and generation of triphosphate metabolite was not completely inhibited. We can therefore conclude that although PGK plays a predominant role in the phosphorylation of anti-cancer and antiviral l-nucleoside analogs, we cannot rule out the possible role of other unknown enzymes in their metabolism to triphosphates. This study also emphasizes that contrary to the assumptions that NDPKs phosphorylate all nucleoside analog diphosphates, the structure of the analog is just another variable in determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Our earlier studies had in fact suggested that pyrimidine d-dideoxynucleoside analog diphosphates are phosphorylated by creatine kinase (32Krishnan P. Fu Q. Lam W. Liou J-Y Dutschman G. Cheng Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of nucleoside analogs currently used or under clinical trials for the treatment of cancer and viral infections, it is important to understand the structure-based distinction in the metabolism of these analogs. Clinically, PGK levels vary by tissue and possibly between patients. Since phosphorylation by PGK is a critical step in l-nucleoside uptake and metabolism, monitoring the PGK levels in the patients undergoing l-nucleoside therapy may prove to be important for predicting compliance to therapy. The clinical manifestations of involvement of PGK in the activation of anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs remain to be seen."

MCa and mutated analogues were chemically synthesized, and their interaction with the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) was studied on purified RyR1, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles, and cultured myotubes. MCa strongly potentiates [3H]ryanodine binding on SR vesicles (7-fold at pCa 5) with an apparent EC50 of 12 nm. MCa decreases the sensitivity of [3H]ryanodine binding to inhibitory high Ca2+ concentrations and increases it to the stimulatory low Ca2+ concentrations. In the presence of MCa, purified RyR1 channels show long-lasting openings characterized by a conductance equivalent to 60% of the full conductance. This effect correlates with a global increase in Ca2+ efflux as demonstrated by MCa effects on Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. In addition, we show for the first time that external application of MCa to cultured myotubes produces a cytosolic Ca2+ increase due to Ca2+ release from 4-chloro-m-cresol-sensitive intracellular stores. Using various MCa mutants, we identified a critical role of Arg24 for MCa binding onto RyR1. All of the other MCa mutants are still able to modify [3H]ryanodine binding although with a decreased EC50 and a lower stimulation efficacy. All of the active mutants produce both the appearance of a subconductance state and Ca2+ release from SR vesicles.

In skeletal muscles, contraction is triggered by the massive release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; RyR1, ryanodine receptor; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; IpTxA, imperatoxin A; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LLSS, long-lasting subconductance state; EC, excitation-contraction; CMC, 4-chloro-m-cresol; MCa, maurocalcine.1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; RyR1, ryanodine receptor; DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; IpTxA, imperatoxin A; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LLSS, long-lasting subconductance state; EC, excitation-contraction; CMC, 4-chloro-m-cresol; MCa, maurocalcine. The channel responsible for this release is the type-1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1). RyR1 has been intensively studied because of its unique structural and functional organization. It forms part of a calcium mobilization complex in which RyR1 is apposed to the l-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR) along many other structural and regulatory components (1Mackrill J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The activation of RyR1 requires a chain of events that starts with plasma membrane depolarization inducing a change in the conformation of DHPR itself transmitted to RyR1. The entire set of events is called excitation-contraction coupling (EC coupling). In vitro, the activity of RyR1 can be modulated by a number of different effectors such as Ca2+, ryanodine, ATP, caffeine, and 4-chloro-m-cresol (CMC) (2Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzin V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 3Jona I. Szegedi C. Sarkozi S. Szentesi P. Csernoch L. Kovacs L. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 441: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Among these effectors, only few present high selectivity and affinity for RyR1. More specific pharmacological agents for RyR1 have been discovered in scorpion venoms (4Valdivia H.H. Kirby M.S. Lederer W.J. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One such peptide has been isolated from the venom of the chactid scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus and has been termed maurocalcine (MCa). It is a 33-mer basic peptide reticulated by three disulfide bridges. MCa can be chemically synthesized without any loss of activity (5Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. di Luccio E. Bichet D.

It is potently active on RyR1 as it alters channel properties in the low nanomolar range (5Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N.

MCa presents a strong sequence homology (82% amino acid sequence identity) with imperatoxin A (IpTxA), a toxin active on RyR1 and isolated from another scorpion venom (7El Hayek R. Lokuta A.J.

Besides the fact that MCa and IpTxA represent two of the most high affinity effectors of RyR1, they also share some amino acid sequence homology with a specific domain (domain A) of the II–III loop of Cavα1.1, the subunit that carries the voltage sensor of DHPR (Fig. 1). Although the exact role of the domain A in the EC-coupling process is highly debated (11El Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29235-29237Google Scholar, 13Ahern C.A. Bhattacharya D. Mortenson L. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3294-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we have recently shown by using plasmon resonance measurements that it is the single II–III loop sequence interacting with RyR1 (14O'Reilly F.N. Robert M. Jona I. Szegedi C. Albrieux M. Geib S. De Waard M. Villaz M. Ronjat M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this exceptional form of homology between a channel sequence and a toxin could be indicative that domain A possesses some kind of yet unresolved function in RyR1 regulation. Therefore, studying the MCa effects on RyR1 may produce several interesting hints on how to proceed further on investigating the role of domain A in EC coupling. In this work, we synthesized several MCa analogues in which amino acid residues, also present in homologous position in domain A, were substituted by alanine residues. We then analyzed the effect of MCa and the analogues on [3H]ryanodine binding, Ca2+-dependent activation of RyR1, channel activity, and Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. We identified an amino acid residue critical for the interaction of MCa with RyR1 and for the induction of a long-lasting subconductance state. The data also demonstrate a clear relationship in the ability of MCa to potentiate [3H]ryanodine binding, induce a subconductance state, and produce Ca2+ release from heavy SR vesicles. To prove the physiological relevance of RyR1 as the main target of MCa, we tested the effect of the peptide on internal Ca2+ release in intact myotubes. We show that the addition of 100 nm MCa in Ca2+-free extracellular medium induces an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and a complete inhibition of CMC-induced Ca2+ release. Chemical Synthesis—N-α-Fmoc-l-amino acids, 4-hydroxymethylphenyloxy resin, and reagents used for peptide synthesis were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The MCa and analogues were obtained by the solid-phase peptide synthesis (15Merrifield R.B. Science. 1986; 232: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) using an automated peptide synthesizer (Model 433A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Analogues were obtained by point mutation (Ala instead of one amino acid in the sequence of maurocalcine native-like) and named Ala/Lys8, Ala/Lys19, Ala/Lys20, Ala/Lys22, Ala/Arg23, Ala/Arg24, and Ala/Thr26. Peptide chains were assembled stepwise on 0.25 meq of hydroxymethylphenyloxy resin (1% cross-linked; 0.89 meq of amino group/g) using 1 mmol of N-α-Fmoc amino acid derivatives. The side chain-protecting groups were as follows: trityl for Cys and Asn; tert-butyl for Ser, Thr, Glu, and Asp; pentamethylchroman for Arg; and tert-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys. N-α-Amino groups were deprotected by treatment with 18 and 20% (v/v) piperidine/N-methylpyrrolidone for 3 and 8 min, respectively. The Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were coupled (20 min) as their hydroxybenzotriazole active esters in N-methylpyrrolidone (4-fold excess). After peptide chain assembly, the peptide resin (approximately 1.8 μg) was treated between 2 and 3 h at room temperature in constant shaking with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/thioanisol/ethanedithiol (88: 5/5/2, v/v) in the presence of crystalline phenol (2.25 g). The peptide mixture was then filtered, and the filtrate was precipitated by adding cold t-butylmethyl ether. The crude peptide was pelleted by centrifugation (3.000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant was discarded. The reduced peptide was then dissolved in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, at a final concentration of 2.5 mm and stirred under air to allow oxidation/folding (between 50 and 72 h, room temperature). The target products, MCa and analogues, were purified to homogeneity, first by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, C18 Aquapore ODS, 20 μm, 250 × 10 mm) by means of a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid = 0–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 6 ml/min (λ = 230 nm). A second step of purification of MCa and analogues was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography on a carboxymethyl cellulose matrix using 10 mm (buffer A) and 500 mm (buffer B) sodium phosphate buffers, pH 9.0 (60-min linear gradient from 0 to 60% buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). The homogeneity and identity of MCa or analogues were assessed by the following: (i) analytical C18 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Merck, C18 Li-Chrospher, 5 μm, 4 × 200 mm) using a 60-min linear gradient of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; (ii) amino acid analysis after acidolysis (6 n HCl/2% (w/v) phenol, 20 h, 118 °C, N2 atmosphere); and (iii) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Heavy SR Vesicles Preparation—Heavy SR vesicles were prepared following a modified method of Kim et al. (16Kim D.H. Onhishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described in Marty et al. (17Marty I. Thevenon D. Scotto C. Groh S. Sainnier S. Robert M. Grunwald D. Villaz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8206-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method. [3H]Ryanodine Binding Assay—Heavy SR vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in an assay buffer composed of 5 nm [3H]ryanodine (unless otherwise stated), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, variable concentrations of CaCl2 to adjust for pCa, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. MCa or peptide mutants were added to the assay buffer just prior to the addition of heavy SR vesicles. [3H]Ryanodine bound to heavy SR vesicles was measured by filtration through Whatmann GF/B glass filters followed by three washes with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Filters were then soaked overnight in 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Cybscint, ICN), and bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm cold ryanodine. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. All of the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Ca2 + Release Measurements—Ca2+ release from heavy SR vesicles was measured using the Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III. The absorbance was monitored at 710 nm by a diode array spectrophotometer (MOS-200 Optical System, Biologic, Claix, France). Heavy SR vesicles (50 μg) were actively loaded with Ca2+ at 37 °C in a 2-ml buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm potassium MOPS, pH 7.0, supplemented with 250 μm antipyrylazo III, 1 mm ATP/MgCl2, 5 mm phosphocreatine, and 12 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (18Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6142-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ loading was started by sequential additions of 50 and 20 μm of CaCl2. In these loading conditions, no calcium-induced calcium release interferes with the observations. At the end of each experiment, Ca2+ remaining in the vesicles was determined by the addition of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (4 μm) and the absorbance signal calibrated by two consecutive additions of 20 μm CaCl2. RyR1 Ca2 + Channel Reconstitution and Single-channel Recording Analysis—Measurements of channel activity were carried out using purified RyR1 incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. RyR1 was purified from rabbit SR vesicles as previously described (19Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The bilayers were formed using phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and l-phosphatidylcholine in a ratio of 5:4:1 dissolved in n-decane up to the final lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml (20Herrmann-Frank A. Reacher M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Bilayers were formed across a 200- or 250-μm diameter aperture of a Delrin cap using a symmetrical buffer solution (250 mm KCl, 100 μm EGTA, 150 μm CaCl2, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.2). The chamber into the small aliquot of purified RyR1 was added and defined as the cis (cytoplasmic) side, whereas the other chamber labeled as the trans (luminal) side was kept on ground potential. To ensure the orientation of the incorporated RyR1, we tested the effect of free Ca2+ concentration on both side. After successful incorporation of the RyR1 channel, free calcium concentration in the cis chamber was adjusted to 238 nm by the addition of EGTA. Electrical signals were filtered at 1 kHz through an 8-pol low-pass Bessel filter and digitized at 3 kHz using Axopatch 200 and pCLAMP 6.03 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Total recording time in each experiment was 10–20 min for any experimental condition tested. After changing conditions, at least 5 min were allowed for equilibration, which appeared to be enough to reach the new equilibrium of the parameters. Single channel measurements were carried out at 20–22 °C. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the computer program and affinity constants published by Fabiato (21Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Open probabilities were calculated using the common 50% criteria with a medial dead zone of 5%. Current amplitude distribution was analyzed using Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Values of the open probability are expressed as the means ± S.E. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle satellite cells were obtained as described previously (16Kim D.H. Onhishi S.T. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9662-9668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on laminin-coated plates, in a proliferation medium composed of Ham's F-10 with glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 2–3 days, differentiation of satellite cells into myotubes was induced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamax-I (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Ca2 + Imaging from Culture Myotubes—Changes in cytosolic calcium levels were monitored using the calcium-dependent fluorescent dye Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes). The myotubes were loaded for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 5 μm Fluo-4-AM. Uptake of the dye was facilitated by the addition of 0.02% pluronic acid (Sigma). After loading, myotubes were washed for 1 h to allow ester hydrolysis of the dye. Fluorescence changes were measured by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a LEICA TCS-SP2 operating system in the xyt mode. Fluo4 was excited at a wavelength of 488 nm, and the fluorescence was collected from 500 to 570 nm. Images were collected every 1.6 s for 2–4 min and then analyzed frame by frame with the data analysis software provided by Leica. Fluorescence curves are expressed as a function of time as ΔF/F, where F represents the base-line fluorescence and ΔF represents the fluorescence variations. Synthesis of MCa and Analogues— Fig. 1 presents the primary structure of the different MCa analogues that we synthesized. The structural determination of MCa shows that the stretch of basic residues (from Lys20 to Arg24) forms a single basic-rich surface (22Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Fajloun Z. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. Proteins. 2000; 40: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We will define the residues forming this basic surface as residues belonging to the “basic class.” The opposite surface of the toxin contains four acidic residues (Asp2, Glu12, Asp15, and Glu29) and one basic residue (Lys8). We will define this acidic surface as the “acidic face.” This electrostatic charge distribution creates a marked anisotropy in which the role in MCa pharmacology is unknown. We choose to substitute one by one all of the MCa amino acid residues common between MCa and the domain A of the II–III loop of Cavα1.1 subunit. Most of these residues belong to the basic class with the exception of Thr26 and therefore were replaced by neutral alanine residues. We also synthesized the mutant [Ala8]MCa because Lys8 is not conserved in the II–III loop but is located on the toxin face opposite to the basic surface (23Green D. Pace S. Curtis S.M. Sakowska M. Lamb G.D. Dulhunty A.F. Casarotto M.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of the peptides were folded/oxidized in a 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, by a 72-h exposure to air and purified to homogeneity by preparative C18 reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Both analysis of elution profiles and circular dichroism spectra indicate that all of the peptides have proper secondary structures (data not shown). Effects of MCa on [3H]Ryanodine Binding to RyR1—We recently described that MCa stimulates the binding of [3H]ryanodine onto heavy SR vesicles that contain RyR1 (6Chen L. Estève E. Sabatier J.M. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16095-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A confirms this initial finding as we observe that 200 nm MCa increases the binding of [3H]ryanodine by 7.4 ± 2.5-fold with an EC50 of 12.5 ± 0.8 nm. Results presented in Fig. 2B show that MCa induces a slight change in the [3H]ryanodine binding k obs value (k obs = 1.08 × 10–2 ± 0.22 × 10–2 min–1 without MCa versus k obs = 1.81 × 10–2 ± 0.23 × 10–2 min–1 with 100 nm MCa). As shown in Fig. 2C, [3H]ryanodine binding on RyR highlights both a high affinity (51 nm) and a low affinity (228 nm) class of binding sites, whereas in the presence of MCa (100 nm), ryanodine binding on RyR1 exhibits a single class of high affinity binding site (11 nm). These results suggest that the increase of ryanodine binding induced by MCa may be because of a conversion of both classes of binding sites into a higher affinity class of binding site. Because [3H]ryanodine binding on SR vesicles is sensitive to external Ca2+ concentration, we examined the effect of MCa on [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of varying external Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2D). In the presence of MCa (saturating 100 nm), [3H]ryanodine binding on SR vesicles still shows a classical bell-shaped dependence to external Ca2+. Interestingly, we observed that the [3H]ryanodine binding inhibition by high Ca2+ concentration (pCa 3) was slightly decreased, whereas the [3H]ryanodine binding stimulation by low Ca2+ concentration (pCa 6 and 6.5) was increased. Indeed, while in the absence of MCa, ryanodine binding was almost completely inhibited (>99%) at pCa 3. In the presence of MCa, 39% of the maximum [3H]ryanodine binding was still observed at pCa 3. Similarly, at pCa 6.5, ryanodine binding is at 70% of its maximum in the presence of MCa, whereas it is only at 4.8% of its maximum in the absence of MCa. Characterization of the Effects of MCa Mutants on [3H]Ry-anodine Binding to RyR1—All of the MCa analogues also stimulate [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3A) with the exception of [Ala24]MCa (up to 5 μm). For all of the functional analogues, the EC50 of the stimulatory effect is reduced with values ranging between 49 ± 14 nm for [Ala26]MCa and 432 ± 168 nm for [Ala22]MCa, which would correspond to a reduction of affinity between 4- and 35-fold. [Ala8]MCa also appeared less effective than MCa with an EC50 of 199 ± 19 nm. These data show that the amino acid residues of MCa can be classified in three different groups: (i) residues belonging to the basic class that are important for interaction with RyR1 (Lys22, Arg23, and Arg24); (ii) residues belonging or not to the basic class that appear less important for the interaction with RyR1 (Lys19, Lys20, and Thr26); and (iii) a residue of the acidic face that appears to mildly affect the interaction with RyR1 (Lys8). Besides various effects on EC50, all of the active analogues also present a significant decrease on the stimulation efficacy on [3H]ryanodine binding. The stimulation efficacies of the analogues are on average 1.9-fold less than MCa itself and ranged between 3.2 ± 0.4-fold for [Ala23]MCa and 4.7 ± 0.1-fold for [Ala8]MCa. [Ala23]MCa combines two negative changes compared with wild-type MCa, a decrease in the apparent affinity and the lowest [3H]ryanodine binding stimulation efficacy. Two explanations can be put forward to explain why [Ala24]MCa is ineffective on [3H]ryanodine binding. Firstly, it may not bind to RyR1, which is the simplest hypothesis. Secondly, it may bind onto RyR1 but cannot produce allosteric changes required to enhance [3H]ryanodine binding. In this latest case, [Ala24]MCa would compete with MCa for binding on RyR1. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of MCa (20 and 100 nm) on [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of [Ala24]MCa. Fig. 3B shows that the effect of MCa is not altered by the presence of up to 1 μm [Ala24]MCa, demonstrating that this analogue is not able to bind onto RyR1. We also checked whether or not the absence of the effect of [Ala24]MCa on [3H]ryanodine binding is related to experimental pCa conditions. Indeed, no [3H]ryanodine binding stimulation was observed at pCa values ranging between 2 and 7 (Fig. 3C). Characterization of the Effects of MCa and MCa Mutants on Ca2 + Release from SR Vesicles—To investigate the effect of MCa on Ca2+ release from heavy SR vesicles, we first actively loaded the vesicles by two consecutive additions of Ca2+ (50 μm and 20 μm) in the presence of ATP-Mg2+, pyrophosphate, and ATP-regenerating system. After Ca2+ loading reaches equilibrium, the addition of 1 μm MCa to the external medium induces Ca2+ release as shown in Fig. 4A. Similar results were obtained with 100 nm MCa (data not shown), but 1 μm MCa was chosen to allow a comparison with the effects of the lower affinity MCa analogues. External Ca2+ level reaches a plateau that corresponds to a new equilibrium between Ca2+ release and Ca2+ uptake rates as evidenced by the additional change produced by 4 μm A23187 calcium ionophore. The release of Ca2+ induced by 1 μm MCa was prevented by preincubating the SR vesicles with 10 μm ruthenium red, demonstrating that MCa-induced calcium release occurs through RyR (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the application of 1 μm MCa prevents the release of Ca2+ induced by the addition of 500 μm CMC, and conversely, the application of 500 μm CMC prevents an additional release of Ca2+ by 1 μm MCa (Fig. 4C). These data again demonstrate that MCa releases Ca2+ from SR vesicles by acting on RyR. Fig. 4D shows that the application of 1 μm of any one of the mutated MCa analogues induces Ca2+ release from SR vesicles with the exception of [Ala23]MCa and [Ala24]MCa. However, these two last MCa analogues are not equivalent since application of 10 μm [Ala23]MCa resulted in Ca2+ release, whereas 10 μm [Ala24]MCa remained inactive (Fig. 4E). The present observation made for [Ala24]MCa is in complete agreement with its lack of effect on [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3B). The results obtained with [Ala23]MCa are also coherent with the data on [3H]ryanodine binding (lower affinity and lower stimulation efficacy), although a discrepancy exists between the [Ala23]MCa concentration needed for Ca2+ release and those inducing an increase in [3H]ryanodine binding. Modification of RyR1 Calcium Channel Conductance by MCa and Analogues—Application of 200 nm MCa to the cis face of the bilayer-recording chamber (cytoplasmic side of RyR1) induces a characteristic long-lasting subconductance state (LLSS) (Fig. 5A). This subconductance state represents 60% of the full conductance state, and the channel spends 54.8 ± 6.2% of its time in this subconductance level. A much less frequent smaller LLSS (48% of the full conductance) was described in earlier reports (5Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16095-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the experimental conditions were slightly different (purified RyR1 versus junctional SR vesicles and K+ current versus Cs+ current in previous reports (5Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16095-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). We next examined whether the LLSS induced by MCa could be correlated to Ca2+ release from heavy SR vesicles and stimulation of [3H]ryanodine binding. Therefore, we tested the effect of [Ala24]MCa on the conductance level of RyR1 in lipid bilayers (Fig. 5B). Indeed, this mutant peptide has no effect on [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3A) nor on the Ca2+ release from SR vesicles (Fig. 4D). As expected, we show that the application of 200 nm [Ala24]MCa does not induce any LLSS of RyR1. Applications of higher concentrations (up to 750 nm) also were without any effect (data not shown). Conversely, the application of 200 nm of an active MCa analogue, [Ala20]MCa, that conserves MCa-like properties (for [3H]ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release from SR vesicles) produces the appearance of the characteristic LLSS.

We report herein that Pdx-1 expression, including the amount of Pdx-1 localized in the nucleus, is not down-regulated in our Irs2 -/- murine β-cells with a C57BL/6 background. We have also demonstrated the expression of upstream genes of Pdx-1, such as HNF3β and HNF1α, as well as its downstream genes, including insulin, Glut2, and Nkx6.1, to be well preserved. We have further demonstrated Pdx-1 expression to also be preserved in β-cells of 30-week-old diabetic Irs2 -/- mice. In addition, surprisingly, even in Irs2 -/- mice on a high fat diet with markedly elevated blood glucose, exceeding 400 mg/dl, Pdx-1 expression was not reduced. Furthermore, we found Pdx-1 to be markedly decreased in certain severely diabetic Irs2 -/- mice with a mixed C57BL/6J × 129Sv background. We conclude that 1) Pdx-1 expression in Irs2 -/- mice is regulated in a strain-dependent manner, 2) Irs2 -/- mice develop diabetes associated with β-cell growth failure even when Pdx1 expression is preserved, and 3) Pdx-1 expression is preserved in severely hyperglycemic Irs2 -/- mice with a C57BL/6 background on a high fat diet.

Besides the impaired β-cell proliferation in Irs2 -/- mice, ablation of p70s6k1, an Akt substrate, is associated with a decrease in β-cell size (18Pende M. Kozma S.C. Jaquet M. Oorschot V.

Pdx-1 is also known as a MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) 4 gene (35Stoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat.

Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Pdx-1 was recently reported to be severely reduced in Irs2 -/- murine β-cells, suggesting the possibility that IRS-2 directly regulates the expression and function of Pdx-1, thereby maintaining β-cell growth and function (37Kushner J.A.

These studies indicated that Pdx-1 mRNA levels in Irs2 -/- islets are reduced to about 20% of those in wild-type islets, associated with HNF3β mRNA reduction, and that the protein levels are reduced identically. However, because glucose-induced insulin secretion was increased and the insulin content was well preserved in our Irs2 -/- murine islets (11Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R.

We report herein that Pdx-1 expression, including the amount of Pdx-1 localized in the nucleus, is not down-regulated in our Irs2 -/- murine β-cells with a C57BL/6J background. In addition, surprisingly, even in Irs2 -/- mice on a high fat diet with markedly elevated blood glucose, exceeding 400 mg/dl, Pdx-1 expression was not reduced. Furthermore, we found Pdx-1 to be markedly decreased in some severely diabetic Irs2 -/- mice with a mixed C57BL/6J × 129Sv background. We conclude that Pdx-1 expression in Irs2 -/- mice is regulated in a strain-dependent manner, and our results suggest that a certain 129Sv-related genetic component(s) is involved in reduced Pdx-1 expression, leading to severe diabetes in Irs2 -/- mice.

GAPDH primers and probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Immunohistochemistry—The removed pancreata were immediately immersion-fixed in Bouin's solution at 4 °C overnight. Tissues were routinely processed for paraffin embedding, and 2-μm sections were cut and mounted on silanized slides. With the indicated antibodies, the sections were immunologically stained brown using an Envision Labeled Polymer Kit (DakoCytomation Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) with a DAB Substrate Kit (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and/or stained red using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody with Vector Red (Vector Laboratories). Western Blot Analysis—Isolated islets were homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentrations of lysates were equalized for loading by total protein assay (Pierce). SDS samples were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was incubated with the indicated antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies. Bands were detected by ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-N-terminal Pdx-1 antiserum (21Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L.M. Wright C.V.E.

Guinea pig anti-insulin, rabbit anti-glucagon, rabbit anti-somatostatin, and rabbit anti-pancreatic polypeptide antibodies were purchased from DakoCytomation Co. Ltd. Rabbit anti-Glut2 antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Goat anti-HNF3β and goat anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). High Fat Diet Experiment—Six-week-old male Irs2 +/+ mice and Irs2 -/- mice were housed in individual cages. They were divided into two groups, a regular chow group and a high fat diet group. The high fat diet was prepared with the following composition: 32% safflower oil, 33.1% casein, 17.6% sucrose, 1.4% vitamins, 9.8% minerals, 5.6% cellulose, 0.5% dl-methionine, as previously described (40Kubota N.

Materials were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Body weight was assessed between 9:00 and 11:00. After 5 weeks of feeding, blood samples were taken from the orbital sinus, and glucose was measured using an automatic blood glucose meter (Glutest Pro; Sanwa Chemical, Nagoya, Japan) between 9:00 and 11:00 in the fed state and after fasting for 16 h from 19:00 to obtain fasted state values. Whole blood was collected and centrifuged in heparinized tubes, and the plasma was stored at -20 °C. Insulin levels were determined using an insulin radioimmunoassay kit (BIOTRAK; Amersham Biosciences) with rat insulin as a standard (40Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K.

The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by Student's t test (two-tailed). Expression of Pdx-1 in Irs2-/- Murine β-Cells—Pdx-1 mRNA levels were measured in islets from Irs2 -/- mice by real time quantitative PCR. This study did not yield conclusive results, because Pdx-1 mRNA levels in Irs2 -/- murine islets were unchanged when β-actin and GAPDH were used as an internal standard and were increased when cyclophillin was used (Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis also showed that Pdx-1 protein was not decreased in isolated islets from Irs2 -/- mice (Fig. 1b). In addition, immunohistochemical studies revealed Pdx-1 protein to be equally expressed in the nuclei of Irs2 -/- murine β-cells at 8 weeks of age, as compared with those of Irs2 +/+ mice (Fig. 2). These results suggested the IRS-2 signal to not always be required for normal Pdx-1 expression. Expression of Pdx-1-regulating Transcription Factor Genes in Irs2-/- Murine β-Cells—HNF3β and HNF1α reportedly regulate the expression of Pdx-1 in vivo and in vitro (33Shih D.Q. Heimesaat M.

HNF3β protein expression was not reduced in islets from 8-week-old Irs2 -/- mice (Fig. 3b).

The immunohistochemical results with anti-insulin, anti-Glut2, and anti-Nkx6.1 antibodies showed expression of these three proteins to be well preserved in Irs2 -/- murine islets, consistent with our previous observation that both glucose-induced insulin secretion and insulin contents were preserved (11Kubota N.

Real time quantitative PCR study also indicated that Glut2 and Nkx6.1 mRNA expressions to not be decreased (Fig. 4e). The Effect of Hyperglycemia Induced by Aging or a High Fat Diet on Pdx-1 Expression in Irs2-/- Murine β-Cells—Irs2-/- mice progressively develop hyperglycemia starting at 10 weeks (11Kubota N.

Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To clarify the effect of aging or glucose toxicity on Pdx-1 expression, immunohistochemistry was performed on pancreata of 30-week-old diabetic Irs2 -/- mice. Pdx-1 protein was not reduced in the nuclei of β-cells from old Irs2 -/- mice (Fig. 5). Irs2 -/- mice on a high fat diet showed marked aggravation of glucose intolerance with exacerbation of obesity (Table I). Even in this state, the expression of Pdx-1 protein in β-cells, as well as those of downstream genes such as insulin and Glut2, did not show apparent reduction (Fig. 6, A and B).Table ICharacterization of Irs2—/— mice on a regular chow diet or a high fat diet The high fat diet experiment was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six-week-old male Irs2+/+ mice and Irs2—/— mice were given ad libitum access to regular chow or a high fat diet for 5 weeks.

We intercrossed our C57BL/6J background Irs2 -/- mice with mice having a C57BL/6J × 129Sv hybrid background. Irs2 -/- mice with a C57BL/6J × 129Sv hybrid background were divided in two groups based on blood glucose level; some Irs2 -/- mice showed mild hyperglycemia, as did those with only a C57BL/6J background, whereas other Irs2 -/- mice had very severe diabetes, dying due to dehydration with polyuria. Immunohistochemical studies revealed Pdx-1 protein to be generally undetectable as well as insulin in β-cells from these mice, whereas it was well preserved in mildly diabetic Irs2 -/- mice (Fig. 7). The results of this study show Pdx-1 expression not to be down-regulated in β-cells from our Irs2 -/- mice with a C57BL/6J background through real time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis, consistent with our previous report (11Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) showing increased glucose-induced insulin secretion and comparable insulin content in our Irs2 -/- murine islets. In addition, expression of genes lying upstream from Pdx-1, such as HNF3β and HNF1α, as well as that of downstream target genes, including insulin, Glut2, and Nkx6.1, was well preserved in our Irs2 -/- murine β-cells. Then what factors are involved in severely reduced Pdx-1 expression in β-cells from Irs2 -/- mice, as previously reported by another laboratory (37Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V.E. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)? The involvement of glucose toxicity has been suggested. Their Irs2 -/- mice have been reported to show a wide range of fasting blood glucose levels (lower group, 99 ± 4 mg/dl; higher group, 290 ± 22 mg/dl) at 8–10 weeks of age (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20791-20795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas our Irs2 -/- mice show comparatively lower (∼100 mg/dl) levels at 10 weeks of age (11Kubota N. Tobe K. Terauchi Y. Eto K. Yamauchi T. Suzuki R. Tsubamoto Y. Komeda K. Nakano R. Miki H. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M. Aizawa S. Nagai R. Kimura S. Akanuma Y. Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia can down-regulate Pdx-1 expression (44Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 45Harmon J.S. Gleason C.E. Tanaka Y. Oseid E.A. Hunter-Berger K.K. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), thereby impairing β-cell function and further aggravating hyperglycemia. However, our study revealed that, in 30-week-old diabetic Irs2 -/- mice, there was no decrease in Pdx-1 expression in β-cells. In addition, even in Irs2 -/- mice on a high fat diet with blood glucose levels over 400 mg/dl, Pdx-1 expression was not downregulated. Thus, hyperglycemia itself may not be a major factor down-regulating Pdx-1 expression in β-cells from our Irs2 -/- mice. Another difference between their Irs2 -/- mice and ours is the genetic background (C57BL/6J × 129Sv versus C57BL/6J). Some previous reports have demonstrated that genetic backgrounds can affect the severity of phenotype in knockout mouse models (46Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 47Qiu J. Ogus S. Mounzih K. Ewart-Toland A. Chehab F.F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3421-3425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 48Huang H.P. Chu K. Nemoz-Gaillard E. Elberg D. Tsai M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 541-551PubMed Google Scholar). We suspected that certain genetic 129Sv components might be involved in the Pdx-1 expression in Irs2 -/- mice, either directly or indirectly as modifier genes. When our Irs2 -/- mice were crossed with mice having a 129Sv background, a significant proportion of F2 mice developed severe diabetes and died before several months of age, although others remained mildly diabetic and lived at least 1 year. When mildly diabetic F2 mice were crossed with 129Sv, the proportion of severely diabetic Irs2 -/- mice was larger. Thus, certain genetic components in 129Sv mice apparently contribute to the development of severe diabetes (49Terauchi Y. Matsui J. Suzuki R. Kubota N. Komeda K. Aizawa S. Eto K. Kimura S. Nagai R. Tobe K. Lienhard G.E. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14284-14290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We found Pdx-1 expression to be reduced in β-cells from severely diabetic Irs2 -/- mice (Fig. 7). Our data strongly suggest that IRS-2 is not always required for the normal expression and function of Pdx-1, because disruption of IRS-2 did not affect the expression of Pdx-1 and its downstream target genes in our knockout mouse β-cells with a C57BL/6J background even when severe hyperglycemia was induced by a high fat diet. Cross-breeding experiments revealed that Pdx-1 reduction in Irs2 -/- mouse β-cells is a strain-dependent phenomenon. Kushner et al. (37Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V.E. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Pdx-1 expression is already reduced in their Irs2 -/- islets at birth, suggesting that Pdx-1 expression in β-cells is regulated via IRS-2 signaling in their mouse models. Considering their results and ours, when the genetic 129Sv components are present, IRS-2 might regulate the expression of Pdx-1. Another hypothesis is that certain 129Sv-related genetic elements may be involved in Pdx-1 reduction by enhancing the inhibitory effect of chronic hyperglycemia on the expression of Pdx-1, since Pdx-1 is a potential target of the glucose toxicity (44Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 50Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patanè G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14112-14121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This hypothesis might explain the mechanisms of age-related intense aggravation on β-cell dysfunction in their Irs2 -/- mice (9Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 10Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L.

Then what common pathways are responsible for β-cell growth failure in their and our Irs2 -/- mice? β-cell-specific constitutively active Akt-1 transgenic mice reportedly have an increased β-cell mass (19Tuttle R.L. Gill N.S. Pugh W. Lee J.P. Koeberlein B. Furth E.E. Polonsky K.S. Naji A. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 20Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wen W. Stahlhut S. Welling C. Permutt M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1631-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and suggest the involvement of IRS-2/Akt pathway in β-cell mass regulation (51Jetton T.L. Liu Y.Q. Trotman W.E. Nevin P.W. Sun X.-J. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 2056-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Foxo1 pathway might also be involved in β-cell growth failure in Irs2 -/- mice. In addition to its role in metabolic regulation, Foxo1 might be involved in β-cell growth regulation as a downstream effector of IRS-2/Akt (52Nakae J. Biggs W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V.E. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that Pdx-1 reduction in Irs2 -/- murine β-cells is a strain-dependent event, and, at least with a C57BL/6J background, IRS-2 is not a major regulator of Pdx-1 expression in mouse β-cells. The mechanisms of β-cell growth failure, which is commonly observed in Irs2 -/- mice with any background, should be distinguished from insulin secretory dysfunction with Pdx-1 reduction.

In order to understand the receptor specificity of T1E, a chimeric ligand constructed by the introduction of the linear N-terminal region of TGFα into EGF, we determined in this study the solution structure and dynamics of T1E by multidimensional NMR analysis. Subsequently, we studied the structural characteristics of T1E binding to both ErbB1 and ErbB3 by superposition modeling of its structure on the known crystal structures of ErbB3 and liganded ErbB1 complexes. The results show that the overall structure of T1E in solution is very similar to that of native EGF and TGFα but that its N terminus shows an extended structure that is appropriately positioned to form a triple β-sheet with the large antiparallel β-sheet in the B-loop region. This conformational effect of the N terminus together with the large overall flexibility of T1E, as determined by 15N NMR relaxation analysis, may be a facilitative property for its broad receptor specificity.

The ErbB signaling network is composed of the ErbB1 (or EGFR), ErbB2 (HER2/Neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4) tyrosine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, these receptors dimerize into a variety of homodimeric and heterodimeric receptor complexes whereby the intrinsic kinases become activated, which results in a cascade of second messengers and a diversity of subsequent downstream signaling (1Alroy I.

Recent crystallographic studies have boosted this field of research by providing a wealth of information on the structure of ErbB-ligand complexes (6Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C.

A critical step in ErbB receptor signaling is the binding of EGF-like ligands to the extracellular domain of the receptor. More than a dozen soluble ligands have been identified that can be categorized into three distinct groups. A first group, composed of epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; NRG, neuregulin; Mut, methanol utilization; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect enhancement spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; NRG, neuregulin; Mut, methanol utilization; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect enhancement spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square. transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), and amphiregulin, binds specifically to ErbB1. A second group consists of neuregulin (NRG) with its multiple isoforms, which have specific affinity for ErbB3 and ErbB4. A third group binds to both ErbB1 and ErbB4 and is composed of β-cellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and epiregulin (8Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 9Harari D. Tzahar E. Romano J. Shelly M. Pierce J.H. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). For ErbB2, no soluble ligand has been identified, but it forms the preferred dimerization partner for all other members of the ErbB family. Despite having distinct receptor binding specificity, all ErbB growth factors have an EGF-like domain as a common motif, which is defined by three disulfide bridges that generate three looped regions, designated the A-, B-, and C-loop, in addition to linear N and C termini. A single hinge residue between the fourth and fifth cysteine divides the EGF-like ligand into an N- and C-terminal half, each with a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. For several ligands, including EGF, TGFα, NRG-1α, and betacellulin, solution structures have been determined by NMR analysis under a variety of experimental conditions (10Hommel U. Harvey T.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34913-34917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), ErbB3 in unliganded form (17Cho H.S. Leahy D.J.

The last two structures established the relative orientation of the four domains in the extracellular part of the receptor and confirmed earlier observations that both EGF and TGFα bind a single ErbB1 receptor molecule, which subsequently dimerizes to form a 2:2 complex. Moreover, these studies indicated that specific residues in the B-loop region of EGF and TGFα are involved in binding to the first extracellular domain (domain I) of the ErbB1 receptor, whereas several residues in the A-loop, C-loop, and C terminus are in close contact with the third extracellular domain (domain III). Unlike EGF, also residues in the N terminus of TGFα directly contact the receptor in domain I. Site-directed mutagenesis and phage display studies have identified amino acids that have only limited freedom of mutation and are thought to be involved directly in receptor binding (18Van Zoelen E.J. Stortelers C. Lenferink A.E. Van de Poll M.L. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 99-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For EGF and TGFα binding to ErbB1, these highly conserved residues are located around the second and sixth cysteine and in the C terminus (19Campion S.R. Niyogi S.K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In contrast, for NRG binding to ErbB3, hydrophobic and charged residues located in the N terminus and B-loop appear of primary importance (21Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H.

Supposing that all EGF-like ligands bind their respective ErbB receptor in a similar orientation, it appears that domain I of ErbB3 contributes mostly to ligand specificity, whereas for ErbB1 this is located in domain III (24Singer E. Landgraf R. Horan T. Slamon D. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44266-44274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to study ligand binding specificity, we have previously used a domain exchange strategy between EGF and TGFα and shown that replacing the N-terminal linear region of EGF with that from TGFα results in a chimera, designated here as T1E, with unique ErbB binding specificity. T1E not only maintains high affinity for ErbB1, the natural receptor for both EGF and TGFα, but has in addition gained the ability to bind to ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimers with nearly identical affinity as NRG-1 (26Stortelers C. van de Poll M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutation analysis showed that the TGFα residues His4 and Phe5 in the N terminus and the EGF residue Leu28 at the tip of the B-loop are essential for the high affinity of T1E for ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimers. Replacement of Leu28 for the Glu residue present at the equivalent position in TGFα strongly impaired binding to ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimers without affecting binding to ErbB1 (26Stortelers C. van de Poll M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the combination of residues in the N terminus of TGFα and in the B-loop region of EGF mediate the enhanced binding affinity for ErbB2·ErbB3 heterodimers. High affinity binding requires a proper three-dimensional structure of the ligand in combination with specific residues in the receptor binding domain. In order to understand the altered receptor specificity of T1E compared with EGF and TGFα, we have studied structure and dynamics of T1E by twoand three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques. Subsequently, we modeled the interaction of T1E with both the ErbB1 and ErbB3 receptors, on the basis of the recently published crystal structures of the extracellular regions of ErbB3 (17Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and the EGF·ErbB1 and TGFα·ErbB1 complexes (6Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 7Ogiso H.

Using these models, the specific roles of residues in the N terminus and B-loop of T1E in ErbB2·ErbB3 interaction were analyzed. Construction of T1E Expression Vector—To produce sufficient amounts of T1E for NMR analysis, we used the Pichia pastoris protein expression system (Invitrogen). Thereto, T1E was cloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZαA. A gene construct encoding the human TGFα/EGF chimera T1E, previously described by Stortelers et al. (26Stortelers C. van de Poll M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was used as a template for the amplification of the T1E fragment by PCR. The primers used for PCR introduced an XhoI and a SalI restriction site permitting directional cloning of the amplified DNA in frame with the α-factor leader sequence in the pPICZαA expression vector. A stop codon preceding the SalI site prevented expression of the His tag. The amplified fragment was first subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO® cloning vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant TOPO vector was digested with XhoI-SalI to generate a 189-bp fragment, which was subsequently introduced into the pPICZαA expression vector using its XhoI-SalI sites. The correctness of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Approximately 7 μg of the DNA construct were linearized with BstXI prior to transformation of P. pastoris X33 (Mut+) and KM71H (MutS) cells. The electroporation method of the EasySelect™ Pichia expression kit (version F; Invitrogen) was used for transformation, and the transformants were plated on MD and MM agar plates to screen for methanol utilization (Mut) phenotype. Several Mut+ and MutS clones were put on plates with very high zeocin concentrations (up to 1 mg/ml) to select for the so-called “jackpot” clones with multiple integrations. Southern blotting was used to confirm the presence of multiple integrations in the genome of selected high zeocinresistant colonies. In small scale expression screens, the expression levels showed to be proportional to the number of integrations. A Mut+ clone with multiple integrations was selected for large scale expression and 15N labeling. Expression of Recombinant 15N-labeled T1E in P. pastoris—To produce 15N-labeled T1E, we slightly modified the protocol of Wiles et al. (27Wiles A.P. Shaw G. Bright J. Perczel A. Campbell I.D. Barlow P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, 25 ml of BMG culture medium (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 0.00004% (w/v) biotin, and 1% (w/v) ammonium sulfate) were inoculated with a fresh colony of the selected Mut+ clone and grown overnight while shaking at 30 °C to midlogarithmic phase. The culture was scaled up to 500-ml batches of BMG medium without ammonium sulfate but containing 0.1% (w/v) 15N-labeled ammonium chloride as its sole nitrogen source (99% 15N; Campro Scientific, Veenendaal, The Netherlands) in 2-liter baffled flasks. After overnight culture, the cells were transferred to 500 ml of BMM induction medium (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids or ammonium sulfate, 0.5% (v/v) methanol, 0.00004% (w/v) biotin, and 1% (w/v) 15N-labeled ammonium chloride) and grown for 9 days with additional supplies of methanol every 24 h. The minimal amount of nitrogen source needed for optimal protein production was determined to be 0.1% in the growth medium and 1% in the induction medium. Protein Purification—The P. pastoris culture supernatant was subjected to cation exchange chromatography (SP-Toyopearl 550C, Tosoh Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0.2-1.0 m NaCl in 0.05 m NaAc). The fractions were tested for binding affinity to ErbB1 by an 125I-mouse EGF binding competition assay as previously described by van de Poll et al. (28van de Poll M.L. Lenferink A.E. van Vugt M.J. Jacobs J.J. Janssen J.W. Joldersma M. van Zoelen E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22337-22343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and analyzed in parallel by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody (Ab-3) raised against recombinant wild type human EGF (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA). Specific antibody binding was detected by a goat anti-rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Fractions positive for ErbB1 binding and displaying only a single band on Western blot were collected, dialyzed against 0.2 m HAc, and lyophilized. After resolubilization in 0.5 m HAc, the protein was finally purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Deltapak C18 column (Waters Associates, Milford, CT). Elution was carried out using a linear gradient of 20-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetate. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the purified protein was identified as 15N-labeled T1E-(1-54) lacking the C-terminal arginine. The fractions corresponding to the main peak were collected, and the volume was reduced using speedvac centrifugation and subsequently dialyzed against double distilled water to remove remaining traces of organic solvents and finally against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. We thus obtained ∼13 mg of uniformly 15N-labeled T1E/liter of culture medium. The labeled material was biologically indistinguishable from the E. coli-derived T1E described previously (26Stortelers C. van de Poll M.L. Lenferink A.E. Gadellaa M.M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Structure Determination—The NMR sample was prepared to contain 0.8 mm protein in 95% H2O, 5% D2O (v/v), in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) with 20 μg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science). NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K on Varian Unity Inova spectrometers operating at 800- and 600-MHz 1H resonance frequencies. The following multidimensional experiments were recorded and analyzed: 15N HSQC, HNHA, HNHB, two-dimensional TOCSY, two-dimensional NOESY, 15N TOCSY, 15N NOESY, and 15N-filtered TOCSY (for both the aromatic and the aliphatic region). All spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using NMRPipe software (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar). Backbone and side chain resonances were assigned using XEASY (30Bartels C.H. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) peaks from the two- and three-dimensional NOESY spectra were classified either as very weak, weak, medium, or strong with an upper distance restraint of 7.0, 5.0, 3.5, and 2.8 Å, respectively. Structure calculations were performed using the program XPLOR 3.851 (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.851: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3 J(HNH)-coupling constants, which were measured by a three-dimensional HNHA experiment (32Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Subsequently, additional [phis] and ψ angle restraints were predicted using TALOS (33Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar), resulting in a total of 98 dihedral angle restraints. To improve local geometry and electrostatics, the lowest energy structures were refined in water using a restrained molecular dynamics protocol under a CHARMM22 force field (34Spronk C.A. Linge J.P. Hilbers C.W. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The resulting ensemble of 36 structures was evaluated with MOLMOL (35Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (51-55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6477) Google Scholar), PROCHECK-NMR (36Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Figures were produced using the programs RasTop and MOLMOL. Structural data for comparison with the T1E structure were taken from Protein Data Bank entries 1YUG for the NMR structure of TGFα (14Moy F.J. Li Y.C. Rauenbuehler P. Winkler M.E. Scheraga H.A.

Relaxation Measurements— 15N longitudinal relaxation rate R 1, the 15N transverse relaxation rate R 1ρ, and the steady-state {1H}-15N NOE were measured at 298 K at 14.1 tesla field strength. R 1 relaxation rates were determined from a series of six interleaved spectra recorded with relaxation delays of 0.016, 0.128, 0.256, 0.512, 0.768, and 1.024 s. For the determination of R 1ρ relaxation rates, six spectra were recorded in an interleaved manner with relaxation delays of 0.016, 0.032, 0.048, 0.064, 0.112, and 0.128 s. An overall rotational correlation time (τc) was first estimated from the mean ratio R 1ρ/R 1 and optimized to 5.4 ns using a grid search routine of the Modelfree program. This value is higher than expected for a monomeric 54-amino acid protein at 298 K and probably results from (partial) aggregation, since at concentrations above 0.8 mm the sample started to precipitate. Using the optimized τc value, the backbone dynamics were further analyzed on a per residue basis by Lipari-Szabo analysis (38Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3377) Google Scholar, 39Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) using the program Modelfree 4.01 (40Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We analyzed the generalized order parameter (S 2), which is correlated with backbone rigidity, the internal correlation time (τe), which is the time scale of internal motion (picosecond to nanosecond), and the chemical exchange contribution R ex describing motions on millisecond to microsecond time scale. Homology Modeling and Structural Superposition Modeling—To compare binding of T1E to the extracellular domains of ErbB1 and ErbB3, we built structural superposition models of T1E·ErbB1 domain I and T1E·ErbB3 domain I. Structures of T1E and ErbB1 domain I were available (1P9J (this paper) and 1MOX), but the crystal structure of ErbB3 (1M6B) published by Cho and Leahy (17Cho H.S. Leahy D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 1330-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) lacks the N-terminal 35 residues. To compensate for this lack of structural information, we first built a homology model of this region (residues 5-35) of ErbB3 by assuming that it has a similar structure as the corresponding region in ErbB1. In order to do so, sequences of ErbB1 domain I and ErbB3 domain I were aligned using ClustalW (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar), which showed that this region of these two receptors has a sequence identity of 29.0% and a sequence similarity of 67.7%. The crystal structure of domain I of ErbB1 (1MOX) was subsequently used as a template structure for homology modeling with the program WHAT-IF (37Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation and Quality—Using a series of homo-nuclear and heteronuclear NMR experiments, 1H and 15N resonance assignments were obtained for T1E using the Wüthrich sequential assignment protocol (42Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The proton resonance assignments were mainly derived from two-dimensional TOCSY and two-dimensional NOESY spectra, whereas a three-dimensional 15N NOESY spectrum was used to identify the sequential 15N resonances of backbone amide groups and to verify the obtained proton resonance assignments. From the NOE spectra, a set of 660 NOEs was collected, composed of 309 intraresidual, 194 sequential, 67 medium range, and 90 long range NOEs. This resulted in an average of 12.2 distance restraints per residue. Additional constraints included nine hydrogen bonding restraints, three constraints from the disulfide bridges, and 98 [phis] and ψ angle restraints. We calculated an ensemble of 36 high resolution NMR structures of T1E. A superposition of this ensemble in two different orientations is shown in stereo view in Fig. 1a. The structural statistics are listed in Table I. All accepted structures contained neither distance violations greater than 0.5 Å nor angle violations greater than 5° from experimental data.

https://openalex.org/W1994047438,"Betaretroviruses encode dUTPase, an essential factor in DNA metabolism and repair, in the pro open reading frame located between gag and pol. Ribosomal frame-shifts during expression of retroviral proteins provide a unique possibility for covalent joining of nucleocapsid (NC) and dUTPase within Gag-Pro polyproteins. By developing an antibody against the prototype betaretrovirus Mason-Pfizer monkey virus dUTPase, we demonstrate that i) the NC-dUTPase fusion protein exists both within the virions and infected cells providing the only form of dUTPase, and ii) the retroviral protease does not cleave NC-dUTPase either in the virion or in vitro. We show that recombinant betaretroviral NC-dUTPase and dUTPase are both inefficient catalysts compared with all other dUTPases. Dynamic light scattering and gel filtration confirm that the homotrimeric organization, common among dUTPases, is retained in the NC-dUTPase fusion protein. The betaretroviral dUTPase has been crystallized and single crystals contain homotrimers. Oligonucleotide and Zn2+ binding is well retained in the fusion protein, which is the first example of acquisition of a functional nucleic acid binding module by the DNA repair factor dUTPase. Binding of the hexanucleotide ACTGCC or the octanucleotide (TG)4 to NC-dUTPase modulates enzymatic function, indicating that the low catalytic activity may be compensated by adequate localization.

The ubiquitous enzyme dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) 1The abbreviations used are: dUTPase, dUTP pyrophosphatase; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; M-PMV, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus; NC, nucleocapsid; DTT, dithiothreitol; CD, circular dichroism. is unique in its capacity to prevent incorporation of uracil into DNA (1Pearl L.H. Savva R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). dUTPase produces the dTTP precursor dUMP and decreases cellular dUTP levels, its lack leads to an elevated dUTP/dTTP ratio and DNA with a high content of uracil. Excision repair of uracil-DNA results in a futile cycle because of the low cellular dTTP content. Subsequently, multiple double-stranded DNA breaks and thymine-less cell death occur (2Goulian M. Bleile B.M. Dickey L.M. Grafstrom R.H. Ingraham H.A. Neynaber S.A. Peterson M.S. Tseng B.Y. Adv. Exp. Med.

Null mutations in retroviral dUTPase gene affect viral growth only in non-dividing cells (e.g. macrophages) (6Threadgill D.S. Steagall W.K. Flaherty M.T. Fuller F.J. Perry S.T. Rushlow K.E.

Virology. 1995; 210: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consequently, viral dUTPases are subjects of medical interest. Retroviral dUTPase genes are located in non-primate lentiviruses and betaretroviruses at different genomic locations (10Baldo A.M. McClure M.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7710-7721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11McClure M.A. Johnson M.S. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lentiviral dUTPase genes are in the pol open reading frame between reverse transcriptase and integrase genes, although in betaretroviruses, the 5′-portion of the pro frame encodes dUTPase. Virion lysates show dUTPase activity, indicating enzyme encapsulation in the virion (13Elder J.H. Lerner D.L. Hasselkus-Light C.S. Fontenot D.J. Hunter E. Luciw P.A. Montelaro R.C. Phillips T.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In betaretroviruses mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (14Moore R. Dixon M. Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 480-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) (15Sonigo P. Barker C. Hunter E. Wain-Hobson S. Cell. 1986; 45: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), two ribosomal frameshifts between gag and pro and pro and pol frames occur, yielding Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins. The first frameshift may give rise to a transframe fusion protein joining the nucleocapsid (NC) and dUTPase polypeptides. Such a fusion protein is present in MMTV (16Koppe B. Menendez-Arias L. Oroszlan S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2313-2319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency of recombinant MMTV NC-dUTPase was, however, low compared with lentiviral or other dUTPases (16Koppe B. Menendez-Arias L. Oroszlan S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2313-2319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bergman A.C. Bjornberg O. Nord J. Nyman P.O. Rosengren A.M. Virology. 1994; 204: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The low activity was attributed to the harmful replacement of a strongly conserved tyrosine by phenylalanine in a dUTPase sequence motif (12McGeoch D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4105-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this motif, Tyr is important for enzyme function (18Vertessy B.G. Zalud P. Nyman P.O. Zeppezauer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Vertessy B.G. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Zeppezauer M. Nyman P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This natural Tyr to Phe substitution prevented an independent assessment of the role of the NC domain on dUTPase activity in the MMTV transframe protein. Eukaryotic, bacterial, and retroviral (EuBaR) dUTPases are homotrimers with three active sites, each of which is constructed by conserved sequence motifs from all the three subunits (20Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. Laco G.S. Hasselkus-Light C. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A.

Biol. 1999; 285: 655-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This architecture, unique among enzymes and conserved in EuBaR dUTPases despite a low sequence similarity, provides a strong dependence of catalytic activity upon oligomerization. The nucleocapsid domain of NC-dUTPase adding 81 amino acids to the 153-residue monomer of dUTPase represents a significant N-terminal extension in the fusion protein. This might interfere with the organization of the N-terminal β-strand of M-PMV dUTPase. In human, Escherichia coli and lentiviral enzyme crystal structures, this segment contributes to cohesive intersubunit forces by making H-bonded contact with the C-terminal β-strand of the neighboring subunit (20Prasad G.S. Stura E.A. McRee D.E. Laco G.S. Hasselkus-Light C. Elder J.H. Stout C.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainer J.A.

Biol. 1999; 285: 655-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is therefore of importance to investigate the oligomerization properties of the transframe protein in relation to the enzymatic activity. Retroviral dUTPases may combine enzymatic function with localization and architectural roles by recruiting additional domains for interaction with nucleic acids. We have, therefore, set out to investigate the presence of NC-dUTPase in the mature M-PMV virion, together with its structural and functional characterization. We selected M-PMV instead of MMTV to circumvent the problem of Tyr to Phe replacement present in MMTV, but not in M-PMV (15Sonigo P. Barker C. Hunter E. Wain-Hobson S. Cell. 1986; 45: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We have identified NC and NC-dUTPase in Western blots of M-PMV virions and determined their relative amounts. To assess the relative influence of the NC domain on dUTPase activity, we generated expression systems for the fusion protein as well as for dUTPase separate from the NC segment. NC-dUTPase and dUTPase were purified to homogeneity, and characterized with respect to protein structure and kinetic properties. The role of the NC segment and oligonucleotide binding in modulating dUTPase activity was investigated. Single crystals of M-PMV dUTPase suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis were generated. NC-dUTPase is shown to possess intact homotrimeric organization, ability to interact with oligonucleotides and an inherent low dUTPase activity that might be modulated upon oligonucleotide binding to the NC segment. Electrophoretic materials and Chelex were from Bio-Rad, chromatographic materials from Amersham Biosciences, Phenol Red indicator from Merck, and other materials of analytical grade from Sigma. Molecular biology materials were from Stratagene, unless stated otherwise. Plasmids, Vectors, and Bacterial Strains—The plasmid FPpSARM4, containing the whole M-PMV genome with one nucleotide insertion within frameshifting sequence between gag and pro genes, was used as a template for PCR amplification of M-PMV dUTPase and NC-dUTPase genes. The plasmid pET22b (Novagen) in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was used for protein expression. E. coli strains DH5α and XL1-Blue were used for plasmid amplification. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by Generi Biotech, Hradec Králové Czech Republic, and Biological Research Center in Szeged, Hungary. DNA manipulations were carried out by common techniques (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. M-PMV dUTPase gene was amplified by PCR using the FPpSARM4 template and the primers 5′-dUTP, 5′-CCACCCCACATATGAAACGGGTGGAG-3′ (NdeI site fused into the start ATG codon in bold) and 3′-dUTP, TAGGCTCGAGTTAATATATGTCTGA (XhoI site and stop codon in bold). Double-digested PCR fragment was purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit) and ligated into pET22b. The resulting recombinant plasmid was named dUTPase/pET22b. For better codon usage in bacterial expression systems, two silent mutations were introduced to replace CGGArg with CGT Arg as well as GGGGly with GGT Gly using the primers 5′-RGdUTP: GAGATATACATATGAAACGTGTGGAGGGTCCAGC, and 3′-dUTP, and dUTPase/pET22b as a template to give plasmid RGdUTPase/pET22b. M-PMV NC-dUTPase gene was amplified using FPpSARM4 as template and the primers 5′-NCdUTP AAGGCCTGCATATGGCCGCCGCCT and 3′-dUTP to result in the plasmid NC-dUTPase/pET22b. Expression and Purification of Recombinant NC-dUTPase and dUTPase—E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (25Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) cells transformed with the plasmids were propagated till exponential growth, then induced by 0.5 mm iso-propyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested three to four hours post-induction and stored at -70 °C. Subsequent manipulations were carried out on ice. For purification of M-PMV dUTPase, cell pellets were solubilized in 1/10 volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml RNase and DNase). Cell suspensions were stirred for 30 min, sonicated (3-5 × 60 s), and centrifuged (18,000 × g for 20 min). Supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and loaded on a CM-Sepharose or SP-Sepharose ion exchange column (200 ml) equilibrated in the same buffer, and developed in a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl. dUTPase eluted at 0.5-0.6 m NaCl, as followed by enzyme activity measurements and SDS-PAGE. Concentrated enzyme fractions were gel filtrated on Superdex 200 HR column using 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) also containing 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2. Cell pellets for purification of M-PMV NC-dUTPase were solubilized as above, but in lysis buffer containing 5 mm DTT. Supernatants were directly loaded on a HiTrap Heparin HP column (5 ml), equilibrated in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and developed using 200 ml of a linear gradient up to 1 m NaCl. NC-dUTPase appeared at 0.35-0.5 m NaCl. Superdex 200 HR column gel filtration was carried out in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) containing 500 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm MgCl2. The purified preparations appeared as single bands on SDS-PAGE, gel densitometry suggested at least 95% purity. Enzyme stocks were concentrated on Millipore centrifugal filters (10 kDa cutoff) to a final concentration of 5-15 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. As shown by activity measurements and SDS-PAGE, this storage did not cause considerable degradation up to three months, but precipitation became prominent after cycles of freeze/thaw. Throughout the present study, molar enzyme concentrations refer to the monomeric species, unless stated otherwise. Before use, aliquots of the enzyme were dialyzed against respective buffers. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford's assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or spectrophotometrically using A0.1% 1 cm, 280 nm = 0.74 or 0.76 for NC-dUTPase, or dUTPase, respectively, as calculated from amino acid composition. UV absorbance spectra were recorded on a JASCO-V550 spectrophotometer at 25 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) also containing 500 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm MgCl2. dUTPase Activity Assay by Thin Layer Chromatography—Reactions were with 1 μm dUTPase in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm of either dUTP, dCTP, or dTTP. At time points, 0.5-1 μl of the reaction mixtures was spotted on Baker-flex silica gel IB2-F thin layer plates. Plates were developed in 6:3:1 iso-propanol/NH3/H2O, resulting in approximate retention values in percent of distance traveled from start point related to total distance traveled by the eluent of 40, 11, and 5% for dNMP, dNDP, and dNTP, respectively. Spots were visualized under UV light. Continuous Spectrophotometric dUTPase Activity Assay—Proton release during the transformation of dUTP into dUMP and PPi was followed at 559 nm at 25 °C (19Vertessy B.G. Persson R. Rosengren A.M. Zeppezauer M. Nyman P.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using a JASCO-V550 spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures contained 240 nm enzyme in 1 mm Tes-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 40 μm dUTP, 0.1-5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 40 μm Phenol Red indicator (assay buffer). Initial velocity was determined from the slope of the first 10 s of the progress curve. The enzyme kinetic parameters k cat and K M were also determined from the entire progress curve using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (27Vertessy B.G. Proteins. 1997; 28: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Metal ion requirement was tested in separate experiments, using components run through a 50-ml Chelex column (1 ml/min flow rate). Dynamic Light Scattering—Measurements were carried out on a DynaPro-MS/X molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc., VA) with a 20-μl micro-sampling cell at 20 °C, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sample contained 1.1 mg/ml protein in 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm ZnCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. An aliquot of 25 μl was freshly filtered (0.02 μm Whatman Anodisc (Whatman, UK)) into the measurement cell. One hundred readings were recorded, and the data were analyzed using the non-negatively constrained least squares method (29Morrison I.D. Grabowski E.F. Herb C.A. Langmuir. 1985; 1: 496-501Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) incorporated into the DYNAMICS version 5.20.05. The analysis is based on the Stokes-Einstein equation (DT = kbT/6 Pi (SV)RH), under the assumption of Brownian motion. DT (translational diffusion coefficient) was converted to the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the sample particles (kb is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, Pi is the value of the constant Pi, and (SV) is the solvent viscosity). Polydispersity was defined as (standard deviation of RH)/RH, giving an estimation of the homogeneity of particle sizes in the sample (30Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Burley S.K. Structure. 1994; 2: 357-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Analytical Gel Filtration—A Superdex 200 HR column, calibrated with transferrin, ovalbumin, myoglobin, and RNase (molecular masses: 81, 43, 17.6, and 13.7 kDa, respectively). 500 μl samples were applied at 0.1-1.0 mg/ml protein concentrations. Exclusion volume was determined by using blue dextran. PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using 12-18% minigels. Protein bands were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) and quantitated on a GelDoc densitometer (Bio-Rad). Native PAGE on Novex 10% polyacrylamide gel pre-casted with Tris borate-EDTA buffer (Invitrogen) was run in reverse direction in 0.2 m sodium-acetate buffer (pH 4.5). Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Far UV CD spectra were recorded on protein samples at 0.2 mg/ml concentration in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm DTT. 1-4 μl aliquots of concentrated and buffered Zn(Ac)2 solution were added in the cuvette to reach the final concentrations. Three scans were averaged. N-terminal Microsequencing—Protein samples blotted on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane were analyzed at the Analysis and Synthesis Laboratory of the Agricultural Biotechnological Research Center of Gödöllö, Hungary on ABI 471A of Applied Biosystems, Inc. Antiserum Production and Western Blotting—Rabbits were immunized with recombinant M-PMV dUTPase. For the first injection, antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant was injected into the muscle of the upper thigh of the animals. The second injection was carried out 3 weeks later using incomplete Freund's adjuvant, followed by boosting at a 2-week interval, using antigen solution in physiological saline. Serum was used at a dilution of 1:50,000 in Western blots on nitrocellulose membranes. Antisera against M-PMV NC and capsid proteins were kindly provided by Dr. T. Ruml from the Institute of Chemical Technology, Prague, Czech Republic. Blots were stained first with Ponceau dye and then developed with the antiserum, followed by staining with secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG). For visualization, nitro-blue-tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate or the enhanced chemiluminescence kit of Amersham Biosciences, respectively, was used. Purification of M-PMV Virions—The rhesus monkey CMMT cell line, chronically infected with M-PMV, was grown in Dulbecco's essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium containing released virions was collected from confluent plates and filtrated through a membrane filter (0.45 μm). Virions were pelleted through a 15% (m/vol) sucrose cushion for 1 h at 160,000 × g. The virus pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 500 mm NaCl and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and loaded onto sucrose velocity gradient containing 25-60% (m/vol) sucrose in the same buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and 1 ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Analysis of Virus Proteins in Infected COS-1 Cells—Confluent CMMT cells, chronically infected with M-PMV, were incubated in Cys, Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) (30 min, 37 °C) followed by change into medium containing 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (60 μCi/ml) (ICN) for overnight labeling (31Rumlova M. Ruml T. Pohl J. Pichova I.I. Virology. 2003; 310: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled virus particles were filtered through 0.45 μm polysulfone membrane, and 10 μg/ml of polybrene was added. COS-1 cells were overlaid with the radiolabeled virion mixture and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, washed several times, and complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added. Cells were lysed after 4 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium-deoxycholate, 0.15 m NaCl, mixture protease inhibitor mix, 7 μg/ml DNase, and 15 μg/ml RNase (lysis buffer A). Cell-associated viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysate using the M-PMV dUTPase antiserum and protein A agarose in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Radiolabeled viral proteins from the immunoprecipitate were separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. In a separate experiment, COS-1 cells were infected with non-labeled released virions from confluent CMMT cells in the presence of polybrene (10 μg/ml). Cells were lysed after washing in lysis buffer at different time (1, 2, 4, and 6 h), and cell-associated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot using SuperSignal West-femto sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Cleavage of M-PMV NC-dUTPase Protein by M-PMV Protease in Vitro—The purified NC-dUTPase was dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) containing 300 mm NaCl and 0.01% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and was concentrated to 0.3 mg/ml. Reaction mixture contained 33 μm NC-dUTPase in a total volume of 40 μl and 2 μm M-PMV protease, expressed and purified as described previously (32Zabransky A. Andreansky M. Hruskova-Heidingsfeldova O. Havlicek V. Hunter E. Ruml T. Pichova I. Virology. 1998; 245: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots. Crystallization—Conditions were screened at different temperatures (Crystal Screen, Hampton Research). Vapor diffusion experiments were made in hanging drops against 500 μl reservoir. dUMP was added to the enzyme solution (7.4 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.05) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm DTT) in equimolar amounts (relative to the monomer). Enzyme solutions (2 μl) were mixed with an equal amount of the reservoir solution. Preliminary X-ray Analysis—Synchrotron radiation was used to collect diffraction data at 100 K from a cryoprotected flash-frozen crystal. Measurements were carried out at beam ID29 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using ADSC Q210 CCD detector. Cell parameters and crystal system were determined by MOSFLM 6.01 program (33Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4+ ESF-EAMCB, Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). Matthews coefficient and solvent content of the crystal were calculated with the CCP4 program suite (34Collaborative Computational Project Number 4The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography, Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Antibody Production— Fig. 1A shows the expression patterns of the constructs NC-dUTPase and dUTPase. The yields of the proteins were 120 mg/liter and 30 mg/liter, respectively. This lower yield for dUTPase was considerably improved upon silent mutagenesis of CGGArg and GGGGly (data not shown). DNA sequencing of the plasmids was in complete agreement with the desired sequences, and N-terminal microsequencing of the expressed proteins also gave the expected results (KRVEG for dUTPase, AAAFSGQTVKP for NC-dUTPase). Molecular mass estimated from SDS-PAGE is 16 kDa, and 27 kDa for dUTPase, and NC-dUTPase, respectively. These data indicate that the recombinant constructs faithfully represent the dUTPase and NC-dUTPase proteins of M-PMV retrovirus. Fig. 1B shows the SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins. The faint higher band in the NC-dUTPase lane is due to a cross-linked aggregate of NC-dUTPase as it was shown to react with the antibody developed against M-PMV dUTPase (Fig. 1E). No cross-reactivity of this polyclonal serum to dUTPases from other species, or to other proteins was detectable. As an ultimate test of protein purity, Fig. 1C demonstrates that single crystals of purified M-PMV dUTPase can be crystallized. Following several chromatographic steps, the proteins were also practically free from nucleic acid contaminations, as shown by the UV absorbance spectra (Fig. 1D) where the maximum wavelength of absorbance is around 280 nm (characteristic for aromatic amino acid side chains). M-PMV Virions and Infected Cells Contain NC-dUTPase, Resistant to Cleavage with Either M-PMV or Cellular Protease—To determine the status of dUTPase in M-PMV virions, immunoblot analysis of virion-associated proteins from sucrose gradient fractions was performed using antibodies against NC (Fig. 2B) and dUTPase (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis of M-PMV viral proteins using antibodies agains M-PMV capsid revealed that gradient fractions 2-4 (corresponding to 31-39% (m/vol) sucrose, or 1.13-1.17 g/ml density) contained the peak of M-PMV-associated proteins (Fig. 2A). These fractions, when reacted with anti-NC antiserum, were shown to contain NC in two forms, characterized by 27 kDa (at relative amount of 12%) and 13 kDa (at relative amount of 88%) (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). The 27-kDa form co-localizes with the only band showing reactivity with the mono-specific antiserum developed against MPMV dUTPase (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-4). These results indicate that mature M-PMV virions contain the fusion protein NC-dUTPase as the only detectable source of dUTPase, whereas NC protein is present both as fused to dUTPase (27 kDa form) and in free (13 kDa) form. To investigate if M-PMV protease, which cleaves viral polyproteins during maturation, is able to cleave NC-dUTPase under optimal in vitro conditions, purified NC-dUTPase was incubated with recombinant M-PMV protease. Fig. 3, A and B, show that no cleavage of NC-dUTPase occurs even upon prolonged incubation with the protease. It can be concluded that the NC-dUTPase junction is practically fully resistant to proteolysis by the retroviral protease. To determine whether NC-dUTPase might get cleaved by cellular proteases in infected cells, we have analyzed M-PMV cell-associated proteins. Radiolabeled M-PMV virions released from CMMT cells were used to infect COS-1 cells. Viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from COS-1 lysate with rabbit anti-dUTPase. The immunoprecipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 3C, lane 7) to reveal the presence of one significant protein band, migrating at ∼27 kDa. This apparent molecular mass corresponds to the size of the intact NC-dUTPase fusion protein (see Fig. 3C, lane 6). Western blot analysis of COS-1 cell-associated proteins using anti-dUTPase antibody and chemiluminescent substrate also showed one protein band reactive to anti-dUTPase that migrates at 27 kDa (Fi"

Here we report the identification, purification, immunocytochemical localization, and cloning of ACP from the oleaginous yeast, Rhodotorula glutinis. The soluble fraction of this organism can synthesize triacylglycerol and is able to accept the acyl group from acyl-ACP for the synthesis. The ACP, cloned from the system, showed a significant similarity with ribosomal protein P2. Expression and characterization of the recombinant protein showed that the ACP was acylated in vitro. The recombinant protein was post-translationally modified, since it was observed in [14C]β-alanine labeling and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopic analysis. Site-directed mutants were generated to identify a serine residue responsible for phosphopantetheinylation and found that mutation of serine 59 to alanine abrogated the fatty acylation ability of the protein. These results demonstrate that a novel modification of ribosomal protein P2 allows it to act as an acyl carrier protein and participate in acylation reactions.

ACP acts as a carrier for substrates and intermediates from the active site of one enzyme to the other in the fatty acid synthase (1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nonribosomal polypeptide synthetases (2Lipmann F. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1980; 21: 227-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and polyketide synthase (3Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACP is also involved in phospholipid synthesis (4Green P.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11151-11159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 253-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), membrane-bound oligosaccharide synthesis (6Therisod H. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8235-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in Escherichia coli, and host-specific lipochitin oligosaccharide signal molecule synthesis in Rhizobium leguminosarum (7Brozek K.A. Carlson R.W. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32126-32136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of ACP have been identified in plant chloroplasts and are shown to be involved in specific fatty acid synthesis during seed development (8Suh M.C. Schultz D.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1999; 17: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In Neurospora crassa (9Zensen R. Husmann H. Schneider R. Peine T. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and bovine heart (10Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), ACP was identified in mitochondria as a subunit of the respiratory NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nuclear encoded and 19-kDa molecular mass ACP has been reported in mitochondria (11Chuman L. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but this ACP is not part of the respiratory complex (13Schneider R. Massow M. Lisowsky T. Weiss H. Curr. Genet. 1995; 29: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). No distinct low molecular mass nonorganellar ACP has been identified in eukaryotes, and this could be due to the presence of fatty acid synthase multifunctional enzyme (type I). Eukaryotic ACP possesses characteristic organellar import sequence in front of the known core sequence (12Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The overall three-dimensional structure and the amino acid sequences around the phosphopantetheine-binding site of ACP are well conserved (14Vanden-Boom T. Cronan J Jr., E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 317-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Keating M.M. Gong H. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1601: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A soluble triacylglycerol biosynthetic complex (TBC) from oleaginous yeast was isolated, and the individual components were characterized (16Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The complex consists of ACP, acyl-ACP synthetase, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acyltransferase, phosphatidic acid phosphatase, diacylglycerol (DAG) acyltransferase (16Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and superoxide dismutase (17Raychaudhuri S. Reddy M.M. Rajkumar N.R. Rajasekharan R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 587-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acyl-ACP synthetase in the multienzyme complex activates free fatty acids to acyl-ACP in an ATP-dependent manner, and the synthesized acyl-ACP is used as a substrate by TBC (18Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 471-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation in any of the acyltransferases present in TBC or alteration in nutritional content leads to decreased synthesis of triacylglycerol in Rhodotorula glutinis (19Gangar A. Raychaudhuri S. Rajasekharan R. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 577-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the identification, purification, and immunolocalization of a nonorganellar ACP from oleaginous yeast that is an integral part of TBC. Cloning, expression, and subsequent characterization of the protein reveals that it has a sequence homology to ribosomal protein P2. The protein is post-translationally modified to accept free fatty acid, and the acyl-ACP formed can act as acyl group donor in acylation reactions. Alteration of serine 59 to alanine by site-directed mutation abolishes the post-translational modification, and therefore the fatty acid esterification ability is lost in the ACP. Materials—R. glutinis was obtained from the Institute of Microbial Technology (Chandigarh, India) (Microbial Type Culture Collection 1151). Ampicillin, tetracycline, kanamycin, sarcosyl, ACP (E. coli), diaminobenzidine, LPA, DEAE-cellulose, MOPS, benzoylated dialysis tubing, lyticase, poly-l-lysine, and [14C]β-alanine (49 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Sigma. The cDNA library construction kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). [1-14C]Palmitoyl-CoA (51 mCi/mmol), [1-14C]oleic acid (55 mCi/mmol), and [α-32P]dATP/dCTP (30 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction enzymes, deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase, Pfu polymerase, low melting agarose, deoxynucleotidyl triphosphates, Sephadex G-10, G-50, EDTA, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and all other molecular biology reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. The DNA purification kit and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) matrix were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Silica-thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Bangalore Genei (Bangalore, India). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown in malt-yeast extract medium (pH 7.0) containing 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.3% malt extract supplemented with 1% glucose with aeration at 30 °C. Alternatively, cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.2% amino acids (with or without aspartate), and 1% glucose. Cell density was determined by light scattering at 600 nm (one A 600 = 9 × 107 cells). Metabolic Labeling of R. glutinis Cells with [14C]β-Alanine—R. glutinis cells were grown in complete minimal medium (containing all of the amino acids) until early log phase (15 h) and then transferred to aspartate-less minimal medium to which [14C]β-alanine (10 μCi/ml culture) was added and incubated further for 12 h. Cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% sucrose, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and glass bead lysis was performed. Cytosol and TBC were prepared (16Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and resolved on 7% native PAGE and 15% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Enzyme Assays—Acyl-ACP synthetase was assayed, and ACP was quantified as described (20Rock C.O. Cronan J Jr., E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.4 m LiCl, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 25 μm ACP from R. glutinis or E. coli, [1-14C]oleate (100 mm; 0.5 μCi), and E. coli acyl-ACP synthetase (25 milliunits). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and spotted on Whatman 3MM filter discs and washed thrice with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (3/6/1, v/v/v) followed by drying. The radioactivity associated with filter discs was determined in a liquid scintillation counter using a toluene-based scintillation mixture. LPA and DAG acyltransferases and phosphatidic acid phosphatase activities are collectively represented as TAG synthase (16Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This assay was performed by monitoring the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA (100,000 dpm) or [14C]oleoyl ACP (35,000 dpm) into TAG in the presence of the acyl acceptor, LPA. The TAG synthase assay mixture consisted of 5–25 μg of enzyme, 20 μm acyl acceptor, 50 μm LPA in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by lipid extraction (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 31: 911-917Google Scholar). Lipids were separated on silica-TLC plates using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) and visualized by staining with iodine vapor. The spot corresponding to TAG was scraped, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Purification of ACP—Acyl carrier protein was purified from R. glutinis as described (22Rock C.O. Cronan J Jr., E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Late logarithmic phase cells (35 g, wet weight) were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mm leupeptin. The cells were lysed using glass beads (0.45–0.6 mm) in the absence of detergent, and the lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 300 × g for 15 min. Lysate was extracted with isopropyl alcohol followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and acid precipitation. The purity of the protein was monitored on 15% SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis. The purified ACP was used as the substrate for E. coli acyl-ACP synthetase. Antibody Generation and Purification—Antisera were produced against the purified ACP as described earlier (16Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10290-10298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The IgG fraction of the polyclonal antibodies was purified by passing the antisera through a protein A-agarose column after adjusting the pH of the antibody preparation to 8.0 (23Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.0), and the pH was immediately brought back to neutral by the addition of 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). Immunoglobulin fractions were identified by separating them in 10% SDS-PAGE. The titer and the specificity of antibodies were determined by direct and inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (24Engvall E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 419-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). This purified fraction was used for further analysis. The peptide CYVVGAQPFGGARGS, corresponding to DAG acyltransferase, was conjugated to bovine serum albumin using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, and antisera were raised as described (18Gangar A. Karande A.A. Rajasekharan R. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 471-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin fraction from the antisera was precipitated with a 33% saturation of ammonium sulfate, the precipitate was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline, and purity was monitored in 10% SDS-PAGE. This immunoglobulin fraction was kept for further use. Protein was estimated by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purification of Acyl-ACP Synthetase from E. coli—Acyl-ACP synthetase from E. coli was partially purified (26Cooper C.L. Hsu L. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7384-7389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overnight grown E. coli (JM109) cells were lysed by passing through a French pressure cell (Aminco) at 16,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and MgCl2 was added to the supernatant to make a final concentration of 10 mm and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 90 min. The resulting pellets were suspended uniformly in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and NaCl and MgCl2 were added to reach a final concentration of 0.5 m and 10 mm, respectively. The solution was stirred for 15 min and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 90 min. The membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 2%. The suspension was then centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 90 min. ATP was added to the supernatant to make a final concentration of 5 mm and then placed in a 55 °C water bath for 7 min. The solution was cooled and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant was used as the source of the enzyme. Double Immunofluorescence—Logarithmic phase (21-h) R. glutinis cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by 4% formaldehyde for 60 min. The fixed cells were washed three times with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 5.9) and resuspended (107 cells/ml) in 1.2 m sorbitol, and lyticase was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/100 μl of cells. Cells were incubated at 30 °Cfor6hto obtain spheroplasts. The cells were washed, resuspended, and plated onto poly-l-lysine-pretreated slides. The slides were treated with ice-cold methanol for 6 min and acetone for 30 s. Slides were first treated with purified anti-ACP antibodies (1:100 dilution) followed by TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Slides were washed thoroughly with PBST and phosphate-buffered saline and treated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1: 100 dilution) to block the unoccupied sites of primary antibodies. Anti-DAG acyltransferase antibodies (IgG fraction) were added in 1:100 dilution followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. The slides were viewed in a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, TCS SP, Heidelberg, Germany) for localization. Purification of Acyl-ACP—Acyl-ACP formed in the reaction mixture was purified through DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography followed by blue Sepharose column chromatography (27Flaman A.S. Chen J.M. Van Iderstine S.C. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35934-35939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A DEAE (1-ml) column was made and equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The acylation reaction product was loaded onto the column and washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The column was then washed with 50% isopropyl alcohol in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove the unreacted fatty acid. Bound protein was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Acyl-ACP-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions were checked for radioactivity in the case of radioactive assay or run on a 15% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Blue Sepharose column (1 ml) was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2% Triton X-100. The dialyzed fraction from the DEAE column was loaded onto the blue Sepharose column, and flow-through was collected and checked for acyl-ACP. An acyl-ACP (500 μl) sample was taken, 100 μl of 0.5 n NaOH was added to it, and the sample was incubated at 100 °C for 15 min. Reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and neutralized. Lipids were extracted and resolved on a silica-TLC, using petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) as the solvent system followed by autoradiography. Modification of Sulfhydryl Group by Iodoacetate or Iodoacetamide— ACP (wild type or mutant) was taken as 2 mg/ml solution in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. Iodoacetate or iodoacetamide was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (28Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 131-137Google Scholar). Excess reagent was removed by dialysis, and protein was used for enzymatic assay and MALDI mass analysis. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by either native or SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. ACP antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2000 in Western blot analysis and at 1:1000 dilution for cDNA library screening. Ribosome Preparation—Exponential phase R. glutinis cells were pelleted down, resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold 2× buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 16 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm EDTA), and lysed with glass beads. Lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto 10–40% linear sucrose density gradient and centrifuged for 17 h at 20,000 × g. The pellet containing polysome was collected and used for analysis. All of the operations were performed at 4 °C (29Raue H.A. Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 453-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression in E. coli, and Purification of Recombinant ACP—cDNA library was constructed using the cDNA library construction kit and pBK-CMV ZAP expression vector (17Raychaudhuri S. Reddy M.M. Rajkumar N.R. Rajasekharan R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 587-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA library was screened using the purified polyclonal antisera raised against R. glutinis ACP. The positive λ ZAPII phage plaques were excised using a helper phage (ExAssist) and sequenced in both directions using T7 and T3 primers in a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 377). For expression of recombinant ACP in E. coli, a 369-bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of ACP was generated by PCR amplification of the cDNA clone using forward primer (5′-TCTATTCAGCTCCATATGAAGCACGTCGCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GGGGAGAGGCGAGAATTCTCATTAGTCGAAGAG-3′). The forward primer contains a NdeI site followed by the beginning of an open reading frame; the reverse primer contains an EcoRI site and a stop codon after the open reading frame. PCR (1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 45 s of elongation at 72 °C) was performed using Pfu polymerase for 30 cycles with a 10 mm concentration of each primer in a final volume of 100 μl. The purified PCR product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated directionally in predigested pET 21a (Novagen) vector. The construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the insert was sequenced. The transformed E. coli cells were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 4 h, and the cell lysate was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE to look for the expression. Recombinant ACP was purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity column chromatography. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl (buffer A). Cells were disrupted by passing through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. The supernatant (10,000 × g) was allowed to bind to the Ni2+-NTA matrix. The column was washed with buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with NaCl containing 250 mm imidazole. One-milliliter fractions were collected and checked for the presence of protein in 15% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Fractions containing ACP were pooled, dialyzed extensively using benzoylated dialysis tubing, concentrated, and used for further assays. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Wild type ACP template (80 ng), sense, and antisense primers (25 pmol each) were added to PCR tubes containing 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 milliunits of Pfu polymerase, and 1× reaction buffer. Amplification was carried out using the following conditions: denaturation of the template at 94 °C for 4 min followed by 20 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s (denaturation), 52 °C for 1 min (annealing), and 72 °C for 6 min (extension). The reaction was continued for another 20 min at 72 °C to complete the extension. The sequences of sense and antisense primers are described in detail in Table I. The PCR-amplified product was treated with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the methylated template and transformed to E. coli DH5α strain. The presence of mutations was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid.Table IPrimers used in site-directed mutagenesis of the serine residuesSerine positionMutationPrimerS12AT98GSense: 5′-CCTCCTCGTCGCGCCGGCAACA-3′Antisense: 5′-TGTTGCCGGCGCGACGAGGAGG-3′S17AT113GSense: 5′-CGGCAACACCGCGCCCTCGGCCG-3′Antisense: 5′-CGGCCGAGGGCGCGGTGTTGCCG-3′S19AT119GSense: 5′-CACCTCGCCCGCGGCCGAGACG-3′Antisense: 5′-CGTCTCGGCCGCGGGCGAGGTG-3′S40AT182GSense: 5′-GGAGCGCCTCGCGGTCCTCATCA-3′Antisense: 5′-TGATGAGGACCGCGAGGCGCTCC-3′S59AT239GSense: 5′-TGCCGAGGGAGCCAAGAAGCTCG-3′Antisense: 5′-CGAGCTTCTTGGCTCCCTCGGCA-3′S64AT254GSense: 5′-GAAGCTCGCTGCCGTCCCCTCGG-3′Antisense: 5′-CCGAGGGGACGGCAGCGAGCTTC-3′S67AT263GSense: 5′-TTCCGTCCCCGCGGGCGGCGCCG-3′Antisense: 5′-CGGCGCCGCCCGCGGGGACGGAA-3′S100AA361G/G362CSense: 5′-GGATGAGGAGGCCGACGACGACA-3′Antisense: 5′-TGTCGTCGTCGGCCTCCTCATCC-3′ Open table in a new tab Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectroscopic Analysis—Two micrograms of WT or mutant ACP was resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The band of interest was excised from the gel, placed in an acid-washed tube, and dried under vacuum. Then the gel pieces were washed twice with 50 μl of water for 30 min. Then the gel pieces were alternately dehydrated and rehydrated in acetonitrile and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, respectively, until they became white. Trypsin (80 ng/ml in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5) was added to the dry gel pieces and allowed to stand for 45 min on ice. The excess trypsin was removed, and the gel pieces were soaked in a minimum amount of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and incubated overnight at 30 °C. Tryptic fragments were extracted by 50% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried, and suspended in 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and applied to a MALDI sample plate. MALDI mass spectroscopic analysis was performed on a Kratos PCKompact Seq 1.2.2 mass spectrometer in linear mode. The masses obtained were compared with the predicted mass of the tryptic fragments obtained from PeptideMass (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org/tools/peptide-mass). Identification of an ACP—Acyl carrier protein contains a 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, attached to a conserved serine residue as a post-translational modification. Phosphopantetheine is synthesized from aspartate in a two-step reaction, and β-alanine is an intermediate in this pathway (1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To show the presence of ACP in soluble fraction, wild type R. glutinis cells were metabolically labeled with [14C]β-alanine in aspartate-less medium, and cytosol was resolved on a 13% SDS-PAGE. A small ∼14-kDa protein was found to be labeled (Fig. 1A). In another set of experiments, incorporation of [14C]β-alanine in TBC was monitored by isolating TBC from the labeled cells and resolving the purified TBC on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). These experiments suggested that the ∼14-kDa polypeptide that was labeled by β-alanine could be soluble ACP. To estimate the amount of cellular ACP associated with other components of TBC, cytosol was resolved on a 7% native PAGE, and 1-cm fractions were cut from the resolving gel. Protein was eluted, and ACP and TAG synthase activities were measured as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” It was observed that 63% of the total ACP activity was associated with TBC, and the remaining activity was found in free form (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of cytosol with anti-ACP antibodies, after separating in 7% native-PAGE, showed two reactive bands, one at the place of TBC and other at around 14 kDa (Fig. 1C). Purification of ACP—Acyl carrier protein was purified from R. glutinis by treating the cell lysate with isopropyl alcohol where ACP partitioned into the isopropyl alcohol supernatant. The ACP was then adsorbed onto DEAE-cellulose followed by elution with increasing concentrations of salt. The acidic nature of ACP was used to selectively precipitate the protein. ACP was purified to 8-fold with a recovery of only 0.5% (Table II), which could be due to the loss of activity during purification. The activity of ACP was determined by estimating the formation of acyl-ACP, and the specific activity of the purified protein was calculated to be 1.7 nmol/min/mg protein. The purified ACP showed an aberrant mobility on SDS-PAGE, which could be due to the highly acidic nature of the protein (Fig. 1D). The pI was determined to be ∼4 by isoelectric focusing (data not shown). Polyclonal antisera were raised against the purified ACP, and the IgG fraction was purified by a protein A-agarose column. In Western blot analysis with cytosol, the purified antibodies recognized a polypeptide of 14 kDa (Fig. 1E). The antiserum was titrated against 1 μg of immobilized ACP. The 50% inhibitory binding was found at a 1:600 dilution of the antibodies. Inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed using the same dilution of antiserum and different concentrations of the purified ACP. The binding (50%) was achieved with 2.6 μm protein (Fig. 1F).Table IIPurification of ACP from R. glutinisVolumeSpecific activityTotal activityYieldPurificationmlnmol/min/mgnmol/min%-foldCell-free extract1000.2216.151001.00Isopropyl alcohol supernatant1500.3810.18631.73DEAE-cellulose300.432.71171.96Acid precipitation0.551.70.0750.467.73 Open table in a new tab Immunocytochemical Localization of ACP in TBC—To determine whether ACP colocalizes with other components of TBC, double immunostaining experiments were performed. This involves the probing of the spheroplasts of oleaginous yeast cells with anti-ACP and anti-DAG acyltransferase antibodies. Confocal analysis revealed a substantial colocalization of both the proteins in cytosol (yellow color in Fig. 2c). Cloning of Acyl Carrier Protein—A cDNA expression"
