https://openalex.org/W2081012183,"Voyager 2, during its encounter with the Jupiter system, provided images that both complement and supplement in important ways the Voyager 1 images. While many changes have been observed in Jupiter's visual appearance, few, yet significant, changes have been detected in the principal atmospheric currents. Jupiter's ring system is strongly forward scattering at visual wavelengths and consists of a narrow annulus of highest particle density, within which is a broader region in which the density is lower. On Io, changes are observed in eruptive activity, plume structure, and surface albedo patterns. Europa's surface retains little or no record of intense meteorite bombardment, but does reveal a complex and, as yet, little-understood system of overlapping bright and dark linear features. Ganymede is found to have at least one unit of heavily cratered terrain on a surface that otherwise suggests widespread tectonism. Except for two large ringed basins, Callisto's entire surface is heavily cratered."

https://openalex.org/W2013623439,"Studies of the spectra of cyclopolysilanes have led to several significant conclusions. These molecules possess both easily ionized Si-Si bonding electrons and low energy delocalized antibonding orbitals, and can therefore serve either as electron donors or acceptors. This model explains the similarity in properties between cyclopolysilanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. Further investigations of cyclopolysilanes seem likely to provide the key to understanding of controversial questions of bonding in metalloid compounds even as studies of their carbon analogs, the cyclic and cage hydrocarbons, have been crucial to present knowledge of organic stereochemistry and reaction mechanisms. The reactions of cyclopolysilanes are not only interesting in themselves, but have opened the way to the synthesis of complex polysilanes and thus to whole new areas of study. Improved methods of synthesis and isolation are needed, but the number and kinds of compounds that can be prepared seem almost limitless. Perhaps a polymetal chemistry comparable in breadth and variety to carbon chemistry is now developing."
https://openalex.org/W1979642653,"The transfer of electrons from one molecule to another by quantum mechanical tunneling has recently been implicated in biological electron transport. This report describes observations of electron transfer between aromatic molecules in a rigid matrix, in which electrons apparently tunnel through tens of angstroms of inert solvent. The kinetics tend to confirm the tunneling process, which is likely to be an important means of electron transfer when diffusion is blocked by steric factors or immobilization of the reactants."

The column, which utilizes a liquid-modified organic adsorbent (Tenax) as the stationary phase, provides efficient transmission and resolution of nanogram quantities of organic materials in the presence of millionfold excesses of water and carbon dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W2005478647,"During detailed analysis of Voyager 2 pictures of the Jupiter ring, a starlike object was identified in the plane of the ring. The same object was subsequently found on a higher-resolution frame and proved to be a satellite of Jupiter. This satellite has a circular orbit whose radius is 1.8 Jupiter radii, a period of 7 hours and 8 minutes, and a diameter of less than 40 kilometers. It is located at the outer edge of the Jupiter ring."

https://openalex.org/W1977443006,"I have discussed the problem whether an explanation of the phenomena of life can be deduced from an exclusive reliance on causal relationship as in the currently accepted physical description, or whether attention should be given to something more. For this more the concept of anticipation is taken. Starting from what we observe in our own minds various notions involved in the idea of anticipation have been brought forward. The picture is derived from the philosophy of A. N. Whitehead. It is admissible in this philosophy to postulate an influence of anticipation on the statistical weights which play a part in quantum physics. This influence could change the probability distribution of the results of atomic reactions and thus account for living beings having a way of behavior of their own. I have also tried to show that an inquiry into the possibility that living organisms possess features not covered by present-day physics need not lead to a belief in supernatural phenomena. The idea of purpose should not be condemned. It does not mean being directed toward a definite goal for some billions of years. Although no quantitative relations have come forward the role of anticipation can be discussed on a rational basis and finds support in an important philosophical system. It introduces some attractive features into the definition of life and it can help to probe the depth of problems which the reductionist principle leaves unanswered. It might be considered as a picture complementary to the physical picture."
