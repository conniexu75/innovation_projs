Despite an exponential rise in prescriptions and publications, high quality clinical efficacy and safety studies are lacking. The outcomes of a large Australian clinical electronic registry cohort are presented. Methods A prospective cannabis-naïve patient cohort prescribed oral MC participated in an ongoing longitudinal registry at a network of specialised clinics. Patient MC dose, safety and validated outcome data were collected regularly over two years and analysed. Results 3,961 patients (mean age 56.07 years [SD 19.08], 51.0% female) with multimorbidity (mean diagnoses 5.14 [SD 4.08]) and polypharmacy (mean 6.26 medications [SD 4.61]) were included in this analysis. Clinical indications were for: chronic pain (71.9%), psychiatric (15.4%), neurological (2.1%), and other diagnoses (10.7%). Median total oral daily dose was 10mg for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 22.5mg for cannabidiol (CBD). A stable dose was observed for over two years. 37.3% experienced treatment related adverse events. These were graded mild (67%), moderate (31%), severe (&lt;2%, n = 23) and two (0.1%) serious adverse events. Statistically significant improvements at a p value of &lt;0.001 across all outcomes were sustained for over two years, including: clinical global impression (CGI-E, +39%: CGI-I, +52%; p&lt;0.001), pain interference and severity (BPI, 26.1% and 22.2%; p&lt;0.001), mental health (DASS-21, depression 24.5%, anxiety 25.5%, stress 27.7%; p&lt;0.001), insomnia (ISI, 35.0%; p&lt;0.001), and health status (RAND SF36: physical function, 34.4%: emotional well-being, 37.3%; p&lt;0.001). Mean number of concomitant medications did not significantly change over 2 years (p = 0.481). Conclusions Oral MC was demonstrated to be safe and well-tolerated for a sustained period in a large complex cohort of cannabis-naïve, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. There was significant improvement (p&lt;0.001) across all measured clinical outcomes over two years. Results are subject to limitations of Real World Data (RWD) for causation and generalisability. Future high quality randomised controlled trials are awaited."
https://openalex.org/W4309364410,"The plasticity of glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) represents a fundamental mechanism in the modulation of dopamine neuron burst firing and phasic dopamine release at target regions. These processes encode basic behavioral responses, including locomotor activity, learning and motivated behaviors. Here we describe a hitherto unidentified mechanism of long-term synaptic plasticity in mouse VTA. We found that the burst firing in individual dopamine neurons induces a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory synapses on adjacent dopamine neurons that crucially depends on Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes, mediated by endocannabinoid CB1 and dopamine D2 receptors co-localized at the same astrocytic process, and activation of pre-synaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors. Consistent with these findings, selective in vivo activation of astrocytes increases the burst firing of dopamine neurons in the VTA and induces locomotor hyperactivity. Astrocytes play, therefore, a key role in the modulation of VTA dopamine neuron functional activity. This study shows that burst-firing-induced astrocyte signaling potentiates glutamatergic transmission onto dopamine neurons in mouse VTA."
https://openalex.org/W4308990258,"The red blood cell (RBC)-Omics study, part of the larger NHLBI-funded Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS-III), aims to understand the genetic contribution to blood donor RBC characteristics. Previous work identified donor demographic, behavioral, genetic, and metabolic underpinnings to blood donation, storage, and (to a lesser extent) transfusion outcomes, but none have yet linked the genetic and metabolic bodies of work. We performed a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using RBC-Omics study participants with generated untargeted metabolomics data to identify metabolite quantitative trait loci in RBCs. We performed GWA analyses of 382 metabolites in 243 individuals imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 all-ancestry reference panel. Analyses were conducted using ProbABEL and adjusted for sex, age, donation center, number of whole blood donations in the past 2 years, and first 10 principal components of ancestry. Our results identified 423 independent genetic loci associated with 132 metabolites (p < 5×10–8). Potentially novel locus-metabolite associations were identified for the region encoding heme transporter FLVCR1 and choline and for lysophosphatidylcholine acetyltransferase LPCAT3 and lysophosphatidylserine 16.0, 18.0, 18.1, and 18.2; these associations are supported by published rare disease and mouse studies. We also confirmed previous metabolite GWA results for associations, including N(6)-methyl-L-lysine and protein PYROXD2 and various carnitines and transporter SLC22A16. Association between pyruvate levels and G6PD polymorphisms was validated in an independent cohort and novel murine models of G6PD deficiency (African and Mediterranean variants). We demonstrate that it is possible to perform metabolomics-scale GWA analyses with a modest, trans-ancestry sample size.

Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cell in the human body, representing approximately 84% of the ∼30 trillion host cells in an adult individual (1Nemkov T. Reisz J.A. Xia Y. Zimring J.C.

This task is facilitated by their transit through the whole body every ∼20 s, during the average 120 days lifespan of RBCs (5Kaestner L. Minetti G. The potential of erythrocytes as cellular aging models.Cell Death Differ. 2017; 24: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). From this perspective, RBC metabolism has been leveraged in clinical chemistry assays as a window on systems metabolism and dysregulation thereof (6D'Alessandro A. Giardina B. Gevi F. Timperio A.M.

The recent implementation of cost-effective high-throughput mass spectrometry-based metabolomics (8Zampieri M. Sekar K. Zamboni N. Sauer U. Frontiers of high-throughput metabolomics.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2017; 36: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) has fueled the efforts toward personalized medicine. RBC transfusion is a life-saving intervention for 4.5 million Americans every year. The logistics of producing over 100 million units of blood available for transfusion every year around the world necessitates storage of RBC components in the blood bank. However, storage in the blood bank is characterized by a series of biochemical (9D'Alessandro A. D'Amici G.M. Vaglio S. Zolla L. Time-course investigation of SAGM-stored leukocyte-filtered red bood cell concentrates: from metabolism to proteomics.Haematologica. 2012; 97: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and morphological alterations (10Roussel C. Morel A. Dussiot M. Marin M. Colard M. Fricot-Monsinjon A. et al.Rapid clearance of storage-induced microerythrocytes alters transfusion recovery.Blood. 2021; 137: 2285-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), collectively referred to as the storage lesion (11Yoshida T. Prudent M. D'Alessandro A. Red blood cell storage lesion: causes and potential clinical consequences.Blood Transfus. 2019; 17: 27-52PubMed Google Scholar), which ultimately lower the efficacy of the transfusion therapy (e.g., hemoglobin increment upon transfusion) (12Roubinian N.H. Plimier C. Woo J.P. Lee C. Bruhn R. Liu V.X. et al.Effect of donor, component, and recipient characteristics on hemoglobin increments following red blood cell transfusion.Blood. 2019; 134: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alterations to RBC energy and redox metabolism are a hallmark of the storage lesion (13Paglia G. D'Alessandro A. Rolfsson O. Sigurjonsson O.E. Bordbar A.

Magnusdottir M. et al.Identified metabolic signature for assessing red blood cell unit quality is associated with endothelial damage markers and clinical outcomes.Transfusion. 2016; 56: 852-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Metabolic markers of RBC storage quality have been identified, including markers of the RBC propensity to hemolyze spontaneously (15Van 't Erve T.J. Wagner B.A. Martin S.M. Knudson C.M. Blendowski R. Keaton M. et al.The heritability of hemolysis in stored human red blood cells.Transfusion. 2015; 55: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or following oxidant or osmotic insults (16D'Alessandro A.

Stefanoni D. et al.Hypoxic storage of red blood cells improves metabolism and post-transfusion recovery.Transfusion. 2020; 60: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and markers of oxygen transport and off-loading function in fresh and stored RBCs (19Donovan K.

Stanworth S. et al.Stored blood has compromised oxygen unloading kinetics that can be normalized with rejuvenation and predicted from corpuscular side-scatter.Haematologica. 2021; 107: 298-302Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Appreciation for the role of RBC metabolism in storage quality and post-transfusion performances has informed the concept of the metabolic age of the unit—as opposed to the chronological age of the unit (i.e., days elapsed since the time of donation) (20D'Alessandro A. Zimring J.C. Busch M. Chronological storage age and metabolic age of stored red blood cells: Are they the same?.Transfusion. 2019; 59: 1620-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Levels of metabolic markers of RBC storage quality and function are impacted by blood processing, storage additives, donor demographics (e.g., sex, race-ethnicity, and age), dietary metabolites (21D'Alessandro A.

In a move toward personalized transfusion medicine, the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study—REDS-III RBC-Omics—was designed to test the hypothesis that donor biology plays a significant role in the quality of donated RBC (29D'Alessandro A.

As part of this study, genomics approaches were used to characterize 12,353 volunteer donors enrolled at four different blood centers across the United States of America (29D'Alessandro A.

Keating B. et al.Development and evaluation of a transfusion medicine genome wide genotyping array.Transfusion. 2019; 59: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Genetic heterogeneity of blood donors was associated with the RBC propensity to hemolyze spontaneously, or following oxidative, osmotic or mechanical insults. Quantitative trait-loci analyses were used to identify polymorphic genes that contribute to an increased resistance/susceptibility to RBC hemolysis (28Page G.P. Kanias T. Guo Y.J. Lanteri M.C. Zhang X. Mast A.E. et al.Multiple-ancestry genome-wide association study identifies 27 loci associated with measures of hemolysis following blood storage.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e146077Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Of note, polymorphisms associated with a compromised (<10%) residual activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) were associated with an increased susceptibility of stored RBCs to lyse following oxidant insults (28Page G.P. Kanias T. Guo Y.J. Lanteri M.C. Zhang X. Mast A.E. et al.Multiple-ancestry genome-wide association study identifies 27 loci associated with measures of hemolysis following blood storage.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e146077Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This observation was corroborated by findings from ex vivo studies (31Tzounakas V.L. Kriebardis A.G. Georgatzakou H.T. Foudoulaki-Paparizos L.E. Dzieciatkowska M. Wither M.J. et al.Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient subjects may be better ""storers"" than donors of red blood cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2016; 96: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and in vivo determination of autologous post-transfusion recovery (17Francis R.O. D'Alessandro A. Eisenberger A. Soffing M. Yeh R. Coronel E. et al.Donor glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency decreases blood quality for transfusion.J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130: 2270-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as well as decreases in hemoglobin increments upon transfusion of G6PD-deficient units (32Roubinian N.H. Reese S.E. Qiao H. Plimier C. Fang F. Page G.P. et al.Donor genetic and nongenetic factors affecting red blood cell transfusion effectiveness.JCI Insight. 2022; 7e152598Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, the main antioxidant pathway in RBCs. Thus, G6PD is crucial for the synthesis of the reducing cofactor NADPH, which is required to preserve glutathione homeostasis and reduce multiple antioxidant enzymes as they exert their catalytic activities (33D'Alessandro A. Hansen K.C. Eisenmesser E.Z. Zimring J.C. Protect, repair, destroy or sacrifice: a role of oxidative stress biology in inter-donor variability of blood storage?.Blood Transfus. 2019; 17: 281-288PubMed Google Scholar). G6PD deficiency is common in routine blood donors of African descent (up to 13% prevalence in some metropolitan areas like New York) (34Burka E.R. Weaver 3rd, Z. Marks P.A. Clinical spectrum of hemolytic anemia associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Ann. Intern. Med. 1966; 64: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In G6PD-deficient donors, higher levels of metabolic markers of the storage lesion have been reported, such as a faster rate of purine deamination (35Nemkov T. Sun K. Reisz J.A. Song A. Yoshida T. Dunham A. et al.Hypoxia modulates the purine salvage pathway and decreases red blood cell and supernatant levels of hypoxanthine during refrigerated storage.Haematologica. 2018; 103: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), asparagine deamidation and methylation (36Ingrosso D. Cimmino A. D'Angelo S. Alfinito F. Zappia V. Galletti P. Protein methylation as a marker of aspartate damage in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes: role of oxidative stress.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2032-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and lipid oxidation (16D'Alessandro A. Fu X. Kanias T. Reisz J.A. Culp-Hill R. Guo Y. et al.Donor sex, age and ethnicity impact stored red blood cell antioxidant metabolism through mechanisms in part explained by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase levels and activity.Haematologica. 2021; 106: 1290-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, to date, linkage of genetic polymorphisms to metabolic heterogeneity in freshly donated or end of storage blood has been limited to twin studies (15Van 't Erve T.J. Wagner B.A. Martin S.M. Knudson C.M. Blendowski R. Keaton M. et al.The heritability of hemolysis in stored human red blood cells.Transfusion. 2015; 55: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Blood donors are a selected population, with the basic requirement for volunteer blood donation being the absence of serious underlying medical conditions, adequate hemoglobin levels, absence of risk factors for transfusion-transmitted infections, and not taking specific teratogenic or other medications (22Nemkov T. Stefanoni D. Bordbar A. Issaian A. Palsson B.O. Dumont L.J. et al.Blood donor exposome and impact of common drugs on red blood cell metabolism.JCI Insight. 2020; 6e146175Google Scholar) that are grounds for deferral. As such, epidemiology studies have been facilitated by the study of large cohorts of blood donors, similar to investigations on SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the general population based on serological characterization of routine blood donors (37Sabino E.C. Buss L.F. Carvalho M.P.S. Prete Jr., C.A. Crispim M.A.E.

Here, we leveraged genomic (28Page G.P. Kanias T. Guo Y.J. Lanteri M.C. Zhang X.

However, most of these studies focused on plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, with limited analyses targeting erythrocyte metabolism—which is the focus of this study.

Through the workflow summarized in Fig. S1, a total of 2831 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-metabolite associations were observed below the genome-wide correction threshold (p < 5.0 × 10−8). Data are summarized in tabulated form in Table S1 by identifying the SNP with the smallest p-value within a ± 500 kilobase range as the lead SNP; individual SNP associations are reported extensively in Table S1. In Fig. 1B, we listed the top 10 hits identified by closest annotated gene to the significant SNP in order of -log10(p). Manhattan plots overlapping all the significant hits (FDR < 5 × 10-8) are shown in Fig. 1C, which also includes metabolite—gene pairs. Q-Q plots for the top nine metabolite-associated SNPs are shown in Fig. 1D. Sensitivity analyses for 46 metabolites examining the impact of (1) more stringent variant quality control (QC); (2) the choice of imputation strategy for missing metabolite data; (3) the effect of blood storage additive; and (4) ancestry are reported in Table S1. Genetic associations identified for six metabolites have been previously reported (Table S1). Ancestry plots were thus generated to show normalized metabolite abundances as a function of alleles, as distributed across genetic ancestries of the donors enrolled in this study (Fig. 2A).

Not long after, the virus spread worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. This caused many changes around the world and in the United States, including an educational shift towards online learning. In this paper, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in online learning impact college students’ emotional wellbeing. We use several machine learning and statistical models to analyze data collected by the Faculty of Public Administration at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia in conjunction with an international consortium of universities, other higher education institutions, and students’ associations. Our results indicate that features related to students’ academic life have the largest impact on their emotional wellbeing. Other important factors include students’ satisfaction with their university’s and government’s handling of the pandemic as well as students’ financial security."

In the present study, we report that curcumol promotes the death of activated HSCs and reduces the deposition of extracellular matrix. Interestingly, curcumol treatment can trigger ferroptosis to eliminate activated HSCs characterized by iron overload, lipid ROS accumulation, glutathione depletion, and lipid peroxidation. Curcumol promotes HSC autophagy, which may be the key mechanism for its induction of ferroptosis. It is worth noting that the upregulation of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) may play a key molecular mechanism. NCOA4 mediates the release of iron ions and induces the occurrence of ferroptosis. Overall, curcumol promotes autophagy in hepatic stellate cells, mediates the degradation of NCOA4 and FTH1 complexes, releases iron ions, leads to iron overload, and induces ferroptosis, which may be an important mechanism for its anti-hepatic fibrosis effect."

We conducted a case-controlled study that included 40 patients with AIS within 24 hours and 40 healthy subjects during the same period as a control group. Differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) were obtained using GEO2R, and the expression of hsa_circ_0004099 was verified using RT-PCR. Correlation analysis of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) disease severity score and ischemic time with hsa_circ_0004099 expression levels was also performed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of hsa_circ_0004099 was constructed, and bioinformatic analysis of hsa_circ_0004099 was performed. NIHSS scores negatively correlated with hsa_circ_0004099 levels (P&lt;0.001, r = -0.7053), whereas infarct time was negatively correlated with hsa_circ_0004099 levels (P&lt;0.001, r = -0.5130); hsa_circ_0004099 could benefit clinical diagnosis (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.923 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8680–0.9904]). Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that hsa_circ_0004099 was enriched in several cancer pathways, which were collectively enriched in four genes namely TCF7L2, NRAS, CTNNB1, and KRAS. Eight core proteins were screened using a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network namely SMAD4, HIF1A, CTNNB1, CDKN1B, CDK6, FOXO3, KRAS, and NRAS. hsa_circ_0004099 is a potential clinical diagnostic marker. In addition, the possible role of hsa_circ_0004099 in the pathogenesis of AIS was analyzed using bioinformatics, which provided a new potential molecular target for AIS treatment."

The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine will play a key role in combating the worldwide pandemic. Public confidence in this vaccine is largely based on its safety and effectiveness. This study was designed to provide independent evidence of the adverse effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines among healthcare workers in Iraq and to identify the attitudes of healthcare workers who rejected the vaccination. We conducted a cross-sectional study to collect data on the adverse effects of the Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinopharm vaccines. Data were collected between October 2021 and February 2022. A total of 2,202 participants were enrolled in the study: (89.97%) received injections of the COVID-19 vaccines and (10.03%) were hesitant to receive the vaccination. Participants received either the Pfizer vaccine (62.9%), AstraZeneca vaccine (23.5%) or Sinopharm vaccine (13.6%). Most adverse effects were significantly less prevalent in the second dose than in the first dose. Notably, the adverse effects associated with the Pfizer vaccine were significantly more prevalent in females than in males. Following the first dose, the participants experienced more adverse effects with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Following the second dose, more adverse effects were associated with the Pfizer vaccine. Interestingly, the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in participants who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine was significantly reduced compared to those who received two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Sinopharm vaccines. According to vaccine-hesitated participants, insufficient knowledge (29.9%), expeditious development (27.6%) and lack of trust in the vaccines (27.1%) were the three major reasons for refusing the vaccines. The results of our study indicated that these adverse effects do not present a significant problem and should not prevent successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic."

It may affect people of any age, gender, education, socioeconomic status and occupation. Tension headache, migraine headache and cluster headache are commonly encountered headache types. The prevalence of headache problems is higher among medical students. This could potentially affect their academic performance and quality of life. The objective of this study is to find out the prevalence of headaches and their clinical characteristics among students of a medical college.An online, single-centre, cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Nepal. Stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique was adopted depending upon the academic years of students. For data collection, pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was used. The data entry and analysis were done by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS), version-23. The prevalence of headache and its subtypes were calculated. All the clinical characteristics associated with headaches were also studied.The prevalence of headache disorder was 65 (26.86%), with tension headache (69.23%) being the commonest one. It was highest among fourth-year students (37.84%) followed by first-year students (33.33%). Anxiety/stress (75.40%) was the most common precipitating factor. This problem stopped most of the students (63.09%) from doing daily activities. More than half of them (53.85%) practised self-medication in case of non-resolution of pain, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were frequently used.Headache was fairly prevalent among medical students. Anxiety/stress in medical life has led to headaches in the majority of students. The headache disturbed their daily activities and promoted self-medication practice. So, this problem should be properly looked into and addressed in time by the concerned authority."

F . prausnitzii thus shows promise as a next-generation probiotic for use in restoring the balance of the gut microbial flora and, due to its strong anti-inflammatory properties, for the treatment of certain pathological conditions. However, very little information is available about gene function and regulation in this species. Here, we utilized a systems biology approach—weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)–to analyze gene expression in three publicly available RNAseq datasets from F . prausnitzii strain A2-165, all obtained in different laboratory conditions. The co-expression network was then subdivided into 24 co-expression gene modules. A subsequent enrichment analysis revealed that these modules are associated with different kinds of biological processes, such as arginine, histidine, cobalamin, or fatty acid metabolism as well as bacteriophage function, molecular chaperones, stress response, or SOS response. Some genes appeared to be associated with mechanisms of protection against oxidative stress and could be essential for F . prausnitzii ’s adaptation and survival under anaerobic laboratory conditions. Hub and bottleneck genes were identified by analyses of intramodular connectivity and betweenness, respectively; this highlighted the high connectivity of genes located on mobile genetic elements, which could promote the genetic evolution of F . prausnitzii within its ecological niche.

https://openalex.org/W4309364020,"Retrotransposons are one type of mobile genetic element that abundantly reside in the genomes of nearly all animals. Their uncontrolled activation is linked to sterility, cancer and other pathologies, thereby being largely considered detrimental. Here we report that, within a specific time window of development, retrotransposon activation can license the host's immune system for future antiviral responses. We found that the mdg4 (also known as Gypsy) retrotransposon selectively becomes active during metamorphosis at the Drosophila pupal stage. At this stage, mdg4 activation educates the host's innate immune system by inducing the systemic antiviral function of the nuclear factor-κB protein Relish in a dSTING-dependent manner. Consequently, adult flies with mdg4, Relish or dSTING silenced at the pupal stage are unable to clear exogenous viruses and succumb to viral infection. Altogether, our data reveal that hosts can establish a protective antiviral response that endows a long-term benefit in pathogen warfare due to the developmental activation of mobile genetic elements."

In this study we focus on applications in the agricultural domain and we implement Deep Learning (DL) techniques for the automatic generation of meaningful synthetic images of plant leaves, which can be used as a virtually unlimited dataset to train or validate specialized CNN models or other image-recognition algorithms.Following an approach based on DL generative models, we introduce a Leaf-to-Leaf Translation (L2L) algorithm, able to produce collections of novel synthetic images in two steps: first, a residual variational autoencoder architecture is used to generate novel synthetic leaf skeletons geometry, starting from binarized skeletons obtained from real leaf images. Second, a translation via Pix2pix framework based on conditional generator adversarial networks (cGANs) reproduces the color distribution of the leaf surface, by preserving the underneath venation pattern and leaf shape.The L2L algorithm generates synthetic images of leaves with meaningful and realistic appearance, indicating that it can significantly contribute to expand a small dataset of real images. The performance was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively, by employing a DL anomaly detection strategy which quantifies the anomaly degree of synthetic leaves with respect to real samples. Finally, as an illustrative example, the proposed L2L algorithm was used for generating a set of synthetic images of healthy end diseased cucumber leaves aimed at training a CNN model for automatic detection of disease symptoms.Generative DL approaches have the potential to be a new paradigm to provide low-cost meaningful synthetic samples. Our focus was to dispose of synthetic leaves images for smart agriculture applications but, more in general, they can serve for all computer-aided applications which require the representation of vegetation. The present L2L approach represents a step towards this goal, being able to generate synthetic samples with a relevant qualitative and quantitative resemblance to real leaves."

Enforcement is primarily through annual and final reports submitted to these funding agencies, where all peer-reviewed publications must be registered through the appropriate mechanism as required by the specific federal funding agency. Unreported and/or incorrectly reported papers can result in delayed acceptance of annual and final reports and even funding delays for current and new research grants. So, it's important to make sure every peer-reviewed publication is reported properly and in a timely manner. For large collaborative research efforts, the tracking and proper registration of peer-reviewed publications along with generation of accurate annual and final reports can create a large administrative burden. With large collaborative teams, it is easy for these administrative tasks to be overlooked, forgotten, or lost in the shuffle. In order to help with this reporting burden, we have developed the Academic Tracker software package, implemented in the Python 3 programming language and supporting Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. Academic Tracker helps with publication tracking and reporting by comprehensively searching major peer-reviewed publication tracking web portals, including PubMed, Crossref, ORCID, and Google Scholar, given a list of authors. Academic Tracker provides highly customizable reporting templates so information about the resulting publications is easily transformed into appropriate formats for tracking and reporting purposes. The source code and extensive documentation is hosted on GitHub (https://moseleybioinformaticslab.github.io/academic_tracker/) and is also available on the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/academic_tracker) for easy installation."

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the development of at-home dance programs delivered digitally through live and pre-recorded media, but little is known about how participants may engage with and benefit from these resources.This study explored experiences and potential benefits of digital dance participation among healthy older adults and people with PD.An online survey consisting of fixed-choice and open questions was designed in collaboration with dance program providers and distributed between June and November 2020.Healthy older adults (N = 149) and people with PD (N = 178) participating in at-home dance programs reported frequent engagement and a range of benefits. People with PD reported greater levels of motor (e.g., ease of movement, balance) than non-motor (e.g., energy, confidence) outcomes, while healthy older adults reported similar numbers of motor and non-motor outcomes. Positive outcomes were associated with the use of movement imagery during dance in both groups, while singing was associated with benefits in people with PD and vocalising was associated with benefits in older adults. At-home dance resources were found to offer convenience and flexibility, but participants missed the interaction, support, and routine provided by in-person classes. The majority expressed a preference to continue with both digital and in-person participation in the future. Qualitative analysis of participants' comments further revealed that digital participation could help to maintain connection and well-being, as well as identifying further considerations for improving accessibility and facilitating digital engagement.At-home dance appears to be accessible, engaging, and potentially beneficial for older adults and people with PD, although barriers to participation should be addressed. Digital resources will be increasingly important to enable cost-effective, large-scale provision of home-based therapeutic activities."

We assessed the prevalence of MVD in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) as compared to subjects with preserved ejection fraction (EF) using stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods We retrospectively studied consecutive patients with NICM and 58 subjects with preserved left ventricular (LV) EF who underwent stress CMR between 2011–2016. MVD was defined visually as presence of a subendocardial perfusion defect and semiquantitatively by myocardial perfusion reserve index (MPRI&lt;1.51). MPRI was compared between groups using univariate analysis and multivariable linear regression. Results In total, 41 patients with NICM (mean age 51 ± 14, 59% male) and 58 subjects with preserved LVEF (mean age 51 ± 13, 31% male) were identified. In the NICM group, MVD was present in 23 (56%) and 11 (27%) by semiquantitative and visual evaluation respectively. Compared to those with preserved LVEF, NICM patients had lower rest slope (3.9 vs 4.9, p = 0.05) and stress perfusion slope (8.8 vs 11.7, p&lt;0.001), and MPRI (1.41 vs 1.74, p = 0.02). MPRI remained associated with NICM after controlling for age, gender, hypertension, ethnicity, diabetes, and late gadolinium enhancement (log MPR, β coefficient = -0.19, p = 0.007). Conclusions MVD—as assessed using CMR—is highly prevalent in NICM as compared to subjects with preserved LVEF even after controlling for covariates. Semiquantitative is able to detect a greater number of incidences of MVD compared to visual methods alone. Further studies are needed to determine whether treatment of MVD is beneficial in NICM."

Therefore, utilization of natural products as a therapeutic approach has attained wider consideration for development of novel drugs for asthma management. Bromelain, a mixture of natural bioactive cysteine proteases abundantly found in pineapple stem, has allured attention for its pharmacological activities. However, poor stability in gastric milieu, high dose and immunogenicity associated with prolonged use hinders its oral use. Therefore, need exists to explore alternative route of bromelain administration to achieve its plausible benefits. The present study investigated the preclinical prospects of nasal administration of bromelain on systemic bioavailability, tissue distribution and it's in vivo anti-histaminic, bronchodilator and anti-asthmatic activity in animal models. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed 1.43-fold higher relative bioavailability with faster absorption of bromelain on nasal administration at one-fourth oral dose. The enhanced cellular uptake and localization of bromelain in tissues of lung was observed significantly. Furthermore, faster onset and enhanced antihistaminic, bronchodilator and anti-asthmatic activity on bromelain's nasal administration signified faster absorption and higher in vivo stability of bromelain. Nasal administration significantly achieved decrease in level of oxidative and immunological markers along with restoration of antioxidant enzymes at considerably one-fourth dose administered orally. These findings distinctly manifested that nasal administration could be a substantial and effective route for bromelain delivery with enduring competency in asthma management."
https://openalex.org/W4309306641,"Rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) above the human hearing threshold of ~ 20 kHz to communicate emotional states and to coordinate their social interactive behavior. Twenty-two kHz USVs emitted by adult rats have been reported in a variety of aversive social and behavioral situations. They occur not only under painful or restraining conditions but can also be evoked by gentle cutaneous touch or airflow. This study aimed to test if placement of a human hand in a cage can evoke 22-kHz USVs. It was found that 36% of the adult male Sprague-Dawley and 13% of the adult male Wistar Han rats emitted 22-kHz USVs when a gloved hand was introduced into the cages. Average vocalization onset latencies were 5.0 ± 4.4 s (Sprague-Dawley) and 7.4 ± 4.0 s (Wistar Han) and the USVs had a stable frequency (22 kHz) across the calls, ranging from 0.1 to 2.3 seconds in duration. Surprisingly, no 22-kHz USVs were found in any female Wistar Han rats tested. To further explore the mechanisms underlying this observation, we compared retinal function, basal serum corticosterone, and testosterone levels between the 22-kHz USV responders and non-responders. None of these parameters or endpoints showed any significant differences between the two cohorts. The results suggest that the introduction of a gloved-hand inside the cage can trigger adult male albino rats to emit 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations. This response should be considered in USV studies and animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W4309306652,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as a neurocrine factor released by enteric neurons has been postulated to participate in the regulation of transcellular active calcium transport across intestinal epithelium, but the preceding evidence is scant and inconclusive. Herein, transepithelial calcium flux and epithelial electrical parameters were determined by Ussing chamber technique with radioactive tracer in the intestinal epithelium-like Caco-2 monolayer grown on Snapwell. After 3-day culture, Caco-2 cells expressed mRNA of calcium transporters, i.e., TRPV6, calbindin-D9k, PMCA1b and NCX1, and exhibited transepithelial resistance of ~200 Ω cm2, a characteristic of leaky epithelium similar to the small intestine. VIP receptor agonist was able to enhance transcellular calcium flux, whereas VIP receptor antagonist totally abolished calcium fluxes induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. Since the intestinal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) could be activated by VIP and calciotropic hormones, particularly parathyroid hormone, we sought to determine whether CFTR also contributed to the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced calcium transport. A selective CFTR inhibitor (20-200 μM CFTRinh-172) appeared to diminish calcium fluxes as well as transepithelial potential difference and short-circuit current, both of which indicated a decrease in electrogenic ion transport. On the other hand, 50 μM genistein-a molecule that could rapidly activate CFTR-was found to increase calcium transport. Our in silico molecular docking analysis confirmed direct binding of CFTRinh-172 and genistein to CFTR channels. In conclusion, VIP and CFTR apparently contributed to the intestinal calcium transport, especially in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, thereby supporting the existence of the neurocrine control of intestinal calcium absorption."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between dissociative experiences and post-traumatic stress symptoms from the economic crisis, the Beirut blast, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other mental health issues in a sample of Lebanese university students.This cross-sectional study enrolled 419 active university students (18-35 years) from all over Lebanon (May and August 2021). The respondents received the online soft copy of a survey by a snowball sampling technique through social media and messaging apps. The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, the Dissociative Experience Scale (DES-II), the PTSD Checklist Specific Version (PCL-S), the Financial Wellbeing Scale, the Beirut Distress Scale, the Lebanese Anxiety Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire.The two-factor model of the DES fitted best according to CFI, RMSEA and χ2/df values, but modestly according to TLI. The two factors were absorption and amnesia/depersonalization. Higher stress (Beta = 0.95) and more PTSD from the Beirut blast (Beta = 0.29) and from the economic crisis (Beta = 0.23) were significantly associated with more absorption. A personal history of depression (Beta = 6.03), higher stress (Beta = 0.36) and more PTSD from the Beirut blast (Beta = 0.27) and from the COVID-19 pandemic (Beta = 0.16) were significantly associated with more amnesia/depersonalization.Significant rates of dissociative experiences and their sub-manifestations (amnesia/depersonalization and absorption) were found among Lebanese university students, with remarkable co-occurrence of a traumatic/stressful pattern, whether on an individual (history of PTSD) or a collective level (Post-traumatic manifestations from Beirut blast, COVID-19 pandemic and/or economic crisis), or whether correlated to an acute single event or to certain chronic stressors, or even to a personal history of depression. Such findings must raise the attention to serious mental and psychosocial alteration in the Lebanese national identity."
https://openalex.org/W4309306770,"To understand multidisciplinary team healthcare professionals' perceptions of current and optimal provision of acute rehabilitation, perceived facilitators and barriers to implementation, and their implications for patient recovery, using hip fracture as an example.A qualitative design was adopted using semi-structured telephone interviews with 20 members of the acute multidisciplinary healthcare team (occupational therapists, physiotherapists, physicians, nurses) working on orthopaedic wards at 15 different hospitals across the UK. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, anonymised, and then thematically analysed drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to enhance our understanding of the findings.We identified four themes: conceptualising a model of rehabilitative practice, which reflected the perceived variability of rehabilitation models, along with facilitators and common patient and organisational barriers for optimal rehabilitation; competing professional and organisational goals, which highlighted the reported incompatibility between organisational goals and person-centred care shaping rehabilitation practices, particularly for more vulnerable patients; engaging teams in collaborative practice, which related to the expressed need to work well with all members of the multidisciplinary team to achieve the same person-centred goals and share rehabilitation practices; and engaging patients and their carers, highlighting the importance of their involvement to achieve a holistic and collaborative approach to rehabilitation in the acute setting. Barriers and facilitators within themes were underpinned by the lack or presence of adequate ways of communicating with patients, carers, and multidisciplinary team members; resources (e.g. equipment, staffing, group classes), and support from people in leadership positions such as management and senior staff.Cornerstones of optimal acute rehabilitation are effective communication and collaborative practices between the multidisciplinary team, patients and carers. Supportive management and leadership are central to optimise these processes. Organisational constraints are the most commonly perceived barrier to delivering effective rehabilitation in hospital settings, which exacerbate silo working and limited patient engagement."
https://openalex.org/W4309307000,"The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the relationships between service quality, patient satisfaction, patient loyalty and medication adherence in the Syrian healthcare setting from a patient’s perspective. Based on random sampling technique, data collection was conducted in six hospitals located in the Syrian capital Damascus. The reliability and validity of the theoretical model had been confirmed using quantitative analyses SmartPLS software. The study indicated that our proposed model can significantly explain (35) per cent of patient satisfaction, (55) per cent of patient loyalty and (46) per cent medication adherence in a statistically manner. Our results highlighted that patient satisfaction mediated the relationship between patient loyalty and service quality (assurance, reliability and financial aspect). Besides, patient satisfaction had mediation effect on the relationship between medication adherence and service quality (reliability and financial aspect). Financial aspect had the highest impact on patient satisfaction (β = 0.242) and medication adherence (β = 0.302). In addition, reliability was the only dimension of service quality that had a significant direct impact on patient satisfaction, patient loyalty and medication adherence. To increase patient loyalty in Syrian hospitals, healthcare professionals should place a greater emphasis on the reliability and responsiveness elements of service quality. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first study conducted during the COVID pandemic to evaluate the mediating role of patient satisfaction in the relationship between service quality, patient loyalty and medication adherence in the Syrian healthcare sector."
https://openalex.org/W4309307022,"Objective Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing in the United States, with higher rates among minoritized racial and ethnic populations and lower income populations. GDM increases risk for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and postpartum diabetes screening and prevention are imperative. This qualitative study examines barriers and facilitators to postpartum T2DM screening and prevention among non-privately insured individuals with a history of GDM in a state prior to Medicaid expansion. Methods Thirty-six non-privately insured women with a history of GDM completed semi-structured interviews. Four focus groups and seven interviews were conducted with 30 nurse practitioners, physicians, physician assistants, nurses and registered dietitians from Federally Qualified Health Centers in St. Louis, MO. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using an integrative thematic analysis informed by the socio-ecological model. Results Barriers and facilitators to T2DM screening and prevention occur across multiple environments (society, healthcare system, interpersonal, and individual). Societal barriers include insurance issues, unemployment, and lack of transportation, childcare, safe housing, and healthy food access, while facilitators include government sponsored programs and community organizations. Healthcare system barriers include care fragmentation, scheduling policies and time constraints while facilitators include care coordination, pregnancy support groups, and education materials. Interpersonal barriers include negative care experiences, cultural differences, communication challenges, competing priorities, and lack of a social support network, while facilitators include family and friend support and positive care experiences. Individual barriers include health complications and unhealthy food and exercise patterns, while facilitators include child wellbeing, empowered attitudes and healthy food and exercise patterns. Conclusions The socioecological model highlights the societal and systemic determinants that encompass individual and interpersonal factors affecting postpartum T2DM screening and prevention. This framework can inform multi-level interventions to increase postpartum T2DM screening and prevention in this high-risk population, including policy changes to alleviate higher-level barriers."
https://openalex.org/W4309307027,"Vicarious learning, i.e. learning through observing others rather than through one's own experiences, is an integral skill of social species. The aim of this study was to assess the causal role of affect sharing, an important aspect of empathy, in vicarious fear learning. N = 39 participants completed a vicarious Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. In the learning stage, they watched another person-the demonstrator-responding with distress when receiving electric shocks to a color cue (conditioned stimulus; CS+; a different color served as CS-). In the subsequent test stage, an increased skin conductance response (SCR) to the CS+ presented in the absence of the demonstrator indexed vicarious fear learning. Each participant completed this paradigm under two different hypnotic suggestions, which were administered to induce high or low affect sharing with the demonstrator in the learning stage, following a counterbalanced within-subject design. In the learning stage, high affect sharing resulted in stronger unconditioned SCR, increased eye gaze toward the demonstrator's face, and higher self-reported unpleasantness while witnessing the demonstrator's distress. In the test stage, participants showed a stronger conditioned fear response (SCR) when they had learned under high, compared to low, affect sharing. In contrast, participants' declarative memory of how many shocks the demonstrator had received with each cue was not influenced by the affect sharing manipulation. These findings demonstrate that affect sharing is involved in enhancing vicarious fear learning, and thus advance our understanding of the role of empathy, and more generally emotion, in social observational learning."
https://openalex.org/W4309307136,"Radiation to the female pelvis as part of treatment for cancer predisposes young women to develop Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI). As the human female is born with their full complement of non-growing follicles which decline in an exponential fashion until the menopause, the age at which POI occurs is dependent on the age of the patient at treatment and the dose received by the ovary. A model that predicts the age at which POI occurs for a known dose at a known age will aid counselling patients on their fertility risk. Patients deemed to be at high risk of POI may be considered to be good candidates for established fertility preservation techniques. An updated and externally validated model of the age-related decline in human ovarian reserve was combined with the best available estimate of the median lethal dose LD50 for the human ovary. Using known age at diagnosis and posited radiotherapy treatment plan to estimate the dose to the least-affected ovary, we use an age-related model of the decline in ovarian reserve to generate a personalized age prediction of premature ovarian insufficiency. Our algorithm is available as an online calculator which graphs model outputs to inform discussions around survivor fertility. We report four example cases across different ages and diagnoses, each with two carefully designed photon and proton treatment plans. The treatment options are compared in terms of remaining fertile lifespan for the survivor. International oncology guidelines now mandate the consideration of later fertility when reviewing treatment options for children diagnosed with cancer. Our calculator (https://sites.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/radiosensitivity), and the underlying algorithm and models, allow detailed predictions of the impact of various radiotherapy plans on fertility. These patient-specific data enhance pre-treatment discussions around post-treatment fertility and fertility preservation."

We aimed to evaluate the expression of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and its receptors in renal samples from pediatric NS patients and its relationship with renal function survival.We conducted an ambispective study on 33 patients with pediatric NS. Immunohistochemistry for BAFF, TACI, BCMA and BR3 was performed. Markers were evaluated on podocytes and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates (III). We performed Kaplan-Meier curves to describe renal function survival according to markers' expression.Thirty-three NS patients were included. Minimal change disease was seen in 21 (63.6%) patients, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 12 (36.4%). BAFF was found in podocytes (18.2% of samples) and III (36.4% of samples), BAFF-R in one sample, TACI in 4 (podocytes and III), and BCMA in 5 samples of podocytes and 7 of III. BAFF on podocytes and III was associated with worst renal function at follow-up; those patients had 25% probability of having GFR >90 mL/min/1.73m2, versus 84.9% when absent (p = 0.0067). Patients with BAFF in III had 42.9% probability of having GFR>90 mL/min/1.73 m2, versus 94.1% when absent (p = 0.0063).BAFF expression in renal biopsies could be a prognostic factor for renal function."
https://openalex.org/W4309307531,"Recent evidence suggests that shorter telomere length (TL) is associated with neuro degenerative diseases and aging related outcomes. The causal association between TL and brain characteristics represented by image derived phenotypes (IDPs) from different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities remains unclear. Here, we use two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to systematically assess the causal relationships between TL and 3,935 brain IDPs. Overall, the MR results suggested that TL was causally associated with 193 IDPs with majority representing diffusion metrics in white matter tracts. 68 IDPs were negatively associated with TL indicating that longer TL causes decreasing in these IDPs, while the other 125 were associated positively (longer TL leads to increased IDPs measures). Among them, ten IDPs have been previously reported as informative biomarkers to estimate brain age. However, the effect direction between TL and IDPs did not reflect the observed direction between aging and IDPs: longer TL was associated with decreases in fractional anisotropy and increases in axial, radial and mean diffusivity. For instance, TL was positively associated with radial diffusivity in the left perihippocampal cingulum tract and with mean diffusivity in right perihippocampal cingulum tract. Our results revealed a causal role of TL on white matter integrity which makes it a valuable factor to be considered when brain age is estimated and investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4309326443,"Background Healthcare professionals working at the frontline, dealing with COVID-19 patients or their samples, should know about variants of concern (VOCs) and their transmissibility, disease severity, and vaccine efficacy. Healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) perceptions towards new VOCs affect their practice and attitudes towards their patients. Moreover, these perceptions might significantly impact their patients’ perceptions of new COVID-19 variants and public vaccine acceptability. Methods Online and paper-based questionnaires were distributed among Healthcare professionals in Jordan between August 2021 and October 2021. Results Among 423 HCPs who participated in this study, a majority believe that when viruses mutate, they become more transmissible (77.8%), more deadly (61.7%), and pathogenic (64.8%). In addition, half of the respondents, perceived current treatments as partially effective against VOCs and current diagnostics to be efficient. However, all VOCs were perceived as more transmissible, more virulent, and related to higher mortality rates when compared to the original strain. Regarding immunity against VOCs, (57.4%) of respondents believe in partial immunity against re-infection, and most respondents were either unsure about the current vaccines’ efficacy or agreed that available vaccines would be ineffective. However, respondents (44.4%) still believe that people previously infected should get vaccinated. Respondents referred to the Ministry of Health as the most reliable source of information (45.6%) and the party responsible for educating the public about COVID-19 VOCs (57.9%). Travel was not a source of worry among respondents. However, they were worried about their families getting the new COVID-19 VOCs from their work. Similar proportions agreed/disagreed on the efficacy of the precautions and infection control measures currently applied by the government for preventing the spread of the new COVID-19 VOCs. Conclusion Campaigns, workshops, and webinars targeting vaccines are highly recommended among HCPs to increase public acceptance of the vaccine and further booster shots."
https://openalex.org/W4309306176,"Introduction Fibroadenomas are benign lesions found in the breast tissue. Widespread access to and use of the internet has resulted in more individuals using online resources to better understand health conditions, their prognosis and treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the readability and visual appearance of online patient resources for fibroadenoma. Methods We searched Google TM , Bing TM and Yahoo TM on 6 July 2022 using the search terms “fibroadenoma”, “breast lumps”, “non-cancerous breast lumps”, “benign breast lumps” and “benign breast lesions” to identify the top ten websites that appeared on each of the search engines. We excluded advertised websites, links to individual pdf documents and links to blogs/chats. We compiled a complete list of websites identified using the three search engines and the search terms and analysed the content. We only selected pages that were relevant to fibroadenoma. We excluded pages which only contained contact details and no narrative information relating to the condition. We did not assess information where links were directed to alternative websites. We undertook a qualitative visual assessment of each of the websites using a framework of pre-determined key criteria based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services toolkit. This involved assessing characteristics such as overall design, page layout, font size and colour. Each criterion was scored as: +1- criterion achieved; -1- criterion not achieved; and 0- no evidence, unclear or not applicable (maximum total score 43). We then assessed the readability of each website to determine the UK and US reading age using five different readability tests: Flesch Kincaid, Gunning Fog, Coleman Liau, SMOG, and the Automated Readability Index. We compared the readability scores to determine if there were any significant differences across the websites identified. We also generated scores for the Flesh Reading Ease as well as information about sentence structure (number of syllables per sentence and proportion of words with a high number of syllables) and proportion of people the text was readable to. Results We identified 39 websites for readability and visual assessment. The visual assessment scores for the 39 websites identified ranged from -19 to 31 points out of a possible score of 43. The median readability score for the identified websites was 8.58 (age 14–15), with a range of 6.69–12.22 (age 12–13 to university level). There was a statistically significant difference between the readability scores obtained across websites (p&lt;0.001). Almost half of the websites (18/39; 46.2%) were classified as very difficult by the Flesch Reading Ease score, with only 13/39 (33.33%) classified as being fairly easy or plain English. Conclusion We found wide differences in the general appearance, layout and focus of the fibroadenoma websites identified. The readability of most of the websites was also much higher than the recommended level for the public to understand. Fibroadenoma website information needs to be simplified to reduce the use of jargon and specificity to the condition for individuals to better comprehend it. In addition, their visual appearance could be improved by changing the layout and including images and diagrams."
https://openalex.org/W4309306288,"Despite its benefits, HPV vaccine uptake has been historically lower than other recommended adolescent vaccines in the United States (US). While hesitancy and misinformation have threatened vaccinations for many years, the adverse impacts from COVID-19 pandemic on preventive services have been far-reaching.To explore the perceptions and experiences of adolescent healthcare providers regarding routine vaccination services during the COVID-19 pandemic.Between December 2020 and May 2021, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted via Zoom video conferencing among a purposively selected, diverse group of adolescent healthcare providers (n = 16) within 5 healthcare practices in the US southeastern states of Georgia and Tennessee. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a rapid qualitative analysis framework. Our analysis was guided by the grounded theory and inductive approach.Participants reported that patient-provider communications; effective use of presumptive languaging; provider's continuing education/training; periodic reminders/recall messages; provider's personal conviction on vaccine safety/efficacy; early initiation of HPV vaccination series at 9 years; community partnerships with community health navigators/vaccine champions/vaccine advocates; use of standardized forms/prewritten scripts/standard operating protocols for patient-provider interactions; and vaccine promotion through social media, brochures/posters/pamphlets as well as outreaches to schools and churches served as facilitators to adolescent HPV vaccine uptake. Preventive adolescent services were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic at all practices. Participants highlighted an initial decrease in patients due to the pandemic, while some practices avoided the distribution of vaccine informational materials due to sanitary concerns.As part of a larger study, we provided contextual information to refine an intervention package currently being developed to improve adolescent preventive care provision in healthcare practices. Our results could inform the implementation of comprehensive intervention strategies that improve HPV vaccination rates. Additionally, lessons learned (e.g. optimizing patient- provider interactions) could be adopted to expand COVID-19 vaccine acceptance on a sizable scale."
https://openalex.org/W4309306638,"Worldwide, an estimated 400,000 children develop cancer each year. The bulk of the mortalities from these cases occur in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a tremendous need to strengthen the capacity of health systems to provide high-quality cancer care for children. However, a lack of data on the economic impact of cancer treatment in low-resource settings hinders its consideration as a healthcare priority. To address this gap, this study models the clinical and financial impact of pediatric cancer care in Tanzania, a lower-middle income country in East Africa.We conducted a retrospective review of patients with cancer under the age of 19 years treated at Bugando Medical Centre from January 2010 to August 2014. Information was collected from a total of 161 children, including demographics, type of cancer, care received, and five-year survival outcomes. This data was used to calculate the number of averted disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) with treatment. Charges for all direct medical costs, fixed provider costs, and variable provider costs were used to calculate total cost of care. The societal economic impact of cancer treatment was modeled using the value of statistical life (VSL) and human capital methods.The total health impact for these 161 children was 819 averted DALYs at a total cost of $846,743. The median cost per patient was $5,064 ($4,746-5,501 interquartile range). The societal economic impact of cancer treatment ranged from $590,534 to $3,647,158 using VSL method and $1,776,296 using a human capital approach.Despite the limitations of existing treatment capacity, economic modeling demonstrates a positive economic impact from providing pediatric cancer care in Tanzania. As many countries like Tanzania progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage, these key economic indicators may encourage future investment in comprehensive pediatric cancer care programs in low-resource settings to achieve clinically and economically beneficial results not only for the individual patients, but for the country as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W4309306659,"Background Although minimally invasive surgical techniques have reduced intraoperative bleeding, the risk of transfusion exists. However, few studies have evaluated risk factors for transfusion in radical hysterectomy. We aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative red cell distribution width/albumin ratio (RDW/albumin) and transfusion in cervical cancer patients. Methods We analyzed 907 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy between June 2006 and February 2015. Logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the risk factors for transfusion and mortality at 5-year and overall. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated identification improvement (IDI) analyses were performed to verify the improvement of the intraoperative transfusion model upon the addition of RDW/albumin. Results RDW/albumin was an independent risk factor for transfusion (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–1.77, p = 0.035). Additionally, body mass index, operation time, laparoscopic surgery, total fluids, and synthetic colloid were risk factors for transfusion. RDW/albumin was an independent risk factor for 5-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.07–2.14, p = 0.020), and overall mortality (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.06–2.07, p = 0.021). NRI and IDI analyses showed the discriminatory power of RDW/albumin for transfusion (p&lt;0.001 and p = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions RDW/albumin might be a significant factor in transfusion and mortality in cervical cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4309306990,"Background Genetics and genomics research (GGR) is associated with several challenges including, but not limited to, methods and implications of sharing research findings with participants and their family members, issues of confidentiality, and ownership of data obtained from samples. Additionally, GGR holds significant potential risk for social and psychological harms. Considerable research has been conducted globally, and has advanced the debate on return of genetic and genomics testing results. However, such investigations are limited in the African setting, including Uganda where research ethics guidance on return of results is deficient or suboptimal at best. The objective of this study was to assess perceptions of grassroots communities on if and how feedback of individual genetics and genomics testing results should occur in Uganda with a view to improving ethics guidance. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that employed a qualitative exploratory approach. Five deliberative focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 42 participants from grassroots communities representing three major ethnic groupings. These were rural settings and the majority of participants were subsistence farmers with limited or no exposure to GGR. Data were analysed through thematic analysis, with both deductive and inductive approaches applied to interrogate predetermined themes and to identify any emerging themes. NVivo software (QSR international 2020) was used to support data analysis and illustrative quotes were extracted. Results All the respondents were willing to participate in GGR and receive feedback of results conditional upon a health benefit. The main motivation was diagnostic and therapeutic benefits as well as facilitating future health planning. Thematic analysis identified four themes and several sub-themes including 1) the need-to-know health status 2) paternity information as a benefit and risk; 3) ethical considerations for feedback of findings and 4) extending feedback of genetics findings to family and community. Conclusion Participation in hypothetical GGR as well as feedback of results is acceptable to individuals in grassroots communities. However, the strong therapeutic and/or diagnostic misconception linked to GGR is concerning given that hopes for therapeutic and/or diagnostic benefit are unfounded. Viewing GGR as an opportunity to confirm or dispute paternity was another interesting perception. These findings carry profound implications for consent processes, genetic counselling and research ethics guidance. Privacy and confidentiality, benefits, risks as well as implications for sharing need to be considered for such feedback of results to be conducted appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W4309307013,"The ability to accurately predict the one-year survival of older adults is challenging for clinicians as they endeavour to provide the most appropriate care. Standardised clinical needs assessments are routine in many countries and some enable application of mortality prediction models. The added value of blood biomarkers to these models is largely unknown. We undertook a proof of concept study to assess if adding biomarkers to needs assessments is of value. Assessment of the incremental value of a blood biomarker, Brain Naturetic Peptide (BNP), to a one year mortality risk prediction model, RiskOP, previously developed from data from the international interRAI-HomeCare (interRAI-HC) needs assessment. Participants were aged ≥65 years and had completed an interRAI-HC assessment between 1 January 2013 and 21 August 2021 in Canterbury, New Zealand. Inclusion criteria was a BNP test within 90 days of the date of interRAI-HC assessment. The primary outcome was one-year mortality. Incremental value was assessed by change in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Brier Skill, and the calibration of the final model. Of 14,713 individuals with an interRAI-HC assessment 1,537 had a BNP within 90 days preceding the assessment and all data necessary for RiskOP. 553 (36.0%) died within 1-year. The mean age was 82.6 years. Adding BNP improved the overall AUC by 0.015 (95% CI:0.004 to 0.028) and improved predictability by 1.9% (0.26% to 3.4%). In those with no Congestive Heart Failure the improvements were 0.029 (0.004 to 0.057) and 4.0% (0.68% to 7.6%). Adding a biomarker to a risk model based on standardised needs assessment of older people improved prediction of 1-year mortality. BNP added value to a risk prediction model based on the interRAI-HC assessment in those patients without a diagnosis of congestive heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W4309307023,"Background Approval of living kidney donors (LKD) with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) risk factors, such as obesity, has increased. While lifetime ESKD development data are lacking, the study of intermediate outcomes such as diabetes is critical for LKD safety. Donation-attributable diabetes risk among persons with obesity remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 10-year diabetes-free survival among LKDs and non-donors with obesity. Methods This longitudinal cohort study identified adult, LKDs (1976–2020) from 42 US transplant centers and non-donors from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (1985–1986) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (1987–1989) studies with body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 . LKDs were matched to non-donors on baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) plus diabetes-specific risk factors (family history of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, smoking history). Accelerated failure time models were utilized to evaluate 10-year diabetes-free survival. Findings Among 3464 participants, 1119 (32%) were LKDs and 2345 (68%) were non-donors. After matching on baseline characteristics plus diabetes-specific risk factors, 4% (7/165) LKDs and 9% (15/165) non-donors developed diabetes (median follow-up time 8.5 (IQR: 5.6–10.0) and 9.1 (IQR: 5.9–10.0) years, respectively). While not significant, LKDs were estimated to live diabetes-free 2 times longer than non-donors (estimate 1.91; 95% CI: 0.79–4.64, p = 0.15). Conclusions LKDs with obesity trended toward living longer diabetes-free than non-donors with obesity, suggesting within the decade following donation there was no increased diabetes risk among LKDs. Further work is needed to evaluate donation-attributable diabetes risk long-term."

https://openalex.org/W4309307127,"Background Advances in medicine and public health mean that people are living longer; however, a significant proportion of that increased lifespan is spent in a prolonged state of declining health and wellbeing which places increasing pressure on medical, health and social services. There is a social and economic need to develop strategies to prevent or delay age-related disease and maintain lifelong health. Several studies have suggested links between the gut microbiome and age-related disease, which if confirmed would present a modifiable target for intervention development. The MOTION study aims to determine whether and how changes in the gut microbiome are associated with physical and mental capacity. A comprehensive longitudinal multiparameter study such as this has not been previously undertaken. Methods MOTION is a longitudinal prospective cohort study with a focus on gut health and cognitive function. 360 healthy individuals aged 60 years and older, living in East Anglia, UK will be recruited to the study, stratified into one of three risk groups (cohorts) for developing dementia based on their cognitive function. Participants will attend study appointments every six months over four years, providing stool and blood samples and a health questionnaire. Participants will also undergo physical measurements and cognitive tests at alternating appointments, and undergo Optical Coherence Tomography scans at 3 timepoints. Two subgroups of participants in the study will provide colonic tissue biopsies (n = ≥30 from each cohort), and brain imaging (n = 30) at two timepoints. Discussion This study will provide new insights into the gut-(microbiota)-brain axis and the relationship between age-associated changes in gut microbe populations and cognitive health. Such insights could help develop new microbe-based strategies to improve lifelong health and wellbeing.

https://openalex.org/W4309307129,"Purpose The study aimed to evaluate changes over a period of time in techniques and indications for corneal transplantation in a single center in Poland. Methods Retrospective analysis of corneal transplants performed at the Ophthalmology Department of the District Railway Hospital in Katowice in 2001–2020. Data on indications and surgical technique were collected. Results A total of 3021 corneal transplantations were performed in the years 2000–2020. The most common technique was penetrating keratoplasty (69,54%), then lamellar grafts—both anterior and posterior (19,63%), and limbal grafts (10,82%). Only in 2007 the number of lamellar keratoplasties exceeded the number of penetrating grafts and accounted for 108 (54,55%), including 85 (42,93%) of Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty. The only noticeable trend in changing techniques was a decrease in the number of performed deep anterior lamellar keratoplasties (r 2 = -0.21) over the last seven years. Main indications included bullous keratopathy (23,22%), following keratoconus (18,59%), leukoma (14,67%), keratitis and perforation (14,3%), Fuchs dystrophy (11,4%), and regrafts (7,22%). Leukoma and bullous keratopathy as an indications for corneal transplant have been declining over the years (r2 = 0.60 and r2 = 0.30 respectively). Consecutively, indications such as fuchs dystrophy, regraft and keratitis perforation have increased (r2 = 0.05, r2 = 0.50, r2 = 0.33) Conclusions The number of keratoplasties gradually increased from 2001 to 2020. It could be possible that the development and spread of new therapeutic alternatives, like corneal cross-linking and scleral lenses, have contributed to the decrease in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty performed. There was an increasing trend in the percentage of penetrating keratoplasties for failed grafts, Fuchs dystrophy and infectious keratitis."
https://openalex.org/W4309307137,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the decontamination efficacy of liquid formaldehyde solutions for three soil types (sand, loam, and clay) against spores of Bacillus anthracis (B . a . ) and Bacillus atrophaeus . Approximately 1 x 10 8 colony forming units were inoculated into each sample. Through a series of six bench-scale experiments, two concentrations and two volumes of liquid formaldehyde solution were then added to the soil samples and allowed to remain in contact for either 24 or 48 hours. Decontamination efficacy was assessed at either 22° or 10°C with or without lids atop the sample jars. Complete inactivation (no spores recovered from the soil samples, typically providing &gt; 7 log reduction) of B . a . occurred in all soil types in five of the six tests, while complete inactivation of B . atrophaeus was achieved in all soil types for three of the six tests. The results demonstrated a higher probability of complete inactivation of spores for samples that were covered, samples that received the higher volume of formaldehyde, and those contaminated with B . a . Overall, the use of liquid formaldehyde solution (2.5–5%) was highly effective in inactivating entire spore populations (typically &gt; 10 7 CFU) for both B . a . and B . atrophaeus in the soil matrices studied. Covering the soil after application would allow for less formaldehyde solution to be used without impacting the overall efficacy of the process. The data from this study may aid in the selection of appropriate decontamination parameters when using liquid formaldehyde for soil remediation. The data may also aid in the decision to use B . atrophaeus as a surrogate for B . a . when performing further decontamination studies using liquid formalin solutions."
https://openalex.org/W4309307526,"Critical transitions can be conceptualized as abrupt shifts in the state of a system typically induced by changes in the system's critical parameter. They have been observed in a variety of systems across many scientific disciplines including physics, ecology, and social science. Because critical transitions are important to such a diverse set of systems it is crucial to understand what parts of a system drive and shape the transition. The underlying network structure plays an important role in this regard. In this paper, we investigate how changes in a network's degree sequence impact the resilience of a networked system. We find that critical transitions in degree mixed networks occur in general sooner than in their degree homogeneous counterparts of equal average degree. This relationship can be expressed with parabolic curves that describe how the tipping point changes when the nodes of an initially homogeneous degree network composed only of nodes with degree k1 are replaced by nodes of a different degree k2. These curves mark clear tipping boundaries for a given degree mixed network and thus allow the identification of possible tipping intersections and forbidden tipping regions when comparing networks with different degree sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4309307630,"Mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) refers to tactile sensations people have on their own body when they see another person being touched. This trait has been linked to individual differences in computing body awareness and ownership (e.g., on questionnaires, cognitive tests) as well as differences in the brain. Here it is assessed for the first time in a non-Western (Chinese) population. Study 1 shows that reports of mirror-touch are elevated in a Chinese sample (N = 298) relative to comparable Western samples shown identical stimuli. In other respects, they are qualitatively similar (e.g., showing a difference between whether humans or inanimate objects are touched) and, overall, these differences could not be attributed to an acquiescence bias. The Chinese sample also completed a battery of questionnaires relating to body awareness and social-emotional functioning including mental health (Study 2) and had participated in brain imaging (the structural scans were analysed using voxel-based morphometry in Study 3). Participants reporting higher levels of mirror touch reported higher levels of anxiety. There were no reliable differences in the VBM analysis. It is suggested instead that cross-cultural differences in embodied cognition can manifest themselves in different rates of vicarious experience such as mirror touch."
https://openalex.org/W4309308241,"The present study documented in two distinct population-based samples the contribution of preschool fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities to school achievement in primary school and examined the mediating role of crystallized abilities in this sequence of predictive associations. In both samples, participants were assessed on the same cognitive abilities at 63 months (sample 1, n = 1072), and at 41 and 73 months (sample 2, n = 1583), and then with respect to their school achievement from grade 1 (7 years) to grade 6 (12 years). Preschool crystallized abilities were found to play a key role in predicting school achievement. They contributed substantially to school achievement in the early school years, but more modestly in the later years, due to the strong auto-regression of school achievement. They also mediated the association between fluid abilities and later school achievement in the early grades of school, with the former having modest direct contribution to the latter in the later grades. These findings are discussed regarding their implication for preventive interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4309327409,"To evaluate the choriocapillaris (CC) flow changes in branched retinal vascular obstruction (BRVO) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).Retrospective analysis of 29 patients with unilateral BRVO (58 eyes, including unaffected fellow eyes for controls). 4.5 x 4.5 mm macular scans were divided into 4 quadrants. Serial analyses were conducted on CC flow voids of the opposite quadrant to the active occluded area in BRVO eyes. Each of the quadrants were also compared to the occluded quadrant of resolved eyes and the contralateral quadrant of fellow eyes by matched data analysis. A regression analysis was performed on the several parameters (Choroidal thickness; CT, Choroidal vascularity index; CVI, Central macular thickness; CMT, The number of intravitreal injections) and CC flow voids.The CC flow void increased sequentially: The uninvolved quadrant of acute BRVO-affected eyes, that of resolved eyes after 3-month/1-year, the contralateral quadrant of fellow eye, the involved (occluded) quadrant of resolved eyes. There were significant correlations between initial CMT, the number of injections and the CC flow void of uninvolved quadrants (P = 0.025, 0.031, respectively), and between the involved (occluded) quadrants and fellow CT (P = 0.029).CC flow void of uninvolved macular areas decreased significantly in eyes with acute BRVO, suggesting that CC changes were limited to the blocked area and a compensatory mechanism would work in surrounding areas."

https://openalex.org/W4309471301,"The process of spermatogenesis is a complex and delicate process that is still not fully understood. In this study, we examined the role of fatty acid oxidase 3-hydroxy acyl CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) in maintaining normal spermatogenesis in mice. In male mice, ablation of the Hadh gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology arrested spermatocyte meiosis, increased multinucleated giant germ cells and vacuoles in seminiferous tubules, and accompanied with acrosomal dysplasia. Hadh-/- male mice showed the typical features of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), including decreased sperm concentration and motility and increased sperm abnormalities. Next, we explored the molecular events in the testes of the mutant mice. We found fatty acids accumulated in the testis of Hadh-/- mice. And also, inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly increased, apoptosis-related protein Bcl-2 was decreased, and Bax and cleaved-Caspase3 were increased in Hadh-/- male mice testis. After using etanercept, a specific inhibitor of TNF-α, testis injury caused by Hadh knockout was significantly alleviated, the sperm quality and motility were improved, and germ cell apoptosis was reduced. So our study demonstrated that Hadh deletion caused an increase in fatty acids. The accumulated fatty acids further induced testicular inflammation and germ cell apoptosis through the TNF-α/Bcl-2 signaling pathway, finally resulting in OAT in the Hadh-/- mice. Inhibiting TNF-α may be used as a new treatment approach for testicular inflammation and OAT."
