Polyethylenimine and to a lesser extent polylysine, but not cationic lipids, enhance transgene expression when complexes are injected into the cytoplasm. This latter effect was independent of the polymer vector/cDNA ionic charge ratio, suggesting that nucleic acid compaction rather than surface charge was critical for efficient nuclear trafficking.

Despite their low efficiency in comparison to viral vectors (1Behr J.P. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 2Gao X. Huang L.

Many research efforts are currently dedicated to optimizing transfection efficiency of nonviral vectors, and in this context, several novel chemical entities have recently being disclosed (4Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar, 5Goldman C. Soroceanu L.

However, rational (as opposed to empirical) chemical design of improved vectors requires a better knowledge of the multistage process by which nonviral vectors promote transgene expression in eucaryotic cells.

Acta. 1995; 1235: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) have been studied in detail. By comparison, much less is known about intracellular trafficking of the transgene to the nucleus where it is transcribed. Release of cDNA from the endosomes is suggested to proceed by destabilization of the endosomal membrane (14Xu Y. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Zabner et al. (9Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) postulated that the cDNA must then dissociate from the cationic lipid vector before naked cDNA enters the nucleus. To this end, anionic lipids normally found on the cytoplasmic-facing monolayer of cell membrane can very potently displace cDNA from the cationic liposome·cDNA complex (14Xu Y. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that synthetic polymers such as polyethylenimine (4Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar, 15Boussif O. Zanta M.A. Behr J.P. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1074-1080PubMed Google Scholar) and polylysine differ from cationic lipids inasmuch as (i) polymers promote gene delivery from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and (ii) transgene expression in the nucleus is prevented by complexation with cationic lipids but not with cationic polymers. Our findings provide new rationale for future developments targeted to improve the efficiency of nonviral vectors and highlight the in vitro superiority of cationic polymer vectors over cationic lipids. Polyethylenimine (PEI)/DNA 1The abbreviations used are: PEI, polyethylenimine; DOTAP,N(1-(2,3-dioleolyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; SPQ, 6-methoxy-1-(3-sulfonatopropyl) quinolinium. zeta potential was determined using a Zetamaster 3000 (Malvern Instrument, Orsay, France) with the following specifications: sampling time, 30 s; three measurements per sample; viscosity, 1.014 centipoise; dielectric constant, 79; temperature, 20 °C. Carbon films were prepared by sublimation on freshly cleaved mica and recovered by flotation on Cu2+/Rh2+ grids (300 mesh, Touzard & Matignon, Courtaboeuf, France). After overnight drying, grids were kept on a blotting paper in a Petri dish. Immediately before sample addition, grids were glow-discharged (110 mV, 25 s). A drop (5 μl) of sample solution was left on the grid for 1 min. Complexes were negatively stained with 30 μl of aqueous uranylacetate (1% w/w) for 20 s, and excess liquid was removed with blotting paper. Observations were performed at 80 kV with a Philips EM 410 transmission electron microscope. COS-7 cells, pancreatic epithelioid CFPAC-1 from a ΔF5808/ΔF508 cystic fibrosis patient and human A549 lung carcinoma cells obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) were cultured as previously indicated (16Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baro I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). PEI (25 kDa) and polylysine were used as 10 mm monomer aqueous stock solution. Dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine (Transfectam®, Promega, Madison, WI) was used as a 2 mm ethanolic solution.N-(1-(2,3-dioleolyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim) was used in aqueous solution at 1 mg/ml. A pCMV-LacZ plasmid in which the β-galactosidase cDNA was established under the control of the CMV promoter was used as a reporter gene. Alternatively, we used a pCMV-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plasmid (a kind gift from J. Ricardo, Lisbon, Portugal) in which a CMV promoter drove expression of the CFTR protein. Adherent cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amounts and volumes given below refer to a single well. Two μg pf pCMV-LacZ were diluted into 50 μl of a 150 mm NaCl solution. The desired amount of 25-kDa PEI was diluted into 50 μl of 150 mm NaCl, gently vortexed, spun down (500 rpm for 5 s), and then incubated for 10 min. PEI was used at PEI/cDNA ratios between 2 and 10 equivalents (PEI/cDNA ratio calculated on the basis of PEI nitrogen/cDNA phosphate; see Ref. 15Boussif O. Zanta M.A. Behr J.P. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1074-1080PubMed Google Scholar). The cationic vector was added to the plasmid solution, mixed, vortexed, spun down, and incubated for 10 min. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were fixed for 15 min with 0.5% formaldehyde and then analyzed histochemically using X-gal (17Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All experiments were done in duplicate. Cells were microinjected at day 1 post-plating. In this procedure, we used the Eppendorf microinjector 5246 system, the micromanipulator 5171 system, and a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Nuclear or intracytoplasmic injections were performed with the Z (depth) limit option using a 0.3-s injection time and 30–80-hectopascal injection pressure. Injection pipettes (internal diameter 0.5 ± 0.2 μm) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries. Plasmids were diluted at a final concentration ranging from 0.01 to 100 μg/ml in an injection buffer made of 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaOH, 40 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. 0.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (150 kDa) was added to the injection medium. The plasmid solution was injected into the cells, and the exact number of nuclearly or cytoplasmically injected cells was counted. Twenty-four h post-injection, cells were fixed and analyzed for exogenous β-galactosidase expression. Dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine was used at six charge equivalents (six cationic amino groups per phosphate group). For polylysine, we used 0.6 μl of polylysine 10 mm/μg of plasmid. This mixture yields a polylysine/cDNA ratio of 2, corresponding to a PEI/cDNA ratio of 5 on the basis of the ionic charges of the complexes. In a separate set of experiments, we observed that polylysine transfection efficacy peaked at 2 equivalents. 2J.-S. Remy, unpublished observations. For DOTAP, we used 6 μl of DOTAP/μg of plasmid. The volume of the solution intracellularly microinjected was determined using radiolabeled probes. 0.5% fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran supplemented with99Tc (80 μCi/μl) or 111In (50 μCi/μl) was injected into the nucleus of 100 cells. Immediately after injection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. Cells were trypsinized and suspended into 1.5 ml of culture medium, and the radioactivity of the solution in cpm was determined. Different solutions of known volumes and radioactive concentrations were used as internal standards. In COS-7 cells, 8735 ± 823 cpm/ml was measured in the cell lysate (n = four experiments) using 99Tc. This value corresponded to an estimated injection volume of 923 ± 191 fl/cell (range: 587 to 1402 fl/cell). A comparable estimate was also obtained using 111In. Thus, for a pCMV-LacZ plasmid concentration of 100 μg/ml, the number of injected cDNA copies was in the order of 10,000/cell. This value is 1 log lower than the number of cDNA copies entering a cell during transfection with PEI, as evaluated with electronic microscopy imaging (18Labat-Moleur F. Steffan A.M. Brisson C. Perron H. Feugeas O. Furstenberger P. Oberling F. Brambilla E. Behr J.P. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1010-1017PubMed Google Scholar). The large variability we observed in injection volume estimate is consistent with previous reports (19Minaschek G. Bereiter-Hahn J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our method has been reported in detail elsewhere (16Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baro I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Cells placed on glass coverslips were loaded with the intracellular dye SPQ (Molecular Probes) by incubation in hypotonic (50% dilution) medium. The coverslip was mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for fluorescence and illuminated at 370 nm. The emitted light was collected by a high resolution image intensifier coupled to a video camera (Extended ISIS camera system, Photonic Science) connected to a digital image processing board controlled by FLUO software (Imstar, Paris, France). To standardize the fluorescence response to solution changes, the initial fluorescence level in the presence of I− was taken as zero. The control Tyrode's solution for SPQ experiments contained 145 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, and 10 μm bumetanide, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. I− and NO3− media were identical to the control Tyrode solution except that I− or NO3−replaced Cl− as the dominant extracellular anion. pCMV-LacZ plasmids complexed or not with PEI were microinjected into COS-7 cells, which were analyzed for exogenous β-galactosidase expression 24 h post-injection. Control experiments demonstrated that nuclear or cytoplasmic injection with naked cDNA or with PEI·cDNA complexes was not associated with cell toxicity. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, epifluorescence microscopy discriminated cells that were correctly injected into the nucleus from those injected into the cytoplasm. The efficiency of our injection procedure was defined as the ratio between the number of cells per Petri dish exhibiting X-gal blue staining (Fig. 1 B) divided by the number of injected cells exhibiting fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran fluorescence. Fig. 2 A summarizes data obtained after intranuclear injection and shows that the injection efficiency increased according to a sigmoidal relation as the number of injected cDNA copies increased in the range 10−1–104 copies/cell. Fig. 2 A, (right panel) shows that transgene expression was comparable in the absence or presence of PEI, irrespective of the PEI/cDNA ratio used, i.e. of the ionic charge of the PEI·cDNA complexes. Data obtained with intracytoplasmic microinjections are summarized on Fig. 2 B. As previously reported (20Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1980; 22: 479-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 21Dowty M.E. Williams P. Zhang G. Hagstrom J.E. Woff J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4572-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Wilke M. Fortunati E. Van Der Broek M. Hoogeveen A. Scholte B.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1133-1142PubMed Google Scholar), intracytoplasmic injection of naked cDNA led to a low expression of the reporter gene (<15% of the cells), yet only at injected cDNA copies/cell greater than 103 (Fig. 2 B). Remarkably, cDNA complexation with PEI increased transgene expression (Fig. 2 B). Comparable expressions (40–50%) were observed after injection of 104 copies in the cytoplasm and 102 copies in the nucleus. Increased expression when cDNA was complexed with PEI was noticed only for PEI/DNA ratio higher or equal to 2 (Fig. 2 B) and may be a consequence of the electrostatic charge and/or of the morphology of the complexed DNA. Zeta potential (an indication of surface charge) measurements of PEI·cDNA complexes performed with increasing amounts of PEI showed that particles become neutral at a PEI/cDNA ratio around 3.5. The morphology of PEI·cDNA complexes may be inferred from a combination of centrifugation and electron microscopy experiments. Complexes formed at a PEI/cDNA ratio of 1 cannot be pelleted (<5%, 10 min, 11,000 × g), presumably because of extensive DNA looping out (Fig. 3), whereas for PEI/DNA ratio 2–10, complexes were compact and centrifugable (>80%). We next explored whether in cytoplasmic injection experiments, the reporter gene was necessarily reaching the nucleus at the time of cell division. To this goal, isolated cells (<10% confluency) were injected in the cytoplasm with pCMV-LacZ (104 cDNA copies/cell) complexed with 5 equivalents of PEI (n = 4 assays; 107 cells). If plasmid cDNA only had access to the nucleus during the transient breakdown of the nuclear membrane that is associated with mitosis, then one would expect to see only clusters of at least 2 cells expressing the transgene. We observed that 20 cells out of 40 expressing the transgene were isolated cells (Fig. 4), indicating that cell mitosis was not an absolute requirement for transgene expression.Figure 2Efficiency of intranuclear (A) and cytoplasmic (B) cDNA microinjections in COS-7 cells. In A and B (left panels) dose-effect relations with naked pCMV-LacZ cDNA (open symbols) or with PEI·cDNA complexes at 5 equivalents (filled symbols) are shown. A variable number of injected plasmid copies as indicated on the x axis was used. Data are mean ± S.E., with n between 178 and 650. Right panels show the effects of varying the PEI/cDNA ratio on injection efficiency.

X-gal staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) COS-7 were transfected with pCMV-LacZ complexed with PEI. Eight h post-transfection, a low percentage of cells showed β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5,left panel). At 12 and 24 h post-transfection, ≈20 and 60% of the cells expressed the transgene, respectively. By contrast, 4 h post-injection of naked or complexed cDNA into the nucleus, a high percentage of cells already expressed the transgene. In cells injected into the cytoplasm with naked cDNA, at least 12 h of incubation were needed to detect transgene expression. Eight h post-injection in the cytoplasm of PEI·cDNA complexes, a detectable proportion of cells stained blue. Prolonging the incubation period from 24 to 48 h only slightly increased expression efficiency. Expression kinetics were also followed using a pCMV-CFTR plasmid and a SPQ fluorescence assay. Measurements of membrane permeability to halide under cAMP stimulation was used to detect functional CFTR proteins in relation to post-injection time (Fig. 5, right panel). Direct intranuclear PEI/cDNA injection in COS-7 cells led to the expression of a CFTR-related conductance within 4 h, i.e. within the same time frame as β-galactosidase expression. Comparable kinetics were observed with nuclear injection of naked cDNA. Microinjection of PEI·pCMV-CFTR in the cytoplasm markedly delayed transgene expression in comparison to nuclear injections, with detectable transgene expression 12 h post-injection. We concluded that (i) exogene transcription and translation are fast processes and (ii) transgene expression kinetics after intracytoplasmic injection and transfection were comparable, pointing at plasmid intracellular trafficking to the nucleus as the rate-limiting step. Transfection efficiency was markedly variable between different cell lines, since it was much greater in COS-7 than in CFPAC-1 or A549 cells (Fig. 6 A). Consistent with previous studies using PEI (4Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar), transfection efficiency was optimal at a PEI/cDNA ratio of at least 5 equivalents, i.e. when complexes were positively charged. Nuclear injection of cDNA·PEI led to comparable expression for all cells (Fig. 6 B), suggesting similar transcription levels. By contrast, the efficiency after cytoplasmic injections markedly varied with the cell line, with the highest efficiency in COS-7 cells and the lowest in A549 cells. Finally, we investigated the influence of the vector's molecular nature on transgene expression. In agreement with previous reports (9Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 22Wilke M. Fortunati E. Van Der Broek M. Hoogeveen A. Scholte B.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1133-1142PubMed Google Scholar), neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear injection of cDNA complexed with cationic lipids such as dioctadecylamidoglycyl spermine or DOTAP produced blue stained cells (Fig. 7). By contrast, nuclear and cytoplasmic injections of cDNA complexed with polylysine produced consistent expression of the reporter gene albeit with a lower efficacy than with PEI (p < 0.001 in both cases). Our results demonstrate that cDNA complexation with cationic polymers promotes gene accessibility to the nucleus, a property that is not observed with cationic lipids. When 10,000 naked cDNA copies were injected in the cytoplasm, only 13% of the cells expressed the transgene. A comparable expression efficiency was obtained when less than 10 copies of naked cDNA were directly injected into the nucleus. This suggests that less than 1/1000 naked cDNA copies injected in the cytoplasm were effectively trafficked to the nucleus, an estimate that is in agreement with previous observations (9Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 18Labat-Moleur F. Steffan A.M. Brisson C. Perron H. Feugeas O. Furstenberger P. Oberling F. Brambilla E. Behr J.P. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1010-1017PubMed Google Scholar). A similar calculation shows that 1/100 cDNA·PEI complexes were trafficked to the nucleus and thus that cDNA complexation increased 10-fold the access of the transgene to the nucleus. Our results also show that in opposition to cationic lipids, cationic polymers when injected in the nucleus do not prevent gene expression and thus likely disassemble from cDNA in the nucleus, a process that is supposedly fast since expression kinetics were very similar with coated or uncoated cDNA. We have also showed that rupture of the nuclear envelope as occurs during cell division was not an absolute requirement for penetration of cDNA·PEI complexes into the nucleus. This observation is in agreement with efficient in vitro (23Sola B. Staedel C. Remy J.S. Bahr A. Behr J.P. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and in vivo (24Abdallah B. Hassan A. Benoist C. Goula D. Behr J.P. Demeneix B.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) PEI-mediated transfections of post-mitotic cells such as neurons. In addition, we found that compaction of plasmid cDNA into spherical particles rather than the ionic strength of the cDNA·PEI complexes appeared as a critical factor for transgene trafficking to the nucleus. Finally, expression kinetics after intracytoplasmic injection of cDNA·PEI complexes or classical PEI-mediated cell transfection were comparable, suggesting trafficking through the nuclear envelope as the rate-limiting step. The simplest explanation to account for our results as a whole is that plasmids coated with polymers but not with cationic lipids are targeted to the nucleus. However, alternative mechanisms could also very well explain our observations, including improved intracytoplasmic mobility or polymer-related protection of cDNA from endogenous nuclease degradation. Current programs in our laboratory are dedicated to evaluating this latter hypothesis. Transfection efficiency with PEI markedly varied depending on the cell line, with low levels of expression in CFPAC-1 or A549 epithelial cells. Intracytoplasmic injection of cDNA·PEI complexes in CFPAC-1 and in A549 cells led a lower level of expression as compared with COS-7 cells, although this did not reach significance in CFPAC-1 cells. These results suggest that intracellular barriers to plasmid trafficking quantitatively varies with cell type. Nuclear transport in mammalian cells is a critical limiting step in gene transfer using nonviral vectors (9Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 18Labat-Moleur F. Steffan A.M. Brisson C. Perron H. Feugeas O. Furstenberger P. Oberling F. Brambilla E. Behr J.P. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1010-1017PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are in line with a reasonable scheme proposed by Xu and Szoka (14Xu Y. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5616-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) postulating that during transfection, cDNA is released from cationic lipids in the cytoplasm and is then trafficked uncoated by an inefficient mechanism into the nucleus. The present work suggests that the sequence leading to transfection with cationic polymers differs from the latter scheme inasmuch as coated cDNA may penetrate post-mitotic nuclei where it is most likely released by competitive interaction with genomic DNA (25Remy J.S. Kichler A. Mordvinov V. Schuber F. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that cDNA compaction rather than the ionic charge of cDNA complexes improves nuclear targeting. Altogether these findings provide a novel mechanistic basis for rational vector design. We thank Dr. A. Faivre for his kind help with injection volume measurement. We thank B.

https://openalex.org/W2129091231,"Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is a member of the vertebrate HSF family that regulates stress-inducible synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Although the synthesis of the constitutively expressed and inducible members of the heat shock family of stress proteins correlates with increased cellular protection, their relative contributions in acquired cellular resistance or ""thermotolerance"" in mammalian cells is presently unknown. We report here that constitutive expression of multiple HSPs in cultured embryonic cells was unaffected by disruption of the murine HSF1 gene. In contrast, thermotolerance was not attainable in <i>hsf1</i> <sup>(−/−)</sup> cells, and this response was required for protection against heat-induced apoptosis. We conclude that 1) constitutive and inducibly expressed HSPs exhibit distinct physiological functions for cellular maintenance and adaptation, respectively, and 2) other mammalian HSFs or distinct evolutionarily conserved stress response pathways do not compensate for HSF1 in the physiological response to heat shock."

https://openalex.org/W2130638014,"NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes two-electron reductive metabolism and detoxification of quinones and their derivatives leading to protection of cells against redox cycling and oxidative stress. To examine the in vivo role of NQO1, a NQO1-null mouse was produced using targeted gene disruption. Mice lacking NQO1 gene expression showed no detectable phenotype and were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. However, NQO1-null mice exhibited increased toxicity when administered menadione compared with wild-type mice. These results establish a role for NQO1 in protection against quinone toxicity.

Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) also acts at sites of injury and stimulates similar vascular cell responses. We have, therefore, investigated whether there are specific interactions between bFGF and fibrinogen and fibrin that could play a role in coordinating these actions. Binding studies were performed using bFGF immobilized on Sepharose beads and soluble125I-labeled fibrinogen and also using Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen and soluble 125I-bFGF. Both systems demonstrated specific and saturable binding. Scatchard analysis indicated two classes of binding sites for each withKd values of 1.3 and 260 nm using immobilized bFGF; and Kd values of 0.9 and 70 nm using immobilized fibrinogen. After conversion of Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen to fibrin by treatment with thrombin, bFGF also demonstrated specific and saturable binding with two classes of binding sites having Kd values of 0.13 and 83 nm. Fibrin binding was also investigated by clotting a solution of bFGF and fibrinogen, and two classes of binding sites were demonstrated using this system with Kd values of 0.8 and 261 nm. The maximum molar binding ratios of bFGF to fibrinogen were between 2.0 and 4.0 with the four binding systems. We conclude that bFGF binds specifically and saturably to fibrinogen and fibrin with high affinity, and this may have implications regarding the localization of its effect at sites of tissue injury.

We conclude that bFGF binds specifically and saturably to fibrinogen and fibrin with high affinity, and this may have implications regarding the localization of its effect at sites of tissue injury. The vascular response to injury requires a coordinated interaction of the hemostatic and inflammatory systems and is regulated by cytokines and growth factors that act locally to regulate cellular proliferation and tissue repair. The hemostatic response results in platelet accumulation at the site of injury, and exposure of blood to tissue factor also leads to the formation of thrombin. Thrombin then cleaves fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen converting it to fibrin, which helps prevent blood loss and also serves as a temporary matrix to support tissue healing and remodeling. The role of fibrin in the cellular response is not passive as a structural matrix only, but rather it plays an active role through specific receptor-mediated interactions with cells of the blood and vessel wall. These result in fibrin-specific responses of endothelial cells including adhesion and spreading (1Bunce L.A. Sporn L.A. Francis C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), proliferation (2Sporn L.A. Bunce L.A. Francis C.W. Blood. 1995; 86: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protein synthesis (3Kaplan K.L. Mather T. DeMarco L. Solomon S. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 43-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and secretion (4Ribes J.A. Francis C.W. Wagner D.D. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Cytokines and growth factors are produced in response to injury and also act locally to modulate cell responses to vascular damage. Important among these are members of the fibroblast growth factor family, which includes 13 members exerting a variety of effects on many cells and organ systems (6Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In particular, bFGF 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor. increases endothelial cell migration and proliferation and also stimulates angiogenesisin vitro and in vivo (6Bikfalvi A.

Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). bFGF also regulates the expression of proteolytic mediators of angiogenesis including urokinase-type plasminogen activator and collagenase (8Gualandris A. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (9Mignatti P. Mazzieri R. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The role of bFGF in vessel injury and repair is further supported by evidence that bFGF is released from vessel wall cells after injury (10Villaschi S. Nicosia R. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar) and that bFGF mRNA is up-regulated in atherosclerotic arteries (11Hughes S.E. Crossman D. Hall P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1214-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and following vessel injury (12Casscells W. Lappi D.A. Olwin B.B. Wai C. Siegman M. Spier E.H. Sasse J. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The need for fibrin to support endothelial cell spreading, migration, angiogenesis, and the potent stimulation of the same responses by bFGF suggests that these processes may be interrelated. This concept is supported by evidence that fibrin clots are a good matrix to support bFGF-stimulated angiogenesis in vitro (13Deblois C. Cote M.-F. Doillon C.J. Biomaterials. 1994; 15: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Brown, K. J., Maynes, S. F., Bezos, A., Maguire, D. J., Ford, M. D., and Parish, C. R. Lab. Invest., 75, 539–555.Google Scholar). Little information is available, however, regarding specific interactions of bFGF with fibrin. We have, therefore, investigated the association of bFGF with fibrinogen and fibrin, and the results demonstrate high affinity specific and saturable binding.RESULTSBinding of fibrinogen to immobilized bFGF was saturable and specific with nonspecific binding representing less than 20% of the total (Fig. 1 A). Saturation of specific binding occurred at a fibrinogen concentration of 150 nm, and only an increase in nonspecific binding was observed at higher concentrations. In control experiments there was a maximum of 3% binding of 125I-fibrinogen over the same range of concentrations to beads with immobilized anti-bFGF immunoglobulin only or to beads with no protein bound and active sites blocked with ethanolamine. A plot of bound versus bound/free fibrinogen (Fig. 1 B) was nonlinear, suggesting the presence of more than one binding site. This was confirmed by Scatchard analysis, which indicated that binding was best described by a two-site model with apparent Kd values of 1.3 and 260 nm (Table I).Bmax was 6.3 and 35 nm for the high and low affinity sites, respectively, and the maximum molar binding ratio of bFGF to fibrinogen was 4.0.Table IBinding constants for the association of bFGF with fibrinogen and fibrinSystemKd1Kd2Bmax1Bmax2Maximum molar binding ratio of bFGF/fibrin(ogen)nmFibrinogen/bFGF-Sepharose1.3 ± 1.6260 ± 646.3 ± 3.135 ± 2.14.0 ± 0.5bFGF/fibrinogen-Sepharose0.9 ± 0.170 ± 120.3 ± .025.9 ± 0.72.0 ± 0.5bFGF/fibrin-Sepharose0.13 ± 0.183 ± 24.03 ± .015.9 ± 1.42.0 ± 0.9bFGF/fibrin clot0.8 ± 0.7261 ± 700.5 ± 0.360 ± 222.0 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab To further characterize the protein that bound to bFGF,125I-fibrinogen was passed over a column of immobilized bFGF. Following washing, the specifically bound protein was eluted with 2 mg/ml unlabeled fibrinogen (Fig. 2), and approximately 90% of bound label rapidly eluted in two fractions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the eluted protein showed bands consistent with the Aα, Bβ and γ chains of fibrinogen (Fig. 2, inset) establishing that the bound protein was fibrinogen and not a minor contaminant. In control experiments, less than 5% of bound radioactivity was eluted from the column with 2.0 mg/ml ovalbumin, demonstrating specificity of the elution.Figure 2Elution of bound protein from immobilized bFGF. 125I-Fibrinogen (1.0 mg/ml) was passed through a 1-ml column of Sepharose-immobilized bFGF. Following washing, the column was eluted with 2 mg/ml unlabeled fibrinogen, and fractions of 200 μl were collected. Approximately 90% of the bound radioactivity eluted in fractions 5 and 6 (1.0–1.2 ml elution volume). These fractions were pooled, and an aliquot was electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and used to prepare autoradiograms (inset). The polypeptide chain pattern in the eluted pool showed Aα, Bβ, and γ chains of fibrinogen and was similar to that in the starting material.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The association of bFGF and fibrinogen was also characterized using soluble 125I-radiolabeled bFGF and fibrinogen immobilized on Sepharose beads (Fig. 3). With this system, saturable and specific binding was also observed, and nonspecific binding represented 20% or less of the total. Saturation of specific binding was observed at a bFGF concentration of approximately 75 nm. Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3 B) indicated the presence of two binding sites of different affinities with apparent Kd values of 0.9 and 70 nm and a maximum molar binding ratio of 2.0 (Table I) as compared with 4.0 with radiolabeled fibrinogen binding to Sepharose-immobilized bFGF (Fig. 1 and Table I). Competitive inhibition of the binding was performed to further characterize the specificity and the degree of nonspecific association. 125I-bFGF at a concentration of 0.2 nm was incubated with Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen and then varying concentrations of unlabeled bFGF was added. The binding of 125I-bFGF to fibrinogen was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of unlabeled bFGF (Fig. 3 C), but 28% of the radiolabel remained at 100 nm bFGF, which we interpreted as nonspecific binding.Figure 3A, binding of bFGF to fibrinogen. 125I-bFGF was incubated with fibrinogen immobilized on Sepharose beads, and the amount of bound protein was determined as radioactivity associated with the beads following centrifugation and washing. Nonspecific binding (squares) was determined in the same way in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled bFGF. Specific binding (triangles) was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific from the total bound (diamonds). Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. B, Scatchard plot. The best fit of the data was determined by analysis with the Ligand program and is most consistent with involvement of two distinct binding sites.C, competitive inhibition of binding.

To characterize the association of bFGF with fibrin in the absence of polymerization, we incubated Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen with thrombin. The antibody-mediated immobilization of fibrinogen to the Sepharose beads prevents or limits association of the resulting fibrin, forming a surface with immobilized fibrin monomer. Binding of bFGF to fibrin (Fig. 4 A) was similar to that seen for fibrinogen using the same system with specific binding approaching saturation between 75 and 100 nm bFGF (Fig. 4 A). Nonspecific binding was low at bFGF concentrations below 15 nm and increased at higher concentrations. In contrast to the binding seen with fibrinogen, the bFGF binding curve at concentrations below 1 nm bFGF suggested the presence of a high affinity binding site of low capacity. This was confirmed by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 4 B), indicating the presence of two binding sites with apparent Kd values of 0.13 and 83 nm (Table I).Figure 4Binding of bFGF to fibrin monomer.Fibrinogen was immobilized on Sepharose beads and then converted to fibrin monomer by incubation with thrombin. 125I-bFGF was incubated with immobilized fibrin, and bound and free ligand were then separated by centrifugation.

The best fit of the data was determined using the Ligand program, and the presence of two distinct binding sites was indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of binding to polymerized fibrin presents technical and interpretive problems because of transport of bFGF into the gel is limited, and access to potential binding sites within individual fibrin fibers may also be restricted. We chose, therefore, to add125I-bFGF to a solution of fibrinogen, which was then clotted by the addition of thrombin to avoid problems of transport of bFGF into the gel. Total binding was measured with this clotting system in the absence of an unlabeled competitor, whereas nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100-fold molar access of unlabeled bFGF (Fig. 5). Nonspecific binding represented up to 40% of the total (Fig. 5 A). This was higher than that seen with binding to fibrinogen (Figs. 1 and 3) or to fibrin monomer (Fig. 4), possibly reflecting some entrapment of radiolabel within the fibrin gel. A plot of bound versus bound/free125I-bFGF was nonlinear (Fig. 5 B), and Scatchard analysis identified two distinct binding sites with apparentKd values of 0.8 and 261 nm, similar to those for fibrinogen (Table I). The maximum molar binding ratio of bFGF to fibrin was 2.0.Figure 5A, binding of 125I-bFGF to polymerized fibrin. 125I-bFGF was added to a solution of 100 μg/ml fibrinogen and then clotted by the addition of 0.5 units/ml of thrombin.

Two different experimental systems were used to characterize the association with either bFGF or fibrinogen immobilized on Sepharose beads. The results were similar, with both systems identifying high affinity binding sites withKd values of 1.3 and 0.9 nm and lower affinity sites with Kd values of 260 and 70 nm. The association of bFGF with fibrin was also characterized using two systems with either surface-immobilized fibrin or polymerized fibrin. The results of binding to fibrin were similar to those found using fibrinogen with two distinct binding sites. the Kd values for the high and low affinity sites were 0.13 and 0.8 nm and 83 and 261 nm for surface-immobilized and -polymerized fibrin, respectively.The maximum molar binding ratios for bFGF to fibrinogen or fibrin were between 2.0 and 4.0 with the different systems used. Considering that fibrinogen is a dimerically symmetric molecule (19Doolittle R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 195-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and that two binding sites with different Kd values were identified, the ratio of 4 bFGF to 1 fibrinogen would be expected and consistent with the presence of two structurally distinct and independent sites on each half-molecule. The expected ratio of 4 was, however, only found using a system in which fibrinogen bound to immobilized bFGF, whereas the ratio was lower using the other three approaches. One potential explanation for the lower binding ratio is that the access of bFGF to potential binding sites was limited. This would be reasonable with polymerized fibrin, as sites in both the D and E domains are involved in the reciprocal binding required for polymerization (20Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This could prevent concurrent binding of bFGF to any sites in close proximity or to those otherwise affected by polymerization. A similar explanation could explain reduced binding of bFGF to Sepharose-immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin if the binding site was either close to that recognized by the antibody J88B or altered by antibody binding. An alternative explanation for the lower than expected binding ratio is that one of the binding sites is present on only a minor variant of fibrinogen. There are several such fibrinogen variants including those due to heterogeneity at the carboxyl terminus of the γ chain (21Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5599-5604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or to variations in serine phosphorylation. These sites are known to be important in the molecular interactions and function of fibrinogen and fibrin as the γ chain site is involved both in binding to platelets (23Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Bednarek M.A. Sakon M. Hawiger J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2915-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and in factor XIII cross-linking (24Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4486-4491Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Ser3 of the α chain affects thrombin action (25Hanna L.S. Scheraga H.A. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4681-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This explanation could account for the ratio of 4 found with the system using bFGF immobilized on Sepharose as only those fibrinogen molecules with the high affinity site would bind. By contrast, the epitope recognized by J88B involves a structurally invariant site (17Odrljin T.M. Rybarczyk B.J. Francis C.W. Lawrence S.O. Hamaguchi M. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) so all fibrinogen molecules would be immobilized, whereas only a minority would possess the putative high affinity site. Ongoing studies designed to identify specific sites on fibrinogen and fibrin responsible for bFGF binding will be required to resolve this question.The significance of bFGF binding to fibrinogen and fibrin must be considered in relation to both the tissue distribution of bFGF and to the availability of other sites for binding within the vasculature. bFGF has a wide tissue distribution, and it is synthesized in culture by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, glial cells, and smooth muscle cells (6Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Rifkin D.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 26-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Vlodavsky et al. (26Vlodavsky I. Fridman R. Sullivan R. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have shown that endothelial cells synthesize bFGF, which then remains closely associated with the cells and bound to the basement membrane or cell matrix with aKd value of 610 nm. It is inactive as a complex with heparan sulfate or heparin but is stabilized and protected against proteolytic degradation (27Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 28Rosengart T.K. Johnson W.B. Friesel R. Clark R. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It can be released in active form by proteolytic degradation with plasmin (29Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) or heparitinase and by competition with heparin-like molecules (30Bhaskin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). bFGF is also present normally in plasma at a concentration up to 10 pg/ml (0.6 pm), and elevated levels up to 6 pm can be found in patients after cardiopulmonary bypass (31Medalion B. Merin G. Aingorn H. Miao H.-Q. Nagler A. Elami A. Ishai-Michaeli R. Vlodavsky I. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and chronic liver disease (32Jin-ho K. Tanimizu M. Hyodo I. Kurimoto F. Yamashita T. J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 32: 119-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The effects of bFGF are mediated through specific receptors, and four distinct genes encoding bFGF cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified. bFGF binds to FGFR1 and FGFR2 with similar affinities (33Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Moscatelli D. Kornbluth S. Hanafusa H. Basilico C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Dionne C.A. Crumley G. Bellot F. Kaplan J.M. Searfoss G. Ruta M. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and bFGF binds specifically and with higher affinity to intact baby hamster kidney cells with Kdvalues of 20 pm and 2 nm (35Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar).Heparin and heparan sulfate interact with both bFGF and fibrinogen and may play a role in modulating interactions between them. Heparin and heparan sulfate represent low affinity (Kd 470 nm) receptors for bFGF present in abundance on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix (36Schlessinger J. Lax J. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This binding increases the concentration of bFGF on the cell surface and may thereby promote the interaction of bFGF with high affinity transmembrane-signaling receptors. Heparin is not required for binding of bFGF to specific cell receptors (37Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but receptors are activated by receptor dimerization, which is promoted by heparin (38Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the affinity of bFGF for FGFR1 is increased approximately 10-fold in the presence of heparan sulfate or heparin (39Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. VanDyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D.R. Lear J.D. Hahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Receptor dimerization results in activation of protein tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation and further to activation of the signaling pathway for the initiation of cell proliferation (40Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Heparin mediates binding of bFGF to the luminal surface of endothelial cells as indicated by its displacement by incubation of heparin in vitro (31Medalion B. Merin G. Aingorn H. Miao H.-Q. Nagler A. Elami A. Ishai-Michaeli R. Vlodavsky I. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or by heparin infusionin vivo (31Medalion B. Merin G. Aingorn H. Miao H.-Q. Nagler A. Elami A. Ishai-Michaeli R. Vlodavsky I. Circulation. 1997; 95: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 41Thompson R.W. Whalen G.F. Saunders K.B. Hores T. D'more P.A. Growth Factors. 1990; 3: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Heparin also binds to fibrinogen and fibrin, and it may, therefore, alter their interactions with bFGF. Heparin binds to a site within the fibrinogen D domain (42Mohri H. Iwamatsu A. Ohkubo T. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 1994; 1: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and with higher affinity (Kd 0.8 μm) to the central E domain (43Odrljin T.M. Shainoff J.R. Lawrence S.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of fibrinopeptide B during conversion to fibrin exposes a new site at the amino terminus of the β chain including residues 15–42, which represent a higher affinity site (Kd 0.3 μm) that mediates fibrin-endothelial cell interactions (43Odrljin T.M. Shainoff J.R. Lawrence S.O. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 2050-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The binding of bFGF to fibrinogen has implications regarding the distribution and actions of bFGF within the vasculature. At normal plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (7 μm) and of bFGF (up to 6 pm) nearly all bFGF should be bound to fibrinogen considering the Kd values in the nanomolar range. However, other bFGF binding proteins, α2 macroglobulin (44Dennis P.A. Saksela O. Harpel P. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and soluble forms of FGF receptor (45Hanneken A. Ying W. Ling N. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9170-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), have also been identified in blood. The binding of bFGF to α2 macroglobulin involves formation of covalent bonds and is slow, requiring up to 4 h to reach completion (44Dennis P.A. Saksela O. Harpel P. Rifkin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7210-7216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three soluble truncated forms of the high affinity cell receptor FGFR1 have also been identified in plasma as binding proteins for bFGF (45Hanneken A. Ying W. Ling N. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9170-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but neither the plasma concentration nor binding affinities have been described. Further studies will be required to elucidate the distribution of bFGF binding to these plasma proteins and their role in influencing plasma half-life or bFGF activity.The binding of bFGF with fibrinogen and fibrin may have effects locally at sites of vessel injury or disease. Fibrinogen is found in both normal and atherosclerotic arterial walls (46Bini A. Kudryk B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This may also occur with fibrin that is also present in atherosclerotic vessels (47Shekhonin, B. V., Tararak, T. M., Samokhin, G. P., Mitkevich, O. V., Mazurov, A. V., Vinogradov, D. V., Vlasik, T.

Binding of bFGF to fibrin could, therefore, localize both molecules to sites where they are needed to support endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis.The binding of bFGF to fibrinogen and fibrin may also have effects on interactions with cell receptors and with signal transduction. Binding of endothelial cells to matrix glycoproteins through integrin receptors alters their sensitivity to growth factor-induced signaling mechanisms (49Klein S. Roghani M. Rifkin D.B. Exper. Suppl.

https://openalex.org/W2080599767,"Previous studies have shown that a Na+-dependent transport system is responsible for the transplacental transfer of the vitamins pantothenate and biotin and the essential metabolite lipoate. We now report the isolation of a rat placental cDNA encoding a transport protein responsible for this function. The cloned cDNA, when expressed in HeLa cells, induces Na+-dependent pantothenate and biotin transport activities. The transporter is specific for pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) for the transport of pantothenate and biotin in cDNA-transfected cells is 4.9 ± 1.1 and 15.1 ± 1.2 μm, respectively. The transport of both vitamins in cDNA-transfected cells is inhibited by lipoate with an inhibition constant (Ki) of approximately 5 μm. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT)) predicts a protein of 68.6 kDa with 634 amino acids and 12 potential transmembrane domains. Protein data base search indicates significant sequence similarity between SMVT and known members of the Na+-dependent glucose transporter family. Northern blot analysis shows that SMVT transcripts are present in all of the tissues that were tested. The size of the principal transcript is 3.2 kilobases.

SMVT represents the first Na+-dependent vitamin transporter to be cloned from a mammalian tissue. Vitamins are required for essential metabolic processes in all mammalian cells. Such cells have developed intrinsic mechanisms for active accumulation of essential vitamins. The small intestine and the kidney, tissues that are important for the absorption of vitamins, possess active transport mechanisms that mediate the transcellular transfer of these essential nutrients. The placenta also functions in the transcellular transfer of nutrients from mother to developing fetus. The syncytiotrophoblast, the absorptive epithelium of the placenta, possesses specific transport systems for several nutrients (1Smith C.H. Moe A.J. Ganapathy V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 183-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent studies (2Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17760-17765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated the presence of a Na+-dependent vitamin transport system in the placenta that accepts as substrates the water-soluble vitamins pantothenate and biotin and the essential metabolite lipoate. The active transport system responsible for the uptake of these compounds is driven by a transmembrane Na+ gradient. The uptake of [14C]pantothenate into human placental brush border membrane vesicles (4Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cells (2Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is mediated by a single saturable high affinity transport system with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2–8 μm. The uptake of the radiolabeled pantothenate is inhibited by biotin and lipoate. The uptake of [3H]biotin into human placental brush border membrane vesicles is Na+-dependent and is inhibited by pantothenate and lipoate (3Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17760-17765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a single transport system is responsible for the placental uptake of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate. There is also evidence that a similar transport process for these vitamins operates in the small intestine and kidney in the absorption of these three essential vitamins (5Said H.M. Redha R. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: G52-G55PubMed Google Scholar, 6Karnitz L.M. Gross C.J. Henderson L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the cloning and functional expression of a rat placental cDNA that encodes a Na+-dependent vitamin transporter responsible for the placental uptake of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate. This represents the first successful cloning of a Na+-dependent vitamin transporter from a mammalian tissue. SuperScript Plasmid System for cDNA cloning and Lipofectin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. Magna nylon transfer membranes were purchased from Micron Separations, Inc.d-[14C]Pantothenate (51.5 mCi/mmol) and [3H]biotin (58.2 Ci/mmol) were procured from NEN Life Science Products. The rat chromaffin granule amine transporter (rCGAT) (rVMAT II) clone used in the screening was kindly provided by Dr. B. J. Hoffman (NIMH, Bethesda, MD). d-Pantothenate was purchased from ICN Biochemicals, Inc., and d-biotin,dl-α-lipoic acid, and dl-myo-inositol were bought from Sigma. HeLa cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of penicillin, and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. Rat placental mRNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript Plasmid System with a modified oligo(dT) primer adapter containing a NotI site. Following second strand synthesis and addition of SalI adapters, the cDNA was digested with NotI to generate cDNA with NotI and SalI “sticky” ends for unidirectional cloning. The cDNA was then size-fractionated by gel filtration in a Sephacryl column. cDNA larger than 1 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s); kbp, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); rCGAT, rat chromaffin granule amine transporter; SMVT, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter; rSMVT, rat SMVT. was ligated toNotI-SalI-digested pSPORT vector and transformed into the competent DH10B strain of Escherichia coli by electroporation. This was done by colony screening of the plasmid cDNA library grown on Magna nylon transfer membranes as described by Vogeli and Kaytes (7Vogeli G. Kaytes P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe used for screening was a 1.45-kbp-long PstI fragment of rCGAT cDNA (8Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) that consisted of 14 bases 5′ to the translation start site and bases coding for the entire protein except the last 45 amino acids. The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Ready-to-go oligolabeling kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5× SSPE (1× SSPE = 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 mmEDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA. Post-hybridization washing was done at very low stringency conditions, which involved extensive washes with 3× SSPE/0.5% SDS at room temperature. Positive clones were identified, and the colonies were purified by secondary screening. Both sense and antisense strands of the cDNA were sequenced by primer walking. Sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method was performed byTaq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing with an automated Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA Sequencer. The sequence was analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package GCG version 7.B (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Data base searches were done using the GenBank™ Program BLAST (9Benson D.A. Boguski M. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cDNA was functionally expressed in HeLa cells by vaccinia virus expression system (10Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) as described previously (11Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. Biochem.

The cDNA was cloned in the plasmid pSPORT in such an orientation that the sense transcription of the cDNA was under the control of T7 promoter in the plasmid. Subconfluent HeLa cells grown in 24-well cell culture plates were first infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (VTF7-3) encoding T7 RNA polymerase. This was followed by Lipofectin-mediated transfection of the plasmid cDNA into the cells. After 12 h post-transfection, transport measurements were made at room temperature using [14C]pantothenate and [3H]biotin. The transport buffer was composed of 25 mm Hepes/Tris (pH 7.5), supplemented with 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. The incubation time for transport measurements was 30 min. Transport was terminated by aspiration of the uptake buffer followed by two washes with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. Following this, the cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH and transferred to vials for quantitation of the radioactivity associated with the cells. The Na+ dependence of the transport process was examined by isoosmotically substituting NaCl in the transport buffer with choline chloride. HeLa cells transfected with empty vector under similar conditions served as control. In experiments dealing with saturation kinetics, data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. Total RNA was isolated from various rat tissues using TRIzol reagent. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from these total RNAs by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography. 6 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different tissues was separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a Hybond-N transfer membrane by capillary blotting. the SalI-XbaI fragment consisting of the complete cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-to-go oligolabeling kit and used as the probe. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 6× SSPE, 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The post-hybridization wash was done at high stringency conditions that involved a final wash with 0.5× SSPE, 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. Previous studies from our laboratory have provided evidence for the expression of an organic cation/H+ antiporter in the placenta (13Ganapathy V. Ganapathy M.E. Nair C.N. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4561-4568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23632-23639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With an intent to clone this transporter from the rat placenta, we screened a rat placental cDNA library with rCGAT as the probe. rCGAT transports monoamines, which are cationic at physiological pH, in exchange for protons. Thus there is a functional similarity between the organic cation/H+ antiporter and rCGAT. We therefore thought that the two proteins may have significant sequence homology and that the rCGAT cDNA probe may lead to the identification of the organic cation/H+ antiporter cDNA clone by cross-hybridization. When the rat placental cDNA library was screened under low stringency conditions with the rCGAT cDNA probe, several positive clones were identified. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these clones, and the cloned inserts were released by restriction digestion with XbaI-SalI enzymes. The sizes of the inserts were analyzed on agarose gels, and clones larger than 2.0 kbp in size were sequenced at the 5′ end. Based on the nucleotide sequence so obtained, one clone was identical to the cloned rCGAT, another turned out to be rVMAT I (rSVAT) (8Liu Y. Peter D. Roghani A. Schuldiner S. Prive G.G. Eisenberg D. Brecha N. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 539-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 15Erickson J.D Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and several other clones did not have any homology to known cloned transporters. One of these clones, approximately 2.0 kbp in size, showed significant homology with known members of Na+-dependent glucose transporter family (Na+-dependent glucose transporters, Na+-dependent iodide transporter, Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters, and Na+-dependent myo-inositol transporter). This clone was partial and lacked the 5′ end of the cDNA including the translation start site. Therefore, a second screening of the same placental cDNA library was done using this partial cDNA as the probe. Three clones larger than 3.0 kbp were obtained, two of which turned out to be identical to the partial clone used as the probe except that they contained a ∼1.0-kbp-long 5′ extension. One of these was arbitrarily chosen for further characterization by complete sequence analysis and functional expression. The cloned cDNA is 3091 bp long and has an open reading frame of 1905 bp including the termination codon. The open reading frame is flanked by a 412-bp-long 5′ noncoding sequence and 774-bp-long 3′ noncoding sequence. The putative initiation codon is preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence (GTG AGG) (16Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). At the 3′ end, the cDNA has a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) followed by a poly(A)+ tail. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 634 amino acids. The primary structure of this protein is shown in Fig. 1. The protein has an estimated core molecular mass of 68.6 kDa and a pI of 7.86. Hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence using the Kyte-Doolittle method (17Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17287) Google Scholar) with a window size of 20 amino acids shows that the protein is highly hydrophobic with 12 putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 1). When modeled as most other cloned transporters, both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein face the cytoplasm. Three putativeN-glycosylation sites are present in the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 11 and 12. The C-terminal end of the protein following the last transmembrane domain is about 84 amino acids long and is highly hydrophilic. The functional expression of the clone was done in HeLa cells by transient transfection followed by vaccinia virus-induced expression of the cDNA. The function was monitored by the transport of radioactive substrates. Cells transfected with the empty vector were used to measure the endogenous transport activity. The ability of the expressed transporter to transport several substrates known to have sodium-dependent uptake mechanisms like ascorbate, carnitine, myoinositol, pantothenate, and biotin was investigated. Of these substrates tested, the uptake of only pantothenate and biotin was significantly increased in the cells transfected with the cDNA in comparison with the vector-transfected cells. The uptake of [14C]pantothenate was typically 4-fold higher in the cDNA-transfected cells compared with the endogenous transport measured in the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A) but varied between 3- and 8-fold between experiments. Replacement of Na+ with choline in the transport buffer resulted in the complete loss of the uptake activity, demonstrating the Na+ dependence of the transport process. Significant uptake of Na+-dependent pantothenate is also seen in HeLa cells transfected with empty vector, indicating that there is endogenous expression of this transporter in HeLa cells. The substrate specificity of the cloned transporter was analyzed by competition studies. Unlabeled pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate significantly inhibited the uptake of [14C]pantothenate into the cDNA-transfected cells, indicating that all three essential nutrients are substrates for the carrier. Myo-inositol, which is not a substrate of the carrier, failed to inhibit the uptake of the radiolabeled pantothenate. The substrate specificity of the transporter was also confirmed using [3H]biotin as the radiolabeled substrate. As seen in Fig. 2 B, the uptake of [3H]biotin in the presence of Na+ was stimulated more than 7-fold in the cDNA-transfected cells in comparison with the vector-transfected cells. Replacement of Na+ with choline in the transport buffer decreased the uptake drastically. The uptake of [3H]biotin was also inhibited by pantothenate and lipoate in addition to unlabeled biotin. Myo-inositol, as in the case of pantothenate uptake, had very little effect on the uptake of [3H]biotin. Thus, the transporter can transport pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate. Based on this substrate specificity, we refer to this new transporter as the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT). The characteristics (Na+dependence and substrate specificity) of the cloned transporter are similar to those of the native transporter present in JAR cells and placental brush border membrane vesicles (2Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17760-17765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate saturation kinetics of the cloned SMVT were analyzed in cDNA-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3). For the kinetic analysis of pantothenate uptake, the concentration of [3H]pantothenate in the uptake buffer was varied from 0.25 to 10 μm. The kinetics of biotin uptake was investigated by measuring the transport over a biotin concentration range of 2.5–100 μm with the [3H]biotin concentration kept constant at 15 nm. Due to the nonavailability of labeled lipoate, the inhibition of [14C]pantothenate and [3H]biotin uptake by lipoate in cDNA-transfected HeLa cells was analyzed. The concentration of lipoate was varied from 0.316 to 31.6 μm. For the uptake of pantothenate and of biotin, the experimental values fit best to a transport model consisting of a single transport system plus a nonsaturable diffusion component. The values for the kinetic constants, Kt and Vmax, for the uptake of pantothenate in cDNA-transfected cells are 4.9 ± 1.1 μm and 0.93 ± 0.2 nmol/106 cells/30 min, respectively. The corresponding values for the vector-transfected cells are 1.6 ± 0.5 μm and 46.1 ± 8.6 pmol/106 cells/30 min, respectively. The Kt and Vmax values for biotin uptake are 15.1 ± 1.2 μm and 1.3 ± 0.1 nmol/106 cells/30 min, respectively, in cDNA-transfected cells and 5.8 ± 1.8 μm and 37.2 ± 5.1 pmol/106 cells/30 min, respectively, in vector-transfected cells. The IC50value (i.e. the concentration necessary to cause 50% inhibition) of lipoate is 7.0 ± 1.5 μm in the case of pantothenate uptake and 6.4 ± 1.1 μm in the case of biotin uptake in cDNA-transfected cells. The corresponding values in vector-transfected cells are 4.6 ± 1.1 and 2.5 ± 0.3 μm. The inhibition constants (Ki) for lipoate, determined using these values according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (18Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar) are 5.0 ± 1.1 μm for pantothenate uptake and 6.4 ± 1.1 μm for biotin uptake in the cDNA transfected cells. Thus the affinity of SMVT for the different substrates is in the following order: pantothenate > lipoate > biotin. The apparent broad substrate specificity of this Na+-dependent vitamin transporter may have physiological importance. To understand the molecular basis for the ability of the transporter to recognize pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate as substrates, we compared the three-dimensional structure of these three essential nutrients. All three molecules possess a long side chain containing a carboxylate group. Biotin and lipoate possess ring structures. Even though such a ring structure is not apparent in pantothenate, it is possible that hydrogen bonding between the amino group of the β-alanine moiety and the hydroxyl group in the pantoic acid moiety of the molecule may induce a ring conformation. It is known that both biotin and lipoate bind to avidin (19Hale G. Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1992; 249: 247-253Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and apparently a significant similarity in the molecular structure of these essential metabolites provides a rational basis for these findings. Thus the structural domains of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate that bear significant similarity are most likely involved in the substrate recognition of the cloned transporter. The ability of this transporter to mediate the cellular uptake of three different essential nutrients may have biologic importance. Pantothenate as a component of coenzyme A, biotin as a coenzyme for carboxylation reactions, and lipoate as a component in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate and also as an antioxidant are crucial for viable metabolic function in all cells. As the transport protein responsible for the cellular uptake of these three essential nutrients, SMVT plays a very important physiological function. Sequence comparison with the sequences in the SwissProt data base shows that SMVT exhibits significant homology with some of the other known sodium-dependent nutrient transporters. Of these, the pantothenate permease from E. coli (20Jackowski S. Alix J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Hemophilus influenzae (21Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4701) Google Scholar) and the mammalian iodide transporter, glucose transporters, and myo-inositol transporter show maximal homology with SMVT. The percentage of similarity and identity values obtained from such a comparison are presented in Table I. Interestingly, the pantothenate permeases from E. coli and H. influenzae are functionally similar to SMVT. The pantothenate permease (panF) gene of E. coli has been functionally expressed following cloning (20Jackowski S. Alix J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene codes for a protein that catalyzes the sodium-dependent uptake of pantothenate into the bacterium. The permease gene of H. influenza was identified by homology search. Similar to the mammalian SMVT, the bacterial and viral pantothenate permeases are integral membrane proteins with 12 putative transmembrane domains. The bacterial protein is specific to pantothenate with a Kt of 0.4 μm (22Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is lower in comparison with the mammalian counterpart, which has a Kt of 2–8 μm. However, it is not known whether biotin and lipoate are also transported by the bacterial and viral pantothenate permeases. It is interesting to note that rCGAT, which does not belong to the Na+-dependent glucose transporter family, has 46% similarity and 20% identity with rSMVT at the protein level. This probably explains why the rCGAT cDNA probe hybridized to the rSMVT cDNA during the library screening.Table IHomology of rSMVT to the known members of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter familyProteinSimilarityIdentity%E. coli pantothenate permease (panF)5323H. influenzae pantothenate permease (panF)5622Rat Na+-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1)5225Rat Na+-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2)5122Rat Na+-dependent iodide transporter (NIT)6440Rat Na+-dependent nucleoside transporter (cNT1)4821Rat Na+-dependent nucleoside transporter (SPNT)4419Human myo-inositol transporter5023 Open table in a new tab Poly(A)+RNA isolated from several tissues of rat was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization for the presence of mRNA transcripts of SMVT (Fig. 4). Transcripts were detected in all of the tissues analyzed. The size of the primary transcript was 3.2 kb. An additional minor hybridizing transcript of 6.5 kb was also seen in all tissues. Quantitatively, the absorptive tissues like the intestinal mucosa, kidney, and placenta have very high amounts of the SMVT-specific mRNA. Significant amounts of SMVT transcripts are seen in other tissues such as the liver, brain, lung, heart, and skeletal muscle. This is not surprising because SMVT transports three different vitamins that are obligatory for the proper metabolic functioning of every cell. In conclusion, we have isolated a cDNA (rSMVT) from a rat placental cDNA library that when expressed in HeLa cells induces Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate. The functional characteristics of the induced activity are similar to those of the pantothenate/biotin transport activity described in the placenta and JAR cells. Tissue distribution of the SMVT transcripts suggests that this protein may be involved in the entry of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate in all cell types. Homology search indicates that SMVT gene belongs to the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family. We thank Dr. Beth J. Hoffman (NIMH, Bethesda, MD) for providing the rat CGAT clone. We also thank Dr. Matthias Brandsch and Dr. Reinhard Paschke (Biocentre, Martin-Luther-Universität, Halle-Wittenberg, Germany) for the analysis and comparison of the three-dimensional structures of pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate."
https://openalex.org/W2109425462,"Abstract MDC-15 (ADAM-15, metargidin), a membrane-anchored metalloprotease/disintegrin/cysteine-rich protein, is expressed on the surface of a wide range of cells and has an RGD tripeptide in its disintegrin-like domain. MDC-15 is potentially involved in cell-cell interactions through its interaction with integrins. We expressed a recombinant MDC-15 disintegrin-like domain as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (designated D-15) in bacteria and examined its binding function to integrins using mammalian cells expressing different recombinant integrins. We found that D-15 specifically interacts with αvβ3 but not with the other integrins tested (α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, α6β1, α6β4, αvβ1, αIIbβ3, and αLβ2). Mutation of the tripeptide RGD to SGA totally blocked binding of D-15 to αvβ3, suggesting that D-15-αvβ3 interaction is RGD-dependent. When the sequence RPTRGD is mutated to NWKRGD, D-15 is recognized by both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, suggesting that the receptor binding specificity is mediated by the sequence flanking the RGD tripeptide, as in snake venom disintegrins. These results indicate that the disintegrin-like domain of MDC-15 functions as an adhesion molecule and may be involved n αvβ3-mediated cell-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1964484264,"Moesin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of membrane/cytoskeletal linkage proteins, is known to be threonine-phosphorylated at Thr558 in activated platelets within its conserved putative actin-binding domain. The pathway leading to this phosphorylation step and its control have not been previously elucidated. We have detected and characterized reactions leading to moesin phosphorylation in human leukocyte extracts. In vitro phosphorylation of endogenous moesin, which was identified by peptide microsequencing, was dependent on phosphatidylglycerol (PG) or to a lesser extent, phosphatidylinositol (PI), but not phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Analysis of charge shifts, phosphoamino acid analysis, and stoichiometry was consistent with a single phosphorylation site. By using mass spectroscopy and direct microsequencing of CNBr fragments of phospho-moesin, the phosphorylation site was identified as KYKT*LRQIR (where * indicates the phosphorylation site) (Thr558), which is conserved in the ERM family. Recombinant moesin demonstrated similar in vitro phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation compared with the endogenous protein. The phosphorylation site sequence of moesin displays a high degree of conservation with the pseudosubstrate sequences of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. We identified the kinase activity as PKC-θ on the basis of immunodepletion of the moesin kinase activity and copurification of PKC-θ with the enzymic activity. We further demonstrate that PKC-θ displays a preference for PG vesicles over PI or PS/DAG, with minimal activation by DAG, as well as specificity for moesin compared with myelin basic protein, histone H1, or other cellular proteins. Expression of a human His6-tagged PKC-θ in Jurkat cells and purification by Ni2+ chelate chromatography yield an active enzyme that phosphorylates moesin. PG vesicle binding experiments with expressed PKC-θ and moesin demonstrate that both bind to vesicles independently of one another. Thus, PKC-θ is identified as a major kinase within cells with specificity for moesin and with activation under non-classical PKC conditions. It appears likely that this activity corresponds to a specific intracellular pathway controlling the function of moesin as well as other ERM proteins.

Although closely related, there is evidence that these proteins have distinct functions, based upon their patterns of intracellular and tissue distribution. Moesin is named for its association with extracellular extensions (membrane-organizing-extensionspike protein). ERM proteins have N-terminal membrane-binding domains and C-terminal actin-binding domains. Relatively little is known about their intracellular control, although phosphorylation of moesin Thr558 by an unidentified kinase in activated platelets has recently been described (1Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This residue is within the previously identified actin-binding domain of ezrin, which is highly conserved in moesin (2Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This laboratory has been studying a distinctive protein phosphorylation reaction characterized by stimulation of more than 10-fold with the addition of appropriate phospholipid vesicles in the presence of Mn2+, in preference to Mg2+, but not requiring Ca2+ (3Elias L. Davis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7023-7028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Klemm D.J. Elias L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7580-7585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Klemm D.J. Elias L. Exp. Hematol. 1988; 16: 855-860PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions phosphorylation was strikingly specific for two major endogenous substrates from human leukemic cell extracts, which were 47 and 73 kDa by SDS-PAGE. This activity was found to be most highly expressed in both normal and malignant hemopoietic cells and tissues of both human and murine origin. We noted the activation requirements of these reactions to contrast with those of classical PKC isozymes and therefore embarked upon the purification and identification of the components of this system from human leukocytes. Previously, we identified the 47-kDa substrate as the small calpain fragment of talin, a protein which has homology to ERM proteins and is involved in focal adhesions of cells to substratum (6Simons P.C. Elias L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3343-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We here report the purification and identification of the 73-kDa substrate as moesin. We furthermore have identified the moesin kinase present in our cell extracts as protein kinase C-θ, a novel PKC isozyme, which is known to be highly expressed in hemopoietic lineage cells but is of unknown function. These results thus provide evidence for a novel pathway of control of ERM proteins by PKC-θ. The results also provide insights into the specificity of PKC-θ for moesin and the activation requirements for PKC-θ, which has not previously been shown to be activated by Mn2+ and PG. All electrophoresis materials were supplied by Bio-Rad, and all other chemicals, as well as the catalytic subunit of PKA, were supplied by Sigma unless otherwise noted. Protein kinase C (PKC), purified from rat brain, was obtained from Lipidex (Westfield, NJ) and is a mixture of isozymes. Isozyme-specific anti-PKC sera used for immunodepletion experiments were obtained from R & D Ab Diagnostics (Berkeley, CA). These antibodies, with the exception of anti-PKC-ε, are capable of immunoprecipitation. Anti-PKC-θ specific for the V3 region of PKC-θ was used as described previously (7Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); anti-PKC-θ (F-13) specific for the C-terminal residues 691–703, anti-PKC-α (C-20) specific for C-terminal residues 651–672, and anti-His6 probe (H-15) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies and reagents for ECL detection were obtained from Amersham. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out as described previously (6Simons P.C. Elias L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3343-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the phospholipid was sonicated in water for 30 min to produce a suspension of vesicles. After the reaction, proteins were precipitated by adding 1/10 volume of 0.15% deoxycholic acid, mixing, and then quickly adding 1/10 volume of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, mixing, and centrifuging in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. This method improves protein yield and results in a stable precipitate (8Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). The precipitate was rinsed once with 20 μl of water, dissolved in 10 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer at 56 °C for 10 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE as described (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried between cellophane sheets, and autoradiograms were made. Protein determinations were done as described (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Purification of the 73-kDa substrate was carried out as described previously, including ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography of proteins on CM-cellulose (6Simons P.C. Elias L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3343-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was based on earlier work (11Bruns K.A. Elias L. Blood. 1988; 72 (Abstr. 81a): 234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions from a gradient elution of the CM-cellulose column were assayed for PG-stimulable phosphorylation of a 73-kDa substrate, and the peak fractions (about 0.1–0.15 m NaCl) were combined and concentrated using a PM-30 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA); 40 ml of pelleted acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells from a patient gave 4 ml of CM-cellulose fraction with 14 mg of protein. 400 μl of this was adsorbed to PG vesicles as in the assay (800 μl total), incubated at 30 °C for 5–15 min, put on ice for 5–15 min, and then spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the PG vesicles including adsorbed proteins were suspended in 200 μl of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.6% Ampholines, pH 6–7 (Serva; Crescent Chemicals, Hauppauge, NY), 0.4% Ampholines, pH 3.5–10, 8% sucrose. This was divided between two isoelectric focusing tubes 0.15 cm inner diameter by 18 cm, containing a 0–40% sucrose gradient plus the Ampholines listed above, as described (12Korant B.D. Lonberg-Holm K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 100 V was applied for 18 h and then 0.25-ml fractions were collected through a 26-gauge needle and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The three fractions containing pp73 (determined by a 32P-radiolabeled tracer and SDS-PAGE) were co-precipitated with deoxycholate plus trichloroacetic acid as described above and rinsed on ice with 50 μl of cold acetone. The precipitates were submitted to the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University (New Haven, CT) for trypsin digestion, HPLC separation of the resulting peptides, and Edman sequencing of two of the peptides. One peptide gave a major and a minor sequence. To identify the phosphorylation site, 32P-labeled moesin was digested with CNBr, and the peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The radioactive peak was analyzed by mass spectroscopy using matrix-assisted laser desorption (performed at the Yale University facility). This system is capable of 1-Da accuracy at 3500 Da. Manual amino acid sequencing of the32P-labeled moesin peptides was performed as described (13Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A further partial purification of moesin, starting at the CM-cellulose pool, resulted in separation of moesin, moesin kinase, and phosphatase activity. The CM-cellulose pool was equilibrated in 0.02 mTris, pH 7.5, applied to a column of DEAE 8HR (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and eluted with a linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl. moesin eluted at about 0.25 m NaCl, just before the endogenous kinase activity. cDNA to human moesin was generously given by H. Furthmayr (Stanford University) in plasmid form. Double-stranded cDNA was generated by the polymerase chain reaction, making the two BglI fragments of moesin, using the following two primer pairs: 5′-CATGCCCAAAACGATCAGTGT plus 5′-CAAGGCCTCCTTGGCCTCT and 5′-TTACATAGACTCAAATTCGTCAAT plus 5′-AGAGGCCAAGGAGGCCTTG. The products were cut with BglI (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.28-5.32Google Scholar) and ligated, and after agarose gel electrophoresis, full-length moesin cDNA was obtained using Geneclean (Bio 101, La Jolla). Primers were synthesized to allow insertion into the NheI toKpnI site of the bacterial expression vector pRSETA (Invitrogen, San Diego): 5′-CCGGCTAGCATGCCCAAAACGATCAGTGT plus 5′-GCGGGTACCTTACATAGACTCAAATTCGTCAAT. The resulting DNA was ligated into the vector and used for transformation of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) containing pLys S for expression of protein (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). This sequence codes for moesin preceded by the protein “tag” MRGSHHHHHHGMAS; the six-histidine (His6) tag binds tightly to a nickel (Ni2+) chelate column (see below). Protein expression was adequate in E. coli grown in L broth at 37 °C in the absence of inducer. 50 ml of L broth supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol were inoculated with a fresh colony, grown for 8 hours, and centrifuged at 5,000 ×g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in water to a total volume of 4 ml and then quick frozen. The thawed suspension was sonicated with 40 bursts from a microtip at 30% duty, using a Bronson sonifier set at output 2. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the 3.2 ml of supernatant was combined with 3.2 ml of “bind” buffer and applied to a 2-ml Ni2+ chelate affinity column (Invitrogen). The column was rinsed according to the supplier's instructions, and the recombinant moesin was eluted with an imidazole gradient from 0 to 400 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing moesin were combined and equilibrated in 10 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol by passage through a P6DG column (Bio-Rad). Residual phosphatases were removed by passage through a 1-ml CM-cellulose column with a 0–0.3 m NaCl gradient over 10 ml. Fractions of 1 ml were again analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions 5–7 were combined, and glycerol was added to 7%, and the preparation was frozen. Recombinant His6-moesin was judged to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Isozyme-specific PKC rabbit antibodies were purified from crude antisera by performing a 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation. This step effectively removed phosphatase activity present in serum. The precipitated IgG fraction was dialyzed into TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and the total protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE using different amounts of molecular weight standards. An aliquot of the CM-cellulose-purified moesin kinase was incubated with 1 μg each of the isozyme-specific and non-immune IgG in TBS at 4 °C for 60 min, followed by protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz) for an additional 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used in the moesin kinase assay described above. Each step in the purification of protein kinase activity utilized His6-moesin (10 μg/ml) as a substrate in the phosphorylation reaction described above. Cells from patients with AML were obtained by leukapheresis. Cells were pelleted at 500 ×g, rinsed with PBS, and stored in BSB (10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) at −70 °C. Forty ml of packed cells were thawed, suspended in BSB containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and homogenized in a Brinkmann Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was used for sequential ammonium sulfate fractionation. A 35–60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in BSB, and then desalted on Sephadex G-50 (50 ml) equilibrated in BSB. The eluate was applied to a 20-ml CM-cellulose column equilibrated in BSB and rinsed with 2 column volumes of buffer. A step gradient from 0.05 to 0.3 m NaCl was used to elute protein kinase activity from the column. Active fractions were pooled and desalted into DEAE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA) using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell. The sample was applied to a Millipore DEAE 8HR column and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in DEAE buffer. Active fractions were pooled and desalted into DEAE buffer and then fractionated on heparin-Sepharose. The heparin-Sepharose column was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 2.0m NaCl in DEAE buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μmNaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Glycerol was added to each column fraction to obtain a final concentration of 10% before freezing at −70 °C. Jurkat Tag cells are stably transfected with the SV40 large T antigen, which is used to promote expression of genes cloned in the pEF vector (16Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pEF-PKC-θ contains the complete coding region of PKC-θ and an in-frame His6tag at the C terminus. Cells (2 × 107) were electroporated with 20 μg of pEF-PKC-θ or pEF-neo (empty vector control) plasmids in a volume of 400 μl of RPMI 1640 medium using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 260 V and 960 microfarads. The cells were transferred to a flask containing 10% fetal calf serum in RPMI medium and 700 μg/ml G418 and grown for 48 h. The cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, and then lysed in 1 ml of binding buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were used for purification using 0.1 ml of Ni2+ affinity beads. The beads were mixed with supernatants for 60 min at 4 °C and then rinsed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer and then three times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5. The beads were then rinsed once with TBS to remove detergent, and bound proteins were eluted by incubation of the beads in 0.1 ml of 500 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, in TBS containing 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50% glycerol for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the eluates from the Ni2+ affinity beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PKC-θ (V3-specific) and anti-His6 antibodies. Both antibodies detected a single immunoreactive band at 80 kDa in the eluate from the pEF-PKC-θ-transfected cells but not pEF neo-transfected cells. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 62 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine containing 20% methanol at 280 mA for 45 min. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid to identify the molecular weight standards and destained in PBST (PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20). The blots were incubated with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST for 15 min and then with primary antibodies for 60 min. After several rinses in PBST, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG for 30 min and then rinsed with PBST before detection with ECL reagent (Amersham). Chloroform solutions of lipid were dried with a stream of N2, and the dried lipid was suspended in water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with vigorous vortexing. The solution was sonicated in a 20 °C water bath for 15 min to give phospholipid vesicles, and buffer was added to give a stock concentration of 0.5 mg/ml phospholipid, 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl. Phospholipid vesicles (100 μg/ml final concentration) were mixed with or without His6-moesin (0.5 μg) and/or expressed PKC-θ-His6 in a buffer containing 3 mmMn2+, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then for an additional 10 min on ice. The tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain supernatant and pellet fractions, which were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Prior to the addition of PKC-θ-His6and His6-moesin to vesicles, the solutions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove aggregated protein. The partial purification of pp73 from 40 ml of human leukemic cells utilized the same ammonium sulfate precipitation and CM-cellulose chromatography as were used previously for identifying pp47, which is phosphorylated under similar conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). The peak CM-cellulose fractions for pp73 purification were obtained at 0.1–0.15 m NaCl and contained both enzyme and substrate but very little phosphatase. We estimated purification at this step at about 100-fold, based upon a 50% yield estimate, which was inexact due to phosphatases in the starting material. As shown in Fig. 1, the partially purified system exhibits characteristics similar to our previous observations in whole cell extracts, with lane 3demonstrating optimal phosphorylation of pp73 with Mn2+ and PG (3Elias L. Davis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7023-7028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The order of phospholipid preference was PG > PI > PS > no lipid, shown in lanes 3, 2, 5, and 1, respectively. We also wished to determine whether the phosphorylation was due to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or to classical PKC. In lane 4, addition of rat brain PKC, under optimal conditions for phosphorylation of pp73,i.e. Mn2+ and PG, resulted in a decrease in pp73 phosphorylation compared with the CM-cellulose fraction alone in lane 3. In lane 7, addition of rat brain PKC in the presence of PS/DAG/Ca2+ resulted in the phosphorylation of a 75-kDa protein, not pp73. In contrast to the lack of phosphorylation of pp73, the talin fragment was heavily phosphorylated in lane 7 compared with lane 6, merely by the addition of rat brain PKC. In lane 9, addition of the catalytic subunit of PKA under optimal PKA conditions gave almost no phosphorylation of pp73, whereas a band of about 55 kDa was heavily phosphorylated. Thus the CM-cellulose fraction exhibited the Mn2+ dependence and PG preference in phosphorylation noted previously, and the phosphorylation was not due to PKA or to classical PKC which is stimulated by PS/DAG/Ca2+. Since two-dimensional gels showed that there were no significant amounts of other proteins at this pI (∼6.5, data not shown), a preparative purification was conducted using adherence of proteins to PG vesicles under assay conditions as above. This was followed by isoelectric focusing in a sucrose gradient (12Korant B.D. Lonberg-Holm K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and fractions containing pp73 were identified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. These fractions were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Three peptide sequences were obtained and were found to be identical to the ERM protein moesin (Table I). The peptide sequences are inconsistent with those of the closely related proteins ezrin (17Gould K.L. Bretscher A. Esch F.S. Hunter T.

Fig. 2 shows that the phosphorylation of recombinant moesin is PG-stimulable (lane 4 versus lane 3) and that the amount of phosphorylation is roughly comparable to the phosphorylation of endogenous pp73 on a per weight basis (lane 4 versus lane 2). As a control, there is no kinase activity in the purified recombinant moesin fraction alone (lane 5). The cyanogen bromide fragmentation patterns of pp73 and recombinant moesin are identical upon SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Since ezrin has been reported to be multiply phosphorylated, we determined the extent of our in vitro reaction in two ways. First, the maximum phosphate we were able to incorporate was 0.8 mol of phosphate per mol of moesin, which suggests only one phosphorylation. Second, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed on moesin (22O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) generated a charge train of spots which established that the distance between 1 and 2 corresponded to 1 charge unit (data not shown). It is probable that spot 2 is the deamidation product of spot 1, since moesin contains an asparagine-glycine sequence, which is most permissive for deamidation at mild pH and temperature (24Paranandi M.V. Guzzetta A.W. Hancock W.S. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we observed that more of spot 2 was produced by longer storage. Phosphorylation to approximately 20% gave two more spots (Fig. 3, middle) labeled 3 and 4; these spots were radioactive (Fig. 3,bottom). We interpret the data to infer that a single phosphorylation of native moesin, spot 1, produces spot 3 and that a single phosphorylation of deamidated moesin, spot 2, gives spot 4. Moesin phosphorylation did not result in additional spots. A similar pattern of spots using recombinant phospho- and dephospho-moesin was observed upon two-dimensional gel analysis (data not shown). We next determined the site of phosphorylation in moesin. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that greater than 95% of the label was on threonine. Cyanogen bromide fragmentation of phosphorylated moesin showed one main radioactive fragment by SDS-PAGE (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) of about 3 kDa. About 80% of the radioactivity was in a single peak of approximately 3 kDa. Analysis of this peptide by mass spectrometry showed a peak at 3,517 Da, which is exactly the mass expected of a phosphorylated moesin CNBr fragment (550RLGRDKYKTLRQIRQGNTKQRIDEFESM577). Manual Edman degradation of this peptide coupled to an arylamine membrane (13Sullivan S. Wong T.W. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2007948363,"To determine the role of individual saccharide residues of a specific heparin pentasaccharide, denoted DEFGH, in the allosteric activation of the serpin, antithrombin, we studied the effect of deleting pentasaccharide residues on this activation. Binding, spectroscopic, and kinetic analyses demonstrated that deletion of reducing-end residues G and H or nonreducing-end residue D produced variable losses in pentasaccharide binding energy of ∼15–75% but did not affect the oligosaccharide's ability to conformationally activate the serpin or to enhance the rate at which the serpin inhibited factor Xa. Rapid kinetic studies revealed that elimination of the reducing-end disaccharide marginally affected binding to the native low-heparin-affinity conformational state of antithrombin but greatly affected the conversion of the serpin to the activated high-heparin- affinity state, although the activated conformation was still favored. In contrast, removal of the nonreducing- end residue D drastically affected the initial low-heparin-affinity interaction so as to favor an alternative activation pathway wherein the oligosaccharide shifted a preexisiting equilibrium between native and activated serpin conformations in favor of the activated state. These results demonstrate that the nonreducing-end residues of the pentasaccharide function both to recognize the native low-heparin-affinity conformation of antithrombin and to induce and stabilize the activated high-heparin-affinity conformation. Residues at the reducing-end, however, poorly recognize the native conformation and instead function primarily to bind and stabilize the activated antithrombin conformation. Together, these findings establish an important role of the heparin pentasaccharide sequence in preferential binding and stabilization of the activated conformational state of the serpin."
https://openalex.org/W2080447461,"The role of the cAMP signaling pathway in vascular calcification was investigated using calcifying vascular cells (CVC) derived from primary aortic medial cell cultures. We previously showed that CVC have fibroblastic morphology and express several osteoblastic differentiation markers.

Here, we investigated the effects of cAMP on CVC differentiation because it plays a role in both osteoblastic differentiation and vascular disease. Dibutyryl-cAMP or forskolin treatment of CVC for 3 days induced osteoblast-like “cuboidal” morphology, inhibited proliferation, and enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity, all early markers of osteoblastic differentiation. Isobutylmethylxanthine and cholera toxin had the same effects. Treatment of CVC with pertussis toxin, however, did not induce the morphological change or increase alkaline phosphatase activity, although it inhibited CVC proliferation to a similar extent. cAMP also increased type I procollagen production and gene expression of matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein, recently shown to play a role in in vivo vascular calcification. cAMP inhibited the expression of osteopontin but did not affect the expression of osteocalcin and core binding factor.

Other cloned subpopulations of artery wall cells do not form nodules even in prolonged culture conditions, suggesting that CVC represent a specific subpopulation (6Watson K. Bostrom K.

Such cells may account for pathologic calcification in other mesenchymal tissues. The cAMP signaling pathway plays a role in both osteoblast differentiation and vascular disease. In osteoblasts, parathyroid hormone modulates differentiation via the cAMP-mediated pathway (11Partridge N.C. Bloch S.R. Pearman A.T. J. Cell.

Levels of cAMP are also significantly increased in atherosclerotic lesions and aortas of animals on a high cholesterol diet (20Augustyn J.M. Zeigler F.

During osteoblast development, a series of events occurs as cells undergo differentiation (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Proliferation declines before the onset of differentiation, and various osteoblastic marker genes, involved in extracellular matrix development and mineralization, are expressed in waves: Coll I is expressed maximally during proliferation and declines progressively, whereas alkaline phosphatase and matrix GLA protein (MGP) expression start low and peak during the matrix development/maturation stage, and osteopontin and osteocalcin expression increase and reach a maximum during the matrix mineralization stage (22Stein G.S.

Because the cAMP pathway plays a role in both osteoblast differentiation and vascular disease, we investigated its regulatory function in CVC differentiation. In this report, we show that the cAMP pathway stimulates the osteoblast-like differentiation of CVC by inducing morphological change, inhibiting proliferation, enhancing osteoblastic markers (alkaline phosphatase, matrix GLA protein, and type I procollagen), and increasing matrix calcium incorporation yet inhibiting CVC condensation resulting in a diffuse pattern of mineralization.

Type I procollagen polyclonal antibody for Western analysis was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). CVC, the clonal subpopulation of primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells, were identified as described previously (6Watson K. Bostrom K. Ravindranath R. Lam T. Norton B. Demer L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). CVC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT) and supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml), all from Irvine Scientific, CA. The medium was changed every 3–4 days with agents, if applicable. From 5–7 days before von Kossa staining, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N.

CVC seeded in 24-well plates were treated at 70–90% confluence for 24 h with dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm), forskolin (25 μm), or control media (sterile water for db-cAMP and 0.1% Me2SO for forskolin). [3H]Thymidine was added at 1 mCi/ml for an additional 24 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as described previously (26Noda M. Vogel R.L. Hasson D.M. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The data were shown as the means ± S.D. of 6 wells. Cells grown in duplicate 100-mm dishes were treated with forskolin (25 μm) for 3 days. Cells were washed twice and scraped in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.7 mg/liter pepstatin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. The cell debris was pelleted, and the total protein concentration was measured using the Pierce assay. Protein (5 μg) was isolated on 8% Tris-glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4 °C. The blots were probed with rabbit anti-bovine collagen type I polyclonal antibody at 1:100 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. The 1 ° antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). CVC seeded in 24-well plates were treated with vehicle alone or cAMP agonists at subconfluence for 3 days, and alkaline phosphatase assay was performed as described previously (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase activity was normalized to total protein concentration determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay. The data were from a representative of two experiments shown as the means ± S.D. of quadruplicate wells. For spontaneous CVC differentiation, CVC were grown in duplicate 60-mm dishes for the indicated time, and total RNA was isolated (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). During the nodule forming stage, cells were suspended in 1× trypsin-EDTA, and nodules were separated by filtration. The nodules were washed twice, and total RNA from both nodules and flow-through monolayer cells were extracted. For the cAMP treatments, CVC were grown in duplicate 60-mm dishes and vehicle alone, dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm), or forskolin (25 μm) were added at subconfluent stage. After 3 days of culture, total RNA was isolated. Total RNA (10 μg) in duplicate samples were run on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes, which were cross-linked with UV light. The membranes were hybridized overnight at 58 °C with 32P-labeled human osteopontin cDNA probe prepared according to protocols by Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). The membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 20 min with 2× SSC with 0.2% SDS and twice at 58 °C for 20 min with 1× SSC with 0.2% SDS before autoradiography. After stripping with 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS, the same membranes were probed with human type I collagen using the same conditions or with human 28 S rRNA using 55 °C hybridization overnight and washing with 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature once and 0.5× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min twice at 55 °C. The RNA isolated as described above (3 μg) was reverse-transcribed in 50 μl of reaction buffer (Stratagene) containing 0.5 mm of each dNTP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 50–80 units RNase Block (Stratagene), 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) and 750 ng of oligo(dT) (random hexamer; Boehringer-Mannheim) for 90 min at 37 °C. PCR (GeneAmp PCR system 2400, Perkin-Elmer) using primers specific for each gene (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, matrix GLA protein, Cbfa-1, and GAPDH) were carried out in a volume of 10 μl with 1×Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 190 μm of dNTP, 28 ng of each primer, 0.45 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 0.18 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and 1.0 μl of template (from above 50 μl RT reaction). Thermal cycling was carried out for 21 cycles (GAPDH) or 30 cycles (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, MGP, and Cbfa-1) at 62 °C annealing temperature for alkaline phosphatase, MGP, Cbfa-1, and GAPDH and 72 °C for osteocalcin. Amplified fragments were isolated on polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide to bis-acrylamide), and the autoradiographs were scanned with AGFA ARCUS II scanner and semi-quantitated with NIH Image software, version 1.49, public domain program. 2Internet address:http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. 45Ca incorporation and von Kossa staining to detect mineralization was performed as described previously (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The data for 45Ca incorporation were from a representative of two experiments shown as the means ± S.D. of 6 wells. During spontaneous differentiation, CVC displayed distinct morphological transitions. In post-confluent cultures (5–7 days after plating), cells aggregated into ridge-like structures closely resembling embryonic condensations (arrows, Fig. 1 B). From 9–11 days after plating, these condensations formed multicellular nodules (arrow, Fig. 1 C), which became increasingly darkened after 14–16 days in culture due to mineralization, identified by strongly positive von Kossa staining (arrow, Fig. 1 D). Previously we reported that CVC exhibit several osteoblastic differentiation markers (6Watson K. Bostrom K. Ravindranath R. Lam T. Norton B. Demer L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the time course of their expression during the stages described above (Fig. 1, A–D). Total RNA was isolated from duplicate dishes at stages of subconfluence (1 day after plating), confluence (3 days after plating), condensation (6 days after plating), nodules (10 days after plating), and calcification (14 days after plating). Type I procollagen, osteopontin, and 28 S rRNA (used as an internal control) expression were determined by Northern analyses. Alkaline phosphatase, matrix GLA protein, osteocalcin, Cbfa-1, and GAPDH (an internal control) were determined by RT-PCR with specific primers designed for each gene (Fig. 2 A). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, amplification cycles were chosen to be within the linear range (data not shown). Autoradiographs shown in Fig. 2 A were scanned, and data were plotted as the percentage of maximum expression over the number of days in culture that correspond to the stages shown in Fig. 1(A–D) and subconfluence (1 day post-plating; not shown). Coll I, alkaline phosphatase, matrix GLA protein, and osteocalcin expression increased as CVC underwent distinct morphological transitions, whereas osteopontin expression declined progressively (Fig. 2, A and B). Cbfa-1 was expressed constitutively during CVC differentiation (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether the expression of these differentiation markers during the later stages of CVC was limited to the cells within the nodules and not in the intervening monolayer cells, nodules were separated from the intervening cells by suspension and filtration, and total RNA from both sets were extracted. Results showed that all differentiation markers except MGP were expressed at similar levels in both the monolayer and the cells forming nodules (Table I). MGP was expressed at 3-fold higher levels in the nodules than in the monolayer cells.Table IDistribution of osteoblastic differentiation markers between nodules versus intervening monolayer cellsOsteoblastic differentiation markersExpression localized to nodules%Coll I54Alkaline phosphatase51Matrix GLA protein75Osteopontin58Osteocalcin52Cbfa-149 Open table in a new tab Short term treatment of CVC with 1 mmdb-cAMP in a single administration at 70–90% confluence and incubated for 2 days induced a morphological change from an elongated to a “cuboidal” shape (Fig. 1, E versus A, control), which is an indication of preosteoblast differentiation into osteoblastic cells (27Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 28Nefussi J.R. Pouchelet M. Collin P. Sautier J.M. Develay G. Forest N. Bone. 1989; 10: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Aubin J.E. Liu F. Malaval L. Gupta A.K. Bone. 1995; 17: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The same morphological change was observed when CVC were treated with forskolin (25 μm), isobutylmethylxanthine (200 μm), or cholera toxin (500 ng/ml) (data not shown). Prolonged treatment of CVC with db-cAMP has marked effects on later differentiation stages of CVC, including condensation, nodule formation, and mineralization. When CVC were treated with 1 mm db-cAMP (at 70–90% confluence and fed every 3–4 days with fresh medium containing 1 mm db-cAMP), there was inhibition of condensation (Fig. 1: control (B)versus treated cells (F) after 6 days in culture) and subsequent nodule formation (control (C)versus treated cells (G) after 10 days in culture). However, von Kossa staining for mineralization showed that calcification occurred in both treated and control cells after 15 days in culture (control (D) versus treated cells (H). In control cells, calcification was confined within nodules, whereas in treated cells, calcification was diffuse throughout the monolayer with some patches of increased density, despite the absence of nodules. Cells were treated with 1 mmdb-cAMP or 25 μm forskolin at 70–90% confluency and incubated for 2 days. [3H]Thymidine was added to the medium during the last 24 h, and cellular proliferation was assessed (prior to condensation and nodule formation). The results showed that increased cAMP inhibited CVC proliferation (Fig. 3). Because it has been shown in osteoblasts that the decline of proliferation is functionally coupled to the onset of differentiation (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), we investigated whether cAMP stimulation also initiated expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers. Alkaline phosphatase activity, a well recognized early marker of osteoblastic differentiation (30Dunlop L.T. Hall B.K. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 357-371PubMed Google Scholar), increased during spontaneous CVC differentiation (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first measured its activity in response to cAMP stimulation. CVC at 70–90% confluence were treated with various concentrations of db-cAMP or forskolin and incubated for 3 days. Alkaline phosphatase activity was dose-dependently induced (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). In addition, cholera toxin (500 ng/ml) and isobutylmethylxanthine (200 μm), other agents known to increase intracellular cAMP levels, also had similar effects on alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 4 C). Because the results showed that cAMP induced early makers of osteoblast-like differentiation in CVC, we next determined its effects on later markers described above. Duplicate dishes of CVC were treated at 70–90% confluence with 1 mm db-cAMP or 25 μm forskolin and incubated for 3 days, and total RNA was analyzed by Northern analysis or RT-PCR as described above. Treatment with either agent caused increased gene expression of alkaline phosphatase (11- and 8-fold, respectively) and matrix GLA protein (4- and 2-fold, respectively) but a decrease in osteopontin expression (Fig. 5 A). cAMP had no effect on the expression of osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 (data not shown). Type I collagen production was enhanced 2-fold as shown by Western analysis when cAMP was stimulated by 25 μmforskolin (Fig. 5 B). To quantify the amount of mineralization in both control and treated cells, radiolabeled calcium incorporation was measured. CVC were treated with 1 mm db-cAMP at 70–90% confluence and fed every 3–4 days with fresh medium containing 1 mm db-cAMP or control media. After 7 days in culture, 4 mm CaCl2 and 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate were added to the media to enhance mineralization. After an additional 6–7 days in culture, cells were washed twice and changed to media containing 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, labeled calcium (45CaCl2), and either 1 mm db-cAMP or control medium and incubated for an additional 48 h. In validation studies, incorporated labeled calcium has been shown to represent primarily matrix-bound calcium, because similar results were obtained in cultures permeabilized with Triton X-100, which removes ionic calcium (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The results showed that calcium incorporation was enhanced approximately 4-fold with db-cAMP treatment (Fig. 6). Because osteoblastic differentiation has been considered functionally coupled to inhibition of proliferation, we assessed whether inhibition of CVC proliferation is sufficient to promote osteoblast-like differentiation. CVC were treated with pertussis toxin, which has been shown to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation (at 0.001–100 ng/ml) without affecting cell viability and the level of intracellular cAMP (31Zhang L.M. Newman W.H. Castresana M.R. Hildebrandt J.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The results showed that pertussis toxin inhibited CVC proliferation (87% at 20 ng/ml; 89% at 100 ng/ml) without inducing cuboidal morphology or significantly increasing alkaline phosphatase activity (2-fold increase at both concentrations of pertussis toxin), suggesting that the inhibition of proliferation is not sufficient to promote osteoblast-like differentiation of CVC. To further determine whether blocking the cAMP pathway decreases osteoblast-like differentiation, CVC were treated at 70–90% confluence with 10 μm KT5720, previously used as a protein kinase A-specific inhibitor (32Bernabeu R. Bevilaqua L. Ardenghi P. Bromberg E. Schmitz P. Bianchin M. Izquierdo I. Medina J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7041-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 33Revan S. Montesinos M.C. Naime D. Landau S. Cronstein B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17114-17118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Results showed that the increase in alkaline phosphatase activity during spontaneous CVC differentiation was blocked (>90% inhibition; data not shown). In addition, Ca45 incorporation assay showed that mineralization was also inhibited (>80% inhibition; data not shown), suggesting that the cAMP pathway has a direct effect on osteoblast-like differentiation of CVC independent of its effect on proliferation. To assess whether cAMP induces osteoblast-like differentiation in non-CVC, a subpopulation of primary smooth muscle cells that do not form nodules, two clones were treated with forskolin. The results showed that proliferation was inhibited approximately 70% without inducing a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity: at 3 days, the same dose of forskolin that caused a 20-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in CVC caused only a 2–3-fold increase in non-CVC (data not shown). Even with 5 days of forskolin treatment, the effect on alkaline phosphatase activity in non-CVC did not increase further relative to control (data not shown). These results support a direct role of the cAMP pathway in osteoblast-like differentiation of CVC. These findings indicate that short term cAMP treatment (≤3 days) triggered the onset of osteoblast-like differentiation of CVC in several aspects: 1) induction of a morphological change, which is characteristic of preosteoblasts differentiating into osteoblasts (27Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 28Nefussi J.R. Pouchelet M. Collin P. Sautier J.M. Develay G. Forest N. Bone. 1989; 10: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Aubin J.E. Liu F. Malaval L. Gupta A.K. Bone. 1995; 17: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar); 2) inhibition of CVC proliferation, which is considered a requirement for the initiation of differentiation (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar); 3) acceleration of the induction of osteoblastic differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase, type I procollagen, and matrix GLA protein, which were also found to increase during spontaneous CVC differentiation; and 4) acceleration of the decline in osteopontin expression, which also occurs in spontaneous CVC differentiation. The results further showed that long term cAMP treatment altered the mineralization pattern in CVC. During spontaneous differentiation, CVC aggregate to form condensations that mature into mineralized nodules. Prolonged treatment of CVC with db-cAMP inhibited condensation and subsequent nodule formation. Therefore, in cAMP-treated cells, enhanced production of alkaline phosphatase, extracellular matrix components, and increased matrix calcium incorporation were no longer confined to the nodules, as in the case with control cells, resulting in a diffuse pattern of mineralization throughout the monolayer. This diffuse pattern was not perfectly homogeneous, having some patchy areas of increased density, despite absence of nodules. This pattern has intriguing similarities to in vitro mineralization of bone cell lines (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which cAMP blocks condensation is not known but may be related to elimination of a chemotactic gradient (34Vicker M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 659-667PubMed Google Scholar) and/or altered expression of adhesion molecules such as hyaluronan, clusterin, or N-CAM, which have been suggested to regulate aggregation (35Hall B.K. Miyake T. Anat. Embryol. 1992; 186: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 36Silkensen J.R. Skubitz K.M. Skubitz A.P. Chmielewski D.H. Manivel J.C. Dvergsten J.A. Rosenberg M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2646-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The inhibition of condensation by cAMP may also occur through effects on the proliferation signal that precedes aggregation in many epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and probably provides the critical density or quorum of cells required for condensation (35Hall B.K. Miyake T. Anat. Embryol. 1992; 186: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed the similarities between CVC and osteoblastic cells. Our present data reveal that the time course of expression of osteoblastic markers in CVC differs from that previously shown for bone cells by Stein, Lian, and co-workers (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The most evident differences are in osteopontin and collagen I expression. In CVC, osteopontin expression declines progressively, whereas in osteoblastic cultures, its expression increases progressively, peaking during the late stage (matrix maturation stage) of osteoblast-like differentiation. In contrast, in CVC, type I procollagen expression increases progressively peaking during the late stage, but in osteoblastic cultures, its expression declines progressively during differentiation (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that reciprocal responses of vascular and bone cells to lipid exposure may have a role in the simultaneous occurrence of vascular calcification and osteoporosis in humans (7Parhami F. Morrow A.D. Balucan J. Leitinger N. Watson A.D Tintut Y. Berliner J.A. Demer L.L. J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1997; 17: 680-687Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and in essential fatty acid-deficient mice (37Kruger M.C. Horrobin D.F. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 131-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The role of some of the osteoblastic differentiation markers in mineralization is still unclear. Much evidence points to control of formation and maturation of extracellular matrix, providing an environment that facilitates mineral deposition (22Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Montecino M. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 593-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 38Robey P.G. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the expression of one of these proteins, osteopontin, decreases with spontaneous CVC differentiation and in response to cAMP stimulation, whereas it increases in atherosclerotic calcification (39Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar,40Giachelli C.M. Bae N. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The increased expression of osteopontin in human atherosclerotic plaques, however, is largely attributable to other cell types, particularly the macrophage-derived foam cells (39Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 41O'Brien E.R. Garvin M.R. Stewart D.K. Hinohara T. Simpson J.B. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1648-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which synthesize osteopontin as an early inflammatory response to tissue injury (42Giachelli C.M. Liaw L. Murry C.E. Schwartz S.M. Almeida M Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and use osteopontin also as an opsonin for adhesion to and phagocytosis of calcified particulate matter (43McKee M.D. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In areas of plaque composed of predominantly smooth muscle cells, osteopontin expression was not detected (39Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Another osteoblastic marker, matrix GLA protein, increases during CVC differentiation and in response to cAMP stimulation. This is consistent with previous reports of increased MGP expression predominantly by vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions (39Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These results may initially appear paradoxical in light of the recent report from Luo and colleagues demonstrating extensive vascular calcification and ossification in MGP null mouse (44Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 385: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). One might expect a decrease in MGP in association with in vitro vascular calcification. However, there are other examples such as leukocytosis, when a stimulus induces its own inhibitory factor. That is, absence of white cells in immunodeficient mice allows extensive infection; yet, in human infection, white cells are increased rather than absent. Likewise, absence of MGP in the knock-out mice allows extensive vascular calcification; yet, in human vascular calcification, MGP expression is increased rather than absent. Thus, MGP may be up-regulated in response to vascular calcification, perhaps to limit its extent. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that cAMP modulatesin vitro vascular calcification. The findings in atherosclerotic calcification are consistent with the findings in CVC, both in spontaneous and cAMP-induced differentiation, supporting the in vivo relevance of this model.

GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are formed by a multiprotein system that appears to exist in all eukaryotic cells. Recently, we have reconstituted a receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system with purified rabbit hsp90 and hsp70 and bacterially expressed human p23 and p60. We have shown that hsp90, p60, and hsp70 form an hsp90·p60·hsp70 complex that converts the GR from a non-steroid binding to a steroid binding form (Dittmar, K. D., and Pratt, W. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 13047–13054). The resulting GR·hsp90 heterocomplex rapidly disassembles unless p23 is present to bind to the ATP-dependent conformation of hsp90 and stabilize its association with the receptor (Dittmar, K. D., Demady, D. R., Stancato, L. F., Krishna, P., and Pratt, W. B. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21213–21220). In the current work, we show that the purified rabbit hsp70 utilized in prior studies is contaminated with a small amount of the rabbit DnaJ homolog hsp40. Elimination of the hsp40 from the purified GR·hsp90 assembly system reduces assembly activity, and the activity is restored by addition of the purified yeast DnaJ homolog YDJ-1. hsp40 is a component of the hsp90·p60·hsp70 foldosome complex isolated from reticulocyte lysate with antibody against p60. Under conditions that promote binding of p23 to hsp90 (elevated temperature, ATP, Nonidet P-40, molybdate), a five-membered (p23·hsp90·p60·hsp70·hsp40) complex of chaperone proteins is formed in reticulocyte lysate or from purified proteins. The hsp40-free, purified assembly system has a modest level of assembly activity that is maximally potentiated by YDJ-1 when it is present at about one-twentieth the concentration of hsp70. Although hsp40 is not in the final GR·hsp90 heterocomplex isolated from L cell cytosol, it is in the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembled in reticulocyte lysate.

We have also developed a minimal heterocomplex assembly system in which incubation of a GR immune pellet with a mixture containing purified rabbit hsp90 and hsp70, purified human p23, and bacterial lysate containing human p60 yields GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and restoration of the steroid binding conformation of the HBD (13Dittmar K.D.

Rimerman R.A. Honoré B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that p60 binds to hsp70 via an N-terminal TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) region and to hsp90 via a central TPR region. Mixture of the three proteins results in spontaneous formation of an hsp90·p60·hsp70 complex that can be adsorbed with an anti-p60 antibody, and the resulting immune complex converts the GR HBD to a steroid binding state in an ATP-dependent and K+-dependent manner (18Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although hsp90, hsp70, and p60 are sufficient to alter the folding state of the GR HBD to produce a steroid binding site, the GR·hsp90 complexes that are formed rapidly disassemble unless p23 is present to stabilize them (19Dittmar K.D.

This ATP-dependent conformation of hsp90 appears to be required for the GR HBD to have a steroid binding site, and binding of p23 to that state of GR-bound hsp90 stabilizes the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex to disassembly and loss of the binding site (19Dittmar K.D.

Mammalian homologs of the bacterial DnaJ protein are often contaminants of purified hsp70 preparations, and DnaJ-like proteins are possible components of the reconstituted assembly system. In Escherichia coli, DnaJ interacts with DnaK, the bacterial hsp70 homolog, to stimulate its ATPase activity (22Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopolous C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The resulting transition of DnaK to the ADP-bound state stabilizes the interaction of DnaK with protein substrates (23Langer T.

Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and we use the term hsp40 here to refer to mammalian members of the DnaJ-like protein family. To date, hsp40 has not been identified either in native receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes recovered from mammalian cells or in heterocomplexes assembled in reticulocyte lysate. However, the yeast DnaJ homolog YDJ-1 has been recovered in GR·hsp90 (26Chang H.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and v-Src·hsp90 heterocomplexes (27Dey B. Caplan A.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) isolated from yeast lysates. Both genetic and biochemical observations suggest that hsp40 may play a role in heterocomplex assembly by the hsp90-based chaperone system. Studies in yeast involving the genetic manipulation of chaperone activity have shown that hsp90 plays a critical role in determining the ligand responsiveness of steroid and dioxin receptors (Refs. 28Picard D.

Deletion of STI1, the yeast homolog of the p60 component of the hsp90-based chaperone system, reduces the in vivo activity of both the GR and v-Src (26Chang H.J. Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as mutations in the gene for YDJ-1 also affect both steroid receptor and v-Src function in yeast (27Dey B. Caplan A.J. Boschelli F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Kimura Y. Yahara I. Lindquist S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it is possible that hsp40 is a component of the hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system. In biochemical studies, reticulocyte lysate has been utilized to promote chaperone-mediated refolding of denatured proteins. For example, Schumacher et al. (37Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) examined ATP-dependent refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase and found that reactivation of the enzyme activity correlated with the concentration of both hsp70 and hsp90. Additionally, both hsp70 and hsp90 immune pellets, as well as a mixture of purified hsp90 and hsp70, yielded partial luciferase reactivation (37Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found that the purified preparations of hsp70 and hsp90 were contaminated with low levels of hsp40, and when hsp70 and hsp90 that were free of hsp40 were used to facilitate luciferase activation, the system had to be supplemented with a DnaJ-like protein (YDJ-1) to obtain renaturation activity (38Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As DnaJ-like proteins have been found to operate in conjunction with eukaryotic hsp70s in several in vitro refolding systems (e.g. Refs. 39Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 40Levy E.J. McCarty J. Bukau B. Chirico W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to ask whether they play a role in GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly by the minimal (hsp90, hsp70, p60, and p23) assembly system. In this work, we use a new commercial antibody against hsp40 to detect contamination of our purified rabbit hsp70 and hsp90 preparations with small amounts of hsp40. We also find that hsp40 is a component of the hsp90·p60·hsp70 foldosome complex isolated from reticulocyte lysate with antibody against p60. Under conditions that promote binding of p23 to hsp90 (elevated temperature, ATP, Nonidet P-40, and molybdate) a five-protein p23·hsp90·p60·hsp70·hsp40 heterocomplex is formed in reticulocyte lysate or from purified proteins. Elimination of rabbit hsp40 reduces the GR·hsp90 assembly activity of the purified system, and activity is restored by addition of the purified yeast homolog YDJ-1. We show that GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes assembled in reticulocyte lysate contain hsp40, but hsp40 is not a component of native GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes isolated from L cell cytosol. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (42.8 Ci/mmol) and125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Protein A-Sepharose and goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Sigma. The BuGR2 monoclonal IgG antibody against the GR was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The AC88 monoclonal IgG against hsp90, the anti-hsp40 rabbit polyclonal antibody, the N27F3-4 anti-72/73-kDa hsp monoclonal IgG (anti-hsp70), and purified DnaJ fromE. coli were from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The JJ3 monoclonal IgG against p23, E. coliexpressing human p23, and purified YDJ-1 were gifts from Dr. David Toft (The Mayo Clinic). The DS14F5 monoclonal IgG against p60 and E. coli expressing p60 were kindly provided by Dr. David Smith (University of Nebraska Medical School). Actigel-ALD (activated aldehyde agarose) affinity support for protein immobilization was from Sterogene Biochemicals (San Gabriel, CA). Hybridoma cells producing FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). L929 mouse fibroblasts (L cells) were grown in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum. Cells were harvested by scraping into Earle's balanced saline, suspended in 1.5 volumes of HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. Homogenates were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant is referred to as “cytosol.” Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 100-μl aliquots of L cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 8 μl of Actigel-ALD precoupled to 80 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 300 μl of TEG (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate or with other additions as noted, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5m NaCl followed by one wash with 1 ml of TEG and a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). For immunoadsorption of p60, 400-μl aliquots of reticulocyte lysate or various mixtures of purified proteins as noted were immunoadsorbed to 8 μl of protein A-agarose prebound with DS14F5 antibody against p60 (5%) or nonimmune mouse IgG (5%). The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and immunopellets were washed twice with 1 ml of Hepes buffer. FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of hsp90 were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or with combinations of proteins (12 μg of purified hsp90, 20 μg of purified hsp70, 3 μl of lysate from bacteria expressing p60, 4 μg of purified p23, 1.0 μg of purified YDJ-1, 1.0 μg of purified HDJ-1, or 0.5 μg of purified HDJ-2) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mmHepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35). In some experiments p23 was substituted with 20 mmsodium molybdate, which has the same effect on GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (19Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For reconstitution of GR by the immunoadsorbed p60 heterocomplex, stripped receptors were suspended in 50 μl of an assay mix consisting of HKD buffer and then the whole GR immunopellet suspension was pipetted onto the DS14F5 immunopellet containing the immunoadsorbed p60 and the associated protein complex. Dithiothreitol (1 μl) was added to each incubation to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) were added to all assays to yield a final assay volume of 56 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 5 min for soluble protein conditions or every minute for the immunoadsorbed p60 condition. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and, in some experiments, receptor-associated proteins. To conserve the purified components of the reconstitution system, each experimental condition represents a single sample. The experimental observations have been replicated, and in most cases, the key observation from an experiment appears again as one of the conditions presented in another panel in the same figure or in one of the subsequent figures. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight in 100 μl of TEGM buffer plus 4 mm dithiothreitol and 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed twice with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry as described previously. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 100 μl of cytosol. As noted previously (11Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100 μl of L cell cytosol contains 60,000 cpm of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide binding capacity, and we immunoadsorb about 50% of the GR. Thus ∼30,000 cpm represents 100% of receptors reactivated to the steroid binding form. For assay of GR and associated proteins or p60 and associated proteins, immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12% for resolving p23). Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 2 μg/ml BuGR monoclonal antibody for the GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3-4 for hsp70, 0.1% DS14F5 anti-p60 mouse ascites for p60, 0.5% anti-hsp40 for hsp40, or 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counterantibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. It is important to note that hsp40 is very sticky and that immunoadsorption of p60 from reticulocyte lysate or from a mixture of purified proteins yields substantial amounts of hsp40 in nonimmune as well as immune pellets. Thus, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 was added to lysates and protein solutions during immunoadsorption, and the resulting protein A pellets were washed once with 1 ml of detergent-containing (0.02% Nonidet P-40) buffer prior to two washes with detergent-free buffer. This markedly reduces or eliminates nonspecific hsp40 and YDJ-1 binding. The bacterial expression of human p23 and its purification have been described (15Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, p23 is soluble in bacterial lysates, and its abundance and high affinity for DEAE-cellulose allowed purification to 90% purity by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The protein was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 80% of saturation. It was dissolved and dialyzed into 10 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, and stored at −70 °C. hsp70 and hsp90 were routinely purified from rabbit brain cytosol as described previously (12Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ml of brain cytosol were chromatographed on a DE52 column exactly as described by Dittmaret al. (13Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fractions containing hsp70 were chromatographed on an ATP-agarose column and eluted with ATP followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and DE52 fractions containing hsp90 were chromatographed on hydroxylapatite followed by chromatography over ATP-agarose exactly as described by Hutchison et al. (12Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare hsp40-free hsp70, the fractions eluting prior to hsp90 from the DE52 column (fraction A of Dittmar et al. (13Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) were chromatographed on hydroxylapatite before chromatography over ATP-agarose. To prepare hsp40-free hsp90, the routine three-step (DE52, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose) procedure was followed, but at each step a sample from every fraction in the hsp90-containing region of the DE52 and hydroxylapatite eluates was immunoblotted for both hsp90 and hsp40. With very conservative pooling of peak hsp90 fractions containing the least hsp40, hsp40-free hsp90 is obtained. This procedure increases the purification time by ∼50%, and we have noted that the activity of hsp90 in the purified reconstitution system declines as the time of purification is extended. Thus, it is important to purify hsp90 in as few days as possible. In that we do not see cleavage products by immunoblot, it is unlikely that the inactivation is due to proteolysis. The purified hsp70 and hsp90 were dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. The bacterial expression and purification of YDJ-1 (42Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been described (38Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The pooled YDJ-1 fractions (identified by gel electophoresis) were concentrated by vacuum dialysis against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. The final preparation is about 80% pure. The bacterial expression of p60 has been described previously (4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control E. coli and bacteria expressing p60 were grown to an A600 of 0.6, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 25 °C, and harvested. Bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots were flash frozen and stored at −70 °C. In the experiment of Fig. 1 A, GR immune pellets that were stripped free of receptor-associated proteins with salt were incubated with the purified assembly system (hsp90, hsp70, p60, and p23) and various concentrations of the yeast DnaJ-like protein YDJ-1. Addition of the purified YDJ-1 produces a small increase in the level of steroid binding activity that is generated by the purified assembly system (Fig. 1 A). The increase in steroid binding activity is accompanied"

We previously reported that isolated boar sperm membrane vesicles possess high affinity binding sites for partially purified pZPB, but not pZPC. Interestingly, co-incubation experiments also implicated pZPB-pZPC complexes as potential ligands. We now report that when depleted of a minor pZPC contaminant by size exclusion chromatography, pZPB lacks independent binding activity. In solid phase binding assays employing immobilized boar sperm membranes, pZPB failed to compete with biotin-(pZPB+pZPC) probe, and biotin-labeled pZPB yielded negligible binding. However, when co-incubated with pZPC prior to the binding assays, pZPB acted as a potent competitor, and biotin-labeled pZPB exhibited high affinity, saturable binding. Binding activity was attributed to pZPB-pZPC heterocomplexes, which were detected in co-incubation mixtures by size exclusion chromatography and Western blot analysis. In the pig, therefore, sperm membranes possess a zona-binding protein with high affinity sites for pZPB-pZPC heterocomplexes, but not free glycoprotein subunits. Consequently, associative interactions between zona molecules can contribute toward both the assembly of the zona matrix and generation of ligands important for sperm-zona interactions.

The zona pellucida is a morphologically discrete, extracellular matrix which envelops and protects the oocyte and preimplantation embryo. This egg investment also actively participates in the fertilization process. The zona pellucida provides docking sites for species-specific sperm attachment and induces bound sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction, the preparatory event for zona penetration and eventual sperm-egg fusion. This intimate association of male and female gametes is mediated in part by sperm-adhesive glycoproteins within the zona matrix and complimentary zona-binding proteins on the sperm surface. Interestingly, although multiple gamete adhesion molecules have been characterized at the molecular level (1Baba T. Kashiwabara S. Watanabe K. Itoh H. Michikawa Y. Kimura K. Takada M. Fukamizu A.

Although intractable to further purification as fully glycosylated entities, pZPB and pZPC elute as separate peaks during reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethane sulfonic acid. when pretreated with endo-β-galactosidase (17Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Subramanian M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 564-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pZPC glycoprotein (Mr 41,000 following endo-β-galactosidase digestion) elutes first and appears homogeneous on SDS gels. The pZPB glycoprotein (Mr 44,000 following endo-β-galactosidase digestion) follows and routinely contains small amounts (5–10%) of pZPC contaminant. Purified pZPB and pZPC differ markedly in apparent biological activity. When tested in gamete adhesion assays, pZPB inhibits sperm-zona binding, whereas pZPC is without effect (20Sacco A.G.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, when tested in solid phase binding assays, biotin-labeled pZPB binds to immobilized boar sperm membranes in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner, whereas biotin-pZPC does not (22Yurewicz E.C. Pack B.A. Armant D.R. Sacco A.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In competition assays, pZPB blocks binding of a biotin-pZP(B+C) probe to membranes; pZPC fails to compete but, surprisingly, enhances the apparent affinity of pZPB for its cognate zona-binding protein. Collectively, the data suggest that (i) boar sperm possess a zona-binding protein with a pZPB-binding domain that recognizes both pZPB and putative pZPB-pZPC complexes, and (ii) interaction of pZPB with pZPC enhances pZPB binding affinity. More recently, both pZPB- and pZPC-specific antibodies were unexpectedly found to block binding of biotin-pZPB to boar sperm membranes. 2E. C. Yurewicz, unpublished results. 2E. C. Yurewicz, unpublished results. This paradoxical data prompted us to question whether the pZPB glycoprotein indeed binds independently to membrane-associated zona-binding proteins. Could minor amounts of putative pZPB-pZPC complexes account for the observed binding activity of our previous pZPB preparations? Here we conclusively demonstrate that whereas pZPC and more highly purified pZPB lack independent binding activity, reconstituted pZPB-pZPC heterocomplexes are novel, high affinity ligands for zona-binding molecules present in boar sperm membrane vesicles. Three different pig zona protein preparations were used in this study. Their nomenclature conforms with that adapted by Harris et al. (13Harris J.D. Hibler D.W. Fontenot G.K. Hsu K.T. Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. DNA Sequence. 1994; 4: 361-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). pZP(B+C) was purified from heat-solubilized porcine zonae by gel filtration and hydroxyapatite chromatography and consists of fully glycosylated pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins (17Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Subramanian M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 564-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pZPB and pZPC were isolated from endo-β-galactosidase-digested pZP(B+C) by reverse phase HPLC (17Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Subramanian M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 564-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pZP(B+C), pZPB, and pZPC correspond to preparations designated ZP3, ZP3α, and ZP3β in prior publications from this laboratory. Membrane vesicles were isolated from capacitated boar sperm by nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation and stored at −70 °C as described previously (22Yurewicz E.C. Pack B.A. Armant D.R. Sacco A.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide CELQIAKDERYGS (residues 319–330 of the deduced pZPB precursor protein with an added N-terminal cysteine) was described previously (24Hall L.-L.H. Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Moghissi K.S. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Affinity purification on a matrix consisting of the synthetic peptide coupled to AminoLink resin (Pierce) yielded pZPB-specific, site-directed antibodies (anti-pZPB319–330). For pZPC-specific immunodetection, we used an ascites fluid containing a previously described (25Gupta S.K. Bagavant H. Chadha K. Gupta M. Yurewicz E.C. Sacco A.G. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1993; 30: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) mouse monoclonal antibody, MA-451, which recognizes an internal pZPC epitope (EEKLVF, residues 166–171 of cDNA-derived pZPC precursor protein) (26Afzalpurkar A. Gupta S.K. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1997; 38: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham. HPLC separations were performed on a Dionex instrument equipped with a TSK G3000SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm, TosoHaas). The flow of high-salt PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 300 mm NaCl) was maintained at 0.5 ml/min at ambient temperature. For preparative isolations, lyophilized proteins were reconstituted in high-salt PBS and centrifuged through Spin-X filter units (0.45-μm cellulose acetate, Costar) prior to injection. Individual peaks were collected manually, pooled from multiple runs, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon-10, Amicon) to a final protein concentration of >500 μg/ml, and stored at −20 °C. The TSK G3000SWXL column was calibrated daily using blue dextran 2000 and dinitrophenyl-glycine as void volume (Vo) and total volume (Vt) markers, respectively. The elution position (Ve) of individual peaks was used to calculate Kav using the equation, Kav = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo). MALDI-MS of zona proteins was performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite instrument equipped with a nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm with a pulse duration of 2 ns. The instrument was operated at an accelerating voltage of 30 KV in the linear continuous extraction mode. Sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was used as the MALDI matrix and dissolved in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (50:49.9:0.1, v/v/v) to make a solution of 10 mg/ml. Proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm ammonium acetate and lyophilized to dryness prior to analysis. To prepare the target, 1 μl of the protein sample dissolved in water was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution on the sample plate cell and air-dried. Zona proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis on nonreducing 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Novex). After treatment with Blocker™BLOTTO (Pierce), membranes were incubated with either 0.5 μg/ml anti-pZPB319–330 or MA-451 diluted 1:5000. Bound antibodies were decorated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies diluted 1:5000 and visualized with ECL reagents and Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham). Interactions between purified zona proteins and boar sperm membrane vesicles were investigated using a previously described solid phase binding assay (22Yurewicz E.C. Pack B.A. Armant D.R. Sacco A.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Immulon-2 microtiter wells (Dynatech) were coated with 500 ng of sperm membranes and subsequently blocked with 1% BSA. For competition binding assays, wells were incubated in quadruplicate with 50 μl of 0.2 μg/ml biotin-pZP(B+C) in TBS/T/BSA (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA) in the presence and absence of unlabeled competitor. Competitors were preincubated overnight at 4 °C in high-salt PBS, diluted in TBS/T/BSA to twice their final concentration, and mixed with an equal volume of 0.4 μg/ml biotin-pZP(B+C) at least 30 min prior to transfer to wells. Binding of biotin-labeled probe was measured using strepavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Absorbance values at 405 nm were recorded using a Bio-Tek microplate reader. All data in competition assays were corrected for nonspecific binding as determined in wells incubated with biotin probe in the presence of a 100-fold excess of pZP(B+C). IC50 (mean ± S.E.) values are defined as the concentration of competitor required to inhibit binding of biotin-pZP(B+C) by 50%; for co-incubates, IC50 values represent the concentration of the pZPB component only. Direct binding assays followed a similar protocol, except that biotin-labeled proteins were preincubated overnight at 4 °C at ≥50 μg/ml, either alone or with added test protein, in high-salt PBS and then diluted into replicate tubes, one containing TBS/T/BSA (total binding) and the other TBS/T/BSA plus a 100-fold excess of pZP(B+C) relative to the biotin-labeled ligand (nonspecific binding). Wells were incubated in triplicate. EC50 values (mean ± S.E.) were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of saturation binding data using the one-site binding equation in PRISM software (GraphPad). For biotin labeling, 450 μg of protein was reacted with 30 μg of d-biotinoyl-ε-aminocaproic acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester in 180 μl of 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0. After a 1-h incubation at ambient temperature, the reaction was quenched with ammonium chloride. Biotinylated protein was recovered by HPLC on a TSK G3000SWXL column in high-salt PBS and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Proteins were quantitated using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce) in a microtiter plate format. BSA was used to construct standard curves. Protein concentrations were converted to molarities using molecular masses of 36,670 and 36,308 Da for the core polypeptides of pZPB (cDNA-deduced residues 137–446) and pZPC (cDNA-deduced residues 23–348), respectively; N termini have been experimentally determined (17Yurewicz E.C.

DNA Sequence. 1994; 4: 361-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To produce a preparation depleted of residual pZPC, we subjected pZPB to size exclusion chromatography on a TSK G3000SWXL column in high-salt PBS. Under these conditions, pZPB eluted as a series of incompletely resolved UV peaks (Fig. 1 A). The first peak emerged in the column void volume (exclusion limit >700 kDa) and the final peak eluted between the 43- and 80-kDa molecular mass markers. Five subfractions, designated pZPB1–pZPB5 and containing 15, 17, 21, 21, and 26% of recovered protein, respectively, were collected (Fig. 1 A) and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Macromolecular compositions were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Protein staining revealed the pZPB glycoprotein as a predominantMr 44,000 band (≥95% of total Coomassie Blue staining) in the pZPB preparation used as starting material (Fig. 1 B, lane B) and in each pZPB subfraction obtained by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–5). By comparison, purified pZPC glycoprotein migrates as aMr 41,000 band (Fig. 1 B, lane C). Subfractions pZPB1–pZPB3 also contained a Mr 81,000 band accounting for <5% of total Coomassie Blue staining. Western blots were probed with anti-pZPB319–330 and MA-451 to visualize pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins, respectively. Immunostaining with anti-pZPB319–330 uniformly illuminated the Mr 44,000 pZPB glycoprotein in all five subfractions (Fig. 1 C, top). In contrast, MA-451 produced dramatically different staining intensities of pZPC bands in subfractions pZPB1–pZPB3 versuspZPB4–pZPB5 (Fig. 1 C,bottom). Subfractions pZPB1–pZPB3possessed easily detected Mr 41,000 and 81,000 pZPC bands; the Mr 81,000 band was not visible on reducing gels and presumably represents a disulfide-bonded dimer of pZPC. Importantly, subfractions pZPB4 and pZPB5yielded barely discernible pZPC bands, thus indicating negligible pZPC cross-contamination. To assess relative ligand activity of pZPB subfractions toward boar sperm zona-binding proteins, we constructed competitive binding curves using immobilized membrane vesicles as the source of zona-binding proteins and biotin-pZP(B+C) as labeled probe. Significantly, only those subfractions possessing both pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins demonstrated competitor activity (Fig. 2 A). Subfractions pZPB1–pZPB3 blocked binding of biotin-pZP(B+C) to immobilized membranes with respective IC50 values (n = 2) of 20.7 ± 7.1, 36.0 ± 4.9, and 103 ± 22 nm. In striking contrast, pZPB4 and pZPB5 did not compete (IC50 > 1 μm) with the biotin-pZP(B+C) probe. The ability of pZPB1–pZPB3, but not pZPB4 or pZPB5, to displace biotin-pZP(B+C) implied that competitor activity depends upon the coordinate action of pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins. To test this hypothesis, a fixed quantity of pZPB5 was preincubated (4 °C, overnight) with variable amounts of added pZPC and allowed to compete with biotin-pZP(B+C) in the solid phase binding assay. Whereas pZPC added alone did not block binding of biotin-pZP(B+C) to sperm membranes (Fig. 2 C), co-incubates with pZPC:pZPB5 ratios of 1:5, 1:2, and 1:1 were excellent competitors (Fig. 2 B). Based on the above results, pZPB1–pZPB5 were tested in the solid phase binding assay after overnight preincubation with pZPC (pZPC:pZPB5 ratio = 1:2). In the presence of added pZPC, all five pZPB subfractions produced similar competitive binding curves (Fig. 2 C); IC50 values (n = 2) were 11.4 ± 1.6, 11.4 ± 1.4, 8.2 ± 1.1, 7.1 ± 0.3, and 6.5 ± 0.5 nmfor pZPB1–pZPB5, respectively. Taken together, these results implied the existence of a membrane-associated zona-binding protein with high affinity binding sites for putative pZPB-pZPC complexes, but not individual pZPB or pZPC glycoproteins. Further molecular and functional studies of pZPB-pZPC interactions focused on pZPB5. We used MALDI-MS and size exclusion chromatography to evaluate the oligomeric status of purified pZPB5. The MALDI spectra of pZPB5 (Fig. 3) and pZPB starting material (not shown) were highly similar and indicated masses centered about 43,643 and 43,577 Da for the constituent families of pZPB glycoforms, respectively. However, in contrast to the complex elution profile of pZPB starting material in Fig. 1 A, size exclusion chromatography of pZPB5 on the G3000SWXL column in high-salt PBS yielded a dominant peak at Kav = 0.435 (Fig. 4 A); the molecular size relative to protein standards (Fig. 4 B) wasMr 55,400. As this approximates the molecular mass determined by MALDI-MS, pZPB5 most likely exists as monomers in high-salt PBS. The presence of minor Mr 124,000 and 230,000 peaks atKav = 0.313 and 0.221, respectively, indicated a tendency of the pZPB glycoprotein to self-associate.Figure 4pZPB5 elutes as a monomer during size exclusion chromatography. A, after overnight preincubation at 400 μg/ml in high-salt PBS, an 8-μg aliquot of pZPB5 was injected onto a TSK G3000SWXL HPLC column equilibrated with high-salt PBS mobile phase. The major peak had a Mr 55,400 based on the calibration curve in B. Protein standards in B included, in order of elution, thyroglobulin (669 kDa), glutamate dehydrogenase (330 kDa), human IgG (160 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), transferrin (80 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), horse myoglobin (17 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Size exclusion chromatography provided direct evidence that co-incubated pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins form heterocomplexes. Proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 40 μl of high-salt PBS as follows: (i), pZPB5, 16 μg; (ii), pZPB5, 16 μg + fetuin, 12 μg; (iii), pZPB5, 16 μg + pZPC, 12 μg; (iv), pZPC, 12 μg; and (v), pZPC, 12 μg + fetuin, 16 μg. Fetuin, a glycoprotein with physicochemical characteristics similar to pZPB and pZPC, served as a negative control. Twenty-μl aliquots were injected onto the TSK G3000SWXLHPLC column and 1-min fractions were collected. Elution of pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins was monitored by Western blotting using anti-pZPB319–330 and MA-451, respectively. When preincubated alone (not shown) or with fetuin (Fig. 5 A), the pZPB5glycoprotein eluted as a monomer in fraction 17 (cross-reference, Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the pZPC glycoprotein eluted as multiple peaks (Mr 300,000, Kav = 0.178; Mr 160,000, Kav = 0.274; Mr 68,000, Kav = 0.404) in fractions 14–17 whether preincubated alone (not shown) or in the presence of fetuin (Fig. 5 C); the Mr 160,000 peak (fraction 15) was predominant. Importantly, when pZPB5 and pZPC were co-incubated, the chromatographic behavior of each changed dramatically (Fig. 5,B and D); a major percentage of each glycoprotein now eluted in the void volume (fraction 11). The elution shifts demonstrate that when incubated together, pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins assemble into high mass heterocomplexes. To further test specificity of membrane-associated zona-binding proteins for pZPB-pZPC heterocomplexes and to estimate binding affinities, we performed direct binding experiments using biotin-labeled heterocomplexes generated by co-incubation of either biotin-pZPB5 + pZPC or pZPB5 + biotin-pZPC. In the first set of experiments, a fixed concentration (100 μg/ml) of biotin-pZPB5 was preincubated (overnight, 4 °C) in high-salt PBS with or without variable quantities of pZPC. Co-incubates were diluted to yield 0.2 μg/ml biotin-pZPB5 (5.4 nm) and incubated with immobilized membrane vesicles. Binding of biotin-pZPB5depended strongly upon prior incubation with pZPC. At pZPC:biotin-pZPB5 ratios <0.3:1, binding of biotin-pZPB5 was directly proportional to the concentration of co-incubated pZPC (Fig. 6 A). Binding of pZPC:biotin-pZPB5 co-incubates with ratios >0.3:1 plateaued at a level 30-fold higher than that observed with the biotin-pZPB5 incubated alone sample. Presumably, under these experimental conditions, pZPC co-incubated with biotin-pZPB5 in ratios ≥0.3:1 maximizes recruitment of biotin-pZPB5 into heterocomplexes recognized by membrane-associated zona-binding proteins. Co-incubates with pZPC:biotin-pZPB5 or fetuin:biotin-pZPB5 ratios of 1:1 were used to construct saturation binding curves. As shown in Fig. 6 B, pZPC-(biotin·pZPB5) heterocomplexes exhibited high affinity, saturable binding; the EC50 value (n = 3) equaled 4.3 ± 0.6 nm when calculated on the basis of biotin-pZPB5 concentration. High affinity binding was notably absent following co-incubation of biotin-pZPB5 with fetuin. Biotin-pZPC was unable to bind independently to membrane-associated receptors. As shown in Fig. 6 C, biotin-pZPC preincubated alone lacked ligand activity. pZPB5 added as a co-incubate during the preincubation period promoted binding of biotin-pZPC with a maximal response attained at pZPB5:biotin-pZPC ratios of ≥1.4:1. Consequently, co-incubates with pZPB5:biotin-pZPC ratios of 2:1 were used to construct saturation binding curves (Fig. 6 D). Nonlinear regression analysis of the binding isotherm for pZPB5-(biotin·pZPC) heterocomplexes yielded an EC50 value (n = 4) of 1.7 ± 0.1 nm calculated on the basis of biotin-pZPC concentration. Binding was not detected following co-incubation of biotin-pZPC and fetuin. Using highly purified glycoproteins isolated from the pig oocyte zona pellucida, we demonstrate for the first time that pZPB and pZPC associate to form high mass heteromultimeric complexes. We also provide the first description of a zona binding activity in boar sperm membranes that possesses avid affinity for pZPB-pZPC heterocomplexes but not the free zona glycoprotein subunits. As a consequence, we propose that at least for the porcine system, pZPB-pZPC heteromers are important functional and structural units of this gamete-specific extracellular matrix. Data presented earlier (22Yurewicz E.C. Pack B.A. Armant D.R. Sacco A.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1993; 36: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) suggested that pZPB binds directly to isolated boar sperm membranes and hinted that pZPB can associate with pZPC to form putative pZPB-pZPC complexes with enhanced binding affinity. Our new data obtained with pZPB depleted of residual pZPC contaminant by size exclusion chromatography confirm the heterotypic association of co-incubated pZPB and pZPC glycoproteins but conclusively demonstrate that free pZPB subunits fail to engage membrane-associated zona-binding proteins. Consequently we conclude that pZPB-pZPC complexes, although present in minor amounts, accounted exclusively for the ligand activity observed for earlier pZPB preparations (20Sacco A.G. Yurewicz E.C.

https://openalex.org/W2061348601,"We have determined the relationship between the binding sites for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) in heparan sulfate (HS) prepared from a panel of mammary cell lines and the ability of the HS to activate aFGF and bFGF in DNA synthesis assays. The ka of the HS for aFGF fell into three groups, whereas the kd (0.0015–0.016 s−1) and the Kd (0.4–8.6 μm) formed a continuum. bFGF possessed a high affinity binding site (Kd 22–30 nm) with a fastka (320,000–550,000 m−1s−1), termed “fast/high,” and a lower affinity site (Kd 47–320 nm) with a slowerka (35,000–150,000 m−1s−1), termed “slow/low.” Most of the species of HS possessed the latter binding site, which was able to activate bFGF in HS-deficient fibroblasts. However, the HS from the culture medium of the mammary fibroblasts and the myoepithelial-like cells possessed both a fast/high and a slow/low binding site and could not activate bFGF, although it could potentiate the growth-stimulatory activity of aFGF. Treatment of the HS possessing two binding sites for bFGF with heparitinase 1 released oligosaccharides that were able to restore the activity of bFGF in HS-deficient fibroblasts. We have determined the relationship between the binding sites for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and basic FGF (bFGF) in heparan sulfate (HS) prepared from a panel of mammary cell lines and the ability of the HS to activate aFGF and bFGF in DNA synthesis assays.

The two archetypal fibroblast growth factors (FGF), 1The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; aFGF (FGF-1), acidic FGF; bFGF (FGF-2), basic FGF; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; HGF/SF, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor; HS, heparan sulfate; Huma, human mammary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, PBS with Tween 20; Rama, rat mammary; SDM, step-down medium. acidic FGF (aFGF; FGF-1) and basic FGF (bFGF; FGF-2), are classic examples of heparan sulfate (HS)-binding growth factors (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 353-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The FGFs thus possess two distinct types of receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) and HS. The HS receptors for aFGF and bFGF have several functions. First, the interaction between these FGFs and HS stabilizes the protein with respect to spontaneous and experimentally induced denaturation as well as proteolysis (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant for aFGF, which in the absence of HS is unstable at normal physiological ionic strength, pH, and temperature. Second, the sequestration of FGFs on extracellular HS may prevent the diffusion of the growth factor within a tissue compartment or between tissue compartments, as well as allowing a local store of the growth factor to act on a restricted number of cells (3Rudland P.S.

Thus, these growth factors must interact with a dual receptor system consisting of FGFRs and HS receptors, if they are to stimulate cell division or cell migration (5Walker A. Turnbull J.E.

Although the exact mechanism of the dual receptor system is a matter of debate, the requirement for both receptors is firmly established (2Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 353-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). aFGF and bFGF have been implicated in regulating the development of the mammary gland of rodents and humans (Refs. 8Anandappa S.Y.

In resting ducts, bFGF is associated with the basement membrane and with the myoepithelial cell, both of which possess a large, spare capacity of HS binding sites for bFGF (11Rudland P.S. Platt-Higgins A.M. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the radius of action of the growth factor in these structures is limited by its HS receptor. However, in terminal end buds, a major site of cell proliferation between birth and puberty (12Joshi K. Smith J.A. Perusinghe N. Monaghan P. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar, 13Joshi K. Ellis J.T.B. Hughes C.M. Monaghan P. Neville A.M. Lab. Invest. 1986; 54: 52-61PubMed Google Scholar), bFGF is equally distributed between the growing cells in these structures and the basement membrane, and the HS receptors for bFGF in this region of the gland do not appear to have a large excess capacity for binding to bFGF. Hence, in these growing structures, bFGF is able to diffuse more freely and is likely to be involved in the stimulation of the growth of the cells of the terminal end buds and perhaps mediate stromal-epithelial interactions (3Rudland P.S.

Cytochem. 1993; 41: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There has been a long standing association between alterations in both the levels of production and the overall sulfation of HS and the development of malignant mammary tumors (14Iozzo R.V. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1988; 7: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Takeuchi J. Sobue M. Sato E. Shamoto M. Miura K. Nakagaki S. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2133-2139PubMed Google Scholar). In cellular models of breast cancer, analogous changes in the gross structure of HS have been observed, whereas changes in the levels of expression of the core protein of the HS proteoglycan syndecan-1 may be causally related to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype by mammary tumor cellsin vitro (16Fernig D.G.

We have analyzed the aFGF- and bFGF-binding sites present in the HS produced by cells representative of the ductal epithelial cell, the myoepithelial cell, the stromal fibroblast, and malignant mammary tumors, by using a biosensor-based binding assay (19Kinsella L. Chen H.-L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 14 (in press)Google Scholar) and determining quantitatively the binding parameters of aFGF and bFGF for the HS from these different mammary cell types. In addition, we have measured the ability of the different species of mammary HS to activate bFGF in HS-deficient cells. The results indicate that the HS from the mammary cells possesses multiple, but independent classes of binding sites for these growth factors, and that there is a correlation between the class of the bFGF binding site and the ability of the HS to activate bFGF. Human recombinant aFGF and bFGF were prepared as described previously (20Ke Y.Q. Fernig D.G. Smith J.A. Wilkinson M.C. Anandappa S.Y. Rudland P.S. Barraclough R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A modification of previously described methods (26Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y.Q.

Cells were subcultured into 64 15-cm diameter culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and, in four dishes, 10 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine and 20 μCi/ml [35S]SO4 (both ICN-Flow, Thame, UK) were included in the culture medium. After 72 h, when the cells were 90% confluent, the culture medium was removed and pooled with two 5-ml PBS (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) washes of each culture dish. The cells were collected by scraping in 5 ml of 6 m urea with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated in this solution overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. In the case of Rama 27 fibroblasts, two medium and two cellular samples were produced. After the removal of the culture medium and washing the cell monolayers with 5 ml of PBS, 25 ml of fresh step-down medium (SDM; DMEM with 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to each culture dish. Twenty-four hours later, the SDM was collected as before and the cells were then detached with 2 ml of 0.5% trypsin (w/v, Sigma) in Versene (Life Technologies, Inc.) and collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min in 30-ml universal tubes. The cell pellet was washed with 5 ml of PBS by centrifugation as above, and the two supernatants were pooled to produce a fraction called the “trypsinate,” containing trypsin-releasable HS proteoglycans. The culture dishes were scraped in 5 ml of 6 m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS, which was added to the cell pellet and solubilized as above. The samples were applied to a 2.5 × 50-cm column of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Bound macromolecules were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.15–2 m NaCl in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8) and the3H and 35S content of aliquots of the 6-ml fractions eluting between 0.3 and 1 m NaCl, which contained proteoglycans, was determined in a Packard 1900TR scintillation counter. After exhaustive dialysis against H2O for 48 h and lyophilization, the proteoglycans were treated sequentially with: (i) chondroitinase ABC, (ii) sialidases (26Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), (iii) endo-β-galactosidase and nucleases (28Rahmoune H. Rounding H.P. McDonald-Gibson W.J. Lamblin G. Hall R.L. Roussel R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and (iv) Pronase (26Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The free HS chains were purified on a second DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1 × 30 cm) and eluted between 0.3 m and 1m NaCl. Because the HS chains were purified as peptidoglycans, these were biotinylated on the free amino group of the peptide. One hundred μg of HS in 100 μl of distilled water was incubated with 30 μl of a 50 mm solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide aminocaproate (LC) biotin (Pierce-Warriner, Chester, UK) in dimethyl sulfoxide for 72 h. Unreacted biotin was removed by fractionation on a Sephadex G-25 column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated in distilled water, and HS chains were then lyophilized. Biotinylated HS chains were immobilized on streptavidin-derivatized surfaces as described for biotinylated heparin (19Kinsella L. Chen H.-L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 14 (in press)Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out in an IAsys resonant mirror biosensor at 20 °C using three-dimensional carboxymethyl dextran and planar aminosilane surfaces (Affinity Sensors, Saxon Hill, Cambridge, UK). The negative charge of the carboxymethyl dextran surface at pH 7.2 appeared to prevent aFGF binding to HS immobilized on this surface (results not shown). Therefore, aminosilane surfaces, derivatized with streptavidin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affinity Sensors), were used for aFGF binding assays. The bFGF-binding assays were repeated at least three times, once on an aminosilane surface and twice on a carboxymethyl dextran surface. aFGF and bFGF themselves did not bind to streptavidin-derivatized carboxymethyl dextran or aminosilane surfaces (results not shown). The distribution of the immobilized HS and of the bound aFGF and bFGF on the surface of the biosensor cuvette was inspected by examination of the resonance scan, which showed that at all times these molecules were distributed uniformly on the sensor surface and therefore were not microaggregated. A single binding assay consisted of adding the ligate at a known concentration in 100 μl of PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20) and then following the association reaction over a set time, usually 300 s. The cuvette was then washed three times with 200 μl of PBST, and the dissociation of bound ligate into the bulk PBST was followed over time. To remove residual bound ligate, and thus regenerate the immobilized ligand, the cuvette was washed twice with 200 μl of 2m NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2. Binding parameters were calculated from the association and dissociation phases of the binding reactions using the non-linear curve fitting FastFit software (Affinity Sensors) provided with the instrument. The percentage of the HS peptidoglycan chains possessing biotin coupled exclusively to the peptide moiety was also determined. The total number of binding sites for bFGF on biotinylated HS immobilized on a streptavidin-derivatized aminosilane surface was measured by repeatedly adding 3 ng/ml bFGF until saturation of the available bFGF-binding sites was observed. After removal of the bound bFGF with 2m NaCl, β-elimination was carried out on the immobilized HS for 16 h in 50 mm NaOH and 2 mNaBH4 at 37 °C (28Rahmoune H. Rounding H.P. McDonald-Gibson W.J. Lamblin G. Hall R.L. Roussel R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) in the biosensor cuvette. The reaction was stopped with 4 m acetic acid and the supernatant removed. A 50-μl wash of the cuvette with 8 mguanidine HCl was pooled with the supernatant, which was desalted on Sephadex G-25 in H2O. The desalted HS chains were then immobilized on a fresh streptavidin-derivatized aminosilane surface and the total number of bFGF binding sites again measured. bFGF failed to bind to the cuvette washed with 8 m guanidine. Between 90% and 97% of the bFGF-binding sites were associated with HS chains possessing biotin, which was sensitive to β-elimination, and thus linked to the peptide moiety of the peptidoglycan. The remainder of the bFGF-binding sites in the peptidoglycan chains were insensitive to β-elimination and thus may be associated with biotin linked to the polysaccharide moiety of the peptidoglycan (results not shown). HS (1 mg), prepared from the culture medium of the fibroblastic Rama 27 cells, was initially heated to 100 °C for 3 min and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with heparitinase 1 or heparitinase 3 at a concentration of 40 milliunits/ml in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm calcium acetate. The enzymes were then inactivated by heating at 100 °C for 3 min and the resulting oligosaccharides desalted on a column (1 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P6 (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) equilibrated in distilled water. Oligosaccharides in the excluded and included volumes of the column were pooled and lyophilized. HS-deficient Rama 27 fibroblasts were prepared by a modification (29Chen H.-L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 358Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) of the method of Rapraeger et al. (7Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Near-confluent Rama 27 cells in 9-cm culture dishes (Nunc) were washed twice with PBS and fresh, low sulfur Routine Medium (DMEM without SO42−, containing 20 μm methionine and 15 μm cystine (both Sigma) and supplemented with 5% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 ng/ml insulin, 50 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 15 mmNaClO3 (Fluka, Glossop, UK)) was added. After a 6 h of incubation, the cells were subcultured in this medium in 24-well dishes for assays for DNA synthesis. After 24 h, the cell monolayers were washed twice with 500 μl of PBS, and 500 μl of low sulfur SDM (DMEM without SO42−, containing 20 μm methionine and 15 μm cystine and supplemented with 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 15 mm NaClO3) was added. The cells were incubated in this medium for 24 h to induce quiescence, and then the medium was replaced with 500 μl of fresh low sulfur SDM at 37 °C. bFGF and HS were added to the cells as indicated in the text. After 18 h, when S-phase DNA synthesis was maximal, 1.5 μm[3H]thymidine (0.8 μCi; ICN-Flow) was added to the cells for 1 h and the cells were then prepared for scintillation counting, exactly as described previously (30Chen H.-L. Rudland P.S. Smith J.A. Fernig D.G. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In some experiments, control Rama 27 fibroblasts were used in DNA synthesis assays, in which case conventional DMEM was used throughout (30Chen H.-L. Rudland P.S. Smith J.A. Fernig D.G. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The HS chains used in this study were purified from five different mammary cell lines, representative of some of the cell types found in the normal mammary gland (Fig. 1) and in malignant mammary tumors. The ductal epithelial cell is represented by the benign Huma 123 epithelial cells, the myoepithelial cells correspond to the Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells, and the Rama 27 fibroblasts are representative of a mammary stromal fibroblast. The MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells are malignant metastatic human mammary epithelial cells (22Rudland P.S. Twiston Davis A.C. Tsao S.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Rudland P.S. Histol. Histopathol. 1993; 8: 385-404PubMed Google Scholar, 25Soule H.D. Vazquez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Exhaustive digestion of the peptidoglycans with heparitinases 1–3, followed by isolation of the disaccharides on Bio-Gel P6, indicated that over 90% of the starting material was degraded to disaccharides and was thus HS (31Rahmoune H. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 355SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The composition of the disaccharides was determined in those cases where there was sufficient material. The major difference observed was a 2-fold increase in 6-O-sulfated disaccharides in the HS from the two malignant cell lines, MCF-7 and ZR-75, compared with the HS from the benign epithelial Huma 123 and the myoepithelial-like Huma 109 cell lines (31Rahmoune H. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 355SCrossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,32Rahmoune H. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1299Crossref Google Scholar). The association phase of the interaction between bFGF and mammary cell HS was considerably faster than that for aFGF, whereas the dissociation phase of the reactions proceeded at similar rates (Figs. 2 and 3). Consequently, considerably lower concentrations of bFGF were used in the binding assays, and the bulk shifts observed at the start of the association and dissociation phases were quite small (Fig. 2). The interaction between bFGF with mammary cell HS exhibits a much greater complexity than found with the other HS-binding proteins we have examined, 2H. Rahmoune, H.-L. Chen, J. T. Gallagher, P. S. Rudland, and D. G. Fernig, submitted for publication. because some of the samples of HS possess a single binding site for bFGF, whereas other samples of HS possessed two binding sites for bFGF (Table I).Figure 3Binding of aFGF to HS purified from Huma 109 myoepithelial-like cells. HS was biotinylated and immobilized on a streptavidin-aminosilane surface. After the addition of aFGF to the biosensor cuvette, the binding of aFGF was followed in real time for at least 5 min. The cuvette was then quickly washed three times with 200 μl of PBST, and the dissociation of bound aFGF into 200 μl of PBST was followed over the next 2 min. Data were collected every second during the course of the experiment.

IRP1 and IRP2 are cytosolic RNA-binding proteins that bind RNA stem-loops located in the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs encoding proteins that are involved in iron homeostasis. In cells exposed to hypoxia, IRP1 RNA binding was decreased ∼2.8-fold after a 6-h exposure to 3% O2. Hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 was abolished when cells were pretreated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine, indicating a role for iron in inactivation. IRP1 inactivation was reversible since re-exposure of hypoxically-treated cells to 21% O2 increased RNA binding activity ∼7-fold after 21 h with an increase in activity seen as early as 1-h post-reoxygenation. IRP1 protein levels were unaffected during hypoxia as well as during reoxygenation. Whereas the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block IRP1 inactivation during hypoxia, it completely blocked IRP1 reactivation during subsequent reoxygenation. Reactivation of IRP1 during reoxygenation was also partially blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Finally, reactivated IRP1 was found to be resistant to inactivation by exogenous iron known to down-regulate its activity during normoxia. These data demonstrate that IRP1 RNA binding activity is post-translationally regulated during hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation.

In eukaryotes, iron levels are post-transcriptionally regulated by the iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) (reviewed in Refs. 11Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IRPs exert their regulatory functions by binding to RNA stem-loop structures known as iron responsive elements (IREs). IREs are located in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron uptake, storage, or utilization. IREs are found in the 5′-untranslated regions of the iron storage protein ferritin mRNA, as well as in the mRNAs for the iron utilization proteins of mitochondrial aconitase, erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase. IREs are found in the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding iron uptake proteins, such as the transferrin receptor and the metal-ion transporter (13Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y.

IRP1 binding to the 5′-IRE of ferritin mRNA inhibits translation initiation, whereas IRP1 binding to IREs located in the 3′-untranslated regions of the transferrin receptor stabilizes this mRNA.IRP1 is similar to mitochondrial aconitase with the features that both can form a [4Fe-4S] cluster (14Rouault T.A.

The ability of IRP1 to switch between a RNA-binding form and a c-aconitase form allows for the coordinated iron-dependent regulation of IRE mRNAs.

The post-translational regulation of IRP1 activity by ROS couples the regulation of iron homeostasis with the oxidative environment of the cell.Since cellular production of ROS is related to O2concentration, and since there exists a relationship between iron and O2, we investigated the effects of hypoxia and H/ReO2 on IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activity. Our experiments demonstrate that IRP1, but not IRP2 RNA binding activity, decreased during hypoxia, and was reversible upon subsequent reoxygenation. The regulation of IRP1 during hypoxia and H/ReO2 occurred post-translationally without changes in protein levels. IRP1 inactivation during hypoxia required iron, indicating a role for the [4F4–4S] cluster. Interestingly, reoxygenation-induced IRP1 activation was not abrogated in the presence of exogenous iron.DISCUSSIONWe investigated the effects of O2 on the regulation of IRP1 and IRP2, and showed that IRP1 is post-translationally regulated by hypoxia and H/ReO2. During hypoxia, IRP1 RNA binding activity from rat hepatoma cells and primary cardiac myocytes decreased. Hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 was reversed during subsequent reoxygenation. Furthermore, our data suggested that regulation was due in part to the lability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, indicating that the cluster could serve as a target for regulating IRP1 during hypoxia and H/ReO2. IRP2 RNA binding activity did not significantly change under our conditions of hypoxia and H/ReO2, presumably because it does not contain a [4Fe-S] cluster similar to IRP1 (21Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Iron chelation abrogated the decrease in IRP1 RNA binding activity during hypoxia, indicating a requirement for IRP1 to form and/or maintain its [4Fe-4S] cluster. By virtue of iron's ability to convert IRP1 from its RNA-binding form to its [4Fe-4S] c-aconitase form, an increase in iron during hypoxia is a reasonable explanation for the decrease in IRP1 activity. It would be expected that IRP2 activity would decrease if cellular iron levels increased during hypoxia. This, however, was not the case. IRP2 can responded appropriately to exogenous iron, indicating that hypoxic FTO2B cells can sense iron. In addition, the sensitivities of IRP1 and IRP2 to iron were found to be similar. Using IRP2 as an indicator of cellular iron status, we suggest that hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 may be due to factors other than increased cellular iron.A model to explain hypoxia-induced inactivation of IRP1 activity is one in which the stability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is enhanced in an O2 limiting environment. In this model, IRP1 from normoxic cells would exist in a dynamic state interconverting between the [4Fe-4S] cluster c-aconitase form and the apo-IRP1 RNA-binding form. When O2 is limiting, the equilibrium would favor stabilization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, leading to a decrease in total IRP1 RNA binding and a slight (∼15%) increase in c-aconitase activity (data not shown). The modest increase in c-aconitase activity observed in our experiments is not surprising since under normoxic conditions FTO2B cells contain ∼15% of IRP1 in the RNA-binding form and ∼85% in the c-aconitase. Hypoxia-induced IRP1 inactivation might result in increased ferritin synthesis similar to that observed in hypoxic oligodendrocytes (46Qi Y. Jamindar T.M. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2458-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).How could the [4Fe-4S] cluster be stabilized during hypoxia? One possibility is the involvement of ROS, especially O·̄2. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic aconitases are reversibly inactivated by O·̄2 via [4Fe-4S] cluster disassembly (34Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hausladen A.

Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Based on these studies it would seem likely that a decrease in O·̄2 during hypoxia could account for IRP1 inactivation by stabilization of its non-RNA-binding [4Fe-4S] form.Since H/ReO2 has been shown to generate ROS in a variety of cell types, and since IRP1 is sensitive to ROS (25Martin E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the question arose whether IRP1 activity was affected during reoxygenation of hypoxic cells. IRP1 RNA binding activity increased in FTO2B cells and in primary cardiac myocytes without an increase in IRP1 protein levels. The increase in IRP1 activity during reoxygenation may result from an increase in ROS, leading to [4Fe-4S] cluster disassembly. Surprisingly, reactivation of RNA binding activity of IRP1 during reoxygenation was insensitive to exogenous iron. That iron was being taken up into cells is demonstrated by the decrease in IRP2 activity in iron-treated reoxygenated cells. One explanation for the inability of exogenous iron to decrease IRP1 RNA binding activity is that ROS-induced disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is more rapid than iron-stimulated cluster assembly resulting in the accumulation of apo-IRP1. The increase in IRP1 RNA binding during reoxygenation could increase transferrin receptor levels, leading to increased iron uptake. In this scenario, ferritin synthesis might be repressed, contributing further to increases in cellular iron. Whether IRP2 can compensate for IRP1 dysregulation during reoxygenation remains to be determined. The aberrant iron regulation of IRP1 during reoxygenation could contribute to cellular damage seen during ischemia-reperfusion injury.In addition to the above model where IRP1 activation during H/ReO2 may occur by direct attack of ROS on the [4Fe-4S] cluster, signaling pathways are likely to be involved, as has been described for H2O2-induced IRP1 activation (28Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Support for this comes from data demonstrating that cycloheximide completely blocked, while okadaic acid partially blocked, IRP1 reactivation during reoxygenation. These data suggested the possibility that H/ReO2 stimulates the synthesis of a protein(s) which is in a pathway ultimately leading to IRP1 activation. One potential candidate may be a kinase. Phosphorylation of apo-IRP1 at serine residues predicted to be near the active site cleft have been shown to stimulate RNA binding activity (47Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Tuazon P.T. Chen O.S. Kennedy M.C. Eisenstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 48Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that phosphorylation, or some other modification, of IRP1 stimulated by H/ReO2 precludes formation of the [4Fe-4S], thus increasing apo-IRP1 levels. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that cycloheximide might have affected ROS generation during H/ReO2. Collectively, our data support a model where IRP1 activation during H/ReO2 require a signal that modulates IRP1 activity, perhaps by phosphorylation, in addition to the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster.The lability of the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] cluster to the oxidation status of the cell could serve as a mechanism for post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression during hypoxia and H/ReO2. Whether this regulation occurs in other cells types remains to be determined. Furthermore, identification of downstream mRNA targets (e.g. ferritin and transferrin receptor) will be an important next step in understanding the biological role of IRP1 regulation by changing O2 tension. The consequences of O2 regulation of IRP1 may prove to be far reaching, both in terms of cellular adaptation to hypoxia as well as cellular damage seen during H/ReO2. Mammalian cells employ multiple mechanisms that allow them to adapt to changes in oxygen concentration. During hypoxia, a cellular response is mounted aimed at counteracting the effects of limited O2 by the increased expression of specific genes such as erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glycolytic enzymes, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (reviewed in Ref. 1Bunn H.F.

Iron is central in contributing to ROS-induced cell damage due to its ability to catalyze the formation of the highly reactive HO· via Fenton chemistry. This notion is supported by studies showing that iron chelation can protect cells from H/ReO2 injury (7Aust S.D. White B.C. Adv. Free Rad. Biol.

Although free iron is toxic, it is required by most cells for survival, and consequently, cells have developed mechanisms to regulate iron uptake and sequestration. In eukaryotes, iron levels are post-transcriptionally regulated by the iron regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) (reviewed in Refs. 11Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IRPs exert their regulatory functions by binding to RNA stem-loop structures known as iron responsive elements (IREs). IREs are located in either the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs encoding proteins involved in iron uptake, storage, or utilization. IREs are found in the 5′-untranslated regions of the iron storage protein ferritin mRNA, as well as in the mRNAs for the iron utilization proteins of mitochondrial aconitase, erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase. IREs are found in the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding iron uptake proteins, such as the transferrin receptor and the metal-ion transporter (13Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y.

IRP1 binding to the 5′-IRE of ferritin mRNA inhibits translation initiation, whereas IRP1 binding to IREs located in the 3′-untranslated regions of the transferrin receptor stabilizes this mRNA. IRP1 is similar to mitochondrial aconitase with the features that both can form a [4Fe-4S] cluster (14Rouault T.A. Stout C.D. Kaptain S. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D.

When cells are iron-replete, [4Fe-4S] cluster formation converts IRP1 to the non-RNA-binding cytosolic aconitase (c-aconitase) (15Haile D.J. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Kennedy M.C. Blondin G.A.

The ability of IRP1 to switch between a RNA-binding form and a c-aconitase form allows for the coordinated iron-dependent regulation of IRE mRNAs. By controlling the amount of iron taken up, stored, and utilized by cells, iron levels are maintained, and iron toxicity is avoided. IRP2 shares 61% identity to IRP1 and binds IRE mRNAs (17Rouault T.A. Haile D.J. Downey W.E. Philpott C.C. Tang C. Samaniego F. Chin J. Paul I. Orloff D. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D.

In addition, signaling pathways have been implicated in IRP1 regulation in H2O2-treated cells (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.

The post-translational regulation of IRP1 activity by ROS couples the regulation of iron homeostasis with the oxidative environment of the cell. Since cellular production of ROS is related to O2concentration, and since there exists a relationship between iron and O2, we investigated the effects of hypoxia and H/ReO2 on IRP1 and IRP2 RNA binding activity. Our experiments demonstrate that IRP1, but not IRP2 RNA binding activity, decreased during hypoxia, and was reversible upon subsequent reoxygenation. The regulation of IRP1 during hypoxia and H/ReO2 occurred post-translationally without changes in protein levels. IRP1 inactivation during hypoxia required iron, indicating a role for the [4F4–4S] cluster. Interestingly, reoxygenation-induced IRP1 activation was not abrogated in the presence of exogenous iron. DISCUSSIONWe investigated the effects of O2 on the regulation of IRP1 and IRP2, and showed that IRP1 is post-translationally regulated by hypoxia and H/ReO2. During hypoxia, IRP1 RNA binding activity from rat hepatoma cells and primary cardiac myocytes decreased. Hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 was reversed during subsequent reoxygenation. Furthermore, our data suggested that regulation was due in part to the lability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, indicating that the cluster could serve as a target for regulating IRP1 during hypoxia and H/ReO2. IRP2 RNA binding activity did not significantly change under our conditions of hypoxia and H/ReO2, presumably because it does not contain a [4Fe-S] cluster similar to IRP1 (21Phillips J.D. Guo B. Yu Y. Brown F.M. Leibold E.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15704-15714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Iron chelation abrogated the decrease in IRP1 RNA binding activity during hypoxia, indicating a requirement for IRP1 to form and/or maintain its [4Fe-4S] cluster. By virtue of iron's ability to convert IRP1 from its RNA-binding form to its [4Fe-4S] c-aconitase form, an increase in iron during hypoxia is a reasonable explanation for the decrease in IRP1 activity. It would be expected that IRP2 activity would decrease if cellular iron levels increased during hypoxia. This, however, was not the case. IRP2 can responded appropriately to exogenous iron, indicating that hypoxic FTO2B cells can sense iron. In addition, the sensitivities of IRP1 and IRP2 to iron were found to be similar. Using IRP2 as an indicator of cellular iron status, we suggest that hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 may be due to factors other than increased cellular iron.A model to explain hypoxia-induced inactivation of IRP1 activity is one in which the stability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is enhanced in an O2 limiting environment. In this model, IRP1 from normoxic cells would exist in a dynamic state interconverting between the [4Fe-4S] cluster c-aconitase form and the apo-IRP1 RNA-binding form. When O2 is limiting, the equilibrium would favor stabilization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, leading to a decrease in total IRP1 RNA binding and a slight (∼15%) increase in c-aconitase activity (data not shown). The modest increase in c-aconitase activity observed in our experiments is not surprising since under normoxic conditions FTO2B cells contain ∼15% of IRP1 in the RNA-binding form and ∼85% in the c-aconitase. Hypoxia-induced IRP1 inactivation might result in increased ferritin synthesis similar to that observed in hypoxic oligodendrocytes (46Qi Y. Jamindar T.M. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2458-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).How could the [4Fe-4S] cluster be stabilized during hypoxia? One possibility is the involvement of ROS, especially O·̄2. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic aconitases are reversibly inactivated by O·̄2 via [4Fe-4S] cluster disassembly (34Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hausladen A.

Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Based on these studies it would seem likely that a decrease in O·̄2 during hypoxia could account for IRP1 inactivation by stabilization of its non-RNA-binding [4Fe-4S] form.Since H/ReO2 has been shown to generate ROS in a variety of cell types, and since IRP1 is sensitive to ROS (25Martin E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the question arose whether IRP1 activity was affected during reoxygenation of hypoxic cells. IRP1 RNA binding activity increased in FTO2B cells and in primary cardiac myocytes without an increase in IRP1 protein levels. The increase in IRP1 activity during reoxygenation may result from an increase in ROS, leading to [4Fe-4S] cluster disassembly. Surprisingly, reactivation of RNA binding activity of IRP1 during reoxygenation was insensitive to exogenous iron. That iron was being taken up into cells is demonstrated by the decrease in IRP2 activity in iron-treated reoxygenated cells. One explanation for the inability of exogenous iron to decrease IRP1 RNA binding activity is that ROS-induced disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is more rapid than iron-stimulated cluster assembly resulting in the accumulation of apo-IRP1. The increase in IRP1 RNA binding during reoxygenation could increase transferrin receptor levels, leading to increased iron uptake. In this scenario, ferritin synthesis might be repressed, contributing further to increases in cellular iron. Whether IRP2 can compensate for IRP1 dysregulation during reoxygenation remains to be determined. The aberrant iron regulation of IRP1 during reoxygenation could contribute to cellular damage seen during ischemia-reperfusion injury.In addition to the above model where IRP1 activation during H/ReO2 may occur by direct attack of ROS on the [4Fe-4S] cluster, signaling pathways are likely to be involved, as has been described for H2O2-induced IRP1 activation (28Pantopoulos K.

Support for this comes from data demonstrating that cycloheximide completely blocked, while okadaic acid partially blocked, IRP1 reactivation during reoxygenation. These data suggested the possibility that H/ReO2 stimulates the synthesis of a protein(s) which is in a pathway ultimately leading to IRP1 activation. One potential candidate may be a kinase. Phosphorylation of apo-IRP1 at serine residues predicted to be near the active site cleft have been shown to stimulate RNA binding activity (47Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Tuazon P.T. Chen O.S. Kennedy M.C. Eisenstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3950-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 48Eisenstein R.S. Tuazon P.T. Schalinske K.L. Anderson S.A. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27363-27370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that phosphorylation, or some other modification, of IRP1 stimulated by H/ReO2 precludes formation of the [4Fe-4S], thus increasing apo-IRP1 levels. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that cycloheximide might have affected ROS generation during H/ReO2. Collectively, our data support a model where IRP1 activation during H/ReO2 require a signal that modulates IRP1 activity, perhaps by phosphorylation, in addition to the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster.The lability of the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] cluster to the oxidation status of the cell could serve as a mechanism for post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression during hypoxia and H/ReO2. Whether this regulation occurs in other cells types remains to be determined. Furthermore, identification of downstream mRNA targets (e.g. ferritin and transferrin receptor) will be an important next step in understanding the biological role of IRP1 regulation by changing O2 tension. The consequences of O2 regulation of IRP1 may prove to be far reaching, both in terms of cellular adaptation to hypoxia as well as cellular damage seen during H/ReO2. We investigated the effects of O2 on the regulation of IRP1 and IRP2, and showed that IRP1 is post-translationally regulated by hypoxia and H/ReO2. During hypoxia, IRP1 RNA binding activity from rat hepatoma cells and primary cardiac myocytes decreased. Hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 was reversed during subsequent reoxygenation. Furthermore, our data suggested that regulation was due in part to the lability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, indicating that the cluster could serve as a target for regulating IRP1 during hypoxia and H/ReO2. IRP2 RNA binding activity did not significantly change under our conditions of hypoxia and H/ReO2, presumably because it does not contain a [4Fe-S] cluster similar to IRP1 (21Phillips J.D. Guo B.

It is possible that phosphorylation, or some other modification, of IRP1 stimulated by H/ReO2 precludes formation of the [4Fe-4S], thus increasing apo-IRP1 levels. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that cycloheximide might have affected ROS generation during H/ReO2. Collectively, our data support a model where IRP1 activation during H/ReO2 require a signal that modulates IRP1 activity, perhaps by phosphorylation, in addition to the disassembly of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The lability of the IRP1 [4Fe-4S] cluster to the oxidation status of the cell could serve as a mechanism for post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression during hypoxia and H/ReO2. Whether this regulation occurs in other cells types remains to be determined. Furthermore, identification of downstream mRNA targets (e.g. ferritin and transferrin receptor) will be an important next step in understanding the biological role of IRP1 regulation by changing O2 tension. The consequences of O2 regulation of IRP1 may prove to be far reaching, both in terms of cellular adaptation to hypoxia as well as cellular damage seen during H/ReO2. We thank Drs.

This is the first demonstration that ExoS disrupts a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway. Small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily play an integral role in eukaryotic signal transduction, controlling processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation (1Wiesmuller L. Wittinghofer F. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several bacterial toxins covalently modify members of the Ras superfamily and alter transduction of intracellular signals. Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosylates Rho at Asn-41, inhibiting Rho-dependent differentiation (2Aktories K. Mohr C. Koch G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 115-131PubMed Google Scholar).

Conditions such as cystic fibrosis, leukemia, neutropenia, and burn wounds predispose individuals to infections by P. aeruginosa(6Bodey G. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Numerous factors, including the production of exoenzyme S (ExoS 1The abbreviations used are: ExoS, exoenzyme S; FAS, factor-activating exoenzyme S; NGF, nerve growth factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ; 453 amino acids), may contribute to the virulence of P. aeruginosa (7Nicas T.I. Iglewski B.H. Antibiot. Chemother. 1985; 36: 40-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ExoS, a member of the family of bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases (8Krueger K.M. Barbieri J.T. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 34-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), requires the presence of a eukaryotic protein termed factor-activating exoenzyme S (FAS), a 14-3-3 protein, for expression of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (9Fu H. Coburn J. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2320-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Unique to most bacterial toxins, ExoS does not have rigid target protein specificity. In vitro, ExoS has been shown to ADP-ribosylate a number of targets, including IgG3 (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apolipoprotein A-I (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect.

Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of chemical sensitivity indicated that ExoS ADP-ribosylates these proteins at arginine residues (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coburn J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies implicated a role for ExoS in the dissemination of P. aeruginosa from burn wounds (14Nicas T.I. Bradley J. Lochner J.E. Iglewski B.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 152: 716-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and in tissue destruction in chronic lung infections (15Nicas T.I. Frank D.W. Stenzel P. Lile J.D. Iglewski B.H. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 4: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the transposon mutant used in the earlier studies had a disruption in the gene encoding a component of its type III secretion system; thus, this mutant would have pleiotropic effects on the expression of other type III secreted factors in addition to ExoS (16Yahr T.L. Goranson J. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have implicated a role for the type III secretion apparatus in the delivery of ExoS into eukaryotic cells. Olson and co-workers (17McGuffie, E. M., Frank, D. W., Vincent, T. S., Olson, J. C., General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, May 4–8, 1997, Miami Beach, FL, 1997, 56.Google Scholar) have shown that incubation of cultured cells with strains of P. aeruginosa expressing ExoS resulted in the ADP-ribosylation of Ras, whereas Forsberg and co-workers (18Frithz-Lindsten E. Du Y.D. Rosqvist R. Forsberg A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1125-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ExoS is cytotoxic to cultured cells when delivered by the type III secretion system of the heterologous hostYersinia. In this study, we examined the biochemical aspects of the ADP-ribosylation of Ras by ExoS. We demonstrate that ExoS ADP-ribosylates c-Ha-Ras at more than one site, with Arg-41 being the preferred site of ADP-ribosylation. In addition, we show that infection of PC-12 cells by a strain of P. aeruginosa that produces ExoS inhibits nerve growth factor (NGF)-stimulated neurite outgrowth, which is the first demonstration that ADP-ribosylation by ExoS disrupts a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated manufacturers: [adenylate phosphate-32P]NAD and [35S]methionine, NEN Life Science Products; TnT7 quick coupled transcription/translation kit, Promega; Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; bovine serum albumin, Pierce; and DNA oligomers, Operon Technologies, Inc. Recombinant FAS and the pET16b c-Ha-Ras vector were gifts from H. Fu (Emory University). P. aeruginosa 388 exoenzyme S was purified as described previously (19Kulich S.M. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 307-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa 388 and P. aeruginosa388ΔExoS were cultured as described previously (16Yahr T.L. Goranson J. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Ras proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (20Knight D.A. Finck-Barbancon V. Kulich S.M. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin) were added to the concentrated cell suspensions, which were disrupted with a French press. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000 × g for 20 min) and filtered (0.45-μm filter), and His-tagged Ras proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (20Knight D.A. Finck-Barbancon V. Kulich S.M. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged Ras proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 3 μm GTP and 10 mmMgCl2, diluted to 40% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. These proteins were termed RasΔCAAX. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), with the indicated amount of [adenylate phosphate-32P]NAD, and RasΔCAAX in the presence and absence of FAS and/or ExoS or ΔN222 (a catalytic deletion peptide of ExoS) (20Knight D.A. Finck-Barbancon V. Kulich S.M. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3182-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the indicated concentrations. Reactions were performed for 1 h at room temperature and stopped with 0.5 volume of gel loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. RasΔCAAX was engineered by deletion polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of pet16b c-Ha-Ras using primers containing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI and BamHI and ligated into the pET15b vector. the EcoRI-BamHI fragment, encoding the RasΔCAAX gene and the T7 promoter, was then cloned into M13mp18. M13mp18RasΔCAAX was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was performed essentially following the instructions of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA primers were constructed to be 10 base pairs complementary to the DNA template flanking the mutation of interest and encoded a Arg-to-Ala substitution (GC to CG). The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. The mutants were designated RnA, where arginine at residue n of Ras was changed to alanine. M13mp18RasΔCAAX (M13ras) or mutated M13mp18Ras ΔCAAX replicative form DNA was subjected to coupled in vitro transcription/translation (Promega). Transcription/translation reactions (12 μl) contained 0.5 μg of replicative form DNA and [35S]Met (specific activity of 98 Ci/mmol). An aliquot of the transcription/translation reaction (2 μl) was added to 4 volumes of gel loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. This sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to monitor the electrophoretic mobility of intrinsically labeled [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX. The transcription/translation mixture was also subjected to ADP-ribosylation by ExoS in reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing 4 μl of the transcription/translation mixture and 0.6 msodium acetate (pH 6.0) in the presence and absence of 0.1 μm FAS, 960 μm NAD, and either 12 or 1.2 nm ExoS as indicated. Reactions were stopped at the indicated times by adding 2 volumes of gel loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The electrophoretic mobility of this sample was compared with the electrophoretic mobility of intrinsically labeled [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX. The rate of GDP/GTP dissociation of wild-type RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K was measured essentially as described previously (21Shirouzu M. Koide H. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Oshio H. Toyama Y. Yamasaki K. Fuhrman S.A. Villafranca E. Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μmRasΔCAAX was incubated in 4 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 37 °C, and then 50 μm[α-32P]GTP (specific activity of 1.4 Ci/mmol) and 10 mm MgCl2 were added. After 30 min at 37 °C, a 40-fold excess of unlabeled GTP was added. At defined times, 25-μl aliquots were removed, filtered through nitrocellulose filters, and washed. Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. PC-12 cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours prior to an experiment, ∼4 × 103 cells were seeded per well in a 12-well culture dish coated with poly-l-lysine. For differentiation, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum and 100 ng/ml NGF (Boehringer Mannheim). ExoS ADP-ribosylates several eukaryotic proteins in vitro, including vimentin, IgG, and several members of the Ras superfamily (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coburn J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the ADP-ribosylation of c-Ha-Ras by ExoS was examined. To facilitate expression and purification, a deletion peptide of Ras (termed RasΔCAAX) was expressed as a His-tagged protein in E. coli. RasΔCAAX possesses the complete GTP-binding domain and effector functions of Ras, but lacks the four carboxyl-terminal residues, which comprises the farnesylation sequence necessary for membrane targeting. ADP-ribosylation of RasΔCAAX by ExoS showed an absolute requirement for FAS and NAD (Fig. 1). ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAX possessed a slower electrophoretic mobility as determined by SDS-PAGE relative to non-ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAX. Other experiments showed that at saturation, ExoS had ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAX at a stoichiometry of ∼2 mol of ADP-ribose bound per mol of RasΔCAAX (Table I). This suggested that ExoS ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAX at potentially two sites. Similar results were obtained when ExoS ADP-ribosylated full-length c-Ha-Ras (data not shown).Table IBiochemical analysis of recombinant wild-type Ras and RasΔCAAXR41KProteinGTP dissociation kinetics (t1/2)1-2001GTP dissociation was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results of two representative experiments are shown.Stoichiometry of ADP-ribosylation1-bProteins were subjected to ADP-ribosylation as described in the legend to Fig. 7.

Results of two representative experiments are shown. Open table in a new tab Biochemical characterization of eukaryotic proteins that had been ADP-ribosylated by ExoS indicated that arginine was the site of ADP-ribosylation (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the presence of two potential sites for ADP-ribosylation within Ras could complicate a biochemical determination of the preferred site for ADP-ribosylation, a molecular approach was used to determine if ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras at a preferred arginine residue. Briefly, the gene encoding RasΔCAAX was subcloned downstream of a T7 promoter, which was then subcloned into M13mp18 (M13ras). The replicative form of M13ras was isolated and subjected to in vitro transcription/translation using [35S]Met as an intrinsic label. The in vitro transcription/translation mixture, containing [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX, was subjected to ADP-ribosylation by ExoS. ADP-ribosylated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX was measured as a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX. The requirements for the ADP-ribosylation of in vitro translated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX by ExoS are shown in Fig. 2. In vitro translated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX migrated as a distinct 28-kDa band on SDS-PAGE. Incubation of in vitro translated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX with exogenous NAD, FAS, and ExoS resulted in the detection of two electrophoretic mobility shifted forms of RasΔCAAX. This was consistent with ExoS ADP-ribosylating Ras at two distinct sites. RasΔCAAXshowed little electrophoretic mobility shifting in reactions lacking NAD, whereas two electrophoretic mobility shifted forms of RasΔCAAX were observed in reactions lacking FAS. This indicated that the reticulocyte lysates used for in vitrotranscription/translation of RasΔCAAX contained a small amount of NAD and saturating amounts of FAS relative to the concentrations used in the ADP-ribosyltransferase assay. M13ras single-stranded DNA was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis in which 12 individual Arg-to-Ala mutations (each mutant was designated RnA (Arg at residue nof Ras mutated to an Ala) were introduced into the ras open reading frame. M13ras replicative form DNA, encoding the wild type or an individual Arg-to-Ala mutation, was subjected toin vitro transcription/translation. In vitrotranslated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX was ADP-ribosylated by ExoS at a concentration of ExoS such that a single preferred site for ADP-ribosylation would be detected. Wild-type [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX and 11 of the individual Arg-to-Ala mutants of RasΔCAAX, with the exception of RasΔCAAXR41A, showed an electrophoretic mobility shift upon ADP-ribosylation by ExoS. In contrast, RasΔCAAXR41A did not show an electrophoretic mobility shift upon incubation with ExoS. These data suggested that Arg-41 was the preferred site of ADP-ribosylation by ExoS (Fig. 3). ADP-ribosylation of in vitro translated [35S]Met-RasΔCAAX (the wild type and RnA mutants) was also assayed at higher concentrations of ExoS such that multiple sites within Ras would be ADP-ribosylated (Fig. 4). With the exception of RasΔCAAXR41A, ExoS ADP-ribosylated wild-type RasΔCAAX and the RnA mutants, with the appearance of two sequential electrophoretic mobility shifts, suggestive of the presence of double ADP-ribosylated Ras. In contrast, ExoS ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41A to only a single electrophoretic mobility shift, which was consistent with the presence of only a single site for ADP-ribosylation. These data also indicated that the second site of ADP-ribosylation was not at a specific arginine residue and that more than one arginine could be ADP-ribosylated at the second site. Since a third ADP-ribosylation event was not observed, it appeared that ADP-ribosylation at the second site excluded a third ADP-ribosylation event. To support the identification of Arg-41 as the preferred site for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS, several more conservative site-directed mutations were engineered at residue 41, lysine (RasΔCAAXR41K) and glutamine (RasΔCAAXR41Q). As observed for RasΔCAAXR41A, low concentrations of ExoS did not ADP-ribosylate either RasΔCAAXR41K or RasΔCAAXR41Q (Fig. 5). A second positive control, RasΔCAAXG12V, was ADP-ribosylated by ExoS as measured by the generation of electrophoretic mobility shifted Ras. To address ExoS-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Ras at Arg-41 in more detail, RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K were analyzed as targets for ADP-ribosylation. Bacterially produced RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K were expressed and purified to similar levels and reacted with polyclonal antisera to Ras by Western blotting (Fig. 6). To determine whether RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K were functional, the GTP dissociation kinetics were measured. Both RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K exhibited similar GTP dissociation kinetics (Table I), which indicated that the R41K mutation did not alter the global functional properties of Ras. Others have reported that mutations at Arg-41 did not alter the GTP dissociation kinetics (21Shirouzu M. Koide H. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Oshio H. Toyama Y. Yamasaki K. Fuhrman S.A. Villafranca E. Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the ADP-ribosylation of RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K by ExoS was studied. At saturation, ExoS ADP-ribosylated wild-type RasΔCAAX to a stoichiometry of ∼2 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras (Table I), whereas ExoS ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41K to a stoichiometry of 0.7 mol of ADP-ribose incorporated per mol of Ras. Examination of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and autoradiogram showed that, relative to non-ADP-ribosylated Ras, ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAX migrated with an altered electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE, whereas ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41K did not have an altered electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7). The fact that ADP-ribosylated RasΔCAAXR41K did not have an altered electrophoretic mobility in this experiment is due to fact that this experiment was performed using a 12% polyacrylamide gel, whereas the second ADP-ribosylation event was observed upon separation on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, as seen in Fig. 4. Under linear velocity conditions, ExoS ADP-ribosylated wild-type RasΔCAAX at a faster velocity than RasΔCAAXR41K. A representative graph depicting the velocity of the ADP-ribosylation of wild-type RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K by ExoS is shown in Fig. 8. The average of three independent experiments indicated that ExoS ADP-ribosylated wild-type RasΔCAAX at 5-fold greater velocity than RasΔCAAXR41K (Table I).Figure 8Velocity of the ADP-ribosylation of RasΔCAAX and RasΔCAAXR41K by ExoS.Wild-type Ras and RasΔCAAXR41K were ADP-ribosylated by ΔN222. Reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 6.0), 30 μm NAD (specific activity of 12.8 Ci/mmol), and 2.5 μm histidine-Ras fusion protein in the presence of 2.5 nm FAS and 2.5 nm ΔN222. Reactions were performed at room temperature and stopped after 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Arg-41 is located next to the switch 1 region of Ras (residues 30–39), a domain that interacts with downstream effectors (Fig. 9) (22Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, ADP-ribosylation of Ras at Arg-41 could potentially disrupt eukaryotic signal transduction by inhibiting the interaction of Ras with downstream effectors. The ability of ExoS to disrupt eukaryotic signal transduction was determined by analysis of NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. NGF-stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells follows a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway, although there are also Ras-independent components to the pathway (23Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Since ExoS is secreted from P. aeruginosa via a type III secretion pathway (16Yahr T.L. Goranson J. Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), ExoS was delivered into PC-12 cells by infection with P. aeruginosa. PC-12 cells were incubated alone, with a strain of P. aeruginosa that produced ExoS (388), or with a strain of P. aeruginosa that was genetically deleted for exoS (388ΔExoS). After 2 h, PC-12 cells were washed to remove unbound bacteria and incubated alone or with NGF. At 24 h post-infection, PC-12 cells were examined by phase microscopy. PC-12 cells that were incubated in the absence of bacteria and NGF showed a rounded morphology, typical of unstimulated cells (Fig. 10). In contrast, PC-12 cells that had been incubated alone or with a strain of P. aeruginosa that lacks exoS (388ΔExoS) and then incubated with NGF had undergone a morphological change, where the cells had spread and exhibited neurite outgrowth. PC-12 cells that had been incubated with the ExoS-expressing strain of P. aeruginosa followed by incubation with NGF showed a rounded morphology, similar to the morphology of non-infected, non-NGF-stimulated cells. These data indicated that infection of PC-12 cells with an ExoS-producing strain of P. aeruginosa inhibited NGF-stimulated signal transduction leading to neurite outgrowth. In other experiments, we observed that transient expression of ExoS from a cytomegalovirus promoter also inhibited NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. 2A. K. Ganesan and J. T. Barbieri, unpublished data. Together, these data indicated that inhibition of NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth was due to the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of ExoS and not a general cytotoxicity of ExoS or P. aeruginosa for PC-12 cells.Figure 10Uncoupling of NGF stimulation of neurite formation by P. aeruginosa expression of ExoS. PC-12 cells were incubated alone or were infected with P. aeruginosa 388 or 388ΔExoS at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 (bacteria to PC-12 cells) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed to remove unbound bacteria and incubated in differentiation medium containing penicillin/streptomycin alone or containing 0.1 μg/ml NGF. After 24 h, the morphology of the PC-12 cells was examined by phase microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier studies predicted that ExoS ADP-ribosylates eukaryotic proteins at arginine residues (10Knight D.A. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We initially pursued a biochemical analysis of the site of ADP-ribosylated Ras. However, we found that, during proteolysis, a considerable amount of radiolabel was released as ADP-ribose and that the radiolabel that remained peptide-associated was present in several peptides.2 This, in addition to the observation that ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras to a stoichiometry of ∼2 (Table I), prompted a molecular approach for the characterization of the site of ADP-ribosylation. The subsequent determination that ExoS ADP-ribosylates Ras at multiple sites is consistent with our inability to identify a specific arginine as the preferred site of ADP-ribosylation by biochemical approaches. Characterization of in vitro transcribed/translated forms of Ras that each possessed one of 12 individual Arg-to Ala substitutions identified Arg-41 as the preferred site for ADP-ribosylation since the Arg-41 mutants of Ras were not ADP-ribosylated by low concentrations of ExoS. Also, examination of the velocities of ADP-ribosylation of Ras by ExoS showed that Arg-41 was essentially completely ADP-ribosylated prior to the appearance of the second ADP-ribosylation event, which was consistent with Arg-41 being the high affinity site of ADP-ribosylation within Ras.2 Analysis of the single Arg mutants of Ras did not identify a specific Arg as the second site for ADP-ribosylation since all of the single Arg mutants of Ras, with the exception of Ras R41A, could be double ADP-ribosylated. These data indicated that one of several arginine residues could constitute the second site of ADP-ribosylation within Ras. Since a third ADP-ribosylation event was not observed, it appeared that the ADP-ribosylation at one arginine residue excluded a third ADP-ribosylation event. This suggests that the arginines that are targeted for the second ADP-ribosylation event are located in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of Ras. These data also showed that the ADP-ribosylation at Arg-41 and that at the second arginine were independent events and not the result of sequential, ordered ADP-ribosylation reactions since the Arg-41 mutants could be ADP-ribosylated at the second arginine residue. There is precedence for the ADP-ribosylation of proteins at two sites. Aktories and co-workers (24Just I. Sehr P. Jung M. van Damme J. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Moss J. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) recently showed that an endogenous eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferase modifies actin at Arg-95 and Arg-372. The ability of ExoS to ADP-ribosylate Ras at multiple arginine residues assists in addressing an earlier report by Coburn et al.(12Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that described the ADP-ribosylation of several members of the Ras superfamily by ExoS and the subsequent prediction that ExoS ADP-ribosylated Ras at Arg-123 (13Coburn J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 133-143PubMed Google Scholar). Our data could be consistent with Arg-123 being one of the secondary sites of ADP-ribosylation within Ras. Examination of the x-ray crystallographic structure of Ras (25Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 245: 939-945Crossref Scopus (849) Google Scholar) predicts that Arg-41 lies adjacent to the switch 1 domain, which has been shown to function in the interactions with downstream effectors, particularly Raf (22Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Alignment of the primary amino acid sequences of members of the Ras superfamily of small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins showed that Arg-41 is not a highly conserved residue. Thus, it appears that ExoS can potentially ADP-ribosylate the Arg-41 homologue of Ras, Ral, and Rap, but that members of the Rab or Rho family will not be targeted for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS at the Arg-41 homologue. However, the observation that ExoS may ADP-ribosylate Ras at a second arginine residue poses the possibility that other members of the Ras superfamily that lack the Arg-41 homologue, including Rho and Rab, may be targeted for ADP-ribosylation by ExoS at an arginine residue that corresponds to the second site of ADP-ribosylation within Ras. The ADP-ribosylation of other Ras superfamily members by ExoS is currently under investigation. Neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells is a multistep process that is initiated by NGF binding to the Trk membrane tyrosine kinase. NGF binding stimulates Trk kinase activity, which results in the phosphorylation of several effector molecules that activate Ras. This pathway has both Ras-dependent and -independent components. Several studies have suggested that Ras is a dominant element in the transmission of NGF signals from Trk, including microinjection of antibodies to Ras, which interferes with the signaling pathway (26Szeberenyi J. Neurobiology. 1996; 4: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar), or introduction of dominant inhibitory Ras alleles into PC-12 cells, which inhibits NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, transfection of constitutively active Ras, in the absence of NGF stimulation, is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (26Szeberenyi J. Neurobiology. 1996; 4: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The Ras switch 1 domain is required for this signal transduction process since point mutations within the switch 1 regions of constitutively active RasV12 interfere with neurite outgrowth (21Shirouzu M. Koide H. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Oshio H. Toyama Y. Yamasaki K. Fuhrman S.A. Villafranca E. Kaziro Y. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2153-2157PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that ExoS preferentially modifies Ras at a region adjacent to the switch 1 domain and that infection of PC-12 cells with strains of P. aeruginosa expressing ExoS results in an inhibition of neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells is consistent with the model that ExoS inhibits Ras-mediated signal transduction in vivo. However, since ExoS has the potential to modify a wide variety of targets in vitro, it is conceivable that ExoS can disrupt PC-12 cell signal transduction by the ADP-ribosylation of components of this signal transduction pathway. Future studies will focus on whether ExoS disrupts PC-12 cell signal transduction via modification of other components involved in PC-12 cell signal transduction."

This protein has been purified to greater than 80% homogeneity from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and has been given the name eIF4H. eIF4H was shown to stimulate the in vitro activities of eIF4B and eIF4F in globin synthesis, as well as the in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase activities of eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F. Three tryptic fragments of eIF4H yielded amino acid sequences that were 100% identical to a human sequence found in the GeneBankTM that codes for a previously uncharacterized protein (HUMORFU_1). The calculated molecular weight of the protein encoded by this sequence, its predicted cyanogen bromide fragmentation, and calculated isoelectric point are all consistent with those determined experimentally for eIF4H. Also, the presence of an RNA recognition motif within HUMORFU_1 suggests that eIF4H may interact with mRNA. We conclude that this newly characterized protein, eIF4H, functions to stimulate the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of mRNA utilization, and is encoded by the gene for HUMORFU_1.

Protein synthesis is the process by which an mRNA sequence is translated into protein on ribosomes using aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates. In eukaryotes, this process involves many accessory proteins, which are transiently associated with the ribosome and function either in the initiation, elongation, or termination of protein synthesis. The steps involving delivery of the mRNA to the ribosome and positioning of the first initiating methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: Met-tRNAi, initiator methionyl-tRNA; m7G, 7-methylguanosine; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; 3°, ternary complex; HPLC. high pressure liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEPHGE, nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; SB, standard buffer; RRM, RNA recognition motif. 1The abbreviations used are: Met-tRNAi, initiator methionyl-tRNA; m7G, 7-methylguanosine; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; eEF, eukaryotic elongation factor; 3°, ternary complex; HPLC. high pressure liquid chromatography; IEF, isoelectric focusing; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NEPHGE, nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; SB, standard buffer; RRM, RNA recognition motif. at the AUG start codon is termed initiation. This process involves at least 11 protein initiation factors (for a recent review on translation, see Merrick and Hershey (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar)). The first step in the initiation of the majority of mRNAs is the specific recognition of the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap of the mRNA by the multisubunit complex eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F. eIF4F is composed of three protein subunits, eIF4E (25 kDa), eIF4A (46 kDa), and eIF4G (150 kDa). The interaction of eIF4F with the m7G cap is facilitated specifically through the eIF4E subunit (2Carberry S.E. Friedland D.E. Rhoads R.E. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following binding of the eIF4F complex to the 5′ end of mRNA, the initiation factors eIF4A (46 kDa) and the eIF4B dimer (160 kDa) interact with the mRNA and facilitate “melting” of mRNA secondary structure through the helicase activity of eIF4A (3Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). This mechanism facilitates binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the 5′ end of the mRNA and may also provide the motor for the ATP-dependent process of scanning. The other major step in the initiation of protein synthesis involves binding of the first aminoacyl-tRNA, Met-tRNAi, to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. This is facilitated by the translation factors eIF1A, 2The protein translation factors formerly known as EF-1α, eIF-4C, and EF-1δ have been named eEF1A, eIF1A, and eEF1Bα, respectively, in this article as suggested by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) (see Merrick and Hershey (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar)). This new nomenclature has not yet been approved by the IUBMB. 2The protein translation factors formerly known as EF-1α, eIF-4C, and EF-1δ have been named eEF1A, eIF1A, and eEF1Bα, respectively, in this article as suggested by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) (see Merrick and Hershey (1Merrick W.C.

The Met-tRNAi forms a ternary complex (3°) with eIF2 and GTP (3° = eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi) that will then bind to the 40 S ribosomal subunit to form the 43 S preinitiation complex (40 S·eIF1A·eIF3·3°) (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). The 43 S complex binds to unfolded mRNA near the m7G cap, which may involve an interaction of the complexed eIF3 with the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F (4Joshi B. Yan R. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2048-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 43 S complex “scans” down the mRNA until the initiator AUG codon is recognized by the Met-tRNAi (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). Once the ribosome is in the correct position, eIF5 promotes the hydrolysis of the GTP in the 3° complex to GDP (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar, 5Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol.

A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), causing the release of the 40 S-associated initiation factors and leaving a 40 S·Met-tRNAi·mRNA complex. Subsequently, the 60 S ribosomal subunit joins to form 80 S ribosomes on the mRNA with the Met-tRNAi positioned in the P site of the ribosome (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). In this state, the ribosome is ready to begin the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Many of the factors involved in the initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis as described above have been purified and characterized, although there is still an enormous amount of information not yet known about the details of initiation. The last eukaryotic initiation factor to be biochemically identified and characterized was eIF4F (7Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, several attempts have been made to identify novel initiation factors by genetic studies (8Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Cell. 1992; 69: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Yoon H. Miller S.P. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F.

These studies have yielded several proteins characterized as essential for protein synthesis of uniquely selected mRNA. Several of these were found to code for known translation factors (10Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), while some were found to also have additional primary functions (8Gulyas K.D. Donahue T.F. Cell. 1992; 69: 1031-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here we report the biochemical purification and characterization of a new protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate that stimulates translation. This protein's identity was determined by amino acid sequencing and it was defined as a unique translation factor with a sequence identical to a protein found in the data base of undescribed function. In the following article, the activities and characteristics of this protein, which has been named eIF4H, are described. Reagents were purchased from the following suppliers: rabbit reticulocyte lysate from Green Hectares, Oregon, WI; Sephadex G-75, Sephadex G-75 superfine, and Ultrogel AcA-34 chromatography resins from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; CM-cellulose (type 52), DEAE-cellulose (type 52), and phosphocellulose (type P-11) from Whatman; SynChropak RP-P-100 C-18 reverse phase HPLC column from SynChrom Incorporated; isoelectric focusing (IEF) and high molecular weight SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) standards from Bio-Rad; high and low molecular weight rainbow-labeled SDS-PAGE protein standards from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE) protein standards from Life Technologies, Inc.; polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) and nitrocellulose filters (type HA) from Millipore Corporation; pH 3.5–10 ampholytes from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; pH 7–9 and pH 8–10 ampholytes from Bio-Rad; [14C]leucine and [γ-32P]ATP from NEN Life Science Products; and trypsin, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase from Sigma. Purification of eIF4H follows the standard procedures used to purify protein translation initiation factors (7Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with some modifications and additions as outlined below. All steps in the purification of eIF4H were performed at 4 °C. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h to pellet polysomes. Polysome pellets were then washed and resuspended in a 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA buffer. Solid KCl was added to a 500 mm final concentration to dissociate ribosomes and mRNA from the translation initiation factors. Ribosomes were pelleted at 100,000 ×g for 4 h, and the supernatant, containing initiation factors, was dialyzed against a 150 mm KCl standard buffer (SB) (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 10% glycerol, and applied to a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with this same buffer. Initiation factors eIF2A, eIF3, eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H were eluted with SB + 450 mm KCl + 10% glycerol. Initiation factors in the 450 mm KCl wash, including eIF4H, were further separated within a 5–15% (w/v) sucrose gradient containing 500 mm KCl at 26,000 rpm for 24 h in a Beckman SW28 rotor. In this step, the large eIF3 complex (16 S) could be purified away from the other initiation factors which sediment more slowly. The factors eIF4F, eIF4B, eIF2A, and eIF4H were then separated by size using an Ultrogel AcA-34 gel filtration column equilibrated with SB + 500 mm KCl + 25% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. At this point, 25% glycerol was necessary to help stabilize eIF4H, which was found to lose activity rapidly over time in the standard 10% glycerol buffer used previously. Next, eIF4H was passed over DEAE- and CM-cellulose in SB + 50 mm KCl + 25% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, both of which do not bind eIF4H, to remove the majority of the contaminants and eIF2A. Finally, eIF4H was purified from higher molecular weight contaminants using a Sephadex G-75 superfine column equilibrated with SB + 50 mm KCl + 25% glycerol at a flow rate of 4 ml/h resulting in a final product which was ∼80% pure for eIF4H as determined by SDS-PAGE (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). Separating gels used were 12.5% acrylamide (unless otherwise noted) and 0.213% bisacrylamide (ratio acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 58.7:1). The native molecular weight of eIF4H was determined by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex G-75 column and standards of known molecular weight. The column was equilibrated in HSB (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA) + 100 mm KCl + 25% glycerol and developed at a flow rate of 8 ml/h. The elution volume (Ve) for eIF4H was determined by assaying fractions in a globin synthesis assay deficient in eIF4B and eIF4F as well as by SDS-PAGE. The Ve for the standards was determined by SDS-PAGE and Kav was calculated as described previously (13Freifelder D. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1982: 242-243Google Scholar). The native molecular weight of eIF4H was interpolated from a standard curve of the Kav versus the log of the molecular weight. Initiation factors were analyzed in a reconstituted rabbit reticulocyte lysate system lacking eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H, by measuring the incorporation of [14C]leucine into newly synthesized globin as described previously (7Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Merrick W.C.

Briefly, 50-μl reactions contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, purified elongation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomes, globin mRNA, tRNA, 80 μm amino acids (minus leucine), 0.3 μCi of [14C]leucine (specific activity, 320 μCi/μmol), 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.34 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate. The remaining initiation factors (eIF1A, eIF2, eIF4A, eIF5, and eIF5A) were added to the assay in partially purified form as fractions from phosphocellulose, except for eIF3, which was added in its purified form from sucrose gradients. The incorporation of [14C]leucine into hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was measured after a 20-min incubation at 37 °C by scintillation spectrometry. The amounts of initiation factors eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H added are given in the legend of Table I.Table IDependency of the globin synthesis assay of eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4HFactor additions[14C]Leu incorporatedRelative activitypmol%None3.917+ eIF4H4.620+ eIF4F6.428+ eIF4B12.052+ eIF4B + eIF4F23.0100+ eIF4B + eIF4F + eIF4H30.1131 Open table in a new tab Combinations of the initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4F, eIF4B, and eIF4H were used to investigate RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis by measuring the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (15Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μl reactions contained 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Mg(CH3CO2)2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 2000–4000 cpm/pmol), and various concentrations and combinations of initiation factors. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and 32Pi release was quantitated by organic extraction.

The membrane was stained for 5 min in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.5 mm Coomassie Brilliant Blue and then destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Finally, the membrane was washed several times in double distilled H2O to remove any remaining glycine, and the 25-kDa band (eIF4H) was cut out and subjected to analysis using an Applied Biosystems amino acid analyzer, or amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise protein sequencer (Molecular Biology Core Laboratory, Case Western Reserve University). Cyanogen bromide digestion was performed as follows. Approximately 18 μg (∼500 pmol) of eIF4H were precipitated in 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid on ice for 45 min, and then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at full speed (14,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was allowed to air-dry and then washed twice with ice-cold acetone and air-dried again. Afterward, the protein was resuspended in 70% formic acid containing 500 μg of CNBr and allowed to digest for 16 h at room temperature in the dark. Ten volumes of double distilled H2O were added, and the sample was lyophilized to remove formic acid. This was repeated two more times to remove as much formic acid as possible. The peptides were dissolved in SDS-gel sample buffer, neutralized with Tris (pH 9), then loaded onto an 18% polyacrylamide SDS-gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described above. For tryptic digestion, approximately 50 μg (∼1400 pmol) of eIF4H was digested with 0.5 μg of trypsin in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl for 2–3 h at 37 °C in a 40 μl reaction. Then an additional 0.5 μg of trypsin was added, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 37 °C. The sample was diluted with 300 μl of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, applied to a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column, and peptides were eluted with a 4.5-h 0–50% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid gradient. Peaks were detected at both 220 and 280 nm, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Major UV-absorbing peaks were chosen and concentrated under vacuum prior to amino acid sequencing. Purified eIF4H was prepared for two-dimensional electrophoresis by lyophilization and resuspension in sample buffer containing 2% CHAPS, 9.8 murea, 100 mm DTT, and 2% ampholytes (pH 3.5–10). Approximately 0.5 μg of eIF4H was analyzed in the first dimension on a 7.5-cm tube gel using a Hoefer SE 220 minigel tube gel adapter. Tube gels for IEF contained 3% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 20:1), 2% Nonidet P-40, 2.2% ampholytes (an equal mixture of pH 3.5–10, 7–9, and 8–10 ampholytes), and 9.8 m urea. The gel was preelectrophoresed for 30 min at 500 V, and then the sample was loaded and electrophoresed toward the anode for 195 min at 500 V. The upper reservoir (cathode) buffer was 40 mm NaOH and the lower reservoir (anode) buffer was 40 mm o-phosphoric acid. For NEPHGE, the tube gels were similar to those used for IEF, except that the ampholyte concentration was reduced to 1.66% and was an equal mixture of pH 3.5–10 and 8–10 ampholytes. The upper reservoir (anode) buffer used was 40 mm o-phosphoric acid and the lower reservoir (cathode) buffer was 40 mm NaOH. The gels were not preelectrophoresed and electrophoresis was toward the cathode for 70 min at 500 V. Prior to electrophoresis in the second dimension, the tube gels were equilibrated for 15 min in 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. The gels were fixed to the top of 8 × 10 × 1.5-cm polyacrylamide slab gels with 1% agarose containing 24 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 200 mmglycine, 0.1% SDS. The second dimension gels were poured without a stacking gel and were 15% polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1), 375 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 0.1% SDS. Electrophoresis was in buffer as described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar) at 35 mA for 40 min. Following electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by silver staining, as described by Blum et al. (16Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 2897-2905Crossref Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins were prepared as described previously (17Hardy S.J. Kurland C.G. Voynow P. Mora G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) with a few modifications as described below. Two hundredA260 units of polysomes were pelleted through a 1.0 m sucrose cushion containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, and 1 mmEDTA for 5 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman type 75Ti rotor at 4 °C. The polysome pellet was resuspended in a 0.25 msucrose solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, and 1 mmEDTA. Twenty A260 units of the sucrose-washed polysomes were treated with two volumes of glacial acetic acid and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. RNA was pelleted by centrifugation in a Microfuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatant was treated with five volumes of acetone and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The ribosomal proteins were pelleted in a Microfuge at 14,000 rpm 30 min and resuspended in 100 μl of IEF buffer (2% CHAPS, 9.8 murea, 100 mm DTT, 2% ampholytes (pH 3.5–10)), and 7.5 μl of polysomal proteins were loaded onto the gel. During the purification of eIF4B and eIF4F from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, an additional protein possessing translational activity was identified on the basis of its ability to stimulate protein translation in anin vitro globin synthesis assay deficient in eIF4B and eIF4F (Fig. 1). This new activity was found to elute from an Ultrogel AcA-34 gel filtration column later than eIF4F and eIF4B. This factor has been named eIF4H based on its various activities associated with mRNA utilization in protein translation, as will be described in this article. During further rounds of purification, eIF4H's stimulatory activity was found to be unstable in the standard buffers containing 10% glycerol, which may explain why the factor was not identified earlier. Subsequent steps employed buffers containing 25% glycerol, which have been used previously in the purification of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 1A to maintain its stability and activity (18Carvalho J.F. Carvalho M.D. Merrick W.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purification of eIF4H by its activity, as described under “Methods,” resulted in a greater than 80% pure preparation containing a polypeptide band with an apparent molecular weight of 25 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A), and a native molecular mass of 36.75 kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2 B). This discrepancy in size may indicate that the native protein has a nonglobular, asymmetric conformation, therefore affecting its mobility on the column.Figure 2Analysis of the molecular mass of eIF4H.

Standards: bovine serum albumin (BSA) = 67 kDa; ovalbumin = 45 kDa, soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) = 20.1 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether or not eIF4H is a unique translation factor, it was compared by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 A) to other previously characterized low molecular mass (<40 kDa) initiation factor peptides. eIF4H was found to migrate differently than the other factors shown: eIF1A (17 kDa), eIF4E (25 kDa subunit of eIF4F), and the α (35 kDa), β (36 kDa), and γ (40 kDa) subunits of the eIF3 complex. eIF4H was also found to differ from eIF6 (25 kDa) by its interactions with DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose: eIF4H bound to phosphocellulose and not to DEAE-cellulose, while eIF6 has been reported to not bind to phosphocellulose but does bind to DEAE-cellulose (19Valenzuela D.M. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7712-7719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Raychaudhuri P. Stringer E.A. Valenzuela D.M. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11195-11930Google Scholar). Purified eIF4H was found to barely stimulate protein synthesis (18% increase over background), if at all, in a globin synthesis assay deficient in eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF4H (Table I). This low activity was different than that which had initially been seen during purification of eIF4H on the AcA-34 column (230% increase over background, Fig. 1). These fractions, though, may have been contaminated with small amounts of eIF4B, which then contributed to the higher levels of activity seen. When assayed at saturating levels, eIF4F by itself stimulated globin synthesis slightly better than eIF4H (Table I), while eIF4B stimulated synthesis by 3-fold over background. The combination of eIF4B + eIF4F increased activity by an additional 2-fold over that seen with eIF4B alone, and the combination of all three factors, eIF4B + eIF4F + eIF4H, led to an additional 30% increase in globin synthesis over that seen with eIF4B + eIF4F only. Although eIF4H appears to stimulate protein synthesis only mildly in Table I, Fig. 3 A shows that eIF4H dramatically stimulates (300–400% increase) globin synthesis when titrated into reactions containing subsaturating levels of eIF4B (0.3 μg). This significant stimulation of activity confirms that eIF4H is not eIF4B, and may also explain the higher activity seen for eIF4H-containing fractions during purification if these contained small amounts of eIF4B. Fig. 3 B shows a similar titration curve of eIF4B with an amount of eIF4H that stimulates eIF4B's activity well (0.7 μg). In this titration experiment, it can be seen that there is little stimulation of activity at saturating levels of eIF4B (>2.5 μg), which is similar to the lower stimulation seen in Table I using saturating levels of eIF4B and eIF4F. The dramatic stimulation seen at subsaturating levels of eIF4B suggests that eIF4H does function as a stimulatory factor in protein synthesis and that it may function in the same steps in initiation as eIF4B and eIF4F; however, eIF4H is not a cap-binding protein due to its inability to bind to a m7GTP-Sepharose column (data not shown). To further identify eIF4H's function in translation, this protein was examined in an RNA-dependent ATPase assay (Table II). This model initiation assay measures indirectly the interactions of eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F, with mRNA and ATP. Previously, eIF4A and eIF4F have been shown to possess ATPase activity in the presence of RNA, which is stimulated by eIF4B, and the activity is maximal when all three of these factors are present (15Grifo J.A. Abramson R.D. Satler C.A. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8648-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed using 2 μg of eIF4A and subsaturating levels of eIF4B and eIF4F to stimulate eIF4A's RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity (Table II, column 3). As expected, eIF4A displayed limited RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity (50% increase in the activity seen without poly(A) added) that was stimulated by the addition of eIF4B (3.5-fold increase) and maximal when all three factors (eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F) were present (13.8-fold increase over eIF4A alone). When eIF4H was analyzed in the assay, we found that it had minimal ATPase activity either alone or in the presence of mRNA (Table II, row 1). Yet when eIF4H was added to ATPase assays containing various combinations of the initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F, the RNA-dependent ATPase activities of all combinations of these initiation factors were increased (Table II, last column). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that eIF4H stimulates the activities of the initiation factors eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4F during the steps involving mRNA binding and utilization in the initiation of protein synthesis. As with the globin synthesis assay, titration curves of eIF4F and eIF4B in the RN"
https://openalex.org/W2007067622,"The axonal guidance signal semaphorin D is a member of a large family of proteins characterized by the presence of a highly conserved semaphorin domain of about 500 amino acids. The vertebrate semaphorins can be divided into four different classes that contain both secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Here we show that class III (SemD) and class IV semaphorins (SemB) form homodimers linked by intermolecular disulfide bridges. In addition to the 95-kDa form of SemD (SemD(95k)), proteolytic processing of SemD creates a 65-kDa isoform (SemD(65k)) that lacks the 33-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain. Although SemD(95k) formed dimers, the removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain resulted in the dissociation of SemD homodimers to monomeric SemD(65k). Mutation of cysteine 723, one of four conserved cysteine residues in the 33-kDa fragment, revealed its requirement both for the dimerization of SemD and its chemorepulsive activity. We suggest that dimerization is a general feature of sema- phorins which depends on class-specific sequences and is important for their function."
https://openalex.org/W2148168744,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pleiotropic cytokine that elicits a large number of biological effects. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms that are responsible for the TNF-α effects remain largely unknown. We have previously demonstrated that cultured mouse Sertoli cells, after TNF-α treatment, increase the surface expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production (Riccioli, A., Filippini, A., De Cesaris, P., Barbacci, E., Stefanini, M., Starace, G., and Ziparo, E. (1995) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.</i> 92, 5808–5812). Here, we show that, in cultured Sertoli cells, TNF-α activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (p38, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases) as revealed by an increased phosphorylation of p38, activating transcription factor-2, c-Jun, and Elk-1. Furthermore, our data indicate that the biological effects induced by TNF-α in Sertoli cells (enhancement of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and IL-6 expression) depend on the activation of different signaling pathways. SB203580, a highly specific p38 inhibitor, does not affect ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, but strongly inhibits IL-6 production. Moreover, interferon-γ, which up-regulates adhesion molecule expression and reduces IL-6 production, does not induce phosphorylation of p38. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that, in response to TNF-α, activation of p38 leads to IL-6 production, whereas ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression could be induced by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2080142147,"CD95 is a potent inducer of apoptosis. It activates the caspase cascade, but also induces ceramide (Cer) production, reportedly involving acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) activity. A role for Cer as a second messenger for apoptosis induction was proposed, based on the finding that synthetic Cer analogues can induce cell death. We have tested whether aSMase is required for 1) apoptosis induction and 2) Cer production by CD95. For this purpose, we have used cultured Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) lymphoid cells with a defined mutation (R600H) in the aSMase protein. Despite their inherited deficiency of aSMase, we found that these cells readily undergo apoptosis upon CD95 stimulation. After retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the aSMase cDNA, the transduced (i.e.“corrected”) NPD cells showed neither increased levels of apoptosis nor altered kinetics of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction as compared with empty vector-transduced cells. The slow sustained elevation of Cer levels in response to CD95, which we have previously documented for Jurkat T cells (Tepper, A. D., Boesen-de Cock, J. G. R., de Vries, E., Borst, J., and van Blitterswijk, W. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 24308–24312), was similarly found in NPD cells. Moreover, the kinetics of Cer formation remained unaffected after aSMase transduction. These results indicate that this Cer does not result from aSMase activity. We conclude that aSMase is not required for and does not facilitate CD95-mediated apoptosis and that it is not responsible for the late Cer response. CD95 is a potent inducer of apoptosis.

However, data are conflicting with regard to the kinetics of the Cer response and the sphingomyelinase(s) involved. One group reported that TNF-R1 couples through its death domain via a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C to acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase), which gives rise to a modest increase in Cer levels within minutes after receptor triggering (15Schütze S.

To investigate whether aSMase is required for CD95-induced apoptosis and Cer generation, we have used Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts from an NPD patient, which have a defined point mutation in the aSMase gene and lack detectable aSMase activity (29Santana P. Pen̆a L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

These cells were reconstituted with the aSMase cDNA by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, and CD95 responses in aSMase-deficient and -proficient cells were compared. From our studies, we conclude that aSMase plays no role in CD95-induced caspase activation and apoptosis induction. Moreover, Cer production took place irrespective of functional aSMase expression. l-[3-14C]Serine (54.0 mCi/mmol), [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (56.0 mCi/mmol), the enhanced chemiluminescence kit, and protein G-Sepharose beads were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The Bradford protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. The DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent was from Boehringer Mannheim. Silica Gel 60 TLC plates were from Merck. Puromycin was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll (Dassel, Germany). Anti-CD95 mAb CH-11 was purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Mouse anti-human caspase-3 mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig and swine anti-rabbit Ig were obtained from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat Ig was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-caspase-8 serum was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 2–20 of human caspase-8. Specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by immunoblotting of detergent lysates of COS-7 cells transfected with the human caspase-8 cDNA (8Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K.

The 12CA5 mAb directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was used as hybridoma supernatant (32Field J. Nikawa J.I. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I.A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Drs. K. Ferlinz and K. Sandhoff (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, Bonn, Germany). The EBV-transformed B cell line derived from NPD patient MS1418 is homozygous for a nucleotide substitution at position 1799 of G to A, which changes the normal arginine at residue 600 in the aSMase protein (25Schuchman E.H.

The EBV-transformed B cell line JY was used as a control. Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA cloned into the pMT2 expression vector according to the DEAE-dextran method (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The LZRS-pBMN-lacZ vector was kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) (35Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). We have used a modified version of this vector in which the lacZ gene was replaced by a linker region, an IRES sequence, and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) cDNA as described by Heemskerk et al. (36Heemskerk M.H.M. Blom B. Nolan G. Stegmann A.P.A. Bakker A.Q. Weijer K. Res P.C.M. Spits H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The aSMase cDNA (25Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Sandhoff. An HA tag, a new stop codon, and anEcoRV site for blunt cloning were added to the 3′-end of the aSMase cDNA before cloning into the EcoRI and SnaBI sites of the linker. The correct sequence was checked by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. Plasmid LZRS-aSMase-IRES-eGFP or empty vector was transfected into the FNX-Ampho producer cell line (kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Nolan) by calcium phosphate precipitation (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Virus-containing supernatants from the producer cell lines were collected, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until further use. MS1418 and JY cells were transduced at a density of 0.5 × 106/ml of virus-containing supernatant in the presence of 10 μg/ml DOTAP. After overnight incubation, the supernatant was removed, and cells were cultured in fresh medium. eGFP-expressing cells were sorted on a FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA). Experiments were performed with cell populations consisting of >80% green fluorescent cells. In vitro aSMase activity was assayed as described by Wiegmann et al. (16Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Cells (10 × 106/sample) were collected and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.2% Triton X-100 and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 50 μg of protein (as determined with a Bradford protein assay kit) was assayed for aSMase activity using [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin at pH 5.0. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Radioactive phosphocholine in the aqueous phase was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cer levels were measured as described previously (24Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106/ml) were labeled to equilibrium with l-[3-14C]serine (0.2 μCi/ml) for 48 h in synthetic Yssel's medium (37Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Koken M. van Blitterswijk W.J. Spits H.J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in Yssel's medium and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml. Following stimulation with 500 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb CH-11, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Total lipid was spotted on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates. After chromatography, radioactive lipids were visualized and quantitated using a Fuji BAS 2000 TR phosphoimager and identified using external lipid standards. Cer was expressed relative to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine levels, which remained unaltered upon stimulation. Cells were incubated overnight in Yssel's medium, seeded at 1 × 106/ml, and stimulated with anti-CD95 mAb CH-11 at the indicated concentrations at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for different time periods. All assays were performed in duplicate. To measure nuclear fragmentation, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. In this lysis buffer, the nuclei remain intact. Fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide-stained DNA was determined on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson Advanced Cellular Biology), and data were analyzed using Lysys software. Segmented apoptotic nuclei are recognized in this assay by subdiploid DNA content (38Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). To measure propidium iodide uptake, cells were stimulated, washed, and suspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2 containing 1 mg/ml glucose and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Propidium iodide (final concentration of 5 μg/ml) was added immediately before analysis, and propidium iodide-stained cells were analyzed on the FACScan. After overnight incubation in Yssel's medium, cells were seeded at 10 × 106/ml and incubated with 500 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb CH-11 for the indicated time periods at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (0.01 mtriethanolamine HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were mixed with concentrated reducing SDS sample buffer. Equivalents of 106 cells/lane were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with anti-caspase-3 mAb at 10 μg/ml or with anti-caspase-8 serum at a 1:500 dilution in TBST with 1% nonfat dry milk. After subsequent incubation with a 1:7500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig or swine anti-rabbit Ig, respectively, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation, Nonidet P-40 lysates were cleared with normal goat serum and protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated with 2 μl of goat anti-human aSMase serum and protein G-Sepharose beads. Protein isolates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting was performed as described above with 12CA5 hybridoma supernatant (anti-HA tag) or anti-aSMase serum at a dilution of 1:500. Antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (1:7500) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat Ig (1:2000), respectively. To determine the contribution of aSMase to the CD95 response, we used an EBV-transformed B cell line derived from NPD patient MS1418 (29Santana P. Pen̆a L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), with or without the retrovirally transduced human aSMase cDNA. As a control, we used the EBV-transformed B cell line JY. Fig. 1 shows that the aSMase gene transfer was effective. The HA-tagged cDNA product could readily be detected in anti-aSMase immunoprecipitates from aSMase-transduced MS1418 and JY cells as well as in whole cell lysates of transfected COS-7 cells. Its size of ∼70 kDa corresponds to that of the mature protein as described (33Hurwitz R. Ferlinz K. Vielhaber G. Moczall H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5440-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also immunoblotted anti-aSMase immunoprecipitates with anti-aSMase serum to detect endogenous protein. Endogenous aSMase levels appeared to be very low. No signal was observed in JY cells, whereas a very weak band migrating at the same position as the cDNA product was detected in the MS1418 cells (Fig. 1). Since MS1418 carries a point mutation in the aSMase gene, these cells may well express a nonfunctional protein. From the immunoblot analysis, we conclude that gene transduction elevates aSMase protein levels by at least a factor of 10 in both NPD and JY cells. To check whether the transduced cDNA product was functional, we determined aSMase activity in whole cell lysates in vitro. In line with the NPD phenotype, aSMase activity in empty vector-transduced MS1418 cells was much lower than in wild-type JY cells and hardly exceeded background levels. In aSMase-transduced cells, enzymatic activity was dramatically increased (Fig. 2). Morover triggering of the CD95 receptor did not alter aSMase activity in either NPD or JY cells. It appears from the data depicted in Table Iand Fig. 6 that the transduced aSMase is also active in situ. In aSMase-transduced cells, basal Cer levels were elevated, whereas sphingomyelin levels were reduced as compared with those in empty vector-transduced cells.Table IaSMase transduction alters basal Cer and sphingomyelin levels in NPD and JY lymphoblastsCellsCeramideSphingomyelinVectoraSMaseVectoraSMaseNPD45 ± 360 ± 5140 ± 1131 ± 2JY100 ± 3118 ± 5100 ± 192 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 6aSMase is dispensable for CD95-induced Cer formation. NPD MS1418 (left) and JY (right) cells, transduced with empty vector (circles) or aSMase cDNA (squares), were labeled withl-[3-14C]serine to equilibrium. Lipids of stimulated (500 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb CH-11; filled symbols) or untreated (open symbols) cells were extracted and separated by TLC, and labeled Cer was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data (means ± S.D.) represent two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess the contribution of aSMase to CD95-induced apoptosis, we compared the sensitivity of NPD and JY cells to anti-CD95 mAb CH-11. It appeared that aSMase-deficient MS1418 cells readily undergo apoptosis in response to CD95 ligation. Propidium iodide uptake (Fig. 3 A) and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3 B) profiles of NPD cells were very similar to those obtained with JY cells. Apparently, functional aSMase is not an absolute requirement for CD95-induced apoptosis. To examine whether aSMase facilitated CD95-induced apoptosis, we compared the sensitivity of parental and aSMase-reconstituted MS1418 cells (Fig. 4). The presence of aSMase had no effect on the kinetics of apoptosis induction (Fig. 4, upper panels) or on the sensitivity of the cells to CD95 stimulation (lower panels). Similar results were found in JY cells, where the apoptotic response was also not altered by aSMase overexpression (Fig. 4, upper and lower panels). From these experiments, we conclude that aSMase activity is not required for and does not influence CD95-induced apoptosis in lymphoblasts.Figure 4aSMase does not affect apoptosis induction in response to CD95 triggering. Empty vector-transduced (□ and ▨) or aSMase-transduced (▨ and ▪) NPD MS1418 (left panels) and JY (right panels) cells were left untreated or were stimulated with 500 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb, and apoptosis was measured at the indicated time points (upper panels). Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of anti-CD95 mAb CH-11, and apoptosis was measured after 6 h (lower panels). Propidium iodide-stained nuclei were prepared according to Nicoletti et al. (38Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar), and apoptosis was analyzed on a FACScan. Data are representative of three independent experiments and show the means ± S.D. from duplicate samples in one experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since apoptosis is the biological end point of CD95 signaling, we also examined the possible effects of aSMase on the induction phase of the apoptotic process, i.e. caspase activation. We analyzed whether aSMase influenced proteolytic processing of caspase-8 and caspase-3, as these proteases are activated upon CD95 triggering in lymphoid cells (12Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K.

Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). It is shown in Fig. 5 that no difference in caspase-8 processing was observed between empty vector- and aSMase-transduced MS1418 cells. Similarly, caspase-3 processing proceeded with the same kinetics and efficiency in the presence and absence of aSMase. Also, overexpression of aSMase in JY cells had no effect on these responses. We conclude that aSMase is not required for and does not influence activation of at least two key members of the caspase cascade induced by CD95. We have previously shown that in Jurkat cells, CD95 stimulation induces a slow and sustained increase in Cer levels (24Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This “late” Cer response remains largely unaffected upon inhibition of caspase function and apoptosis induction by the tetrapeptide inhibitor DEVD-CHO (24Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that Cer may participate in the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, it was relevant to investigate Cer formation upon CD95 ligation in aSMase-deficient NPD cells. Fig. 6 shows that upon CD95 stimulation, Cer levels gradually increased to the same extent and with similar kinetics in both MS1418 and JY cells, irrespective of the presence of a functional aSMase. We conclude that CD95 induces late Cer formation in which aSMase is not involved. While aSMase is important for sphingolipid turnover in cells, its contribution to signal transduction is questionable. It was suggested that Cer resulting from aSMase activity signals to the NF-κB transcription factor upon TNF-R1 stimulation (15Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been established that in aSMase-deficient fibroblasts from NPD patients or gene-targeted mice, NF-κB induction by TNF-R1 occurs normally, clearly ruling out a function for aSMase in this signaling pathway (39Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16474-16481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With the study reported here, we also question the role of aSMase in signaling to apoptosis by CD95. Consistent with our previous work in Jurkat T cells (24Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the EBV-transformed B cells studied here have a late Cer response, but lack the CD95-induced “rapid Cer response,” which has been attributed to aSMase (22Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD95-induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and apoptosis is the same in the presence or absence of aSMase, clearly excluding aSMase from the CD95 signaling pathway leading to apoptosis, at least in lymphoid cell. Whether aSMase plays a role in CD95-induced apoptosis in other cell types should be evaluated in aSMase-deficient mice. In contrast to CD95-mediated apoptosis (this work and Refs. 23Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and 24Tepper A.D.

Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.

In irradiated aSMase-deficient human lymphoblasts and aSMase−/− mice, both this Cer response and apoptosis induction were severely impeded, whereas aSMase reconstitution restored responsiveness (29Santana P. Pen̆a L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Apparently, radiation-induced apoptosis, unlike CD95-induced apoptosis, requires aSMase. In radiation-induced apoptosis, Cer has been reported to signal to c-Jun kinase (42Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.-H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), which may couple to the caspase cascade. CD95, however, directly activates the caspase cascade. This may explain differences in the requirement for secondary signals. We have previously reported that CD95-induced Cer formation is not blocked by caspase-3 inhibition (24Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that this slow Cer response contributes to signaling to apoptosis. We now know that this Cer formation does not involve aSMase. Apparently, it results either from a neutral sphingomyelinase activity or fromde novo biosynthesis. In either case, evaluation of the role of Cer in apoptosis induction is important and can be accomplished by attenuation of Cer levels using pharmacological or genetic approaches. We are aware that others have found apoptosis resistance in MS1418 cells. We have been informed that the MS1418 line is subject to phenotypic changes upon continuous in vitro culture. However, we have confirmed the aSMase gene mutation (R600H) and unambigously shown the aSMase deficiency of the cells used in this study. We thank Drs. K. Ferlinz, K. Sandhoff, G. P. Nolan, and H.

https://openalex.org/W2003566015,"Hepatitis delta antigens (HDAgs) are important for the replication and assembly of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). To understand the association between HDAgs and cellular proteins and the mechanism of viral multiplication, we have studied the interaction between HDAgs and nucleolin, a major nucleolar phosphoprotein. The interaction between HDAgs and nucleolin was first demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining studies. HDAgs and endogenous nucleolin were colocalized in the nucleoli of cultured cells transfected with plasmids encoding the small and large HDAg. Coimmunoprecipitation results indicated that the NH2-terminal domain of HDAg was essential for its binding to nucleolin. In vitro ligand binding assays revealed two nucleolin binding sites, NBS1 and NBS2. Each spanned amino acid residues 35-50 and 51-65, respectively, with a conserved core sequence K(K/R)XK. HDV replication was modulated by exogenous human nucleolin. In addition, a small HDAg mutant S-d65/75, which possesses both NBS1 and NBS2, was capable of transactivating HDV replication, whereas the small HDAg mutant S-d50/75, which retained NBS1 but not NBS2, was unable to support the replication of HDV. Thus, the nucleolin binding activity of HDAg is critical for its nucleolar targeting and is involved in the modulation of HDV replication."
https://openalex.org/W1974015253,"High affinity iron uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a metal reductase, a multicopper ferroxidase, and an iron permease. Fet3, the apparent ferroxidase, is proposed to facilitate iron uptake by catalyzing the oxidation of reductase-generated Fe(II) to Fe(III) by O2; in this model, Fe(III) is the substrate for the iron permease, encoded by FTR1 (Kaplan, J., and O'Halloran, T. V. (1996)Science 271, 1510–1512). We show here that dioxygen also plays an essential role in the expression of these iron uptake activities. Cells grown anaerobically exhibited no Fe(III) reductase or high affinity iron uptake activity, even if assayed for these activities under air. Northern blot analysis showed that the amount of those mRNAs encoding proteins associated with this uptake was repressed in anaerobic cultures but was rapidly induced by exposure of the culture to dioxygen. The anaerobic repression was reduced in cells expressing an iron-independent form of the trans-activator, Aft1, a protein that regulates the expression of these proteins. Thus, the effect of oxygenation on this expression appeared due at least in part to the state or distribution of iron in the cells. In support of this hypothesis, the membrane-permeant Fe(II) chelator, 2,2′-bipyridyl, in contrast to the impermeant chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate, caused a strong and rapid induction of these transcripts under anaerobic conditions. An increase in the steady-state levels of iron-regulated transcripts upon oxygenation or 2,2′-bipyridyl addition occurred within 5 min, indicating that a relatively small, labile intracellular pool of Fe(II) regulates the expression of these activities. The strength of the anaerobic repression was dependent on the low affinity, Fe(II)-specific iron transporter, encoded by FET4, suggesting that this Fe(II) pool was linked in part to iron brought into the cell via Fet4 protein. The data suggest a model in which dioxygen directly or indirectly modulates the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio in an iron pool linked to Aft1 protein while bipyridyl increases this ratio by chelating Fe(II). These results indicate that dioxygen both modulates the sensitivity to iron-dependent transcriptional regulation and acts as substrate for Fet3 in the ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by this ceruloplasmin homologue. High affinity iron uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a metal reductase, a multicopper ferroxidase, and an iron permease. Fet3, the apparent ferroxidase, is proposed to facilitate iron uptake by catalyzing the oxidation of reductase-generated Fe(II) to Fe(III) by O2; in this model, Fe(III) is the substrate for the iron permease, encoded by FTR1 (Kaplan, J., and O'Halloran, T. V. (1996)Science 271, 1510–1512). We show here that dioxygen also plays an essential role in the expression of these iron uptake activities. Cells grown anaerobically exhibited no Fe(III) reductase or high affinity iron uptake activity, even if assayed for these activities under air. Northern blot analysis showed that the amount of those mRNAs encoding proteins associated with this uptake was repressed in anaerobic cultures but was rapidly induced by exposure of the culture to dioxygen. The anaerobic repression was reduced in cells expressing an iron-independent form of the trans-activator, Aft1, a protein that regulates the expression of these proteins. Thus, the effect of oxygenation on this expression appeared due at least in part to the state or distribution of iron in the cells. In support of this hypothesis, the membrane-permeant Fe(II) chelator, 2,2′-bipyridyl, in contrast to the impermeant chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate, caused a strong and rapid induction of these transcripts under anaerobic conditions. An increase in the steady-state levels of iron-regulated transcripts upon oxygenation or 2,2′-bipyridyl addition occurred within 5 min, indicating that a relatively small, labile intracellular pool of Fe(II) regulates the expression of these activities. The strength of the anaerobic repression was dependent on the low affinity, Fe(II)-specific iron transporter, encoded by FET4, suggesting that this Fe(II) pool was linked in part to iron brought into the cell via Fet4 protein. The data suggest a model in which dioxygen directly or indirectly modulates the Fe(III)/Fe(II) ratio in an iron pool linked to Aft1 protein while bipyridyl increases this ratio by chelating Fe(II). These results indicate that dioxygen both modulates the sensitivity to iron-dependent transcriptional regulation and acts as substrate for Fet3 in the ferroxidase reaction catalyzed by this ceruloplasmin homologue.

One of the striking features of this pathway is the involvement of a protein, encoded byFET3, that is homologous to the multicopper oxidases, ceruloplasmin, and ascorbate oxidase (5Askwith C. Eide D.

Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Ftr1 contains a REGLE motif that is homologous to a functionally essential feature of mammalian ferritin thought to be involved in the trafficking of Fe(III) from the ferroxidase center to the site of iron core formation in that protein (10Levi S.

The apparently obligate role of Fet3 in high affinity iron accumulation in yeast directly links the iron status of the cell to its copper status: copper-deficient yeast are also iron-deficient because the apo-Fet3 found in copper-deficient cells is inactive with respect to its essential role in iron uptake (4Dancis A.

That is, the identification of the role that Fet3 appears to play in iron accumulation in yeast and its homology to ceruloplasmin has provided support for the hypothesis that the ferroxidase activity exhibited by ceruloplasmin is integral to this protein's role in mammalian iron metabolism (8Stearman R.

The initial step in iron uptake in yeast is the reduction of medium Fe(III) to Fe(II) by plasma membrane metal reductases (1Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major reductase is encoded by FRE1. This Fe(II) is suggested to be the substrate for Fet3, which reoxidizes it to Fe(III) coupled to a four-electron reduction of O2 (7de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9de Silva D. Davis-Kaplan S. Fergestad J. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this model, the Fe(III) is taken into the cell via Ftr1 (8Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 13Askwith C.C. de Silva D. Kaplan J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Evidence for this model is that yeast plasma membranes containing active Fet3 are reported to consume O2 in an Fe(II)-dependent manner with an Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry of 4:1, consistent with Equation 1 (7de Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This equation describes the ferroxidase reaction previously demonstrated to be catalyzed by ceruloplasmin (14Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fet3 also possesses a ferroxidase activity (9de Silva D. Davis-Kaplan S. Fergestad J. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

In this report we test the hypothesis that the state of cell aerobiosis also regulates the expression of iron uptake activity in yeast, as for example, it regulates the expression of respiratory function in this organism (15Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, we show that anaerobically grown yeast do not express genes that encode proteins associated with high affinity iron uptake in yeast. The data indicate that this regulation by culture anaerobiosis involves Aft1, a putative trans-activator known to regulate the expression of genes associated with high affinity uptake in an iron-dependent manner (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar,17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These genes are proposed to constitute the iron “regulon” in yeast (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which Aft1 modulates expression of these genes is not precisely known, in vivo DNA footprinting does indicate Aft1 binds to a consensus ciselement in the 5′-untranslated region of these several loci in iron-depleted cells and not in iron-replete ones. This suggests, although does not prove, the simple model that iron binding to Aft1 in iron-replete cells blocks Aft1-DNA binding and resultingtrans-activation (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We show also that the mRNA species corresponding to the proteins of the high affinity iron uptake pathway accumulate within 5 min following reoxygenation of an anaerobic culture, or addition of a membrane-permeant Fe(II) chelator to anaerobic cells. This result, together with the fact that this expression pattern is modulated in part by Aft1 activity, suggests that a small, labile Fe(II) pool in the cell mediates this regulation also. These observations indicate that high affinity iron uptake by yeast is regulated in two ways by dioxygen. Not only is O2 a substrate essential for this uptake, but its absence or presence in the growth medium modulates the expression of this uptake activity. Wild type strain DEY1457 (MATα ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3), DEY1422 (DEY1457 fet4::LEU2), and DEY1422T2 (DEY1457 fet4::LEU2 GAL4p-FET4) were obtained from D. Eide (18Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter strain expresses Fet4 protein from the GAL promoter when grown in galactose but is Fet4− when grown in glucose (18Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARY1458 (ftr1Δ) was constructed in DEY1457 using a fragment of FTR1 disrupted by TRP1 (8Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) while ARY1459 (aft1Δ) was constructed in DEY1457 using a fragment of AFT1 disrupted by TRP1 (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cultures of these strains were grown in YPD (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose) to early log phase (A660 nm = 1.0). Also, DEY1457(pT14) and ARY1458(pT14) were prepared by transformation of the two parental strains with plasmid pT14, aCEN-containing vector (YCp50) that expresses a genetically dominant, gain-of-function iron-independent allele of Aft1 protein designated Aft1-1 up (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Experiments using these transformants were performed in synthetic selective medium (minus uracil) containing 10 μm each copper and iron (19Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cultures grown anaerobically under argon or nitrogen were supplemented with 2 μg/mL ergosterol and 0.2% Tween 80 (20Rose M.D. Winston F.M. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 177-186Google Scholar). Anaerobic cultures for experiments were prepared using stocks that were themselves grown anaerobically. 59Fe uptake and Fe(III) reductase measurements were made at 30 °C as described previously (19Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 128-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) in 0.1m MES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; fAAS, flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry; BIP, 2,2′-bipyridyl; BPS, bathophenanthroline disulfonate. at pH 6.0 which contained 20 mm citrate and 2% glucose. When present, ascorbate was added to 1 mm. This buffer contained <15 nm contaminating iron as determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry (fAAS). All uptake velocities were from the linear portion of the time versus 59Fe accumulation curve. Uptake was measured at [59Fe] = 0.1 μm. This iron concentration is essentially the Km value for high affinity iron uptake, which has been estimated to be 0.15 μm (3Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the uptake rates reported here represent second-orderVmax/Km values. Total RNA isolation and Northern analysis were by standard techniques (21Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). All samples were taken from early log phase cultures. fAAS analyses were performed using a Perkin-Elmer model 1100B with a model 700 graphite furnace on extracts prepared from whole cells digested at 75 °C in 6 m perchloric acid. Accumulation of the complex between 2,2′-bipyridyl (BIP) and Fe(II) in yeast cells was established by extracting cells pretreated with BIP (100 μm for 1 h) with benzyl alcohol (22Breurer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24209-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The rose-colored BIP3·Fe(II) complex was quantitated in the benzyl alcohol phase by its absorbance at 520 nm (ε = 11,000m−1 cm−1 as determined from a standard curve). Statistical analyses were carried out using INSTAT (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), while 59Fe uptakeversus time data were graphed and fit by linear least squares using Cricket Graph (Cricket Software, Malvern, PA). The proposed role of dioxygen as substrate for high affinity iron uptake in yeast suggested that expression of iron uptake activities might be regulated by the state of aerobiosis of the culture. Indeed, the transcripts encoding all three members of the high affinity iron accumulation pathway, Fre1 (metal reductase), Ftr1, and Fet3 were undetectable in anaerobically grown cells (Fig. 1, panels A and B, t = 0). Consequently, these cells exhibited essentially no Fe(III) reductase activity (Fig. 2, panel A, t= 0) nor 59Fe uptake (Fig. 2, panel B,t = 0). On the other hand, these activities quickly recovered when anaerobically grown cultures were resuspended and then grown in air-saturated medium (Fig. 2). This recovery was preceded by the accumulation of the iron-associated mRNA species absent in the initial anaerobic culture (Fig. 1). This recovery of the steady-state transcript level was rapid, occurring within 15 min, with some recovery ≤5 min (Fig. 1, panel B). This rapid increase indicates that the state of aerobiosis as well as the medium iron concentration (2Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Early log phase cell samples from anaerobically grown cultures of DEY1457 (wild type) were used for measurement of Fe(III) reduction (panel A,t = 0) and 59Fe uptake (panel B,t = 0). The remainder of the culture was resuspended in air-saturated medium and allowed to double twice while maintaining the culture density by dilution with fresh medium. Samples were taken for reductase and uptake measurements at the times indicated.59Fe accumulation was measured under air in the absence (open symbols) and presence (filled symbols) of ascorbate. Ascorbate renders iron uptake reductase-independent. the t = 0–4 h values are from two experiments with samples in triplicate; the error bars represent 1 S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next assessed the sensitivity of this transcriptional control to [O2]. To do so, cultures were grown anaerobically and att = 0, air-saturated medium was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.24, 2.4, or 12.2 μm dissolved O2. Cell samples were taken at intervals for isolation of total RNA. This RNA was then analyzed by Northern analysis as above. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3. Addition of O2 to 0.24 μm caused little increase in the FET3 and FTR1 transcript abundance. In contrast, 2.4 and 12.2 μm O2 caused an increase in these species within 5 min with a maximum increase at 15 min. At this time, both transcripts began to decline in the cells exposed to 2.4 μm O2, a decline that was apparent in the cells exposed to 12.2 μm O2 only after 30 min. Our interpretation of this pattern is that the limiting dioxygen added to these latter cultures was consumed by the cells reducing the dissolved [O2] ≤ 0.24 μm (or that concentration below which no induction occurred). These results indicate that the mechanism that triggers the transcriptional response to O2 functions in the concentration regime of 1 μm dissolved O2. The results also indicate that both transcripts are relatively unstable since their steady-state level rapidly declines following the apparent down-regulation of transcription (see also below). We next addressed the mechanism of the down-regulation of FTR1 and FET3 expression (the high affinity iron permease complex) in anaerobic cells. We considered two explanations for this expression pattern which are not, however, mutually exclusive. The first was that O2 was a direct effector of expression of these genes through a pathway that was independent of Aft1 and perhaps iron as well. The second possibility was that the state of oxygenation of the cells modulated the sensitivity of the Aft1-dependent iron-sensing pathway to medium iron concentration. The latter explanation was reasonable and had precedent in the case of the transcriptional regulators in Escherichia coli, Fur, and Fnr (23Hassan H.M. Schrum L.W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 314-315Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, this possibility was tested first by making the Aft1 trans-activation of iron uptake activities relatively iron-independent and determining whether this negated the anaerobic down-regulation. This was accomplished by using transformed strains DEY1457(pT14) and ARY1458(pT14). The plasmid pT14 carries an Aft1 gain-of-function allele,AFT1-1 up (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), while, as a control, ARY1458 carries a deletion in FTR1, encoding the high affinity iron permease. Because of a Cys to Phe mutation, the DNA binding activity of Aft1up protein at otherwise iron-repressible genes,e.g. FTR1 and FET3 is less strongly suppressed by medium iron (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). That is, in an Aft1up-carrying strain, the expression of high affinity iron uptake activity is only weakly repressed by 40 μm ferrous sulfate in comparison to the 50% repression observed in wild type (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Wild type transformant DEY1457(pT14) was grown both aerobically and anaerobically in synthetic (SC) medium, which is normally repressing for expression of high affinity iron uptake (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 18Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two cultures were washed, maintaining their respective states of aerobiosis, and were then resuspended in air-saturated buffer to initiate aerobic uptake. Samples were taken also for preparation of total RNA, which was subjected to Northern analysis. The data showed (Fig. 4, Northern analysis) that in air-grown wild type strain DEY1457, as expected, the Aft1up protein supported a 4–5-fold higher level of expression of the “iron regulon” (17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), which resulted in a comparable fold increase in iron uptake (Fig. 4, uptake values). Consistent with the model being tested, the Aft1up protein supported significant expression of this activity in anaerobically grown cells, as well, although the suppression of the anaerobic phenotype was not complete. That is, these cells recovered ∼20% of the transcript abundance and uptake activity seen in the air-grown culture of the pT14 transformant, while, as shown above, the untransformed cells exhibited no detectable uptake activity (Fig. 4). In the same experiment, the ftr1Δ strain expressing Aft1up, ARY1458(pT14), exhibited essentially no high affinity 59Fe uptake, demonstrating that the uptake seen in the wild type transformant grown under nitrogen or air was Ftr1-dependent (data not shown). These results are consistent with the suggestion that the lack of expression of high affinity iron uptake in anaerobic cultures was due at least in part to the putative iron-dependent suppression of Aft1 protein DNA binding (and subsequent trans-activation) (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 17Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), a degree of suppression that would not occur in an aerobic culture at a comparable medium iron concentration (e.g. in YPD which is partially derepressing; cf. Fig. 7). The conclusion that Aft1 was involved in this expression pattern was also supported by the fact that the up-regulation of the iron-associated genes upon oxygenation of an anaerobic culture was absent in strain ARY1459, a construct carrying a deletion of AFT1 (data not shown). This observation was consistent with the fact that these genes are not expressed in aerobically grown cultures of anaft1Δ-containing strain (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D.

Cultures of DEY1457 (wild type) were grown either anaerobically and aerobically in YPD in the absence or presence of BPS (100 μm) as indicated. Samples were then taken for Northern analysis and aerobic 59Fe uptake measurement. Even sample loading was confirmed by analysis of mRNA due to ACT1. The 59Fe uptake values are shown under the respective mRNA samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If this anaerobic repression were due to an iron-dependent modulation of Aft1 activity, then manipulation of iron availability by chelation would also be expected to alter this anaerobic expression pattern. One iron chelator, bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS) is well documented to induce expression of aerobic iron uptake in yeast by activating the Aft1 protein-dependent expression of FTR1 and FET3, as well as the other genes in the iron “regulon” (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This activation is linked to the depletion of cellular iron caused by an inhibition of iron uptake. That is, addition of BPS to an59Fe-uptake mixture caused an immediate inhibition of uptake, which was relieved if the BPS was washed out (Fig. 5, filled circles). Similarly, addition of BIP to yeast caused a rapid and strong inhibition of59Fe uptake, also (Fig. 5, filled triangles). However, BPS, which is anionic, is likely to be impermeant to yeast cells as it is to mammalian cells (22Breurer W. Epsztejn S. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2005930762,"The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) participates in steroidogenesis through the mitochondrial transfer of cholesterol to cytochrome P450scc. The rat adrenal Star gene is transcribed as a 3.5-kilobase pair (kb) and 1.6-kb mRNA with the larger mRNA predominating (∼85% of total) in vivo. Hypophysectomy (HPX) produced a 3–5-fold decrease in Star mRNA along with a loss of adrenal steroids, whereas P450scc mRNA decreased by less than 2-fold. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment of HPX rats maximally stimulated steroidogenesis rates within 5 min with over 10-fold elevation of steady state blood levels occurring within 10 min. For intact rats there was a 5–10-fold larger increase, paralleling previously observed elevations of cholesterol-cytochrome P450scc association and metabolism in subsequently isolated adrenal mitochondria. ACTH did not increase either total STAR protein or a group of modified forms until at least 30 min after completion of acute stimulation, indicating that elevated translation of STAR protein cannot alone mediate this acute stimulation. Parallel slow changes in STAR protein and corticosterone formation after ACTH treatment are consistent with participation of STAR forms as co-regulators of these hormonal responses. ACTH stimulation of HPX rats increasedStar mRNA by 2.5-fold within 20 min and by 4.5-fold after 1 h, thus preceding the rise in the STAR protein. A 3.5-kbStar cDNA clone isolated from a rat adrenal cDNA library exhibited a 0.9-kb open reading frame and a 2.5-kb 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR). The open reading frame sequence differed at only 12 amino acids from that of the mouseStar. The rat Star gene seven exons with exon 7 encoding the entire 2.5 kb of 3′-UTR of the 3.5-kb mRNA. The 3′-UTR sequence suggests that 1.6- and 3.5-kb mRNA are formed by an alternative usage of different polyadenylation signals. Multiple UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) motifs also suggest additional regulation through this extended 3′-UTR. Although elevation of STAR protein by ACTH does not cause the acute increase in adrenal cholesterol metabolism, changes in the turnover or distribution of an active STAR subfraction cannot be excluded.

The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is the first step of steroid synthesis and is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) 1The abbreviations used are: P450scc, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme; STAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction; HPX, hypophysectomy; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: P450scc, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme; STAR, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction; HPX, hypophysectomy; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame.localized on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Miller W.L.

This conversion is the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis and is hormonally activated (3Stone D. Hechter O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1954; 51: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The availability of cholesterol to P450scc which limits this conversion (4Simpson E.R. Jefcoate C.R. Brownie A.C. Boyd G.S. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1974; 42: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This latter process is blocked within 10 min by protein synthesis inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, which also correlate with the loss of steroid synthesis after removal of ACTH (8Garren L.D.

A series of phosphoproteins (30–37 kDa) have been identified in cultured adrenal cells that localize to the mitochondria and increase in response to hormone stimulation (10Krueger R.J.

Subsequent studies from several laboratories have shown that these changes in 30-kDa proteins occur in adrenal, testis, and ovarian cells of several species (13Pon L.A. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol.

The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor that is localized in the adrenal mitochondrial outer membrane is also essential for this step, suggesting the involvement of a complex multistep process (17Papadopoulos V. Brown A.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,18Boujrad N. Gaillard J.L. Garnier M. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, a cDNA encoding the 30-kDa protein has been cloned and renamed the Steroidogenic acuteregulatory protein (STAR) (19Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several sites for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase have been recognized in the sequence which otherwise shows no similarity to other proteins (20Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Star expression in COS-1 cells that have been previously transfected with expression vectors encoding P450scc and adrenodoxin further enhances cholesterol metabolism (21Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy K.P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Recent work shows that this STAR activity in COS-1 cells is independent of the mitochondrial uptake that is seen in steroidogenic cells (22Arakane R. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain E.

MutatedSTAR has been found in humans born with the steroid deficiency disease, congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (23Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol R.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 200-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases C-terminal truncation of the protein removes steroidogenic activity. Disruption of the Star gene in mice produces a similar phenotype (58Caron K.M. Soo S.C. Wetsel W.C. Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Parker K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11540-11545Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Star has been detected in all steroidogenic tissues except for brain and placenta (26Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two species of Star mRNA (1.6 and 3.4 kb) are stimulated by cAMP in cultured mouse Leydig tumor cells (26Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of the relative proportions of these Star mRNA species may be important in determining the post-transcriptional activation that has been implicated in the rapid hormone stimulation of steroidogenesis (19Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated acute effects of ACTH on levels of Star mRNA and protein in the rat adrenal gland in vivo under conditions that exhibit ACTH-enhanced transfer of cholesterol to P450scc within adrenal mitochondria (4Simpson E.R. Jefcoate C.R. Brownie A.C. Boyd G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 443-450Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Privalle C.T. Crivello J.F. Jefcoate C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 1973; 212: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have particularly addressed the kinetics of the activation of steroidogenesis in relation to changes in Star mRNA and protein, in particular whether changes in STAR are sufficiently fast to account for the acute response. Although the gene encoding STAR has been cloned from both mouse (19Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human cells (21Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy K.P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we know little about the mechanism of transcriptional and translational regulation. The present structures of the mouse and human STAR gene only account for the expression of a 1.6-kb Star mRNA even though steroidogenic cells show extensive expression of a 3.5-kb mRNA. Here we show that this longer mRNA is the predominant species in rat adrenals in vivo, thus raising questions about this extended sequence. Several elements in the 3′-UTRs are targets for RNA-binding proteins which regulate their processing, translational efficiency, and stability (27Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 28Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Here we describe an extended structure for the Star gene encoding the complete rat 3.5-kb mRNA that is a key step toward characterizing the acute control of the activation of this protein. We show that the extended sequence indeed contains motifs that may affect regulation of thisStar mRNA. Intact and hypophysectomized female Sprague-Dawley rats (175–200 g) were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Madison, WI). All animal treatments were performed at 10:00 a.m. Animals were kept in stress minimizing environment. Each rat was then injected with ACTH. Intact rats were treated intraperitoneally with 4 units/rat of Cortrosyn (Organon, West Orange, NJ) up to 20 min prior to sacrifice (20-min group), or subcutaneously with 4 units/rat of Acthar gel (Rhone-Pouleuc Rorer Pharmaceuticals Inc., Collegeville, PA) 24 h prior to sacrifice (24-h group), or subcutaneously (4 units of Acthar gel/rat/day) for 3 consecutive days (3-day group). Hypophysectomized rats were allowed to recover after surgery for 3 days when they were maintained on Purina Lab Chow diets supplemented with 5% sucrose solution. A group of rats was given 4 units of Cortrosyn intraperitoneally for stimulations of up to 20 min prior to sacrifice. For 1 h stimulation, a second injection was given after 30 min to compensate for in vivo degradation of ACTH. For prolonged administrations ACTH was injected subcutaneously as Acthar gel (4 units) 24 h prior to sacrifice. In 24-h groups a second subcutaneous injection of 4 units of Acthar gel was given 3 h prior to sacrifice. All animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and blood was collected into vacutainers containing 15% EDTA, and adrenals were surgically removed, defatted, and rapidly homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) Adrenal protein and RNA fractions from this treatment were analyzed for STAR protein and mRNA (see below). Steroids were extracted from plasma with ethyl acetate/acetone (2:1). Cortisone was used during extraction as an internal standard. The organic phase was then evaporated under nitrogen with heating at 37 °C. The residue was dissolved in 100 ml of the methanol and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography analysis using a reverse-phase C18 column (Beckman, 5 m, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) with a linear gradient of methanol (50–100%). Detection was carried out at 254 nm by a Beckman System Gold programmable Detector Module 166, and the data were analyzed by System Gold Software via a Beckman System Gold Analog Interface Module 406. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (29Elliot M.E. Goodfriend T.L. Jefcoate C.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using the Millipore Investigator Two-dimensional Electrophoresis System. In brief, tube gels (200 × 1 mm) were prepared with isoelectrofocusing gel solution (ESA, Inc., Chelmsford, MA), broad range ampholytes (Millipore, pH 3–10), and 10% ammonium persulfate. The protein fraction from rat adrenal tissue homogenized in TRIzol reagent (50–100 mg of tissue/1 ml of reagent; Life Technologies, Inc.) was obtained according to the protocol from Life Technologies, Inc. The protein pellet was washed with ethanol and then solubilized with 1% SDS solution. Protein concentration was determined by BCA method, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 120 mm dithiothreitol, 0.06% SDS, 3.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1.8% ampholytes, and 8 m urea (all reagents from ESA, Inc.). 80 μg of protein was loaded on the tube gel and subjected to electrofocusing at 1000 V for 18 h. Gels were extruded from the tubes and equilibrated for 2 min in a 373 mm Tris (pH 8.6), 50 mm dithiothreitol, 3% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue buffer. Tube gels were placed on top of slab gels, consisting of 375 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 0.1% SDS, and 12.5% Duracryl. Molecular weight standards, prepared in 1% agarose, were applied on the top of the slab gel at either end of the tube gel. Gels were run at a constant power of 16 watts/gel for 5 h. After electrophoresis, the proteins from the gel were transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The position of the molecular weight markers was determined by staining the membrane with Ponceau S. Western immunoblot analysis (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar) was completed, using a rabbit antibody (1:6000) raised against a peptide sequence of mouse Star, kindly provided by Drs. N. Boujrad and V. Papadopoulos (Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.), followed by the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Promega, Madison, WI). Proteins were visualized by exposing the nitrocellulose membranes following treatment with the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), to the ECL x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia). Construction of rat cDNA library in λZAPII was performed as described previously (31Bhattacharyya K.K. Brake P.B. Eltom S.E. Otto S.A. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11595-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The coding region of rat Star cDNA was cloned by PCR usingpfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers designed against mouse Star cDNA sequences 15–34 and 973–992 (19Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 0.9-kb amplified product was then subcloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequence was analyzed by the dideoxy method using Sequenase Version II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and sequence comparison with reported mammalian Star genes was completed using the GCG program (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). 5 × 105 plaques of the cDNA library were screened using the 0.9-kb rat Star cDNA as a probe. The probe was labeled by the random primer method (Prime-It kit II, Stratagene) using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) and nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) filter replicas for hybridization. From more than 100 positive clones, 18 were randomly selected and excised into the pBluescript vector and then characterized. cDNA clones were isolated and purified using the Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen Inc.). The dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction was carried out for both strands using GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). 5 × 105plaques of the WiStar Furth rat genomic DNA library were screened using a 0.9-kb rat Star cDNA as described above. From 10 positives, 5 clones were selected and characterized. Five clones were amplified by the standard plate lysate and liquid culture method, prepared by the polyethylene glycol method (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.21-3.51Google Scholar), and then purified by Qiagen plasmid kit. The gene structure was verified by PCR using a set of specific primers derived from the 0.9-kb cDNA sequence (Table I). For determination of genomic sequence and, specifically, the sequences for introns and exon-intron junctions, primers were designed against sequences from the ends of each exon. We assumed a distribution of ORF sequences between exons equivalent to the mouse sequence (see Table I and Fig. 6). PCR products were purified using a QIAEX-gel extraction kit and then directly sequenced using GeneAmp PCR System 9600. The gene sequences from within each exon were compared with those of rat Star cDNA.Table IPrimers used for the generation of PCR productsPCR productsPrimersForwardReversePCR 15′-AGC TTC TAC AGA CAT ATG CG-3′ (1F)5′-GCT CTC CGG TTC AGC TCT TG-3′ (1R)PCR 25′-AGC TTC TAC AGA CAT ATG CG-3′ (1F)5′-TCC TGG TCA CTG TAG AGT GT-3′ (2R)PCR 35′-CAG GAA GGC TGG AAG AAG GA-3′ (2F)5′-AAC ACC TTG CCC ACA CCT GG-3′ (3R)PCR 45′-CAG GAA GGC TGG AAG AAG GA-3′ (2F)5′-TTT CCA ATC TTC TTC AGG AC-3′ (4R)PCR 55′-CTG TGT GCT GGC AGG CAT GG-3′ (3F)5′-ACC ATG CAG GTG GGA CCG TG-3′ (5R)PCR 65′-CTG TGT GCT GGC AGG CAT GG-3′ (3F)5′-ATG GTC TTT GGC AGC CAC CC-3′ (6R)PCR 75′-TGA GGC AAT CAT TCC ATC CT-3′ (4F)5′-ATG GTC TTT GGC AGC CAC CC-3′ (6R)PCR 85′-CGA GGC CTG TAC ATG CTG AC-3′ (5F)5′-GTG TTC CCG TTA CAG CCA CA-3′ (7R) Open table in a new tab Restriction digestion of the five genomic clones was carried out with a set of restriction enzymes, followed by Southern blotting using a probe synthesized against a partial 5′-flanking region (∼150 bp) of the rat Star gene. A 4.4-kb DNA fragment produced bySacI digestion of one genomic clone was recognized by the 5′-flanking region cDNA probe, was subcloned, and was partially sequenced. A dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction was carried out for both strands of the construct using the GeneAmp PCR System 9600. Rats were injected with long acting ACTH 24 h prior to sacrifice. Total RNA (20 μg) was then prepared from the adrenal glands with TRIzol reagent. A reverse primer [5′-CCC AGC ACA CAG CTT GAA TGT AGC TAG TAA-3] was synthesized against bases 4–33 downstream to the translation initiation codon, ATG. The extended product was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 100% ethanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and briefly dried for a few minutes and then dissolved in 5 ml of TE buffer (pH 7.4) with 5 ml of formamide loading buffer and kept at −20 °C until use. The sample was heated with boiling water for 3 min just before loading and analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel together with the samples for dideoxynucleotide sequencing using32P-end-labeled primer. 5′-End labeling of the primer with [γ-32P]ATP was conducted with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the labeled primer (5 × 104 cpm) was mixed with RNA. Hybridization was performed at 30 °C overnight, and primer extension reaction was performed at 42 °C for 90 min with 100 units of reverse transcriptase. The same labeled primer (10 ng) was used for the dideoxynucleotide sequencing reaction using a construct containing rat Star 5′-flanking region as a template. Primer extension product was then loaded on a denaturing sequencing gel in parallel to the DNA sequencing ladder. Northern hybridization was conducted with either the 32P-labeled 0.9-kbStar ORF cDNA after agarose-formaldehyde gel (1%) electrophoresis. Quantitation of Northern hybridization was performed by laser densitometry using the NIH image program. Rat Star mRNA species containing poly(A)+tails were identified by using a nested RT-PCR according to the method reported previously (33Toriello H.V. Glover T.W. Takahara K. Byers P.H. Miller D.E. Higgins J.V. Greenspan D.S. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 μg of total RNA isolated from untreated rat adrenal gland, and an adapter primer, 5′-TAC GCC AAG CTC GAA ATT AAC CCT CAC TAA AGG G(T)16-3′. Long distance PCR was then performed usingTaq polymerase under previously published conditions (34Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar,35Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We used a set of 4 primers as follows: the Star exon 1-specific primer 5′-CTG CAG CAC TAC CAC AGA AAG CAT-3′ and adapter-specific primer 5′-TAC GCC AAG CTC GAA ATT AAC CCT C-3′, followed by a second nested PCR with Star exon 1-specific primer 5′-CTA CAT TCA AGC TGT GTG CTG GGA-3′ and adapter-specific primer 5′-TCG AAA TTA ACC CTC ACT AAA GGG-3′ in the presence of RNasin. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, reverse transcriptase was inactivated by boiling for 5 min followed by vigorous shaking to inactivate RNasin. Single strand cDNA was then obtained by digestion of template mRNA with RNase A. The product was dissolved in 50 ml of TE buffer (pH 7.4). The first PCR reaction was conducted using one-tenth of the product as a template. PCR was performed according to the automatic program designed as follows: denaturation, 94 °C for 3.5 min; cycle denaturation, 98 °C for 7 s; annealing, 65 °C for 1 min; autosegment extension, 72 °C, 4 min + 10 s/cycle; 30 cycles. At the end of the last cycle, the tubes were held at 70 °C for 10 min for elongation reaction and then cooled down to 4 °C. The second nested PCR reaction was performed with a 100 × diluted sample of the first PCR product as a template, using the conditions and primers described above. We have characterized the expression of immunodetectable STAR protein in relation to the time course of steroid synthesis following ACTH stimulation of rats in vivo. Fig. 1 shows the time course of the increase in corticosterone synthesis in hypophysectomized (HPX) and intact rats. Similar to previous studies, we show that removal of ACTH through HPX lowers circulating adrenal steroid levels by over 10-fold. Administration of ACTH to the HPX rats produced a biphasic steroidogenic response, including an acute phase which is complete in 20 min and a chronic phase which occurs between 1 and 24 h post-treatment. In the acute phase there is a short lag (3–5 min) followed by a rapid increase to a steady state that is reached in 10 min and is maintained at least until 1 h after stimulation. The chronic phase corresponds to a further 3.5-fold increase in serum glucocorticoids, which occurs between 1 and 24 h after stimulation. In intact rats the acute phase kinetics are retained but with much higher amplitude of the response. The change to a new steady state at 20 min corresponds to a 3-fold increase in the rate of secretion of glucocorticoids relative to the basal secretion rate. We analyzed the effect of ACTH treatment on STAR protein by carrying out immunoblotting from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of total adrenal protein. This approach has been used previously to resolve modified forms of rat STAR, notably phosphorylated forms, which locate at a more acidic pH on these gels (52Jefcoate C.R. McNamara B.C. Artemenko I. Yamazaki T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Prior to ACTH treatment of HPX and intact rats, we detected two proteins whose pI (pI 6.5 and 6.6) and size (30 kDa) are fully compatible with previous determinations for rat STAR in unstimulated cultured adrenal cells (Fig. 2) (13Pon L.A.

Biol. 1992; 43: 751-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the same animals that were used for these steroid measurements, the STAR protein levels were 2–4 times lower in HPX rats but showed absolutely no response to ACTH within the 20-min period of the acute phase response (Fig. 2 B). Increases in total STAR were only apparent 60 min after stimulation (data not shown) and rose 3–4-fold by 24 h corresponding to the period of chronic changes in steroidogenesis. During this period, initial pair o"

TGF-β1 inhibited the growth of COLO-357 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and caused a rapid but transient increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 mRNA levels. TGF-β1 caused a delayed but sustained increase in the protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 and a sustained increase in type I and II TGF-β receptors (TβRI and TβRII) mRNA and protein levels. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) completely blocked the TGF-β1-mediated increase in TβRI and TβRII expression. Furthermore, a nuclear runoff transcription assay revealed that the increase in receptor mRNA levels was due to newly transcribed RNA. There was a significant increase in TβRI and TβRII mRNA levels in confluent cells in comparison to subconfluent (≤80% confluent) controls, as well as in serum- starved cells when compared with cells incubated in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. COLO-357 cells expressed a normal SMAD4 gene as determined by Northern blot analysis and sequencing. These results indicate that TGF-β1 modulates a variety of functions in COLO-357 cells and up-regulates TGF-β receptor expression via a transcriptional mechanism, which has the potential to maximize TGF-β1-dependent antiproliferative responses.

Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 induces growth inhibitory or stimulatory responses, depending on the cell type and growth conditions (2Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 3Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Wakefield L.M. Roche N.S. Stern D.F. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In most epithelial cells, TGF-β1 inhibits growth while enhancing the production of extracellular matrix proteins (4Moses H.L. Tucker R.F. Leof E.B. Coffey Jr., R.J. Halper J. Shipley G.D. Feramisco J. Ozane B. Stiles C. Cancer Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 65-75Google Scholar). TGF-β1 signals through a family of transmembrane receptors that have intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) binds TGF-β1 and then forms a heteromeric complex with the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI). This complex consists most likely of two type I and type II receptors (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activated TβRII transphosphorylates the glycine- and serine-rich domain of the type I receptor kinase, thereby activating TβRI, which then transiently associates with and phosphorylates SMAD2 and/or SMAD3. These proteins belong to a recently discovered family of intracellular signaling molecules (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated SMAD2 and/or SMAD-3 form a heteromeric complex with SMAD4, which is required for the translocation of both proteins into the nucleus, where they can act as transcriptional activators (1Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 4: 327-339Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

TGF-β1 is thus able to induce the expression of growth inhibitory proteins that suppress cell cycle progression, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1(8Datto M.B.

Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, depending on the cell type, TGF-β1 activates or inhibits IGFBP-3 transcription (14Erondu N.E. Dake B.L. Moser D.R. Lin M. Boes M. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hembree J.R. Pampusch M.S. Yang F. Causey J.L. Hathaway M.R. Dayton W.R. J. Anim. Sci. 1996; 74: 1530-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In some cell types growth inhibition may be mediated via a pathway that is distinct from the signaling pathway regulating expression of genes that modulate the extracellular matrix. For example, TGF-β1 is able to induce the expression of a number of genes such as PAI-I (16Carcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massague J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibits both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (17Sprengers E.D. Kluft C. Blood. 1987; 69: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mink lung epithelial cells, expression of a truncated TβRII does not attenuate TGF-β1-mediated induction of PAI-I. In contrast, expression of the truncated TβRII renders these cells resistant to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β1 (18Chen R.-H. Ebner R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cultured human pancreatic cancer cell lines are usually resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-β1 (19Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Büchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This resistance may be the consequence of a number of alterations, including the presence of mutated TGF-β receptors (20Takenoshita S. Hagiwara K. Nagashima M. Gemma A. Bennett W.P. Harris C.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), decreased expression of TβRI (19Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Büchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or TβRII (21Freeman J.W. Mattingly C.A. Strodel W.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and mutations in the SMAD4/DPC4 gene (22Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T.M. Moskaluk C.A. daCosta L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Although, COLO-357 pancreatic cancer cells are relatively sensitive to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition (23Baldwin R.L. Korc M. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity are not known. Furthermore, it has not been established whether TGF-β1 modulates the expression of growth-regulating genes in these cells. Therefore, in the present study we characterized the effects of TGF-β1 on the expression of PAI-I, IGFBP-3, p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 in relation to its effects on the expression of TβRI and TβRII. We now report that TGF-β1 induces rapid but transient up-regulation of PAI-I and IGFBP-3 mRNA in COLO-357 cells and enhances p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 and TβRI/II expression in a sustained manner in these cells.

All other reagents were from Sigma. TGF-β1 was a gift from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA); COLO-357 cells were a gift from Dr. R. S. Metzger (Durham, NC). COLO-357 were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). For TGF-β1 experiments, subconfluent cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, and antibiotics), and subsequently incubated for the indicated time with the indicated additions. Cells were then harvested for protein or RNA extraction. To perform growth assays, COLO-357 cells were plated overnight at a density of 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and subsequently incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of TGF-β1. Incubations were continued for the indicated time prior to adding 3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 62.5 μg/well) for 4 h (19Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M.

Cellular MTT was solubilized with acidic isopropanol and optical density was measured at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). In pancreatic cancer cells the results of the MTT assay correlate with results obtained by cell counting with a hemocymeter and by monitoring [3H]thymidine incorporation (23Baldwin R.L. Korc M.

Total RNA was extracted by the single step acid guadinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method. RNA was size fractionated on 1.2% agarose/1.8m formaldehyde gels, electrotransferred onto nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation (25Korc M. Chandrasekar B. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buechler M.W. Beger H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized with cDNA probes (TβRII, PAI-I, IGFBP-3, 7S) or a TβRI riboprobe and washed under high stringency conditions as previously reported (25Korc M. Chandrasekar B. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buechler M.W. Beger H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Blots were then exposed at −80 °C to Kodak XAR-5 films and the intensity of the radiographic bands was quantified by densitometric analysis. The following cDNA probes were used: a human TβRI and TβRII fragment as previously reported (19Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Büchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a 500-base pair SacII PstI fragment of PAI-I (obtained from Dr. H. Friess, University of Bern, Switzerland), a 475-base pair EcoRV fragment of IGFBP-3 (obtained from Dr. S. Shimasaki, University of California, San Diego), and a 1.7-kilobase pair SMAD4 construct (obtained from Dr. J. Massague, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). ABamHI 190-base pair fragment of mouse 7S cDNA that hybridizes with human cytoplasmatic RNA was used to confirm equal RNA loading (25Korc M. Chandrasekar B. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buechler M.W. Beger H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C) and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Membranes were incubated for 90 min with anti-TβRI (50 ng/ml), anti-TβRII (50 ng/ml), anti-p15Ink4B (200 ng/ml), anti-p21Cip1 (200 ng/ml), or anti-p27Kip1 (200 ng/ml) antibodies, washed, and incubated with a secondary antibody against mouse (anti-p21Cip1) or rabbit IgG for 60 min. After washing, visualization was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence. 2 μg of RNA, isolated as described earlier, were reversed transcribed using the manufacturer's recommended reaction conditions. PCR reactions were performed using 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 1 μl of cDNA mix, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTP, 2 units of Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μm for each primer. The thermal cycling was programmed as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C for denaturation, 1 min at 55 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension; the final extension was at 72 °C for 10 min. The following primers were used for SMAD4 amplification: sense 1, 5′-AGCAAGCTTGCTTCAGAAATTGGAGAC, antisense 1, 5′-AGCGAATTCCCCAAAGTCATGCACAT (26Takagi Y. Kohmura H. Futamura M. Kida H. Tanemura H.

PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into pBluescript-IISK+ vector. Sequence analysis was performed using the Sequenase Version 1.0 DNA sequencing kit according to the recommended protocol. To measure specific gene transcription, COLO-357 cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were trypsinized and resuspended in complete medium. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was resuspended and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (4 °C) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Cells were then lysed in 4 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After a second 500 × g (5 min) centrifugation step, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again. The pellet was then resuspended in 200 μl of storage buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol and stored at −80 °C for subsequent transcription. Nuclear runoff assays were initiated by incubating 200 μl of the frozen nuclei with 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 μl of 1m dithiothreitol, and 2 μl of 100 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, and 10 μl of 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 40 μl of 1 mg/ml DNase I and 1 ml of HSB buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) were added and incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. After incubating samples for 30 min (42 °C) with 10 μl of proteinase K in 200 μl of SDS/Tris buffer consisting of 5% SDS, 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.125 m EDTA, nuclear RNA was extracted as described previously (25Korc M. Chandrasekar B. Yamanaka Y. Friess H. Buechler M.W. Beger H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1352-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and dissolved in 0.5 ml of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O. When necessary, samples were diluted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O to adjust32P-labeled RNA equally for each sample to ≥5 × 106 cpm/ml. Linearized TβRI and TβRII cDNA (100 μg) was denatured by incubating samples for 30 min (23 °C) in 0.2m NaOH and neutralized with 6× SSC. cDNA samples (5 μg) were slot blotted onto nylon membranes and UV cross-linked. Membranes were preincubated at 42 °C as described earlier and incubated at 42 °C with 32P-labeled RNA samples for 24 h. Membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC at 65 °C for 30 min, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 mg/ml RNase A in 2× SSC to remove unbound 32P-labeled RNA, washed again in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 1 h, and exposed at −80 °C to Kodak XAR-5 films using intensifying screens. To confirm that COLO-357 cells are sensitive to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition (19Baldwin R.L. Friess H. Yokoyama M. Lopez M.E. Kobrin M.S. Büchler M.W. Korc M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), cells were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of TGF-β1 (Fig. 1). TGF-β1 significantly inhibited growth after a 48-h incubation, maximal effects occurring at 100 pm TGF-β1 (−35.8% ± 6.3%, p < 0.01). Following a more prolonged incubation (72 h), 100 pmTGF-β1 inhibited the growth of COLO-357 cells by 47.7% ± 4.5% (p < 0.01). To study the effects of TGF-β1 on the expression of PAI-I and IGFBP-3 mRNA, Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA extracted from control and TGF-β1-treated (200 pm) COLO 357 cells. TGF-β1 caused a time-dependent increase in PAI-I and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels (Fig. 2). Densitometric analysis revealed a rapid increase in PAI-I mRNA levels, with maximal stimulation (11-fold) occurring within 3 h. PAI-I mRNA levels then decreased gradually but were still elevated above baseline levels (5-fold) after 48 h of incubation. IGFBP-3 mRNA levels also increased maximally (4-fold) after 3 h of TGF-β1 stimulation. In contrast to PAI-I mRNA levels, IGFBP-3 mRNA returned to control levels after 6 h. To investigate the effects of TGF-β1 on the levels of the Cdk inhibitors p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1, 60% confluent COLO-357 cells were initially incubated in serum-free medium for 12 h. Cells were then incubated in serum-free medium for an additional 48 h in the absence or presence of 200 pm TGF-β1, which was present for 12, 24, and 48 h prior to analysis. Lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Initially, TGF-β1 did not increase p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 protein levels. The mild decrease observed after 12 h (Fig. 3) was inconsistent. In contrast, after 24 h, TGF-β1 caused a marked and consistent increase in all three cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and this effect was consistently sustained for at least 48 h (Fig. 3). To investigate the effects of TGF-β1 on the expression of TGF-β receptors, we first sought to determine the effects of serum and cell confluency on TβRI and TβRII mRNA expression. COLO-357 cells were incubated in complete medium until they were 70% confluent and then incubated an additional 12 h in serum-free or complete medium. Densitometric analysis revealed that following 12 h of serum starvation there was a 5- and 6-fold increase in TβRI and TβRII mRNA levels, respectively, compared with control cells incubated with medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 4). Prolonged incubation (24, 48, and 72 h) of COLO-357 cells in serum-free medium did not significantly alter TβRI/II mRNA levels by comparison with the 12-h incubation (data not shown), suggesting that a steady state of TβRI/II expression was achieved within the first 12 h of serum starvation. Next, COLO-357 cells were incubated in complete medium and grown to 60, 80, and 100% confluency. There was a 6- and 2-fold increase in TβRI and TβRII mRNA levels, respectively, in 100% confluent cells compared with that of the 60% confluent cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, receptor expression was comparable in 60 and 80% confluent cells. To assure that serum starvation did not contribute to any ligand-induced change in receptor expression, all subsequent experiments were carried out after 12 h of serum starvation, so that the effects of serum starvation were already maximal prior to ligand addition. Conversely, to minimize the effects of cell confluency and serum on TβRI/II expression, all subsequent experiments were carried with cell confluency not exceeding 80% during the entire course of the experiments. Accordingly, COLO-357 cells were grown to 60% confluency and initially incubated in serum-free medium for 12 h. Cells were subsequently incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h in the absence or presence of 200 pm TGF-β1, which was added 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h prior to RNA extraction. Under these experimental conditions, TGF-β1 caused a 4-fold increase in TβRI mRNA after 24 h and a further increase (6-fold) after 48 h in comparison to the unstimulated control (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, TβRII mRNA levels exhibited a 3-fold increase after 24 h of incubation with 200 pm TGF-β1, and this increase was sustained for at least 48 h (4-fold). To determine whether the TGF-β1-induced increase in steady-state TβRI and TβRII mRNA levels was associated with an increased in the corresponding protein levels, COLO-357 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 200 pm TGF-β1 under the same conditions, and protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TβRI protein levels were slightly elevated after 24 h and markedly increased after 48 h in comparison with control cells. In contrast, TβRII protein up-regulation was evident within 12 h of TGF-β1 addition and maximal after 48 h (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the effects of TGFβ1 on TβRI/II protein levels paralleled its effects on the corresponding mRNA levels. To determine whether TGF-β1-mediated receptor up-regulation requires protein synthesis, COLO-357 cells were incubated 24–48 h in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide or 1 nmTGF-β1. Cycloheximide did not cause cell death and did not significantly alter basal TβRI or TβRII mRNA levels (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, after both 24 h (Fig. 6 A) and 48 h (Fig. 6 B), cycloheximide completely blocked the TGF-β1-mediated increase in TβRI/II mRNA levels. Cycloheximide also markedly attenuated the TGF-β1-induced increase in TβRI/II protein levels (Fig. 6 C). Thus, TGF-β1-mediated up-regulation of TβRI/II is dependent on new protein synthesis. To determine whether up-regulation of TβRI/II expression was due to increased RNA synthesis or enhanced stability of the mRNA moieties, the effects of TGF-β1 on newly transcribed RNA were examined next with the nuclear runoff transcription assay. COLO-357 cells were grown to 60% confluency, serum-starved for 12 h, and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h in the absence or presence of 1 nm TGF-β1 for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h prior to analysis. No increase of newly transcribed TβRI/II mRNA was observed during the first 12 h of stimulation. However, there was a marked increase in newly transcribed TβRI and TβRII mRNA after a 24- or 48-h incubation with TGF-β1 (Fig. 7). COLO-357 cells were recently reported to harbor a homozygous deletion involving exons 1–4 of SMAD4(27Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero Jr., R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the importance of SMAD4 in TGF-β1-dependent signaling, we examined next the status of SMAD4 in our COLO 357 cells. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from COLO-357 cells clearly demonstrated a SMAD4transcript in these cells that had the same size (approximately 4.5 kilobase pairs) as the SMAD4 transcript in human placenta (Fig. 8). Next, three reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments of the SMAD4 gene covering its entire coding region were sequenced, revealing that COLO-357 cells did not harbor deletions or mutations in the SMAD4 gene (data not shown). An important mechanism for regulating the cellular response to cytokines and hormones resides at the level of receptor expression. It has been shown by Northern blot analysis and binding studies that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and prostaglandin E2down-regulate TβRII expression in human osteoblastic cells and human fibroblasts, respectively (28Fine A. Panchenko M.P. Smith B.D. Yu Q. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Iimura T. Oida S. Ichijo H. Goseki M. Maruoka Y. Takeda K. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 918-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore binding studies revealed down-regulation of TβRI in human monocytes by interferon-γ (30Brandes M.E. Wakefield L.M. Wahl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 266: 19697-19703Google Scholar). Conversely, in human lung fibroblasts (31Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and human corpus carvernosum smooth muscle cells (32Moreland R.B. Traish A. McMillan M.A. Smith B. Goldstein I. de Tejada I.S. J. Urol. 1985; 153: 826-834Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar), TGF-β1 increases steady-state levels of TβRI mRNA, potentially by increasing TβRI promotor activity (31Bloom B.B. Humphries D.E. Kuang P.-P. Fine A. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the regulation of TβRII by TGF-β1. In the present study we determined that TGF-β1 enhances both TβRI and TβRII expression levels in COLO-357 pancreatic cancer cells. This effect occurred in a time-dependent manner with a marked increase after 24 and 48 h. This increase in mRNA levels was associated with enhanced protein synthesis of both receptors. Two lines of evidence indicate that the TGF-β1-induced increase in TβRI and TβRII mRNA levels was effected at the level of transcription. First, blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide completely abrogated the TGF-β1- induced TβRI/II up-regulation. Second, the nuclear runoff transcription assay demonstrated that TGF-β1 acted to enhance transcription of both receptors. In the present study we also determined that TβRI/II is up-regulated following serum starvation, reaching a new steady-state level within 12 h. Moreover confluent COLO-357 cells also exhibited increased TβRI/II mRNA levels compared with subconfluent control cells. It has been shown for the epidermal growth factor receptor, that serum starvation leads to its down-regulation (33Suarez-Quian C.A. Byers S.W. Tissue Cell. 1993; 25: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similarly, cell density-dependent down-regulation of several growth factor receptors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or hepatocyte growth factor receptor, has been demonstrated in a variety of cell types (34Koura A.N. Liu W. Kitadai Y. Singh R.K. Radinsky R. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3891-3894PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mizuno K. Higuchi O. Tajima H. Yonemasu T. Nakamura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ostensibly, this down-regulation is an important component of the signaling mechanism that leads to suppression of growth when cells are either deprived of nutrients or approaching confluency. In this context, up-regulation of TβRI and TβRII may serve to enhance growth inhibitory pathways under the same culture conditions (serum-free medium, confluent cells). While the mechanisms that contribute to cell density-dependent TGF-β receptor up-regulation are not known, it has been recently shown that activation of focal adhesion kinase by α2β1 integrins causes decreased surface expression of TβRI and TβRII (36Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as α2β1 integrins and focal adhesion kinase participate in extracellular matrix-initiated intracellular signaling, our findings raise the possibility that cell-cell contact may also act to activate pathways that modulate TβRI/II gene expression. The mammalian Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 inhibit the activities of cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin D-Cdk6, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin A-Cdk2, whereas p15Ink4Binterferes specifically with cyclin D binding to Cdk4 and Cdk6 (8Datto M.B.

Previous studies in a variety of epithelial cells have demonstrated that TGF-β1 can markedly up-regulate the expression of p21Cip1 and p15Ink4B, but exerts only a small stimulatory effect on p27Kip1 levels (11Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In cell lines that are highly sensitive to TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition, the effect of TGF-β1 on p21Cip1 and p15Ink4Bup-regulation are relatively rapid (11Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 37Ravitz M.J. Wenner C.E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 165-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, TGF-β1 acts via the increase in p15Ink4B levels to displace p27Kip1 from Cdk4 and Cdk6 (11Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, in normal mouse B lymphocytes, TGF-β1 increases p27Kip1 protein levels (38Bouchard C. Fridman W.H. Sautes C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4155-4164PubMed Google Scholar), and such an effect may be due in part to decreased degradation of the protein (37Ravitz M.J. Wenner C.E. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 165-207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined that TGF-β1 causes a delayed but sustained increase in p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 protein levels, which was readily and consistently evident only after 24 h. While the molecular mechanisms that lead to this increase of three different Cdk inhibitors in COLO-357 cells are not known, the relatively slow kinetics of this up-regulation underscore our observation that these cells are insensitive to the TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition during the initial 24 h incubation period (Fig. 1). Conversely, the marked increase in p15Ink4B, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 protein levels that occurs 24 and 48 h after the addition of TGF-β1 suggests that these Cdk inhibitors are then able to contribute to the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on cell growth. These observations also raise the possibility that the delayed up-regulation of the Cdk inhibitors is dependent on the TGF-β1-induced increase in TβR-I/II expression. TGF-β1 caused a rapid increase in PAI-I mRNA levels in COLO-357 cells followed by a less pronounced but sustained increase during the subsequent 48 h. PAI-I is the main inhibitor of the urokinase plasminogen activator system, which is thought to play an important role in cancer cell invasion (40Grondahl-Hansen J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Christensen I.J. Clark G.M. Osborne C.K. Brunner N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 43: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Ito H. Yonemura Y. Fujita H. Tsuchihara K. Kawamura T. Nojima N.

Cancer. 1995; 60: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our observation that TGF-β1 up-regulates PAI-I expression in COLO-357 cells suggests that TGFβ-1 derived from the cells may act via PAI-I to enhance their metastatic potential. TGF-β1 also caused a rapid increase in IGFBP-3 mRNA in COLO-357 cells with a maximal response occurring within 3 h of TGF-β1 addition. Growth inhibitory effects of IGFBP-3 may be caused by inhibition of IGF-1-dependent mitogenesis (43Bertherat J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 426-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or by IGF-1-independent mechanisms (12Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Oh Y. Gucev Z. Ng L. Muller H.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is known to induce divergent effects on IGFBP-3 expression. In endothelial cells, TGF-β1 reduces IGFBP-3 mRNA levels (14Erondu N.E. Dake B.L. Moser D.R. Lin M. Boes M. Bar R.S. Growth Regul. 1996; 6: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it causes a dose-dependent increase of IGFBP-3 in porcine myogenic cells (15Hembree J.R. Pampusch M.S. Yang F. Causey J.L. Hathaway M.R. Dayton W.R. J. Anim. Sci. 1996; 74: 1530-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer cells TGF-β1 stimulates IGFBP-3 production and induces binding of IGFBP-3 to the cell surface (44Oh Y. Gucev Z. Ng L. Muller H.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1995; 6: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Irrespective of its role in other cell lines, the transient nature of IGFBP-3 induction observed in the present study suggests that IGFBP-3 does not play a major role in the TGF-β1-induced antiproliferative response in COLO-357 cells. SMAD4 is an important signaling molecule that is downstream of the TβRI and TβRII signaling pathway. It is crucial in mediating TGF-β1 responses (5Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Pancreatic cancers and cultured pancreatic cancer cell lines often harbor SMAD4 mutations, which lead to loss of TGF-β1-dependent growth suppression (22Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T.M. Moskaluk C.A. daCosta L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 27Schutte M. Hruban R.H.

Although COLO-357 cells have been reported to harbor a homozygous deletion in the SMAD4 gene (27Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero Jr., R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar), four lines of evidence indicate that COLO-357 cells used in the present study express functional SMAD4. First, COLO-357 cells exhibited a SMAD4transcript by Northern blot analysis, which was the same size as the SMAD4 transcript in human placenta. Second, the SMAD4 transcript was readily demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, using specific SMAD4 primers (27Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero Jr., R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar). Third, complete sequencing of the SMAD4 gene in COLO-357 cells did not reveal any mutation. Fourth, COLO-357 cells exhibited rapid, intermediate, and delayed responses to TGF-β1, including our previous finding of autoinduction of TGF-β1 (23Baldwin R.L. Korc M. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the present results demonstrating increased expression of IGFBP-3, PAI-I, TβRI, and TβRII. Taken together, these observations suggest that up-regulation of TβRI and TβRII may be part of an overall gene response in certain cells that serves to maximize the antiproliferative actions of TGFβ-1."
https://openalex.org/W2080451044,"Tentative identification of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and 5 (GRK2 and GRK5) sites of phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (βAR) was recently reported based on in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant receptor (Fredericks, Z. L., Pitcher, J. A., and Lefkowitz, R. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 13796–13803). Phosphorylated residues identified for GRK2 were threonine 384 and serines 396, 401, and 407. GRK5 phosphorylated these four residues as well as threonine 393 and serine 411. To determine if mutation of these sites altered desensitization, we have constructed βARs in which the threonines and serines of the putative GRK2 and GRK5 sites were substituted with alanines. These constructs were further modified to eliminate the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) consensus sites. Mutants βARs were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and standard kinetic parameters were measured following 10 μmepinephrine treatment of cells. The mutant and wild type (WT) receptors were all desensitized 89–94% after 5 min of 10 μmepinephrine stimulation and 96–98% after a 30-min pretreatment. There were no significant changes observed for any of the mutant βARs relative to the WT in the extent of 10 μmepinephrine-induced internalization (77–82% after 30 min). Epinephrine treatment for 1 min induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of the GRK5 and PKA− mutant βARs as well as the WT. We conclude that sites other than the GRK2 and GRK5 sites identified by in vitro phosphorylation are involved in mediating the major effects of the in vivoGRK-dependent desensitization of the βAR.

The decreased responsiveness of the receptor after stimulation by near-saturating concentrations of epinephrine appears to be caused by rapid cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation. GRK phosphorylation in turn promotes β-arrestin binding and receptor internalization (1Perkins J.P. Hausdorff W.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Perkins J.P. The β-Adrenergic Receptors.

Identification of the specific amino acids phosphorylated by these protein kinases has been the focus of numerous studies.

For the GRKs, mutagenesis studies indicate the involvement of 11 serines and threonines in the carboxyl terminus (5Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

By utilizing in vitro GRK phosphorylation of recombinant βAR reconstituted into liposomes followed by sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the carboxyl tail, it was found that four sites were phosphorylated by GRK2 (βAR kinase 1), serines 396, 401, and 407, and threonine 384, and six by GRK5 that included the same four phosphorylated by GRK2 and additionally threonine 393 and serine 411 (7Fredericks Z.L.

On the basis of this study it was proposed that these amino acids were the sites of GRK-mediated phosphorylation in intact cells; however, the effects of mutating these sites on the desensitization of the βAR in vivo was not addressed. In the studies presented here, we have determined the effects of substitutions of the putative GRK phosphorylation sites identified by the in vitro approach of Fredericks et al. (7Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) on the desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of the respective mutant βARs. The serine or threonine residues tentatively identified as the GRK2 and GRK5 phosphorylation sites were replaced with alanine. To aid our analysis of the effects of these mutations, we also replaced the serine residues of the two consensus PKA phosphorylation sites with alanine to eliminate PKA-mediated desensitization and phosphorylation. The GRK/PKA mutants (designated as GRK2− or GRK5−), as well as a mutant βAR containing only the PKA substitutions (PKA−), were constructed in the WTβAR that had been modified by placement of the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen at the amino terminus and six histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus. We recently established that the desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of this double epitope-modified βAR, stably transfected into HEK 293 cells, was indistinguishable from the wild type receptor (8January B.

Furthermore, the HEK 293 cell line offers a system in which the effects of overexpressed GRK2 on βAR phosphorylation and internalization have been studied (9Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the GRK2 substitutions did not significantly alter epinephrine-induced desensitization of the βAR, although a slight reduction of the rate and extent of desensitization was observed with the GRK5 substitutions. Consistent with these observations, we found that the mutant βARs were rapidly phosphorylated and that the rates of internalization were unimpaired. The lack of any major effects on these parameters suggests that the GRK site(s) that mediate the desensitization and subsequent internalization of the βAR do not involve the sites identified by in vitrophosphorylation. The construction of the plasmid containing the HA and six histidine-tagged βAR has been described previously (8January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23871-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This plasmid is designated here as WTβAR. For construction of the mutant βARs, the HA-His6-tagged βAR was excised from the pBC12B1 plasmid as anNcoI/SalI fragment, made blunt-ended, and ligated into the expression vector pKNH that had beenHindIII-digested and blunt-ended. All mutants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. To change the serines at 261 and 262 to alanines (third intracellular loop PKA consensus site), a two-step PCR mutagenesis method was used with the HA-His6 βAR in pBC12B1 as template. In the first step, two independent reactions were carried out, one using a sense mutagenizing oligonucleotide paired with a downstream oligonucleotide, and the other using an antisense mutagenizing oligonucleotide paired with an upstream oligonucleotide. In the second step, the products of the first PCR reactions were amplified using a pair of oligonucleotides nested within the upstream and downstream oligonucleotides. The resulting product was digested with AccI and subcloned into the plasmid pGEM3Z (Promega). The mutagenized receptor was excised as aBamHI/HindIII fragment, blunt-ended, and subcloned into HindIII-digested, blunt-ended pKNH. The S261A and S262A mutant HA-His6-tagged βAR in pKNH served as a template for subsequent mutagenesis. All other mutageneses were performed with single PCR reactions using mutagenizing sense and antisense oligonucleotides and Pfu I polymerase (Stratagene). After PCR, digestion with DpnI (which requires methylated DNA) was performed to remove the non-mutagenized template DNA, followed by transformation into XL1 Blue competent cells. The entire length of each mutant βAR was sequenced to verify the changes and to ensure that no other alterations were introduced by PCR. The mutant βAR designated PKA− had alanine substituted for the serines of both PKA consensus sites and can be described as Ser-261 → Ala, Ser-262 → Ala, Ser-345 → Ala, and Ser-346 → Ala. The mutant βAR designated GRK2− was constructed from the PKA− mutant and, in addition, has threonine 384 and serines 396, 401, and 407 changed to alanine. The four residues Thr-384, Ser-396, Ser-401, and Ser-407 are those identified by Fredericks et al. (7Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) as the sites of in vitrophosphorylation of the βAR by GRK2. The mutant designated GRK5− was constructed from GRK2− and, in addition, has threonine 393 and serine 411 changed to alanine. The six residues Thr-384, Thr-393, Ser-396, Ser-401, Ser-407, and Ser-411 are those identified by Fredericks et al. (7Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Each mutant plasmid was linearized by PvuI digestion and transfected into the HEK 293 cells using the CaPO4 method. The day after transfection the cells were shocked with 25% glycerol in DMEM and placed in media containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 the day after shocking. Stable transfectants were identified using an intact cell [125I]iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) binding assay described below. To measure intact cell receptor number by 125ICYP binding, cells were grown in 12-well dishes. After rinsing with serum-free DMEM, the cells were removed by pipetting up and down with 200–500 μl of serum-free DMEM. Triplicate reactions were performed in DMEM containing ≈200 pm125ICYP, in a total assay volume of 200 μl. Nonspecific binding was measured with the addition of 1 μm alprenolol. The reactions were incubated on ice for 50 min and terminated by dilution with 2.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. The 125ICYP-bound receptor protein was isolated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. The filters were rinsed three times with 2.5 ml of the Tris/MgCl2 buffer and counted in a Beckman 4000 Gamma counter. Protein was measured in duplicate or triplicate with 100 μl of cells. To measure βAR levels in membranes, 5 μg of membrane protein was used per reaction containing 0.1 mm phentolamine, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ascorbate, and 2 mmthiourea, and ≈200 pm125ICYP in the presence or absence of 1 μm alprenolol. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 50 min and terminated as described for the intact cell binding. The Kd values for epinephrine were determined by displacement of 125ICYP using methods previously described (8January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23871-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 125ICYP was prepared according to the method of Barovsky and Brooker (11Barovsky K. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1980; 6: 297-307PubMed Google Scholar) and Hoyer et al. (12Hoyer D.E. Reynolds E. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Alprenolol (1 μm) was included to measure nonspecific binding. The reactions were incubated for 50 min at 30 °C and stopped as described above. The reactions included 40–50 pm125ICYP, 10 μm GTPγS, and concentrations of epinephrine ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm. The data were fit to a one-component competition sigmoidal curve with a Hill coefficient of −1 using GraphPad software and Kd values determined using the Cheng-Prusoff formulation. Cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) to improve cell adhesion. The cells were pretreated with 10 μm epinephrine or carrier by additions made directly to growth medium from 100× stock solutions. The 100× epinephrine stock (1 mm) was prepared in 100× AT carrier, such that the final concentration of AT was 0.1 mm ascorbate and 1 mm thiourea, pH 7. Controls were treated with the AT carrier at the same final concentration. Pretreatment was performed at 37 °C for various times and was stopped by removal of media and 6 washes with 2 ml of ice-cold serum-free DMEM, pH 7. Surface receptor number was then measured with the addition of 2 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 5 nm [3H]CGP-12177, designated CGP hereafter. Incubations were on ice for 1 h. To measure nonspecific binding, cells were incubated with 1 μm alprenolol added to the CGP mix. To measure total receptor number, including internalized βAR, digitonin was added to the binding mix (including alprenolol controls) to a final concentration of 0.2% as described previously (8January B.

The reactions were stopped by removal of the binding mix followed by 3 washes with ice-cold DMEM, 2 ml each. The cells were scraped into 0.75 ml of trypsin and counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Measurements were performed in triplicate for each time point. Additional plates that were washed identically to the experimental plates were used to measure protein. The surface receptor number is expressed relative to the AT-treated control in each experiment. GraphPad software was used to fit the data to an equation for monoexponential decay and determine the apparent rate of internalization. Cells were plated into 150-mm dishes coated with poly-l-lysine and were pretreated at 37 °C with 10 μm epinephrine or AT carrier for the indicated times. The pretreatment was stopped with 6 washes of 10 ml of ice-cold HME buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The washed cells were scraped into HME plus 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 μmokadaic acid and homogenized with 7 strokes in a type B Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were layered onto step gradients of 23 and 43% sucrose prepared in HE buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor for 35 min. The fraction at the 23/43% interface was removed, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed by a modification of the method described by Salomon et al. (14Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Membranes were diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.2–0.4 mg/ml and were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1 mm EDTA, 1.34 mm MgCl2, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 16 units/ml creatine kinase, 100 μm ATP, 1 μm GTP, 0.1 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 30 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 100 μl. The final free Mg2+concentration was calculated to be 0.3 mm to optimize desensitization measurements (3Clark R.B. Friedman J. Dixon R.A.F. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar, 15Clark, R. B., Friedman, J., Johnson, J. A., and Kunkel, M. W. FASEB J., 1, 289–297.Google Scholar, 16Johnson J.A. Clark R.B. Friedman J. Dixon R.A.F. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 289-293PubMed Google Scholar). Each point was assayed in triplicate, with 6–8 concentrations of epinephrine bracketing the EC50. The [32P]cAMP produced in the reaction was purified over Dowex and alumina columns (17Clark R.B. Kunkel M.W. Friedman J. Goka T.J. Johnson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). the Vmax and EC50 values were determined with GraphPad software. As we have previously shown, the expression for coupling efficiency can be combined with that for Vmax to give Equation 1 (8January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R.

(k1)r=(Vmax)(Kd)/(V100)(EC50)Equation 1 This equation describes the coupling capacity, (k1)r, whereVmax is the maximum adenylyl cyclase activity measured for saturating agonist concentrations, and V100 is the theoretical value whenk1 is infinite. The increase in EC50and the decrease in Vmax that occurs with desensitization can be quantitated using the expression for coupling capacity. The extent of desensitization can be expressed as the ratio of receptor coupling capacity in the desensitized relative to naive state. Since the Kd and V100values do not change upon desensitization, the ratio can be expressed as shown in Equation 2.

This calculation can be converted to percent desensitization by multiplying the fraction of βAR activity remaining by 100 and subtracting that value from 100.

Open table in a new tab The apparent rates of desensitization and internalization were determined using GraphPad software for monoexponential decay. With several mechanisms contributing to desensitization and internalization, the data cannot be explained by a simple monoexponential decay. However it is useful to give a t½ for the sum of the total process. To measure phosphorylation of the βAR, confluent cells were washed three times in phosphate-free DMEM, incubated for 3 h with [32P]H3PO4 (0.5–1.0 mCi/100-mm dish), and pretreated for the indicated times with either 10 μm epinephrine or AT carrier. The cells were solubilized, and the extracts were subjected to a two-step purification using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (WGA) as described previously (8January B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23871-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The nickel nitrilotriacetic acid eluent fractions containing the βAR were mixed with 100 μl of WGA (packed volume) and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with rocking. The WGA/βAR was collected and washed with 5 ml of nickel column buffer (0.05%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C. The WGA was further washed twice with 400 μl of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 37 °C for a total incubation time of 10 min. The WGA pellet was collected and the βAR eluted with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 6m urea, 14.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The receptor was resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the addition of pre-stained low molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorscreen for 2–24 h, and the data were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager model 860 and Imagequant software. Autoradiograms of the dried gels were also obtained (24–48 h). In some experiments the gels following SDS-PAGE were transferred to 0.22-micron PVDF membranes, and the identity of the radiolabeled band as the βAR was confirmed by Western analysis using a primary anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Babco) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody as described previously (8January B.

As we have previously shown, determination of the coupling efficiency for agonist activation of adenylyl cyclase requires the measurement of receptor levels, the low affinity Kd for agonist binding, and the EC50 for activation of adenylyl cyclase (8January B.

A summary of these determinations using membranes prepared from each cell line is shown in Table I. At least two clones expressing each receptor were examined, and those shown in Table I were selected for all subsequent experiments since they expressed reasonably similar levels. A representative experiment for the determination of the low affinity Kd for epinephrine binding is shown in Fig. 1. We found no significant differences in the Kd values for the mutant receptors versus the WT. The mutant and WT cell lines displayed similar values for basal activity and the Vmax for epinephrine stimulation. The EC50 values for epinephrine stimulation of the mutant receptors were found to be consistently 4–6.5 times higher than that of the WTβAR (see Fig. 2 for data summary). Using the formulations we described previously (8January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R. Clark R.B. J. Biol.

Following pretreatment, membranes were prepared and assayed for epinephrine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity using a range of epinephrine concentrations. The data summary for desensitization in response to 2 and 30 min pretreatment with 10 μm epinephrine is shown in Fig. 2. These data as well as data from the other time points of 10 μm epinephrine pretreatment are summarized in Fig. 3. The extent of desensitization was quantitated as fraction activity remaining by measuring the right-shift in EC50 and decrease in Vmax as described under “Experimental Procedures” (8January B.

The fraction activity remaining for the 2- and 30-min time points for the various receptors are also shown in Table II, along with the results of calculations of the t½ values for the apparent rates of desensitization. the t½ values were determined by fitting the data to an equation for monoexponential decay. Although the 30-min data did not fit well to the theoretical curve, this method allowed calculation of approximate apparent rates of desensitization for comparison of the WT and mutant βARs. The data demonstrate that there was no significant difference in the apparent rate or extent of desensitization for the PKA− relative to the WTβAR. Although there was a slightly reduced apparent rate and extent of desensitization for the GRK2− and the GRK5−, the decrease was only significant for the GRK5− βAR.

https://openalex.org/W1584608729,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) utilizes the NF-κB/Rel proteins to regulate transcription through NF-κB binding sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). Normally, NF-κB is retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IκB proteins; after stimulation by multiple activators including viruses, IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded, resulting in NF-κB release. In the present study, we examined the effect of tetracycline-inducible expression of transdominant repressors of IκBα (TD-IκBα) on HIV-1 multiplication using stably selected Jurkat T cells. TD-IκBα was inducibly expressed as early as 3 h after doxycycline addition and dramatically reduced both NF-κB DNA binding activity and LTR-directed gene activity. Interestingly, induced TD-IκBα expression also decreased endogenous IκBα expression to undetectable levels by 24 h after induction, demonstrating that TD-IκBα repressed endogenous NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. TD-IκBα expression also sensitized Jurkat cells to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. De novo HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells was dramatically altered by TD-IκBα induction, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1 multiplication, as measured by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and viral RNA. Given the multiple functions of the NF-κB/IκB pathway, TD-IκBα expression may interfere with HIV-1 multiplication at several levels: LTR-mediated transcription, Rev-mediated export of viral RNA, inhibition of HIV-1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased sensitivity of HIV-1-infected cells to apoptosis.

Interestingly, induced TD-IκBα expression also decreased endogenous IκBα expression to undetectable levels by 24 h after induction, demonstrating that TD-IκBα repressed endogenous NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. TD-IκBα expression also sensitized Jurkat cells to tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis. De novo HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells was dramatically altered by TD-IκBα induction, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1 multiplication, as measured by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and viral RNA. Given the multiple functions of the NF-κB/IκB pathway, TD-IκBα expression may interfere with HIV-1 multiplication at several levels: LTR-mediated transcription, Rev-mediated export of viral RNA, inhibition of HIV-1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased sensitivity of HIV-1-infected cells to apoptosis. NF-κB/Rel transcription factors serve essential roles in the regulation of the immunomodulatory genes and activate genes including cytokines, cell surface receptors, and acute phase proteins, as well as viral genes including the HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LTR, long terminal repeat; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s); m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; Dox, doxycycline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); p.i., post-infection; NES, nuclear export signal; TD-IκBα, transdominant repressor of IκBα. 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LTR, long terminal repeat; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; pfu, plaque-forming unit(s); m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; Dox, doxycycline; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); p.i., post-infection; NES, nuclear export signal; TD-IκBα, transdominant repressor of IκBα.

Upon stimulation by many activating agents, including cytokines (TNF and interleukin-1), viruses, and double-stranded RNA, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated on Ser-32 and Ser-36; N-terminal phosphorylation of IκBα represents a signal for ubiquitination and degradation via the 26 S proteasome pathway (15Alkalay I.

Once released, NF-κB is able to activate target genes until new IκBα is synthesized. Since IκBα contains NF-κB binding sites in its promoter, NF-κB autoregulates the transcription of its own inhibitor (31Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The intracellular efficiency of HIV-1 gene expression and replication is due in part to the ability of HIV-1 to utilize host signaling pathways to mediate its own transcriptional regulation. In this regard, the NF-κB/Rel pathway plays a central role in HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription. The HIV-1 LTR contains two adjacent high affinity NF-κB binding sites in the enhancer region of its LTR (−109 to −79) (35Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Transient transfection studies using HIV LTR or HIV enhancer reporter constructs demonstrate that HIV gene expression increases upon induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity with stimulators such as TNFα and interleukin-1 or upon co-infection with other pathogens (reviewed in Refs. 1Roulston A. Lin R. Beauparlant P. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 481-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). The dependence of HIV-1 on its NF-κB sites in the LTR for virus replication has been examined in several studies (see Refs. 36Alcami J. Lain de Lera T. Folgueira L. Pedraza M.-A. Jacque J.-M. Bachelerie F. Noriega A.R. Hay R.T. Harrich D. Gaynor R.B. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1552-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 37Chen B.K. Feinberg M.B.

Virol. 1993; 67: 5235-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increased proteasome-mediated turnover of IκBα, and elevated expression of NF-κB1, NF-κB2, and c-Rel proteins (42McElhinny J.A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 5183-5193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modulation of intracellular NF-κB levels may contribute to enhanced NF-κB-directed gene expression and increased HIV-1 replication. Recently, Chen et al. (37Chen B.K. Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) measured virus multiplication in T cell lines with different basal levels of NF-κB and in primary T cells by infecting with wild type virus or virus containing NF-κB enhancer site mutations. These studies demonstrated that NF-κB sites play a central role in enhancing HIV-1 growth, although the virus was still able to grow more slowly in the absence of κB sites. In primary T cells, an intact enhancer element contributed to an earlier and higher peak titer of virus, thus reflecting the selective advantage conferred by the maintenance and utilization of functional NF-κB sites (37Chen B.K. Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, pathogenic viral isolates with NF-κB site deletions have been described that contain a duplication of a putative TCF-1 site in the U3 region of the LTR (44Zhang L. Huang Y. Yuan H. Chen B.K. Ip J. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); compensatory mutations such as the TCF-1 repeat may decrease the dependence of HIV-1 on intact NF-κB sites in vivo (37Chen B.K. Feinberg M.B. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5495-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we generated Jurkat T cell lines that inducibly express transdominant repressors of IκBα (TD-IκBα), or IκBα super-repressors, and examined the effect of Tet-inducible expression of (TD-IκBα) on NF-κB DNA binding activity, NF-κB-dependent gene expression and de novoHIV-1 multiplication. The time course of de novo HIV-1 infection in TD-IκBα-expressing Jurkat cells was altered by doxycycline (Dox) induction of TD-IκBα, resulting in a dramatic transcriptional inhibition of HIV-1 multiplication, as measured by p24 antigen, reverse transcriptase, and viral RNA analyses. CMVt-rtTA contains the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based pBABE vector backbone, which contains a puromycin resistance gene under the control of the CMV promoter. Plasmid construction consisted of the consecutive insertion of three components into the polylinker site: the doxycycline-responsive promoter CMVt from the CMVtBL vector (a kind gift from A. Cochrane), the rtTA gene from the pUHD172–1neo plasmid (45Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and the poly(A) fragment from the pSVK3 vector. neo CMVt BL was constructed in two steps. First, an intermediary plasmid (neo BL) was generated by ligation of a 3-kilobase pair XhoI/EcoRI fragment from the pMV7 vector (contains the neomycin (neo) resistance gene) to a 3.8-kilobase pair XhoI/EcoRI fragment from the CMV BL vector (contains the poly(A) site and the ampicillin (Amp) resistance gene). Second, a 450-bp XhoI (blunt)/NotI fragment of CMVt BL (contains the CMVt promoter) was cloned into the EcoRI (blunt)/NotI sites of neo BL. CMVt-IκB2N and IκB2NΔ4 were constructed by cloning anEcoRV (blunt)/BamHI IκBα-2N mutant cDNA fragment downstream of CMVt at the EcoRI (blunt, filled with Klenow enzyme)/BamHI site of neo CMVt BL. Jurkat cells were transfected with CMVt-rtTA plasmid by the DEAE-dextran method. The precipitated CMVt-rtTA plasmid (15 μg) was resuspended in TS solution (8 mg/ml NaCl, 0.38 mg/ml KCl, 0.1 mg/ml Na2HPO4·7H2O, 3.0 mg/ml Tris, 0.1 mg/ml MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml CaCl2, pH 7.4) and subsequently DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. For transfection, 1 × 107 cells in exponential phase were washed once in TS, resuspended with the DNA solution and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 ml with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Schering Canada, Pointe Claire, Quebec, Canada), and 0.1 mm chloroquine (Sigma), after which they were centrifuged and resuspended in fresh medium. Cells were selected beginning at 24 h after transfection in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Resistant clones carrying the CMVt-rtTA plasmid (rtTA-Jurkat cells) were then transfected with CMVt-Neo, CMVt-2N, and CMVt-2NΔ4 plasmids by DEAE-dextran. Cells were selected beginning at 24 h after transfection for approximately 4 weeks in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, and 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Initially, pools of transformants corresponding to rtTA-, rtTA-neo-, rtTA-IκB-2N-, and rtTA-IκB-2NΔ4-expressing Jurkat cells were analyzed for inducible IκB expression; subsequently, 6–10 individual clones from each transformant pool were selected for further analysis. To analyze growth kinetics, rtTA-neo-, rtTA-IκB-2N-, and rtTA-IκB-2NΔ4-expressing Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml Dox for various times at an initial cell density of 1 × 105cells/ml and then counted every other day. All cell lines grew well in the above medium with doubling times of 50 ± 4 h. Values obtained were the average of two experiments. To identify apoptotic cells, cells were treated with TNF after 24 h culture in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml Dox, and stained using the TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim) and Hoechst dye 33258. The mixture was then viewed under UV illumination using a Leica fluorescent microscope. To calculate percent apoptosis, a minimum of 200–400 cells were counted. Apoptosis was also analyzed by DNA fragmentation assay. ∼A total of 3 × 106 cells were collected, resuspended in 0.25 ml of TBE containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Extracts were then treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA preparations (30 μl) were loaded on 1.8% agarose gel; DNA fragmentation was visualized under UV light. To characterize kinetics of expression, rtTA-neo, rtTA-IκB-2N, and rtTA-IκB-2NΔ4 Jurkat T cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml Dox (Sigma) for various times. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Western Lysis Buffer (WLB) containing 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Equivalent amounts of whole cell extract (20 μg) were subject to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10% or 15% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Hybond transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 20% methanol for 1 h. The membrane was blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% dried milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight with N-terminal IκBα monoclonal antibody MAD 10B (29Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), anti-NF-κB antibodies (46Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Lin R. Hiscott J. Virology. 1994; 204: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), p24 (ID Laboratories), or anti-actin antibody (Sigma) in 5% milk/PBS, at dilutions of 1:500 or 1:1000. These incubations were done at 4 °C overnight. After four 10-min washes with PBS, membranes were reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:1000. The reaction was then visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL) as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from rtTA-Neo and rtTA-2NΔ4 Jurkat cells infected with HIV in the presence or absence of Dox using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (RQ1 DNase; Promega Biotech, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 37 °C, phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. RT was performed on 2 μg of RNA and 0.2 pmol of random hexamers using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, 500 nm dNTP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 272.5 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PCR assays were performed using 7 μl of RT product, in PCR buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 500 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 200 mm dNTP, 15 pmol of γ-32P-labeled primers, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nucleotide sequences of primers used are as follows: M667, 5′-GGCTAACTAGGGAACCCACTG-3′; M668, 5′-CAGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCC-3′; LA45, 5′-GCCTTAGGCATCTCCTATGGC-3′; LA41, 5′-TGTCGGGTCCCCTCGTTGCTGG-3′; M669, 5′-GTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAAC-3′; LA23, 5′-GCCTATTCTGCTATGTCGACACCC-3′. The PCR reaction mixture was subjected to 24 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 2 min at 61 °C, and polymerization for 2 min at 72 °C. PCR products were then ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as described previously (47D'Addario M. Wainberg M.A. Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1222-1229PubMed Google Scholar) to normalize all reactions. Cells were transiently transfected with HIV LTR CAT or HIV enhancer containing CAT reporter plasmids (15 μg) by the DEAE-dextran method. In some experiments, pSVexTat plasmid (wtTat) (48Delling U. Roy S. Sumner-Smith M. Barnett R. Reid L. Rosen C.A. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6234-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was also cotransfected together with the reporter plasmids. At 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with or without Dox in the presence of 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Boehringer Mannheim) or PMA (100 ng/ml, ICN) plus PHA (1 μg/ml, ICN). At 24 h after induction, cells were harvested and lysed. Extracts (200–400 μg) were assayed for CAT activity for 4–8 h, depending on the experiment. The percent acetylation was determined by ascending thin layer chromatography as described previously (49Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A. Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified using the Bio-Rad Gelscan phosphor imager and the Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software program. Following the addition of 1 μg/ml Dox to the culture medium for times ranging from 1 to 48 h, nuclear extracts were prepared from rtTA-neo, rtTA-IκB-2N, and rtTA-IκB-2NΔ4 Jurkat T cells after induction with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or PMA (100 ng/ml)/PHA (1 μg/ml) for 4 h. Cells were washed in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and were resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cells were then chilled on ice for 10 min before centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Pellets were then resuspended in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min before being centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Nuclear extract supernatants were diluted with Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). Nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA by using a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to two copies of the PRDII region of the IFN-β promoter (5′-GGGAAATTCCGGGAAATTCC-3′). The resulting protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5% Tris-glycine gel and exposed to x-ray film. To demonstrate the specificity of protein-DNA complex formation, a 125-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the nuclear extract before adding labeled probe. rtTA-neo-, rtTA-IκB-2N-, and rtTA-IκB-2NΔ4-expressing Jurkat cells after preincubation with or without Dox for 24 h were infected with HIV-IIIB, derived from the HXB2D molecular clone of HIV-1 (50Fisher A.G. Collalti E. Ratner L. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1985; 316: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) in serum-free medium for 2 h at a m.o.i. of 0.01 pfu/ml and then grown in complete medium for 36 days. Cell supernatants (precleared by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C) were collected every 4 days and analyzed for virus RT activity as described previously (51Lee M.H. Sano K. Morales F.E. Imagawa D.T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amount of virion protein p24 present in the medium was determined by ELISA (52Rooke R. Tremblay R. Wainberg M.A. Virology. 1990; 176: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from a portion of the collected cells by resuspending them in WLB. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above using IκBα MAD10B monoclonal antibody (29Jaffray E. Wood K.M. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p24-specific antibody (ID Laboratories), anti-RelA(p65) antibody (46Pepin N. Roulston A. Lacoste J. Lin R. Hiscott J. Virology. 1994; 204: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or actin monoclonal antibody (ICN). To examine the consequences of overexpression of transdominant repressors of IκBα (TD-IκBα) on NF-κB-dependent gene expression and virus multiplication, Jurkat T cell lines were generated that inducibly expressed two forms of mutant IκBα (TD-IκBα). One form was a full-length IκBα mutated at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (termed IκBα-2N), two sites present in the signal response domain of IκBα required for inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (20Brown K.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The other form of IκBα (IκBα-2NΔ4) also contained the S32A/S36A mutations, as well as a 22-amino acid deletion of the C-terminal portion of IκBα (25Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Beauparlant P. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10690-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a region of the PEST domain that is dispensable with regard to binding of NF-κB subunits but is important in IκBα degradation (Fig. 1 A). Starting with Jurkat T cells selected for expression of the reverse tetracycline transactivator protein rtTA (53Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Müller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar), expressed under the control of the CMVt autoregulatory promoter (Fig. 1 A), we isolated pools and clones of rtTA-Jurkat cells expressing IκBα-2N and IκBα-2NΔ4. The first pool of IκBα-2NΔ4 cells was disappointing because of the high level of leakiness of the transgene (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), compared with endogenous IκBα (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). However, analysis of IκBα expression revealed an interesting modulation of endogenous IκBα protein level when IκBα-2NΔ4 was Dox-induced for 24 h. The level of endogenous IκBα was decreased about 4-fold in Jurkat cells expressing IκBα-2NΔ4 compared with the IκBα levels in either Jurkat or rtTA-Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–4 and 6). Dox induction resulted in a 5-fold increase in IκBα-2NΔ4 expression after 24 h and an almost complete inhibition of endogenous IκBα expression (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). To characterize this inhibition further, a representative clone of IκBα-2NΔ4 Jurkat cells was Dox-induced for 3–48 h and then treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 5 min as an inducer of IκBα phosphorylation, following a 30-min pretreatment with calpain inhibitor I (100 μm) to block inducer-mediated degradation of IκBα (27Beauparlant P.

https://openalex.org/W1995124863,"The involvement of interleukin (IL)-6 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been recently demonstrated. IL-1β stimulated rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) to produce IL-6 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In the present study we investigated how the IL-6 promoter is transcriptionally regulated in rheumatoid FLSs in response to a physiologically relevant mediator of inflammation, IL-1β. Deletion analysis showed that the IL-6 promoter is regulated by two positive elements (located at −159 to −142 base pairs (bp) and −77 to −59 bp). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) binding to nucleotides −159 to −142 bp was constitutively present. The probe corresponding to nucleotides −77 to −59 bp gave three positive bands. The two slower migrating bands were induced by IL-1β and comprised an nuclear factor (NF)-κB p50/p65 heterodimer and a p65/p65 homodimer. The faster migrating band was constitutively expressed and identified as Epstein-Barr virus C-promoter binding factor 1, CBF1. Site-specific mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements regulated inducible activity of the IL-6 promoter in response to IL-1β stimulation, whereas the C/EBPβ binding element mainly regulated basal activity. We also provide the first evidence that CBF1 functions as a positive regulator of human IL-6 gene transcription.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 322: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). In particular, the macrophage-like synoviocytes and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) of the hyperplastic lining layer exhibit an activated phenotype (2Buchan A.B. Barrett K. Fujita T. Taniguchi T.

Lanchbury J.S. Kingsley G.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1992; 35: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These cells are a major source of several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6, proteins which play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of RA (2Buchan A.B. Barrett K. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Maini R. Feldmann M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 71: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 5Firestein G.S. Alvaro-Garcia J.M. Maki R. J.

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in T cell growth (7Lotz M. Jirik F. Kabouridis R. Tsoukas C. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Carson D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), B cell differentiation that might lead to the production of rheumatoid factors (8Hirano T. Taga T. Nakano N. Yasukawa K.

Baumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7251-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Immunological disorders often associated with RA include polyclonal plasmacytosis, production of autoantibodies, increased levels of acute phase proteins, and an increased number of peripheral blood platelets, all of which are related to the biological actions of IL-6 (11Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Advances Immunol. 1993; 56: 1-78Crossref Google Scholar). In fact, IL-6 is produced mainly by FLSs in the synovium (5Firestein G.S. Alvaro-Garcia J.M. Maki R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3347-3353PubMed Google Scholar, 9Guerne P.A. Zuraw B.L. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Clin.

Mitusxova M. Velics V. Falus A. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 63-68PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, administration of anti-IL-6 receptor antibody dramatically improved the symptoms and clinical markers of RA patients (14Yoshizaki K. Nishimoto N. Shima R. Sasai M. Danno N. Kishimoto T. Jpn. Soc. Immunol. 1996; 26: I-115Google Scholar), indicating that IL-6 is one of the key cytokines for the development of RA. So far, several regulatory elements such as AP-1, multiple responsive element (MRE), 5′-C/EBPβ, 3′-C/EBPβ, and NF-κB have been identified within the human IL-6 promoter region (see Fig. 2) (11Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Advances Immunol. 1993; 56: 1-78Crossref Google Scholar). These promoter elements are regulated in a cell type-specific manner. AP-1, MRE, 5′-C/EBPβ, and NF-κB binding elements are required for a murine monocyte/macrophage cell line, the PU5–1.8 (15Dendorfer U. Oettgen P. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4443-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), whereas 5′-C/EBPβ, 3′-C/EBPβ, and NF-κB binding elements are required for a human monocytic leukemia cell line, the THP-1 cell (16Zhang Y. Broser M. Rom W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2225-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The NF-κB site is sufficient for the full expression of this promoter by a human T cell leukemia virus type I-infected T cell line (17Mori N. Shirakawa F. Shimizu H. Murakami S. Oda S. Yamamoto K. Eto S. Blood. 1994; 84: 2904-2911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that Epstein-Barr virus C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1) acts as a negative regulator of the IL-6 gene in a mouse embryonal carcinoma, the F9 cell, and in a mouse fibrosarcoma cell, the L929sA (18Kannabiran C. Xeng X. Vales L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Plaisance S. Berghe W.V. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CBF1 is a DNA-binding protein that is targeted by the viral transactivator Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 in Epstein-Barr virus-infected human B lymphocytes (20Ling P.D. Rawlins D.R. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9237-9241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CBF1 is also known as recombination binding protein Jκ involved in the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin V(D)J gene (21Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaguchi M. Honjo T. Nature. 1989; 342: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), although conflicting data were reported (22Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G. Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). IL-1β is a potent activator of IL-6 synthesis by human rheumatoid FLSs (9Guerne P.A. Zuraw B.L. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Although several transcriptional elements have been implicated in the induction of human IL-6 gene by IL-1β, it is now apparent that the regulatory mechanisms of human IL-6 gene transcription are more complex and divergent among various cell types and phenotypes than initially described (11Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Advances Immunol. 1993; 56: 1-78Crossref Google Scholar). There have been no previous reports regarding the molecular mechanisms of basal transcriptional activity of the IL-6 gene in the absence of inflammatory stimulation. In addition, transcriptional regulation of this gene in rheumatoid FLSs has not been elucidated. In the present study we investigated how the IL-6 promoter is regulated in rheumatoid FLSs both, in the unstimulated state and in response to IL-1β. Recombinant human IL-1β and IL-6 were obtained from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Polyclonal antibodies against p50 (sc-114X), p52 (sc-848X), p65 (sc-109X), c-Rel (sc-70X), HMG I(Y) (sc-1564), C/EBPβ (sc-736), and STAT-1 (sc-346) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Synovial tissue samples were obtained from patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing total joint replacement. All RA and OA patients were evaluated by a certified rheumatologist and were diagnosed as having RA and OA, respectively, according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (23Arnett F.C.

Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (5312) Google Scholar). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Each tissue specimen was minced and then digested with 4 mg/ml collagenase for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated in RPMI 1640 (Nikken, Kyoto, Japan) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). When the cells had grown to confluence, they were treated with trypsin/EDTA and split at a 1:4 ratio. For experiments, FLSs were used in passages 3–10. A FLS line, MH7A, 2K. Miyazawa, A. Mori, K. Yamamoto, and H. Okudaira, manuscript in preparation. was established from synoviocyte cultures obtained from a 53-year-old female RA patient. The MH7A cells were plated in RPMI 1640 (Nikken, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). When the cells had grown to confluence, they were treated with trypsin/EDTA and split at a 1:5 ratio. Cells at confluence were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for the designated time periods. The culture supernatants were kept frozen until measured for IL-6, which was done by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, supernatants or serial dilutions of recombinant IL-6 standards (Genzyme) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) previously coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and then for 2 h at room temperature for saturation. After the plates had been washed, biotinylated anti-human IL-6 polyclonal antibody (2 μg/ml; R&D) was added. The incubation was carried out for 4 h at room temperature. After subsequent incubation (2 h, room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Dojindo Labs., Kumamoto, Japan) was added to the wells. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The minimum detection limit of the assays was 6.25 pg/ml. For generation of plasmid pIL6–3BLuc, a SacI/XhoI fragment containing the 1169-bp (−1158 to +11 relative to the transcription initiation site)BamHI/XhoI 5′-upstream sequence of the IL-6 gene was excised from the plasmid pGEMhIL-6 GT (Riken Gene Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) (29Yasukawa K. Hirano T. Watanabe Y. Muratani K. Matsuda T. Nakai S. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2939-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and inserted into the compatible site (SacI/XhoI) of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A series of deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking region of the IL-6 gene were created as follows. For the construction of pIL6NX-3BLuc, pIL6–3BLuc was digested withNheI and XhoI to generate the NheI/XhoI (−225 to +11) fragment of the IL-6 upstream region, which was then cloned into pGL3-Basic. For the construction of pIL6BX-3BLuc, pIL6AX-3BLuc, pIL6MX-3BLuc, pIL6HX-3BLuc, and pIL6SsX-3BLuc, pIL6B-3BLuc was digested with BfaI,AatII, MseI, HaeIII, or SspI, respectively, made blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme or T4 polymerase, and released by XhoI digestion. The resulting fragments were subcloned into pBluescript® II KS(+) phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) which was then digested with SacI and XhoI. The SacI/XhoI fragment was next inserted into pGL3-Basic. For the construction of pIL6KX-3BLuc, a synthesized NheI/XhoI (−77 to +11) fragment of the IL-6 gene was cloned into the pGL3-Basic. The C/EBPβ site at positions −158 to −145, the IL6-κB site at positions −73 to −64, the CBF1 site at positions −67 to −60, and both IL6-κB and CBF1 sites at positions −73 to −60 of the human IL-6 promoter were mutated by the insertion of synthesized DNA. The mutant sequence utilized for the C/EBPβ, IL6-κB, CBF1, and both IL6-κB and CBF1 sites were ACAgatatCAATCT (C/EBPβ-mt), aatATTTTCC (mt1), TTCCCtcG (mt3), and GGGATTTTagacTG (mt2), respectively. Lowercase letters represent the mutant nucleotides. The reporter constructs (IL6-κB-tk, IL6-κB-mt1-tk, IL6-κB-mt3-tk, and Ig-κB-tk) were generated by cloning four copies of the corresponding oligonucleotides as direct repeats into KpnI and SacI sites of the pGL3-tk vector, which carries the truncated thymidine kinase (tk) promoter (25Luckow B. Schåtz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) connected to the luciferase reporter gene. The DNA sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: IL6-κB-tk, GATCATGTGGGATTTTCCCAT; IL6-κB-mt1-tk, GATCATGTaatATTTTCCCAT; IL6-κB-mt3-tk, GATCATGTGGGATTTTCCCtc; and Ig-κB-tk, GATCGAGGGGACTTTCC. Lowercase letters represent the mutant nucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesized with KpnI and SacI overhangs. Cells were grown to confluence in 75-cm2 culture flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, harvested, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red to give a cell concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. A 500-μl volume of cell suspension, 5–10 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids, and 0.4 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase were placed into a Bio-Rad 4-mm cuvette; electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser, 0.29 kV, 960 μF) was then performed. The transfected cells were cultured for the designated time periods for each reporter plasmid in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red. All assays were carried out in 96-well plates (Culture PlateTM; Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). The luminescence was measured with a Top Count (Packard) at the conditions of 0.15 min of counting time, a single photon counting mode, and a 15-min period of dark adaptation at 22 °C (Top Count). The β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (26Medvedev A.E. Espevik T. Ranges G. Sundan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9778-9784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS(−), and then 100 μl of 1.5 mm chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in PBS(−) containing 20 mmKCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Wako) were added. The absorbance at 570 nm was thereafter measured by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared by a method previously reported (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS(−), harvested, and resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. The cells were then lysed by the addition of 0.6% Nonidet P-40 and vortexing for 10 s. Nuclei were separated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s, washed with 400 μl of buffer A containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), vigorously vortexed for 15 s, and incubated for 5 min on ice. This step was repeated three times. Nuclear extracts were then obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured essentially following the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using a protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Eight oligonucleotides as shown in Fig. 3 were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Sawady Technology, Tokyo, Japan). The 3′ ends of the oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled with Klenow DNA polymerase (Megaprime DNA labeling systems; Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, UK). Samples containing 5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with 10,000 cpm of labeled oligonucleotides and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a 10-μl volume of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol in the presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides for 15 min at room temperature and run on 4% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1, wt/wt) in 0.5× TBE buffer (1× TBE: 89 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, (pH 8.0), 89 mmol/liter boric acid, and 2 mmol/liter EDTA) at 150 V. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed to Rx-U film (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) at −70 °C. Initial studies were designed to confirm the induction of IL-6 synthesis by IL-1β in the human rheumatoid FLSs. Rheumatoid MH7A cells, primary rheumatoid FLSs, and primary OA FLSs were incubated with various concentrations of IL-1β for 24 h. For all cells there was a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of IL-6 released into the medium (Fig. 1 A). Peak IL-6 production was noted with 1–10 ng/ml IL-1β. After the addition of 1 ng/ml IL-1β, IL-6 production was detectable within 2 h and reached a maximum at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). IL-6 production by the FLSs of RA patients in response to IL-1β was significantly greater than that by the control FLSs from patients with OA (Fig. 1). As illustrated in Fig. 2, approximately 1200 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-6 gene contains various putative responsive elements: AP-1 (−283 to −277), MRE (−168 to −153), 5′-C/EBPβ (−155 to −148), 3′-C/EBPβ (−83 to −75), IL6-κB (−73 to −60), and TATA box (−53 to −47 and −30 to −23) (11Akira S.

Functional analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human IL-6 gene was carried out using the −1158 to +11 fragment as well as a series of 5′-deletion mutants of the IL-6 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). For transient expression of the reporter gene, each plasmid was used for transfection of rheumatoid MH7A cells and OA FLSs by electroporation, and the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was then measured 18 h after the addition of IL-1β (1 ng/ml). IL-1β markedly induced the luciferase activity in the MH7A cells transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the IL-6 promoter (Fig. 2 A). The luciferase activity significantly decreased when two regions (−159 to −142 bp and −77 to −59 bp) were deleted. The C/EBPβ consensus element (−155 to −148 bp), NF-κB consensus element (−73 to −64 bp), and CBF1 consensus element (−67 to −60 bp) were contained in these two gene segments. 5′-CATGGGAA-3′ (−60 to −67) was homologous to the reported CBF1 consensus binding element 5′-A(G/C)CGTGGGAA-3′ (31Tun T. Norisada H. Matsunami N. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Kawachi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). IL-1β induced less luciferase activity in the OA FLSs transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids carrying the IL-6 promoter compared with that induced in the rheumatoid FLSs (Fig. 2 B). For the further identification of these positive regulatory elements, we prepared eight double-stranded oligonucleotides as shown in Fig. 3. C/EBPβ (−158 to −142) oligonucleotide contained the C/EBPβ binding element, and IL6-κB (−75 to −60) oligonucleotide contained the NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements. C/EBPβ-mt was the mutant oligonucleotide for C/EBPβ. IL6-κB-mt1 was the mutant for NF-κB. IL6-κB-mt2 was the double mutant for NF-κB and CBF1. IL6-κB-mt3 was the mutant for CBF1. Ig-κB oligonucleotide was the NF-κB consensus binding element of the mouse immunoglobulin κ chain gene (32Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The m8 oligonucleotide contained the CBF1 consensus binding element of the m8 gene of Drosophila Enhancer of split (31Tun T. Norisada H. Matsunami N. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Kawachi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We carried out EMSA using the nuclear extracts of MH7A cells that had been either unstimulated or stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 4, when the C/EBPβ oligonucleotide was used as a probe, a broad band was constitutively detected (lanes 1 and 2). This complex was specifically competed by the unlabeled C/EBPβ oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 4). The complex was scarcely observed when the C/EBPβ-mt oligonucleotide containing a 5-bp mutation of the C/EBPβ element was used as a probe (lane 5). This band disappeared with the addition of anti-C/EBPβ antibody (lane 8). When the 32P-labeled IL6-κB oligonucleotide was incubated with the nuclear extracts obtained from MH7A cells, three complexes (C-1, C-2, and C-3) were detected (Fig. 5 A). A specific faster migrating band, C-3, was constitutively expressed upon incubation of the IL6-κB oligonucleotide with the noninduced nuclear extract (lane 1). In addition to this band, two new slower migrating bands, C-1 and C-2, were detected with the induced nuclear extract (lane 2). These three complexes were specifically abolished by the addition of unlabeled IL6-κB oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 4). Both C-1 and C-2 complexes were competed out by the unlabeled Ig-κB oligonucleotide (lanes 6 and 7), whereas the C-3 complex was not affected. In contrast, the C-3 complex was abolished by the unlabeled m8 oligonucleotide (lanes 9 and 10), whereas the C-1 and C-2 complexes were not affected. We next performed supershift experiments employing antibodies against p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, CBF1, HMG I(Y), C/EBPβ, and STAT-1 to identify individual proteins detected by EMSA. A representative result is shown in Fig. 5 B. C-1 and C-2 complexes consisted of NF-κB p65/p65 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer, respectively (lanes 3 and 5), as supershifts were observed for anti-p50 and anti-p65, but not for anti-p52 or anti-c-Rel antibodies (lanes 4 and 6). The C-3 complex contained the CBF1 molecule, as a supershift was observed with anti-CBF1 antibody (lane 7), but not with anti-HMG I(Y) antibody (lane 8). None of the three bands was affected by the addition of irrelevant antibodies (lanes 9 and 10). EMSA using the IL6-κB oligonucleotide showed the complex nature of the DNA-protein interactions at this motif involving proteins of the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer, p65/p65 homodimer, and CBF1 (Fig. 5). So we introduced site-specific mutations into this motif to separate CBF1 binding from NF-κB binding. The effects of the mutations on DNA-protein interactions were then determined by EMSA. Fig. 6 shows that the IL6-κB-mt1 oligonucleotide, which contained a 3-bp mutation in the NF-κB binding element (Fig. 3), enhanced CBF1 binding but eliminated NF-κB binding (lane 3). Competition with the unlabeled IL6-κB-mt1 oligonucleotide eliminated CBF1 binding complex of the unstimulated (data not shown) and the stimulated (lanes 8 and 9) nuclear extracts, but did not affect the binding of NF-κB (lanes 8 and 9). The IL6-κB-mt2 oligonucleotide containing a 4-bp mutation in both NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements (Fig. 3) eliminated all specific binding (lane 4). Competition with the unlabeled IL6-κB-mt2 oligonucleotide did not affect either NF-κB or CBF1 binding (lanes 11 and 12). The IL6-κB-mt3 oligonucleotide containing a 2-bp mutation in the CBF1 element (Fig. 3) permitted NF-κB binding, but eliminated CBF1 binding (lane 5). Competition with the unlabeled IL6-κB-mt3 oligonucleotide eliminated the binding of NF-κB (lanes 14 and 15). The Ig-κB oligonucleotide did not bind CBF1 protein (lane 6), as expected from the competition experiment using the unlabeled Ig-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6 and 7). For analysis of the functional significance of NF-κB and CBF1 bindings, luciferase reporter constructs containing four copies of the NF-κB and/or CBF1 binding elements connected to the tk promoter gene were constructed (illustrated in Fig. 7 A) and used to transfect rheumatoid MH7A cells, primary rheumatoid FLSs, and primary OA FLSs. Luciferase activity was measured 6 h after IL-1β stimulation. A representative result is shown in Fig. 7 B. The reporter construct carrying both NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements (IL6-κB × 4) was clearly transcribed in response to IL-1β. In contrast, IL6-κB-mt1 × 4, IL6-κB-mt3 × 4, and Ig-κB × 4 reporter constructs were not significantly transcribed by rheumatoid MH7A cells or primary rheumatoid FLSs in response to IL-1β. In this regard, the Ig-κB × 4 reporter construct was transcribed by Jurkat T cells stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (data not shown). The IL6-κB × 4 reporter construct was significantly less transcribed by OA FLSs in response to IL-1β compared with that transcribed by rheumatoid FLSs. There was no significant difference in the luciferase activity among OA FLSs transfected with IL6-κB × 4, IL6-κB-mt3 × 4, or Ig-κB × 4 reporter constructs. For determination of the functional role of each DNA binding element in IL-6 gene transcription by rheumatoid FLSs and normal FLSs, the IL-6 promoter containing mutations in the NF-κB, NF-κB plus CBF1, or CBF1 binding element was used for transfection of rheumatoid MH7A cells and OA FLSs. A representative result is shown in Fig. 8. In rheumatoid MH7A cells (Fig. 8 A), the activity of the wild-type IL-6 promoter was increased by 4.6-fold upon stimulation with IL-1β. A 5-bp mutation introduced into the C/EBPβ binding element reduced the basal IL-6 promoter activity to 51% of the wild-type value, and reduced the induction of IL-6 promoter in response to IL-1β to 40%. A 3-bp mutation introduced into the NF-κB element of the IL-6 promoter did not affect the basal activity of this promoter, but reduced the IL-1β-inducible activity to 74%. A 2-bp mutation introduced into the CBF1 binding element also reduced the IL-1β-inducible activity to 68%, whereas it did not affect the basal activity. Mutations in both NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements did not affect the basal activity, but totally abolished the induction of this promoter activity by IL-1β. These results demonstrate that the C/EBPβ binding element is required for the full expression of the IL-6 promoter in rheumatoid MH7A cells, although both NF-κB and CBF1 binding elements are critical for the transcriptional induction in response to IL-1β. In contrast to rheumatoid FLSs, OA FLSs exhibited signific"

Three genetically distinct subunits, the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains, associate intracellularly to form triple-helical monomers, which then assemble into disulfide-bonded dimers and tetramers before secretion. Although sequence considerations suggest that collagen VI monomers composed of all three chains are the most stable isoform, the precise chain composition of collagen VI remains controversial and alternative assemblies containing only α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains have also been proposed. To address this question directly and study the role of the α3(VI) chain in assembly, we have characterized collagen VI biosynthesis and in vitro matrix formation by a human osteosarcoma cell line (SaOS-2) that is deficient in α3(VI) production. Northern analysis showed an abundance of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs, but no detectable α3(VI) mRNA was apparent in SaOS-2 cells. By day 30 of culture, however, small amounts of α3(VI) mRNA were detected, although the level of expression was still much less than α1(VI) and α2(VI). Collagen VI protein was not detected in SaOS-2 medium or cell layer samples until day 30 of culture, demonstrating that despite the abundant synthesis of α1(VI) and α2(VI), no stable collagen VI protein was produced without expression of α3(VI). The α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains produced in the absence of α3(VI) were non-helical and were largely retained intracellularly and degraded. The critical role of the α3(VI) chain in collagen VI assembly was directly demonstrated after stable transfection of SaOS-2 cells with an α3(VI) cDNA expression construct that lacked 4 of the 10 N-terminal type A subdomains. The transfected α3(VI) N6–C5 chains associated with endogenous α1(VI) and α2(VI) and formed collagen VI dimers and tetramers, which were secreted and deposited into an extensive network in the extracellular matrix. These data demonstrated that α3(VI) is essential for the formation of stable collagen VI molecules and subdomains N10–N7 are not required for molecular assembly.

The collagens, a large protein family, form highly organized supramolecular assemblies in the extracellular space surrounding connective tissue cells. Although many collagen types form well characterized fibrils assembled by lateral aggregation of cross-linked collagen molecules, collagen VI is unique in forming an abundant microfibrillar extracellular network in virtually all connective tissues (see Refs. 1Kielty C.M.

Collagen VI has both cell adhesion properties and a diverse range of extracellular matrix protein binding activities, suggesting a critical bridging role between the cell and the pericellular matrix. Thus, although it is likely that collagen VI provides both structural integrity and key matrix regulatory signals, the precise role of collagen VI during extracellular matrix development and remodeling has not been elucidated. Collagen VI also differs from other collagens in that it is not secreted as a triple-helical monomer, but assembles intracellularly into antiparallel, overlapping dimers, which then align in a parallel manner to form tetramers that are secreted and aggregate to form extracellular microfibrils (5Colombatti A.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The component α-chains of collagen VI (α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI)) are complex multidomain polypeptides comprising short triple helical domains and large globular N- and C-terminal regions containing subdomains with sequence similarities to von Willebrand factor type A domains, fibronectin type III domains, Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, and several other recognized protein motifs (7Chu M.L.

The α3(VI) chain is much larger than the homologous α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains with an extended N-terminal globular domain (7Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R.

The collagen VI mRNAs can, however, be differentially regulated. Transforming growth factor-β and γ-interferon up-regulate and down-regulate α3(VI) mRNA, respectively (18Heckmann M. Aumailley M.

Likewise, α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs are more abundant than α3(VI) mRNA in corneal fibroblasts (14Chu M.L. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Pribula-Conway D. Hsu-Chen C.C. Bernard M.P. Timpl R. Eur. J.

Although sequence data suggest that collagen VI monomers composed of all three chains are required to allow the formation of stable higher order structures (21Chu M.L. Conway D. Pan T.C. Baldwin C. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18601-18606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility that these variations at the mRNA level may be reflected in the formation of alternative collagen VI isoforms with potentially different functions remains controversial. Assemblies apparently composed of only α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains (20Kielty C.M. Boot-Handford R.P. Ayad S. Shuttleworth C.A. Grant M.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or a predominance of α3(VI) chains (22Katagiri K. Takasaki S. Fujiwara S. Kayashima K. Ono T. Shinkai H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1996; 13: 37-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have been reported. It is important to determine the possible chain assembly isoforms to understand not only the normal biological roles of collagen VI, but also the affects of altered expression of collagen VI chains in diseases. For example, it has been proposed that triplication of the COL6A1 and COL6A2 genes and a subsequent stoichiometric disturbance of collagen VI chain composition may be responsible for some of the extracellular matrix manifestations of trisomy 21 (23Brand-Saberi B. Floel H. Christ B. Schulte-Vallentin M. Schindler H. Anatomischer Anzeiger. 1994; 176: 539-547Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Brand-Saberi B. Epperlein H.H. Romanos G.E. Christ B. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 277: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One way to address these questions directly and determine the role of the α3(VI) in regulating intracellular collagen VI assembly would be to examine assembly of α1(VI) and α2(VI) in the absence of α3(VI) chain expression. A mammalian cell line expressing only α1(VI) and α2(VI) would also be an important tool for assessing the role of helical and N- and C-terminal globular α3(VI) domains in molecular assembly, microfibril formation, and architecture, and in cell adhesion and interactions with other matrix molecules, by site-directed mutagenesis and stable expression. Ideally, to allow questions of collagen VI matrix deposition and interactions to be examined, the cell model system should be competent to make collagen VI microfibrils and capable of forming an extensive cross-linked fibrillar collagen matrixin vitro containing a “tissue equivalent” composition of other extracellular matrix components. These characteristics have not been identified in a cell line to date (25Colombatti A. Mucignat M.T. Bonaldo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13105-13111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we directly demonstrate the critical role of the α3(VI) chain in collagen VI assembly by characterization of the human SaOS-2 bone cell line, which is deficient in α3(VI) chain expression and produces no triple-helical collagen VI. However, the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains are abundantly expressed by SaOS-2, and we demonstrate that when low level expression of the endogenous α3(VI) is induced during long term culture, α3(VI) synthesis rescues the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains from degradation and allows secretion and deposition of collagen VI microfibrils within the fibrillar collagen matrix produced by these cells (26McQuillan D.J. Richardson M.D. Bateman J.F. Bone. 1995; 16: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To explore the α3(VI) domains important in molecular assembly, SaOS-2 cells were stably transfected with an α3(VI) cDNA construct, which lacked 4 of the 10 N-terminal type A subdomains. Despite the deletion, the α3(VI) N6–C5 chains retained the ability to associate with endogenous α1(VI) and α2(VI) and formed collagen VI dimers and tetramers, which were secreted and deposited into an extensive network in the extracellular matrix. These studies provide direct evidence that α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains do not form stable secreted assemblies and that α3(VI) expression is essential for the formation of functional collagen VI molecules, and demonstrate that α3(VI) subdomains N10–N7 are not required for molecular assembly. The α3(VI) expression construct was prepared by ligating previously characterized partial cDNA clones (7Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R. Mayer U. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of the α3(VI) cDNA was excised from clone FM22 by digesting withPflMI, which cuts within the C2 domain, and SalI, which cleaves within the polylinker of the Bluescript II vector (Stratagene). This 2.5-kilobase fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites of F376 to generate a cDNA encoding protein domains N2–C5. A SacII fragment of this clone was excised using sites within the triple helix and the Bluescript II polylinker, and ligated into the SacII-digested FO4 cDNA, producing a clone encoding domains N8–C5. A fragment coding for domains N6–C5 was excised from the N8–C5 clone by digesting with NheI, which cuts within the N7 domain, filling in the restriction site overhang with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, followed by cleavage at the 3′ NotI polylinker site. This fragment was ligated into the expression plasmid pRc/AC (27Mayer U. Poschl E. Nischt R. Specks U. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which had also been cleaved with NheI, made blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase I, and then digested with NotI. The resulting expression construct, α3(VI) N6–C5, encoded the BM-40 signal sequence, 54 amino acids of the α3(VI) N7 domain, domains N6–C5, and the 3′ untranslated region and polyadenylation sequence, in the vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), which also encodes the neomycin phosphotransferase gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418.

Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described previously (33Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). From confluence (day 0), the cell cultures were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and supplemented daily with sodium ascorbate to a final concentration of 0.25 mm (34Chan D.

SaOS-2 cells were transfected with the α3(VI) N6–C5 cDNA expression construct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into cell lines. G418 was removed from the culture medium after the fourth passage. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidine hydrochloride extraction method of Wake and Mercer (35Wake S.A. Mercer J.F.B. Biochem.

RNA samples were analyzed under denaturing conditions on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose or nylon filters (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Filters were hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) cDNA probes (P18, P1, and P24; Ref. 21Chu M.L. Conway D. Pan T.C. Baldwin C. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Biol.

Antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were raised against pepsin-digested collagen VI and, although they both recognized all three collagen VI subunits on Western blots, one precipitated only assemblies of α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the other precipitated both assembled and individual, unassociated α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains (39von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Wick G. Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Skin fibroblasts and SaOS-2 cells in 10-cm2 culture dishes were grown to confluence, supplemented with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate for 24 h, then biosynthetically labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label™ 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in methionine-free and serum-free DMEM containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was removed and added to an equal volume of 2× NET buffer (NET buffer is 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Protease inhibitors were included at the following final concentrations: 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 5 mm EDTA. The cell layer was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 containing 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF and 20 mm NEM. Cell lysates and medium samples were clarified by centrifugation and precleared with 30 μl of anti-fibronectin antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 μl of 20% Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of collagen VI antiserum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 μl of 20% Protein A-Sepharose for 18 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitated complexes washed two times for 30 min each with fresh NET buffer, then once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For pulse-chase experiments, confluent SaOS-2 cells were incubated overnight in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, then pulse-labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine. The labeling medium was removed, after which the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM containing 50 mm cold methionine and 0.25 mmsodium ascorbate, and then incubated in this chase medium for up to 24 h. Medium and cell layer fractions were harvested as above and the collagen VI immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of the collagen VI antiserum, which precipitates both assembled and unassociated α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains (39von der Mark H. Aumailley M. Wick G. Fleischmajer R. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated collagen VI was resuspended in 0.5 m acetic acid containing 100 μg/ml pepsin and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Digestion was terminated by lyophilization. At the appropriate time points, the matrix was harvested by rinsing the cell layer twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraping it into 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing fresh protease inhibitors (20 mm NEM, 1 mm PMSF, 25 mm EDTA). The insoluble matrix was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and rinsed briefly in cold distilled water containing protease inhibitors. The pellet was solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.5% (w/v) SDS and 8 m urea by heating at 80 °C for 5 min. Collagen VI chains were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and pepsinized type VI collagen on 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels along with [14C]methylated protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, samples were reduced before electrophoresis by the addition of dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 25 mm. Collagen VI dimers and tetramers were analyzed on 2.4% (w/v) acrylamide/0.5% (w/v) agarose composite gels (40Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. Slayter H.S. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) under non-reducing conditions. Molecular size standards were the reduced (230 kDa and 400 kDa) and unreduced (900 kDa) forms of laminin (Boehringer Mannheim). Radioactively labeled proteins were detected by fluorography (33Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 41Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or imaged using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, STORM™). For immunoblotting, collagen chains resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (Bio-Rad) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SaOS-2 cells were grown in eight-well chamber glass slides (Nunc Inc.) under culture conditions described above, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, then air-dried. Slides were incubated with either primary collagen VI antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) or non-immune rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature and bound antibody detected using fluorescein-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Slides were mounted in FluorSave™ reagent (Calbiochem) then viewed and photographed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. A range of cell lines capable of producing type I collagen and other extracellular matrix components were screened for collagen VI mRNA expression by Northern blotting. Two cell lines, NIH/3T3 and MC-3T3 E1, produced trace quantities of α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) mRNAs; Mov13 and 3T6 synthesized trace amounts of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA; and UMR 106 did not produce detectable levels of any collagen VI subunit mRNA (data not shown). Primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts, however, expressed abundant α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) mRNA (Fig. 1, b,d, and f, lane 1), reflecting the high level of expression of collagen VI in skin (16Olsen D.R. Peltonen J. Jaakkola S. Chu M.L. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Confluent SaOS-2 cells also produced α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA, at levels comparable to that of skin fibroblasts, but were totally deficient in α3(VI) transcription (Fig. 1 f, lane 2) (14Chu M.L. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Pribula-Conway D. Hsu-Chen C.C. Bernard M.P. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The SaOS-2 cell line was thus the only cell line examined that expressed α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs at relatively high levels, making it a potentially valuable tool for the analysis of collagen VI assembly in the absence of α3(VI), and subsequent stable transfection and expression of α3(VI) chains. SaOS-2 bone cells can be induced to lay down an extensive type I collagen matrix, which can mineralize in vitro by extended culture in the presence of sodium ascorbate (26McQuillan D.J. Richardson M.D. Bateman J.F. Bone. 1995; 16: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ascorbate is an essential cofactor for collagen hydroxylation and subsequent helix formation and secretion, and this technique has been used extensively to stimulate collagen matrix deposition and generatein vitro “tissue equivalent” extracellular matrices (34Chan D. Lamandé S.R. Cole W.G. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,42Lamandé S.R. Bateman J.F. Matrix. 1993; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Because during this ascorbate-induced matrix formation in vitro, major changes in collagen gene expression have been reported (34Chan D. Lamandé S.R. Cole W.G. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it was of importance to see if α3(VI) gene expression was influenced by long term culture and type I collagen matrix deposition. The changes in mRNA expression of the three α-chains over a 30-day culture period with sodium ascorbate is shown in Fig. 1. Steady-state levels of α1(VI) mRNA and α2(VI) mRNA remained constant over the first 10–12 days of culture (Fig. 1, b and d, lanes 2–6), but diminished significantly between days 15 and 30 (lanes 7 and 8). Although the steady state levels of α3(VI) mRNA remained below the level of detection under identical analytical conditions during the entire 30-day culture period (Fig. 1 f), overexposure of the Northern blots demonstrated that low level α3(VI) expression is gradually induced during the extended culture period (Fig. 1 g), with the highest levels of expression at days 15–30 (Fig. 1 g, lanes 7 and 8). Collagen VI matrix deposition during the 30-day culture period was assessed by immunoblotting of urea-extracted matrix using chain-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). Skin fibroblasts, which have steady state levels of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA similar to those in the SaOS-2 cells, produced an extensive collagen VI matrix by 8 days of culture (Fig. 2, a–c, lane 1). In contrast, α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains were not detected in the SaOS-2 extracellular matrix until day 15 (Fig. 2, b and c, lanes 2–6), despite the abundant synthesis of α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA. However, from day 15, which coincided with the induction of expression of α3(VI) mRNA, the SaOS-2 cells did produce a small amount of collagen VI matrix, which was detected at day 15 with just the α1(VI) antibody (Fig. 2 c, lanes 7), but by day 30 was detected by both the α1(VI) and α3(VI) antibodies (Fig. 2, b and c, lane 8).

Mice lacking the transcription factor NF-E2 display arrested megakaryocyte differentiation and profound thrombocytopenia. To study the heterodimeric NF-E2 protein in primary cells, we cultured mouse fetal livers with the c-Mpl ligand, obtained highly enriched megakaryocyte populations, and readily detected NF-E2 activity in nuclear extracts. As in erythroid cells, p45 NF-E2 is the only large subunit in primary megakaryocytes that dimerizes with distinct small Maf proteins to constitute a heterogeneous NF-E2 complex.

Although this represents the first example of differential small Maf protein expression among closely related blood lineages, the DNA-binding specificity of NF-E2 is similar in both cell types. Although the megakaryocyte protein preferentially binds an asymmetric AP-1-related motif, it also recognizes cAMP-responsive element-related sequences, albeit with lower affinity, and nucleotides outside the core sequence influence the DNA-protein interaction.

These results demonstrate the feasibility of biochemical studies on primary murine megakaryocytes and provide a basis to dissect the critical functions of NF-E2 in megakaryocyte differentiation. Megakaryocytes, which give rise to blood platelets, constitute an extremely rare subpopulation of cells in vivo. Therefore, despite the importance attached to the process by which megakaryocytes form and release platelets, molecular aspects of their development are poorly understood and have largely been studied in a few multipotential hematopoietic cell lines with limited megakaryocyte differentiation. The c-Mpl ligand (also known as thrombopoietin or the megakaryocyte growth and development factor) is the major cytokine that regulates megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation and raises platelet counts substantially in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 1Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 86: 419-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant c-Mpl ligand has facilitated in vitro culture of sufficient numbers of primary megakaryocytes to permit biochemical studies (2Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), partially relieving the dependence on transformed cell lines. However, studies on gene expression and transcription factors have not been reported in primary cells. Studies in immortalized cell lines suggest that several genes expressed specifically within megakaryocytes are regulated in part by a combination of transcription factors belonging to the GATA and Ets protein families (3Lemarchandel V. Ghysdael J. Mignotte V. Rahuel C. Romeo P.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Block K.L. Ravid K. Phung Q.H. Poncz M.

Indeed, mice with megakaryocyte-selective loss of GATA-1 activity are severely thrombocytopenic as a result of arrested megakaryocyte differentiation (6Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Analysis of megakaryocyte promoters per se has not consistently pointed to other proteins that may mediate lineage-specific gene expression and participate in platelet biogenesis. Like GATA-1, the transcription factor NF-E2 was originally identified through its interaction with critical cis-elements within the β-globin locus control region (7Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Talbot D. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NF-E2 is an obligate heterodimer between a 45-kDa hematopoietic restricted polypeptide (p45 NF-E2) and widely expressed ∼18-kDa proteins related to the avian oncogene v-maf; both subunits belong to the bZip (basic leucine zipper) family of transcriptional regulators (9Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5604-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although several lines of evidence point to NF-E2 as the major enhancer protein acting at the β-globin gene locus in developing erythroid cells, mice lacking p45 NF-E2 display only mild, albeit consistent, red blood cell abnormalities (12Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The most notable feature of these knockout mice is the virtual absence of circulating blood platelets, associated with arrested megakaryocyte maturation (13Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Thus, two distinct “erythroid” transcription factors play critical roles in proper megakaryocyte development and are required to generate normal platelets in vivo. In contrast to the biochemical basis of interactions between the monomeric GATA factors and their cognate DNA-binding sites (14Ko L. Engel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 15Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), our knowledge of NF-E2 interactions with DNA is more limited and is based exclusively on studies in erythroid cells (7Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Talbot D. Grosveld F.

Several aspects of the NF-E2 protein lend complexity to this question. First, at least in erythroid cells, NF-E2 recognizes the extended DNA sequenceGCTGA(G/C)TCA, which lacks dyad symmetry but includes the core symmetric AP-1 motif (underlined) known to bind dimers between the Jun and Fos subfamilies of bZip proteins. Second, there is the potential for variable dimerization between p45 NF-E2 and a number of small Maf proteins, which appear to dictate the binding site preference on DNA (10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, a number of p45 NF-E2-related polypeptides have been identified through molecular cloning (19Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11371-11375Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Caterina J.J. Donze D. Sun C.-W. Ciavatta D.J. Townes T.M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), although their interactions with specific DNA sequences have not been defined completely. These considerations raise the possibility that NF-E2·DNA complexes distinct from the one characterized in erythroleukemia cells may function within megakaryocytes in vivo. As attention turns to the mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia and arrested megakaryocyte differentiation in the absence of NF-E2, it is particularly important to establish the nature of this transcription factor in bona fide megakaryocytes. Here we report on our studies characterizing NF-E2 in primary murine megakaryocytes. Whole livers were recovered from mouse fetuses between embryonic days 13 and 15, and single cell suspensions were prepared by successive passage through 22- and 25-gauge needles. Fetal liver and mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Fetal liver cultures were further supplemented with 0.1 μg/ml polyethylene glycol-conjugated recombinant human c-Mpl ligand (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) or 1% tissue culture supernatant from a murine c-Mpl ligand producer cell line (generously provided by Dr. J.-L. Villeval) (24Villeval J.-L. Cohen-Solal K. Tulliez M. Giraudier S. Guichard J. Burstein S.A. Cramer E.M. Vainchenker W. Wendling F. Blood. 1997; 90: 4369-4383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 75% of the cultured megakaryocytes were harvested on the fifth day of culture; with further expansion of the remaining cells, almost the same number of cells were harvested on the eighth day, after which the culture was terminated. For most experiments, the entire culture of fetal liver cells was used without additional purification of megakaryocytes. To further enrich for megakaryocytes (see Fig. 2), fetal liver cultures containing 50–60% acetylcholinesterase-positive cells were depleted of non-megakaryocytic cells by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with the monoclonal antibodies Mac-1, GR-1, and TER-119 (Pharmingen, Los Angeles, CA), followed by addition of magnetic beads coated with sheep anti-rat IgG (Dynal A. S., Oslo, Norway) for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunodepleted cell fraction contained ≥90% large acetylcholinesterase-positive cells. Acetylcholinesterase activity was detected as described previously (25Jackson C.W. Blood. 1973; 42: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from native or cultured fetal liver and MEL cells were prepared according to a modification of previously described techniques (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 4 °C, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 10 s at 4 °C. Nuclear proteins were extracted over 20 min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol at 4 °C. Both incubations included protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm antipain; all from Sigma). The nuclear residue was eliminated by centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C. To reveal NF-E2·DNA complexes, nuclear extracts (2.5–5.0 μg) were incubated in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol for 5 min in a volume of 14 μl at ambient temperature. One μl of 5′-end-radiolabeled NF-E2 probe (25,000–50,000 cpm) was added before further incubation for 15 min at ambient temperature. Complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at room temperature and detected by autoradiography. GATA-1·DNA complexes were studied as described previously (15Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), with incubations and electrophoresis at 4 °C. For competition experiments, a variable (see Fig. 7) or 100-fold (all other experiments) molar excess of unlabeled self- or modified oligonucleotide was incubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. Besides the competitors used in Fig. 6, which are specified therein and also described elsewhere (9Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the following oligonucleotides were used (modified nucleotides are in boldface).Figure 6Comparison of NF-E2 DNA-binding specificity in primary megakaryocytes and erythroid cells.

The previously determined consensus binding site for NF-E2 is boxed, and altered nucleotides are underlined. Oligonucleotides 2–6 and 9 were derived from promoter sequences (9Andrews N.C.

Only the relevant portion of the autoradiogram, with 90° clockwise rotation relative to all other figures, is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For antibody super shift assays, extracts were incubated with antisera for 20 min at ambient temperature before addition of the radiolabeled probe. The anti-p45NF-E2 rabbit antisera are directed against either full-length murine protein (p45A) (10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or a peptide corresponding to amino acids 40–56 (p45N; kindly provided by Paul Ney). Rabbit anti-MafG antiserum was raised against a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 1–162 of human MafG (27Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cross-reacts weakly with p18/MafK and possibly with MafF as well. Anti-GATA-1 monoclonal antibody N6 and anti-p18/MafK, anti-c-Jun family, and anti-c-Fos family antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were performed according to standard protocols (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). 20–40 μg of nuclear extract from MEL cells or primary cultured megakaryocytes was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; transferred to nitrocellulose; and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p45 NF-E2, anti-MafG, or anti-p18/MafK antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes, incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for 1 h, and five additional washes, the bound antibodies were detected using an enzymatic chemiluminescence kit (Amersham International) and exposure to Reflections autoradiography film (NEN Life Science Products). The anti-MafK blot was exposed approximately five times longer than the anti-MafG and anti-p45 NF-E2 blots. To date, knowledge about gene regulation in megakaryocytes has derived almost exclusively from experiments conducted in immortalized cell lines. To initiate studies on transcription factor structure and function in primary murine megakaryocytes, we cultivated fetal liver cells in the presence of fetal calf serum and recombinant c-Mpl ligand for several days. Within 3–4 days into the culture, megakaryocytes, identified by their large size and acetylcholinesterase activity, were the predominant differentiated cell; although at 5 days, they constituted 50–60% of all viable nonadherent cells (Fig. 1,A and B), their substantially increased DNA content suggested that nuclear extracts from the mixed culture probably contained >90% megakaryocyte-derived proteins. Nuclear extracts prepared from nonadherent cells at 5 or 8 days included an abundant quantity of the erythroid-megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA-1, as detected by binding of this monomeric zinc finger protein to a radiolabeled specific probe in EMSAs (Fig. 1 C). Hence, megakaryocytes cultured directly from mouse fetal livers constitute a useful source of nuclear proteins for biochemical and functional studies. The bZip transcription factor NF-E2 plays an essential role in late megakaryocyte maturation and thrombocytopoiesis (13Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar); however, this heterodimeric protein has only been characterized in erythroid cells, where it fulfills distinct functions in vivo. As with nuclear extracts from MEL cells, from which the p45·p18 NF-E2 complex was originally isolated (9Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), extracts prepared from cultured primary megakaryocytes readily revealed DNA-binding activity for oligonucleotides derived either from the promoter of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene (Fig. 2 A) or from DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 of the β-globin locus control region (oligonucleotide HS2NFE2X2) (data not shown). In contrast to MEL cells, the DNA-protein complexes formed by megakaryocyte nuclear extracts on these probes were virtually limited to the doublet previously identified as the NF-E2 heterodimer. The slower migrating complex that includes c-Jun, c-Fos, and possibly other related bZip proteins in MEL cells (AP-1) (Fig. 2 A) was barely detected in megakaryocytes, although it was clearly present in whole fetal liver extracts prior to culture with the c-Mpl ligand, when erythroid cells predominated (for example, see Fig. 6 below). This difference underscores the lack of significant contamination of these nuclear extracts by non-megakaryocyte proteins. Indeed, the results from EMSAs performed with nuclear extracts prepared from cultures in which contaminating cells were depleted to achieve ≥90% purity of mature megakaryocytes were indistinguishable from the results obtained when no additional purification was performed (Fig. 2 B). To avoid the substantially lower cell yield associated with immunopurification, this step was therefore omitted for most of the experiments described here. Although hematopoietic cells derived from the fetal liver, including megakaryocytes, typically manifest a greater proliferation potentialin vitro than cells from adult tissues, bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes can also be cultured to high purity in the presence of the c-Mpl ligand (2Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from wild-type cultured bone marrow-derived megakaryocytes also display NF-E2 DNA-binding activity; as expected, this activity was missing in megakaryocytes cultured from p45 NF-E2 knockout mice (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the latter extracts did not contain a detectable amount of any alternate NF-E2 DNA binding activity, whereas GATA-1 protein levels were normal (Fig. 3 B). Thus, megakaryocytes cultured from various tissue sources and from single adult mice harbor a specific DNA-binding activity on NF-E2 oligonucleotides that is absent in cells cultured from p45 NF-E2 null mice. In erythroid cells, the NF-E2 heterodimer is composed of p45 and p18 subunits. Three distinct genes that are homologous to p45 NF-E2,Nrf1 (also known as LCR-F1), Nrf2 (forNF-E2-related factors 1 and 2) and Ech, have been isolated (19Chan J.Y. Han X.-L. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl.

A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 30Farmer S.C. Sun C.-W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L.M. Townes T.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 786-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Maf family encompasses at least three small proteins that can heterodimerize with p45 NF-E2 and related proteins in vitro and in vivo, including MafK (the avian homologue of p18 NF-E2), MafG, and MafF (31Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar, 32Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, a heterogeneity of DNA-protein complexes is possible at relevant cis-elements. To investigate the composition of the NF-E2 complex in primary megakaryocytes, we included a set of antibodies directed against p45 NF-E2 and the different Maf proteins in the EMSA reactions. Addition of two distinct anti-p45 antisera abolished the NF-E2 DNA-protein complex in both MEL cells and primary megakaryocytes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3,4, 10, and 11). Together with the finding obtained with p45 NF-E2−/− megakaryocytes (Fig. 3), these results establish that p45 NF-E2 is the only large subunit contributing to the dominant complex in primary megakaryocytes. A specific anti-p18/MafK antibody and an anti-MafG antiserum (27Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), each, inhibited formation of the NF-E2·DNA complex, whereas the combination of these reagents abrogated the NF-E2·DNA complex completely (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5–7 and 12–14). This indicates that the polypeptides recognized by these antibodies together account for all the small subunits constituting the NF-E2 protein complex in primary megakaryocytes as well as MEL cells. Notably, the anti-MafG antiserum consistently displayed a greater effect on the NF-E2 complex in primary megakaryocytes compared with that in MEL cells (Fig. 4 A,lanes 5 and 12). In contrast, the anti-p18/MafK antibody had a reproducibly lesser effect on the complex in primary megakaryocytes compared with that in MEL cells (Fig. 4 A,lanes 6 and 13). Taken together, these findings suggest that the NF-E2 protein complex in primary megakaryocytes has a lesser contribution from the p18/MafK subunit compared with the complex in MEL cells. Immunoblot analysis further revealed that this observation directly reflects differences in the relative amounts of small Maf proteins between the two cell types. The ratio of p18/MafK to other small Maf proteins is high in MEL cells, whereas the converse is true for primary megakaryocytes (Fig. 4 B). The level of p45 NF-E2 was equivalent in the two cell types. These data represent the first example of differential expression of small Maf proteins among closely related hematopoietic lineages and raise the possibility that p45 NF-E2 function in diverse cell types may be mediated in part through distinct complexes with small Maf proteins and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The specificity of DNA binding by the NF-E2 heterodimer depends not only on p45, which recognizes the (C/G)TCA half-site, but also on the small Maf subunit, which binds to the larger GCTGA(C/G) half-site (10Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 16Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To establish the binding specificity of the NF-E2 complex in primary megakaryocytes, we tested the ability of various modified oligonucleotides to compete for binding between the standard probe and nuclear extracts from these cells. With four different oligonucleotides modified either within the AP-1 core sequence (M2 and M4) or in the extended half-site that distinguishes NF-E2 binding from AP-1 (M1 and M3), the pattern of competition was similar between MEL cells and primary megakaryocytes (Fig. 5). Notably, however, oligonucleotide M3, which competes effectively for binding to the p45·p18 complex purified from MEL cells (9Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), consistently competed less well when crude nuclear extracts from either MEL cells or primary megakaryocytes were used in the EMSA (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 11). To identify any potential differences in DNA-binding specificity between erythroid cells and megakaryocytes, we further used an extended panel of 22 oligonucleotides. Again, no significant differences in NF-E2 binding were seen in nuclear extracts from MEL cells, uncultured fetal liver (FL, representing primary erythroid cells), and primary megakaryocytes (Fig. 6). Hence, the observed difference in small Maf subunit abundance between MEL cells and primary megakaryocytes (Fig. 4) does not translate into discernible differences in DNA-binding specificity between erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. The present resolution of the NF-E2·DNA complex therefore suggests that the various Maf homologues impart overlapping rather than exclusive DNA-binding specificities. Finally, oligonucleotides 6, 8, and 17 (Fig. 6), which have an intact NF-E2 core recognition sequence, competed only partially for binding to the NF-E2 protein, indicating that residues outside the previously established consensus sequence (9Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar,27Blank V. Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can also influence the DNA-protein interaction. The demonstrated importance of NF-E2 in megakaryocyte maturation has spurred interest in identifying its direct transcriptional targets. Because one criterion that candidate target genes must fulfill is the presence of an NF-E2-responsive site in a cis-regulatory element, it is important to define the spectrum of DNA sequences that can bind the NF-E2 protein complex found in primary megakaryocytes. AP-1-related bZip proteins can recognize both AP-1 sites and the cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE), and NF-E2 heterodimers assembled from"

Whereas insulin activated both PKN and PKC-ζ, GTPγS activated PKN but not PKC-ζ. In transfection studies in 3T3/L1 cells, stable expression of wild-type Rho and PKN activated glucose transport, and dominant-negative forms of Rho and PKN inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport.

Our findings suggest that (a) GTPγS and insulin activate Rho, PI 3-kinase, and PKN, albeit by different mechanisms; (b) each of these signaling substances appears to be required for, and may contribute to, increases in glucose transport; and (c) PKC-ζ may contribute to increases in glucose transport during insulin, but not GTPγS, action.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26000-26006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby GTPγS and insulin activate GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport, however, are unclear. In 3T3/L1 cells, unlike insulin, GTPγS was not found to activate cytosolic phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (3Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M.

In keeping with the latter possibility, small G-proteins in the Rab group are present in GLUT4 vesicles, appear to translocate or mobilize in response to insulin stimulation (4Cormont M. Tanti J.F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and could act as direct mediators for GTPγS stimulation of glucose transport; accordingly, GTPγS-stimulated glucose transport is only partly inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, in 3T3/L1 adipocytes (5Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and GTPγS therefore appears to act, at least partially, independently of PI 3-kinase in 3T3/L1 cells. On the other hand, we have recently found that the small G-protein, RhoA, is activated by insulin in rat adipocytes, and, based uponClostridium botulinum C3 transferase sensitivity, Rho appears to be required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in these cells (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Further, it seems clear that Rho is directly activated by GTPγS in rat adipocytes, since it was found that the addition of GTPγS to rat adipocyte homogenates stimulates the translocation of Rho to plasma membranes and Rho-dependent activation of phospholipase D (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Of further note, it has been reported that GTP-Rho directly activates PI 3-kinase in some (7Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not all (8Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), cell-free systems. Presently, we examined the possibility that GTPγS activates PI 3-kinase via Rho in rat adipocytes. We also examined the role of Rho, PI 3-kinase, and protein kinases that are known to be downstream of Rho and PI 3-kinase (e.g. PKN and protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ)) in the activation of glucose transport during treatment of rat adipocytes with GTPγS or insulin. Our findings suggested that (a) both GTPγS and insulin, albeit by different mechanisms, activate Rho, PI 3-kinase, and PKN; and (b) each of these factors may be required for, and may contribute to, the activation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Rat adipocytes were prepared by collagenase digestion of epididymal fat pads obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 200–250 g, as described previously (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The adipocytes were suspended in glucose-free Krebs Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for acute incubations, or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for overnight incubations. GTPγS (Sigma or ICN) and C. botulinum C3 transferase (List) were introduced into adipocytes (in 25 or 50% suspensions, cell volume/total volume) by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar; 350 V and 960 microfarads with a time constant of 12 ms) in either an intracellular buffer (118 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm Mg2SO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm sodium pyruyate, 25 mm HEPES, and 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) or in DMEM, respectively, as described in the text. Glucose transport was measured in adipocytes suspended (6%, cell volume/total volume) in glucose-free KRP buffer as described by Karnam et al. (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Where indicated, inhibitor (wortmannin, Sigma; LY294002, Biomol; RO 31-8220, Alexis) was added to the incubation 15 min prior to agonist addition. The cells were then treated with vehicle alone (control), insulin (Elanco), or the indicated concentrations of GTPγS. In the case of GTPγS treatment, immediately following electroporation in intracellular buffer (see above), the cells were diluted with glucose-free KRP buffer containing indicated inhibitor concentrations. After 30 min of treatment with vehicle (controls), 10 nm insulin, or 0–500 μm GTPγS, the uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (2-DOG; 0.1 mm; NEN Life Science Products) was measured over a 1-min period as described (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In these assays, it should be noted that cytochalasin B blank values, which reflect trapping of medium or nonspecific uptake, were relatively small (approximately 10% of stimulated values) and were not influenced significantly by electroporation or overnight incubation. In cells that were assayed directly without electroporation, insulin-induced increases in the uptake of 2-DOG generally ranged from 4- to 10-fold. In cells that were electroporated and then immediately assayed, there usually was a small, but variable, increase in basal 2-DOG uptake, with little or no change in maximal insulin-stimulated values; consequently, the relative effect of insulin on 2-DOG uptake generally tended to be slightly less, i.e. approximately 2–3-fold, in electroporated adipocytes (this is illustrated in Fig. 8). Overnight incubation of adipocytes also increased basal transport activity, and the relative insulin effect was similarly diminished to approximately 2–3-fold in these cells. However, the effect of combined electroporation and overnight incubation on 2-DOG uptake was not significantly different from that of either electroporation or overnight incubation alone, since insulin effects on 2-DOG uptake were also approximately 2–3-fold in these cells. Effects of transiently transfected Rho and PKN on GLUT4 translocation were measured in rat adipocytes co-transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged GLUT4, as described by Quon et al.(10Quon M.J.

In brief, adipocytes (as a 50% suspension in DMEM) were electroporated in the presence of eukaryotic expression vector pCIS2 containing cDNA encoding HA-tagged GLUT4 (kindly supplied by Drs. Michael Quon and Simeon Taylor) and either (a) pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) eukaryotic expression vector alone or pCDNA3 containing cDNA encoding (i) wild-type Rho (kindly supplied by Dr. David Lambeth), (ii) V14 mutant, constitutive Rho (kindly supplied by Dr. Alan Hall), or (iii) dominant negative Rho (kindly supplied by Dr. Gary Bokoch); or (b) pTB701 eukaryotic expression vector alone or pTB701 containing cDNA encoding (i) wild-type or (ii) dominant negative, kinase-inactive mutant forms of PKN (prepared by Dr. Ono). After overnight incubation to allow time for expression of cDNA inserts (see Refs. 10Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

Blank values (nonspecific binding), obtained by incubating cells transfected with vectors alone (i.e. without the HA-GLUT4 and other inserts), were subtracted from values observed in cells in which HA-GLUT4 was expressed. In each experiment, a single batch of adipocytes was used, so that the level of HA-tagged GLUT4 was identical in each experimental group, and treatment groups could be directly compared with each other. Absolute values of 125I bound per 106 cells varied somewhat from experiment to experiment, depending upon the batches of antibodies used and the level of 125I in the second antibody; nevertheless, relative changes induced by GTPγS, insulin, and other treatments were similar in all experiments. Effects of stably transfected, wild-type Rho or PKN on glucose transport (2-DOG uptake) and membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity were evaluated in 3T3/L1 fibroblasts and/or adipocytes, using transfection methods described previously (12Bandyopadhyay B.

Effects of dominant negative forms of Rho and PKN were also studied in 3T3/L1 fibroblasts, but these forms inhibited adipogenesis, thus precluding experiments with plasmids containing these cDNA inserts in 3T3/L1 adipocytes. In these stable transfection experiments, all cells (untransfected controls or cells transfected with pCDNA3 vector alone or pCDNA3 containing cDNAs encoding Rho (supplied by Dr. David Lambeth) or PKN (supplied by Dr. Peter Parker)) were grown, differentiated, and assayed simultaneously. As in previous transfection studies (12Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), all reported clones (selected by G418 resistance) were shown to contain immunoreactive GLUT4 and GLUT1 levels that were indistinguishable from those observed in untransfected control cells; consequently, alterations in glucose transport in Rho or PKN-transfected cells could not be ascribed to changes in levels of GLUT4 or GLUT1. In some experiments, a tetracycline-inducible system (CLONTECH, Tet-On kit) was used to turn on the expression of transfected, wild-type Rho in 3T3/L1 fibroblasts 72 h prior to measurement of 2-DOG uptake (described more fully in text, see Fig. 7). Immunoreactive Rho, GLUT4, GLUT1, PI 3-kinase, and HA-tagged moietes were blotted using methods described previously (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase enzyme activity was measured either in total membranes or in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates of rat adipocytes or 3T3/L1 adipocytes, as described previously (13Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Galloway L. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ enzyme activity was measured as described (12Bandyopadhyay B. Standaert M.L.

To measure immunoprecipitable PKN enzyme activity, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 20 mmTris/HCl (pH, 7.5), 1.2 mm EGTA; 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm NaF, 3 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 μm Microcystin-LR (Calbiochem). Rabbit anti-PKN polyclonal antibody (raised in Dr. Ono's laboratories) was added in sufficient amounts to quantitatively precipitate PKN from 300 μg of lysate protein. After overnight incubation at 0–4 °C, the precipitate was collected on Sepharose A/G beads (Santa Cruz Laboratories), washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH, 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then incubated at 30 °C for 6 min in the presence of 40 μm serine-25 PKC-α pseudosubstrate (Life Technologies) and 50 μm ATP containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted on p81 filter paper, washed in 30% acetic acid, and counted for 32P. It may be noted that phosphatidylserine was not present in PKN assays, and, moreover, PKN activity was not increased by the addition of phosphatidylserine, Ca2+, or diolein: it may therefore be surmised that PKN immunoprecipitates were not contaminated with significant amounts of conventional, novel, or atypical PKCs. As shown in Fig. 1, electroporation of rat adipocytes in the presence of increasing amounts of GTPγS led to dose-related increases in 2-DOG uptake. At a concentration of 500 μm, GTPγS-stimulated increases in 2-DOG uptake were in most cases slightly less than those of insulin, as measured in cells electroporated in parallel. We did not attempt to use higher concentrations of GTPγS, but it may be noted that we probably did not reach maximal transport rates with 500 μm GTPγS, electroporation opens membrane pores only fleetingly, and intracellular GTPγS concentrations were most likely less than those present in the electroporation buffer. In addition to increasing glucose transport, 500 μm GTPγS provoked increases in the translocation of HA-tagged GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (cell surface125I-labeled anti-HA antibody (reflecting the level of exofacial HA-tagged GLUT4) was 1772 ± 238 (n = 4)versus 3748 ± 321 (n = 6) cpm/106 cells (p < 0.005, ttest), control versus GTPγS, respectively); these increases in HA-GLUT4 translocation were in some experimental groups similar to those provoked by insulin (viz. approximately 2-fold) or, in some groups (e.g. see below), slightly less. Since PI 3-kinase is required for insulin effects on glucose transport, it was of interest to see if inhibitors of PI-3-kinase altered the effects of GTPγS on 2-DOG uptake. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, both 100 nm wortmannin and 100 μm LY294002, (concentrations that fully inhibit PI 3-kinase) fully inhibited GTPγS-stimulated, as well as insulin-stimulated, 2-DOG uptake. These findings suggested that GTPγS, like insulin, requires PI 3-kinase for the activation of glucose transport in rat adipocytes. We have previously reported that the effects of insulin on glucose transport are blocked by C. botulinum C3 transferase, which specifically ADP-ribosylates, inhibits, and, after overnight incubation of rat adipocytes, leads to a complete loss of immunoreactive RhoA in these cells (see Ref. 6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, overnight C3 transferase treatment blocked subsequent effects of both GTPγS and insulin on 2-DOG uptake in rat adipocytes. These results (as well as results from transfection studies; see below) suggested that Rho is required for the effects of GTPγS, as well as insulin, on glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Since wortmannin and LY294002 fully blocked the effects of both GTPγS and insulin on 2-DOG uptake in the rat adipocyte, we questioned whether GTPγS activates PI 3-kinase. As shown in Fig. 2, both GTPγS and insulin provoked increases in membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity in rat adipocytes. Interestingly, C3 transferase blocked the activating effect of GTPγS, but not insulin, on membrane-associated PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2 C). Also, insulin-induced increases in PI 3-kinase immunoreactivity and enzyme activity that are specifically associated with IRS-1, were not blocked by C3 transferase treatment (Fig. 3). These findings suggested that activating effects of insulin on PI 3-kinase, both in total membranes and as specifically activated through IRS-1 in the rat adipocyte, were not dependent upon Rho. On the other hand, activating effects of GTPγS on membrane-associated PI 3-kinase in the rat adipocyte appeared to be fully dependent upon Rho. In keeping with a role for Rho in PI 3-kinase activation, as described below, stable overexpression of Rho in 3T3/L1 adipocytes led to increases in membrane-associated PI 3-kinase activity.Figure 3Effects of C3 transferase on insulin (INS)-stimulated PI 3-kinase in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (IP). Adipocytes were electroporated in DMEM with or without 0.5 μg/ml C3 transferase and incubated overnight to deplete immunoreactive Rho (see Ref. 6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in C3 transferase-treated cells. The cells were then equilibrated in glucose-free KRP medium and treated for 15 min with or without 300 nm insulin. After incubation, IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates, and precipitates were examined for p85 immunoreactivity (A and C) or PI 3-kinase enzyme activity (B and D). Shown here are immunoblots and autoradiograms that are representative of four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Considerable evidence suggests that one or more protein kinases, apparently distal to PI 3-kinase, is (are) required for insulin stimulation of glucose transport. For example, we have previously shown that the bisindolemaleimide-type PKC inhibitor, RO 31-8220, inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport, without inhibiting the activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin (15Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Arnold T. Saba-Siddique S. Cooper D.R. Watson J. Zhou X. Galloway L. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found (14Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) that (a) RO 31-8220 inhibits recombinant PKC-α, -β1, -β2, -γ, -δ, -ε, -η, and -ζ with IC50 values of approximately 40, 20, 15, 15, 30, 100, 20 and 1000–4000 nm, respectively, and that (b) of these PKCs inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake in intact adipocytes by RO 31-8220 correlates best with the inhibition of PKC-ζ (IC50 of approximately 4 μm, with nearly full inhibition at 20–30 μm). Presently, we found that RO 31-8220 inhibited immunoprecipitated PKN with an IC50 of approximately 30 nm (Fig. 4). Although the exact identity of the RO 31-8220-sensitive kinase that is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport is not certain, it was of interest to find that RO 31-8220 inhibited the effects of GTPγS, as well as insulin, on 2-DOG uptake in intact rat adipocytes (Fig. 5). However, the concentrations of RO 31-8220 that were required to inhibit GTPγS effects on 2-DOG uptake were considerably less (IC50 < 1 μm) than those required for inhibition of insulin effects (IC50= 5 μm) on 2-DOG uptake in the rat adipocyte (Fig. 5). It therefore seems likely that different RO 31-8220-sensitive protein kinases are required for glucose transport effects of GTPγS and insulin in the rat adipocyte.Figure 5Dose-related effects of RO 31-8220 on GTPγS-stimulated and insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake in rat adipocytes. Adipocytes were incubated in the presence of 0, 0.3, 1, 5, and 20 μm RO 31-8220 for 15 min prior to electroporation and treatment with 10 nm insulin (open circles) or 500 μm GTPγS (solid circles). Values are means of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inasmuch as RO 31-8220 does not inhibit the activity or activation of PI 3-kinase in the rat adipocyte (15Standaert M.L. Avignon A. Arnold T. Saba-Siddique S. Cooper D.R. Watson J. Zhou X. Galloway L. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as alluded to above, it may be surmised that one or more protein kinases, distinct from PI 3-kinase, is required during the activation of glucose transport. Accordingly, we questioned whether GTPγS or insulin activates PKC-ζ or PKN, i.e.kinases that appear to be downstream of PI 3-kinase and/or Rho. Whereas insulin (see Ref. 14Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar for more detailed studies) activated PKC-ζ, GTPγS, if anything, diminished the activity of immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ in intact adipocytes (Table I). In addition, GTPγS, unlike insulin, failed to activate PKB (data not shown). On the other hand, GTPγS activated immunoprecipitable PKN mildly (23%), but significantly, in intact adipocytes (Table II) and more dramatically in adipocyte homogenates (Table III). (Note that the in vitro incubation of adipocyte homogenate in low Mg2+ conditions prior to immunoprecipitation markedly lowered basal immunoprecipitable PKN activity, and this probably facilitated the observance of greater relative effects of GTPγS in the cell-free system.) Similarly, insulin provoked approximately 60% increases in immunoprecipitable PKN activity throughout a 1–10-min treatment period in intact rat adipocytes, and these increases were blocked by C3 transferase, but not by wortmannin (Fig. 6). Thus, in keeping with our previous report that PI 3-kinase is not required for insulin stimulation of GTP-loading of Rho (6Karnam P. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6136-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), PI 3-kinase did not appear to be required for insulin-induced activation of PKN. Also, in keeping with the possibility that PKN is downstream of Rho, Rho appeared to be required for insulin-induced activation of PKN.Table IEffects of GTPγS and insulin on immunoprecipitable PKC-ζ activity in rat adipocytesTreatment (10 min)PKC-ζ activitycpm/immunoprecipitateNone5171 ± 244 (8)10 nm insulin8927 ± 910 (5) (p < 0.005 vs. no treatment)500 μm GTPγS3510 ± 147 (4) Open table in a new tab Table IIEffects of GTPγS on immunoprecipitable PKN activity in intact rat adipocytesTreatmentPKN activitycpm/immunoprecipitateNone20138 ± 822 (12)500 μm GTPγS24705 ± 947 (12) (p < 0.005 vs. no treatment) Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffects of GTPγS on immunoprecipitable PKN activity in rat adipocyte homogenatesTreatmentPKN activitycpm/immunoprecipitateNone310 ± 171 (5)20 μm GTPγS3905 ± 369 (6) (p < 0.001 vs. no treatment) Open table in a new tab Since our findings with C3 transferase suggested that Rho is required for (a) GTPγS- and insulin-induced increases in glucose transport and (b) GTPγS-induced increases in PI 3-kinase, we questioned whether Rho itself could provoke increases in PI 3-kinase activity and glucose transport and/or GLUT4 translocation. To pursue these questions and to further examine the requirement for Rho in glucose transport, we used several transfection approaches. First, in both 3T3/L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, t"

Mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 was also expressed in McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells. In addition to a 3-fold higher in vitro serine-exchange activity, these cells also exhibited enhanced choline- and ethanolamine-exchange activities and incorporated more [3H]serine into PtdSer than did control cells. However, the levels of PtdSer and PtdEtn in cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase-1 activity were not increased. Excess PtdSer produced by the transfected cells was rapidly decarboxylated to PtdEtn and the degradation of PtdSer, and/or PtdEtn derived from PtdSer, was increased. Moreover, the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn biosynthesis was inhibited.

In addition to a presumed structural role in membranes, PtdSer is required for activation of protein kinase C (1Nishizuka Y.

PtdSer exposure on the cell surface also serves as a signal for recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages (4Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M.

The pathway by which PtdSer is synthesized in eukaryotes is different from that in bacteria (7Okada M. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K. J.

Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cloned cDNA in PSA-3 cells showed that the enzyme catalyzed a base-exchange reaction with serine, choline, and ethanolamine. Immunoblot analysis (11Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that PtdSer synthase-1 is present in both microsomes and mitochondria-associated membranes (12Vance J.E. J.

Although the cDNAs for PtdSer synthase-1 and -2 share little similarity, the corresponding amino acid sequences are 32% identical. Expression of PtdSer synthase-2 cDNA showed that, as predicted, this enzyme uses PtdEtn, but not PtdCho, as phosphatidyl group donor. The PtdSer synthase-2 cDNA also transformed PSA-3 cells, which lacked PtdSer synthase-1 activity, into PtdSer prototrophs (13Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol.

In M.9.1.1 cells, the PtdSer synthase activity is ∼50% that of parental CHO-K1 cells (14Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, in M.9.1.1 cells that are deprived of ethanolamine, and therefore are unable to make PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (Fig. 1), PtdSer and PtdEtn levels are lower than in CHO-K1 cells. The growth defect of M.9.1.1 cells is overcome when ethanolamine, PtdSer, lyso-PtdEtn, or PtdEtn are included in the culture medium. M.9.1.1 cells also do not utilize PtdCho as a substrate for PtdSer biosynthesis, although PtdEtn is converted into PtdSer almost as efficiently as in wild-type CHO-K1 cells. Therefore, the primary defect in M.9.1.1 cells was deduced to be in the PtdCho-dependent synthesis of PtdSer (14Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PtdSer synthesized on the ER is transported to mitochondria and decarboxylated to PtdEtn by the enzyme PtdSer decarboxylase (Fig. 1) (15Dennis E.A. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 263-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all mitochondrial PtdEtn in CHO cells is synthesizedin situ in mitochondria by this reaction (16Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PtdEtn is also synthesized on the ER by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (Fig. 1) (17Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, ethanolamine is first phosphorylated by ethanolamine kinase to phosphoethanolamine, which is converted to CDP-ethanolamine by CTP:ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (ET). In the final step of the pathway, CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase transfers phosphoethanolamine from CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol to produce PtdEtn. A third, and quantitatively minor, pathway for the biosynthesis of PtdEtn is the base-exchange reaction (6Hübscher H.G. Dils R.R. Pover W.F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 36: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The relative importance of the two major pathways for PtdEtn biosynthesis appears to depend on the cell type. In some studies, for example in rat liver (18Sundler R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,19Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1275-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and hamster heart (20Zelinski T.A. Choy P.C. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), PtdEtn has been reported to be synthesized primarily via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, although in another study Yeung and Kuksis (21Yeung S.K.F. Kuksis A. Lipids. 1976; 11: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) found that the decarboxylation of PtdSer was the major route of PtdEtn biosynthesis in rat liver. Other cells, such as CHO and BHK-21 cells, synthesize at least 80% of their PtdEtn from PtdSer decarboxylation, even in the presence of ethanolamine (22Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2669-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Miller M.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all these studies difficulties in measurement of pool sizes and possible non-homogeneous radiolabeling of lipid precursor pools complicate interpretation of the data. Several cell types, for example rat mammary carcinoma cells (24Kano-Sueoka T. Cohen D.M. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Mori M. Fujiki H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5741-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), hybridoma cells (25Murakami H. Masui H. Sato G.H. Sueoka N. Chow T.P. Kano-Sueoka T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), and human keratinocytes (26Kano-Sueoka T. Errick J.E. King D. Walsh L.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), have an absolute requirement for ethanolamine for growth and/or proliferation (27Sasaki H. Kume H. Nemoto A. Narisawa S. Takahashi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7320-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One cannot, however, conclude that the ethanolamine requirement of these cells is necessarily for PtdEtn synthesis, since ethanolamine is also used for the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of proteins (28Menon A.K. Stevens V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15277-15280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Little information is available on how PtdSer biosynthesis is regulated and whether or not the two pathways for PtdEtn synthesis are coordinately regulated. We have therefore cloned and expressed a cDNA that encodes mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1. First, we demonstrate that this cDNA complements the ethanolamine auxotrophy of M.9.1.1 mutant CHO-K1 cells. We also show that when PtdSer synthesis is increased severalfold in hepatoma cells overexpressing mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA, PtdSer and PtdEtn levels remain the same as in control cells. Apparently, as compensation for overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 activity, the catabolism of PtdSer and/or PtdSer-derived PtdEtn is increased, and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn biosynthesis is inhibited.DISCUSSIONWe report the cloning and expression of a cDNA that encodes PtdSer synthase-1 from mouse liver and show that the PtdSer synthesis and/or decarboxylation pathways can coordinately regulate the production of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway.As evidence that the cloned cDNA encoded PtdSer synthase-1, the cDNA for mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 was heterologously expressed in M.9.1.1 cells that are mutant CHO cells deficient in PtdSer synthase-1 activity (14Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA was expressed, the ethanolamine auxotrophy of the M.9.1.1 cells was eliminated, the base exchange activities with serine, choline, and ethanolamine were increased, and the levels of PtdSer and PtdEtn were restored to normal. In addition, expression of mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 in McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells resulted in increasedin vitro base exchange activity and an increased rate of incorporation of [3H]serine into PtdSer and PtdEtn in intact cells. These observations are consistent with previous data showing that a PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA from CHO-K1 cells complemented the ethanolamine auxotrophy of a mutant CHO cell line, PSA-3 (10Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our studies in McArdle hepatoma cells imply that the metabolism of PtdSer and PtdEtn is coordinately regulated so that cellular levels of these lipids remain constant. When PtdSer synthase-1 activity was overexpressed, homeostasis of PtdSer and PtdEtn was maintained by the following: (i) increased conversion of PtdSer to PtdEtn, (ii) increased degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdEtn derived from PtdSer, and (iii) inhibition of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn synthesis. These findings are reminiscent of those from a study in which CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of PtdCho biosynthesis via the CDP-choline pathway, was overexpressed in COS cells (49Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a greatly increased rate of PtdCho synthesis in these transfected cells, the mass of PtdCho was barely increased. However, the rate of PtdCho degradation was increased, presumably as a mechanism for maintaining a constant level of PtdCho. Similarly, overexpression of E. coli PtdSer synthase in E. coli did not alter the phospholipid composition of these cells (50Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The increased conversion of PtdSer to PtdEtn in cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase is most likely the direct result of increased PtdSer synthesis. Production of PtdSer-derived PtdEtn appears not to be limited by the activity of the decarboxylase but rather by availability of the substrate, PtdSer (51Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdSer supply is, in turn, regulated by either the rate of PtdSer synthesis or the rate of translocation of PtdSer from its site of synthesis on the ER to the site of the decarboxylase on the outer aspect of inner mitochondrial membranes (15Dennis E.A. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 263-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, an increased supply of PtdSer to mitochondria would be expected to be translated into an increased production of PtdEtn by the decarboxylase.A second consequence of overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 was that degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdSer-derived PtdEtn was increased, although the degradation of PtdEtn derived from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was not increased. Most likely the enhanced degradation was of PtdSer rather than of PtdEtn since in primary hepatocytes newly made PtdSer is rapidly degraded, whereas PtdSer-derived PtdEtn is not significantly degraded (52Samborski R.W. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).A third consequence of overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 in McArdle 7777 cells was that the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was inhibited, as was demonstrated by the greatly reduced incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into PtdEtn. This reduction in incorporation of radioactivity could not be accounted for by an increased degradation of ethanolamine-derived PtdEtn. Moreover, the amounts of [3H]ethanolamine-labeled precursors of PtdEtn were increased indicating that the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn synthesis was inhibited. We therefore investigated which step of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was modified when PtdSer synthase-1 was overexpressed. Under most metabolic conditions the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway is thought to be ET (44Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 45Tijburg L.B.M. Houweling M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 46Sundler R. Akesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the totalin vitro activity of ET was unaffected by overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the distribution of ET between a small active pool and a large inactive pool had been altered since such a change would not have been detected in our experiments. Unlike the cytidylyltransferase of the CDP-choline biosynthetic pathway, there is no evidence that the activity of ET is regulated by reversible translocation to and from membranes (44Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). ET is presumed to be a cytosolic protein that neither requires lipids for activity nor is tightly associated with membranes (47Tijburg L.B.M. Schuurmans E.A.J.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 53Vermeulen P.S. Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7458-7464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Schneider W. Fiscus W.G. Lawler J.A. Anal.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15415-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some association of ET with ER membranes has been detected in immunogold electron microscopy studies (53Vermeulen P.S. Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7458-7464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences of ET (56Nakashima A. Hosaka K. Nikawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9567-9572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (57Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) share some similarities, especially at the N termini of the corresponding proteins. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase contains an amphipathic α-helical C-terminal domain that has been proposed to mediate membrane association (58Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From analysis of the cDNA sequence of ET (56Nakashima A. Hosaka K. Nikawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9567-9572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) it appears that ET might also have an amphipathic α-helical domain close to the C terminus that could potentially form a loose association with membranes.The supply of diacylglycerols has also been implicated in the regulation of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (47Tijburg L.B.M. Schuurmans E.A.J.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Tijburg L.B.M. Houweling M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by virtue of this lipid being a substrate for ethanolaminephosphotransferase. Similarly, under some metabolic conditions, diacylglycerols can regulate the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho synthesis at the level of the cholinephosphotransferase (59Lim P. Cornell R. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 60Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 61Jamil H. Utal A.K. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1752-1760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We detected no difference in the diacylglycerol content of control cells and Mc/PSS1 cells although our experiments would not have detected a change in a small localized pool of this lipid. However, in cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase-1, the cellular content of triacylglycerols was 40% less than in control cells. For each molecule of PtdSer synthesized, one molecule of phospholipid, and hence one molecule of diacylglycerol, is consumed. If the “reservoir” of stored triacylglycerols in the cell served as a precursor pool of diacylglycerols, a reduction in triacylglycerol mass might result from the increased demand for diacylglycerols in the cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase-1. Therefore, overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 might deplete a specific pool of diacylglycerols that is used for PtdEtn synthesis via the ethanolaminephosphotransferase reaction.In conclusion, an increased synthesis of PtdSer, induced by overexpression of mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA, increases the production of PtdEtn from the PtdSer decarboxylation pathway and inhibits the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. These observations suggest that the synthesis and decarboxylation of PtdSer, as well as the synthesis of PtdEtn from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and the degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdEtn, are coordinately regulated so that constant cellular levels of these phospholipids are maintained. Experiments are presently underway in our laboratory to determine whether or not increasing in the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, by overexpression of ET, reciprocally inhibits the synthesis and/or decarboxylation of PtdSer. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ET, CTP:ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; CHO-K1, Chinese hamster ovary; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ET, CTP:ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. is an amino phospholipid component of all animal cell membranes, accounting for ∼5–10% of membrane phospholipids. In addition to a presumed structural role in membranes, PtdSer is required for activation of protein kinase C (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) and for progression of the blood coagulation cascade (2Schroit A.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 3Bevers E. Comfurius P. van Rijn J. Hemker H. Zwaal R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 122: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). PtdSer exposure on the cell surface also serves as a signal for recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by macrophages (4Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Richter D.A. Kailey J.M. Guthrie L.A. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26159-26165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PtdSer is synthesized on ER membranes in a calcium-dependent base-exchange reaction catalyzed by PtdSer synthases (6Hübscher H.G. Dils R.R. Pover W.F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 36: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the polar head-group of an existing phospholipid, such as PtdCho or PtdEtn, is replaced byl-serine (Fig. 1). The pathway by which PtdSer is synthesized in eukaryotes is different from that in bacteria (7Okada M. Matsuzaki H. Shibuya I. Matsumoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7456-7461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Letts V.A. Klig L.S. Bae-Lee M. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7279-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Nikawa J. Tsukagoshi Y. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in both of which PtdSer is synthesized from l-serine, with CDP-diacylglycerol as the donor of the phosphatidyl group. A cDNA encoding PtdSer synthase-1 was cloned from CHO-K1 cells by complementation of PSA-3 mutant cells that are defective in PtdSer synthase-1 activity (10Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cloned cDNA in PSA-3 cells showed that the enzyme catalyzed a base-exchange reaction with serine, choline, and ethanolamine. Immunoblot analysis (11Saito K. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 395: 262-266Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) revealed that PtdSer synthase-1 is present in both microsomes and mitochondria-associated membranes (12Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a cDNA that encodes PtdSer synthase-2 was also isolated from CHO-K1 cells (GenBankTM data bank accession number AB004109) (13Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although the cDNAs for PtdSer synthase-1 and -2 share little similarity, the corresponding amino acid sequences are 32% identical. Expression of PtdSer synthase-2 cDNA showed that, as predicted, this enzyme uses PtdEtn, but not PtdCho, as phosphatidyl group donor. The PtdSer synthase-2 cDNA also transformed PSA-3 cells, which lacked PtdSer synthase-1 activity, into PtdSer prototrophs (13Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19133-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). M.9.1.1 cells are phenotypically similar to PSA-3 cells. In M.9.1.1 cells, the PtdSer synthase activity is ∼50% that of parental CHO-K1 cells (14Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, in M.9.1.1 cells that are deprived of ethanolamine, and therefore are unable to make PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (Fig. 1), PtdSer and PtdEtn levels are lower than in CHO-K1 cells. The growth defect of M.9.1.1 cells is overcome when ethanolamine, PtdSer, lyso-PtdEtn, or PtdEtn are included in the culture medium. M.9.1.1 cells also do not utilize PtdCho as a substrate for PtdSer biosynthesis, although PtdEtn is converted into PtdSer almost as efficiently as in wild-type CHO-K1 cells.

PtdSer synthesized on the ER is transported to mitochondria and decarboxylated to PtdEtn by the enzyme PtdSer decarboxylase (Fig. 1) (15Dennis E.A. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 263-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly all mitochondrial PtdEtn in CHO cells is synthesizedin situ in mitochondria by this reaction (16Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PtdEtn is also synthesized on the ER by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (Fig. 1) (17Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this pathway, ethanolamine is first phosphorylated by ethanolamine kinase to phosphoethanolamine, which is converted to CDP-ethanolamine by CTP:ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (ET).

In some studies, for example in rat liver (18Sundler R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,19Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem.

Kuksis A. Lipids. 1976; 11: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) found that the decarboxylation of PtdSer was the major route of PtdEtn biosynthesis in rat liver. Other cells, such as CHO and BHK-21 cells, synthesize at least 80% of their PtdEtn from PtdSer decarboxylation, even in the presence of ethanolamine (22Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have therefore cloned and expressed a cDNA that encodes mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1. First, we demonstrate that this cDNA complements the ethanolamine auxotrophy of M.9.1.1 mutant CHO-K1 cells. We also show that when PtdSer synthesis is increased severalfold in hepatoma cells overexpressing mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA, PtdSer and PtdEtn levels remain the same as in control cells. Apparently, as compensation for overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 activity, the catabolism of PtdSer and/or PtdSer-derived PtdEtn is increased, and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn biosynthesis is inhibited. DISCUSSIONWe report the cloning and expression of a cDNA that encodes PtdSer synthase-1 from mouse liver and show that the PtdSer synthesis and/or decarboxylation pathways can coordinately regulate the production of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway.As evidence that the cloned cDNA encoded PtdSer synthase-1, the cDNA for mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 was heterologously expressed in M.9.1.1 cells that are mutant CHO cells deficient in PtdSer synthase-1 activity (14Voelker D.R. Frazier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1002-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA was expressed, the ethanolamine auxotrophy of the M.9.1.1 cells was eliminated, the base exchange activities with serine, choline, and ethanolamine were increased, and the levels of PtdSer and PtdEtn were restored to normal. In addition, expression of mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 in McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells resulted in increasedin vitro base exchange activity and an increased rate of incorporation of [3H]serine into PtdSer and PtdEtn in intact cells. These observations are consistent with previous data showing that a PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA from CHO-K1 cells complemented the ethanolamine auxotrophy of a mutant CHO cell line, PSA-3 (10Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our studies in McArdle hepatoma cells imply that the metabolism of PtdSer and PtdEtn is coordinately regulated so that cellular levels of these lipids remain constant. When PtdSer synthase-1 activity was overexpressed, homeostasis of PtdSer and PtdEtn was maintained by the following: (i) increased conversion of PtdSer to PtdEtn, (ii) increased degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdEtn derived from PtdSer, and (iii) inhibition of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn synthesis. These findings are reminiscent of those from a study in which CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of PtdCho biosynthesis via the CDP-choline pathway, was overexpressed in COS cells (49Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a greatly increased rate of PtdCho synthesis in these transfected cells, the mass of PtdCho was barely increased. However, the rate of PtdCho degradation was increased, presumably as a mechanism for maintaining a constant level of PtdCho. Similarly, overexpression of E. coli PtdSer synthase in E. coli did not alter the phospholipid composition of these cells (50Ohta A. Waggoner K. Louie K. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2219-2225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The increased conversion of PtdSer to PtdEtn in cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase is most likely the direct result of increased PtdSer synthesis. Production of PtdSer-derived PtdEtn appears not to be limited by the activity of the decarboxylase but rather by availability of the substrate, PtdSer (51Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8019-8025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdSer supply is, in turn, regulated by either the rate of PtdSer synthesis or the rate of translocation of PtdSer from its site of synthesis on the ER to the site of the decarboxylase on the outer aspect of inner mitochondrial membranes (15Dennis E.A. Kennedy E.P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 263-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, an increased supply of PtdSer to mitochondria would be expected to be translated into an increased production of PtdEtn by the decarboxylase.A second consequence of overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 was that degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdSer-derived PtdEtn was increased, although the degradation of PtdEtn derived from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was not increased. Most likely the enhanced degradation was of PtdSer rather than of PtdEtn since in primary hepatocytes newly made PtdSer is rapidly degraded, whereas PtdSer-derived PtdEtn is not significantly degraded (52Samborski R.W. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).A third consequence of overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 in McArdle 7777 cells was that the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was inhibited, as was demonstrated by the greatly reduced incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into PtdEtn. This reduction in incorporation of radioactivity could not be accounted for by an increased degradation of ethanolamine-derived PtdEtn. Moreover, the amounts of [3H]ethanolamine-labeled precursors of PtdEtn were increased indicating that the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for PtdEtn synthesis was inhibited. We therefore investigated which step of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was modified when PtdSer synthase-1 was overexpressed. Under most metabolic conditions the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway is thought to be ET (44Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 45Tijburg L.B.M. Houweling M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys.

However, the totalin vitro activity of ET was unaffected by overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the distribution of ET between a small active pool and a large inactive pool had been altered since such a change would not have been detected in our experiments. Unlike the cytidylyltransferase of the CDP-choline biosynthetic pathway, there is no evidence that the activity of ET is regulated by reversible translocation to and from membranes (44Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). ET is presumed to be a cytosolic protein that neither requires lipids for activity nor is tightly associated with membranes (47Tijburg L.B.M. Schuurmans E.A.J.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G.

However, some association of ET with ER membranes has been detected in immunogold electron microscopy studies (53Vermeulen P.S. Tijburg L.B.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7458-7464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequences of ET (56Nakashima A. Hosaka K. Nikawa J. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) share some similarities, especially at the N termini of the corresponding proteins. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase contains an amphipathic α-helical C-terminal domain that has been proposed to mediate membrane association (58Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From analysis of the cDNA sequence of ET (56Nakashima A. Hosaka K. Nikawa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9567-9572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) it appears that ET might also have an amphipathic α-helical domain close to the C terminus that could potentially form a loose association with membranes.The supply of diacylglycerols has also been implicated in the regulation of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (47Tijburg L.B.M. Schuurmans E.A.J.M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Tijburg L.B.M. Houweling M. Geelen M.J.H. van Golde L.M.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by virtue of this lipid being a substrate for ethanolaminephosphotransferase. Similarly, under some metabolic conditions, diacylglycerols can regulate the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho synthesis at the level of the cholinephosphotransferase (59Lim P. Cornell R. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 60Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We detected no difference in the diacylglycerol content of control cells and Mc/PSS1 cells although our experiments would not have detected a change in a small localized pool of this lipid. However, in cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase-1, the cellular content of triacylglycerols was 40% less than in control cells. For each molecule of PtdSer synthesized, one molecule of phospholipid, and hence one molecule of diacylglycerol, is consumed. If the “reservoir” of stored triacylglycerols in the cell served as a precursor pool of diacylglycerols, a reduction in triacylglycerol mass might result from the increased demand for diacylglycerols in the cells overexpressing PtdSer synthase-1. Therefore, overexpression of PtdSer synthase-1 might deplete a specific pool of diacylglycerols that is used for PtdEtn synthesis via the ethanolaminephosphotransferase reaction.In conclusion, an increased synthesis of PtdSer, induced by overexpression of mouse liver PtdSer synthase-1 cDNA, increases the production of PtdEtn from the PtdSer decarboxylation pathway and inhibits the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. These observations suggest that the synthesis and decarboxylation of PtdSer, as well as the synthesis of PtdEtn from the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and the degradation of PtdSer and/or PtdEtn, are coordinately regulated so that constant cellular levels of these phospholipids are maintained. Experiments are presently underway in our laboratory to determine whether or not increasing in the synthesis of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, by overexpression of ET, reciprocally inhibits the synthesis and/or decarboxylation of PtdSer. We report the cloning and expression of a cDNA that encodes PtdSer synthase-1 from mouse liver and show that the PtdSer synthesis and/or decarboxylation pathways can coordinately regulate the production of PtdEtn via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2011774111,"Activation of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, leads to phospholipase D (PLD) stimulation, a process apparently involving Rho GTPases, as shown by studies with Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme and Clostridium difficiletoxin B (TcdB). Direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also induces PLD stimulation, which is additive to the mAChR action and which is only poorly sensitive to inactivation of Rho proteins by TcdB. To study whether Ras-like GTPases are involved in PLD regulation, we studied the effects of the TcdB variant TcdB-1470 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL), known to inactivate Rac and some members of the Ras protein family, on PLD activities. TcdB-1470 and TcsL did not affect basal PLD activity and PLD stimulation by mAChR or direct G protein activation. In contrast, PMA-induced PLD stimulation was inhibited by TcdB-1470 and TcsL in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, without alteration in immunologically detectable PKC isozyme levels. In membranes of HEK-293 cells pretreated with TcdB-1470 or TcsL, basal and stable GTP analog-stimulated PLD activities measured with exogenous phosphatidylcholine, in the presence or absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, were not altered. In contrast, pretreatment with TcdB-1470 and TcsL, but not TcdB, strongly reduced PMA-stimulated PLD activity. The addition of recombinant Rac1, serving as glucosylation substrate for TcdB, TcsL, and TcdB-1470, did not restore PLD stimulation by PMA. Furthermore, PMA-stimulated PLD activity, suppressed by prior treatment with TcdB-1470 or TcsL, was not rescued by the addition of recombinant Ras (RasG12V) or Rap proteins, acting as glucosylation substrates for TcsL only (Ras) or TcdB-1470 and TcsL (Rap). In contrast, the addition of recombinant Ral proteins (RalA and RalB), glucosylation substrates for TscL and TcdB-1470, but not for TcdB, to membranes of TcdB-1470- or TcsL-treated cells fully restored PLD stimulation by PMA without altering the strict MgATP dependence of PMA-induced PLD stimulation. RalA-mediated restoration of PMA-stimulated PLD activity in membranes of TcsL-treated cells was not enhanced by coaddition of RasG12V. In conclusion, the data presented indicate that TcdB-1470 and TcsL selectively interfere with phorbol ester stimulation of PLD and suggest an essential role of Ral proteins in PKC signaling to PLD in HEK-293 cells.

Members of the Rho protein family have been shown to mediate PLD stimulation by G protein-coupled and growth factor receptors as well (27Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C.

Stimulation of PLD activity induced by v-Src in Balb/c and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was shown to be mediated by Ras and RalA, the latter acting apparently downstream of Ras (30Jiang H. Luo J.-Q. Urano T. Frankel P. Zhimin L. Foster D.A. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, Ras itself has been reported to activate PLD in different cell types (31Carnero A. Dolfi F. Lacal J.C. J. Cell.

Thus, GTPase cascades are apparently not only involved in cell proliferation and cytoskeleton organization, but they may also participate in PLD activation (34Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Another pathway for PLD stimulation involves isozymes of the protein kinase C (PKC) family, specifically members of the classical forms of PKC, as shown by studies in human neutrophils, in membranes of porcine brain, and with purified PLD (7Hammond S.M. Altschuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

Furthermore, activation of PLD by Ras proteins can apparently involve PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways, depending on cell type and/or PLD isozyme (32Del Peso L. Hernández R. Esteve P. Lacal J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, synergism between PLD stimulation by GTPases and phorbol ester-activated PKC has been demonstrated in several systems (35Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

In human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells, stably expressing the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), various signal transduction components, including GTPases, PKC, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), are apparently involved in PLD activation. We have recently shown that mAChR-mediated PLD stimulation in these cells involves small molecular weight GTPases of both the ARF and Rho protein families (17Rümenapp U. Geizt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol.

As shown in studies with Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB), which inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, and with the selective Rho-inactivating Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, Rho proteins apparently regulate the supply of the essential PLD cofactor, PtdIns(4,5)P2 (40Schmidt M.

Direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), also induces marked PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells, which is additive to the mAChR action and apparently does not involve ARF (17Rümenapp U.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PMA stimulation of PLD in HEK-293 cells was by far less sensitive to inactivation of Rho proteins by TcdB than mAChR stimulation (27Schmidt M. Rümenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To examine whether Ras-like G proteins are involved in PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells, we studied the effects of Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (TcsL) and the variant TcdB, TcdB-1470, which induce similar cytopathic effects (44von Eichel-Streiber C.

TcsL has recently been shown to inactivate Rac and some members of the Ras protein family (Ras, Rap, and Ral) by monoglucosylation (46Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol.

We demonstrate here that TcsL and TcdB-1470, which glucosylates Rac, Rap, and Ral GTPases, potently and selectively inhibit PMA-induced PLD stimulation in HEK-293 cells and that this inhibition is selectively reversed by Ral proteins, suggesting an essential role for Ral GTPases in PKC signaling to PLD in HEK-293 cells.

For experiments, cells subcultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium were grown to near confluence (175- and 75-cm2 culture flasks or 145-mm culture dishes). For measurement of intact cell PLD activity, cellular phospholipids were labeled by incubating nearly confluent monolayers of cells for 20–24 h with [3H]oleic acid (2 μCi/ml) in growth medium. To exclude the possibility that the toxins interfere with the incorporation of radioactivity into phospholipids, the labeling medium was replaced before the cells were treated for 24 h or the indicated periods of time without and with TcsL or TcdB-1470 at the indicated concentrations. Thereafter, cells were detached from the culture flasks, resuspended twice in Hank's balanced salt solution, containing 118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmd-glucose, buffered at pH 7.4 with 15 mm HEPES, at a cell concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml.

This enzyme is a heterotrimeric complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme comprising a molybdenum cofactor-containing catalytic subunit (NarG; 139 kDa), an [Fe-S] cluster-containing electron transfer subunit (NarH; 58 kDa), and a heme-containing membrane anchor subunit (NarI; 26 kDa). NarGHI is an excellent example of a family of bacterial iron-sulfur molybdoenzymes, which includes E. coli Me2SO reductase (DmsABC (4Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)), formate dehydrogenase N (FdnGHI (5Berg B.L. Li J. Heider J. Stewart V. J. Biol.

Kojro E. Kröger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 5456-5463Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). Sequence comparisons between NarG and a large number of bacterial molybdoenzymes indicate that this subunit binds the molybdenum cofactor and is the site of nitrate reduction (3Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 4Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim.

J. 1995; 309: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The structures of a number of bacterial molybdoenzymes have recently been determined. These include Me2SO reductases fromRhodobacter sphaeroides (8Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (9Schneider F. Löwe J. Huber R. Schindelin H. Kisker C. Knäben J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and formate dehydrogenase H from E. coli (10Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In each case, there is a molybdo-bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) (Mo-bisMGD) at the active site. Given the significant sequence similarity between these enzymes and that of the catalytic subunit of NarGHI (NarG), it is likely that NarG also contains a Mo-bisMGD cofactor at its active site. However, because the cofactor has not been unequivocally identified as a Mo-bisMGD, it will be referred to herein as Mo-MGD. One of the final steps in the biosynthesis of Mo-MGD (11Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd. Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar) is the addition of a guanine nucleotide to Mo-molybdopterin (Mo-MPT) to form Mo-MGD (12Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a mobABmutant, this step does not take place. The mob locus comprises two open reading frames, mobA and mobB. The gene product of mobA, MobA, has been shown to be responsible for nucleotide addition (13Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the gene product of mobB, MobB, enhances nucleotide addition but is not essential for it (14Eaves D.J. Palmer T. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The effect of mobAB mutants onE. coli NarGHI and DmsABC has been studied in detail (15Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Rothery R.A. Simala Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified soluble NarGH dimer prepared from a mobABstrain can be incubated in the presence of MobA and GTP, generating enzyme that is able to reduce nitrate with benzyl viologen (BV⨥) as electron donor (13Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This reconstitution presumably occurs as a result of the conversion of Mo-MPT to Mo-MGD. However, its extent corresponds to only 5–10% of the expected level. In these reconstitution experiments, it has been suggested that the source of Mo-MPT is the purified NarGH dimer (13Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results contrast with those reported for DmsABC, in which no MPT or molybdenum was detected in the enzyme studied in a mobAB background (16Rothery R.A. Simala Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this latter case, the enzyme studied was the membrane-bound heterotrimer rather than the soluble DmsAB dimer. It would therefore be interesting to determine the effect of the mobAB mutation on the membrane-bound NarGHI holoenzyme. The operon encoding NarGHI (narGHJI) has a fourth open reading frame (narJ) whose product is not part of the holoenzyme (2Blasco F. Pommier J. Augier V. Chippaux M. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Palmer T. Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). NarJ is a system-specific chaperone that is produced in substoichiometric amounts compared with the other subunits encoded by the operon (18Liu X. DeMoss J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24266-24271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It appears to hold cofactor-deficient NarGH in a cofactor-insertion competent conformation in E. colistrains that are unable to synthesize cofactor (19Blasco F. Dos-Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The NarGH dimer appears to be unstable and is devoid of Mo-MGD in a narJmutant background. The [Fe-S] clusters of NarGHI have been investigated in considerable detail using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis of cluster-ligating Cys residues and EPR spectroscopy (20Augier V. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Augier V. Asso M. Guigliarelli B.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have provided convincing evidence for the presence of one [3Fe-4S] cluster and three [4Fe-4S] clusters located in the NarH subunit of purified preparations of the NarGH dimer. These clusters appear to be ligated by four ferredoxin-like Cys groups (I-IV), and the presence of these groups identifies NarH as being a member of an emerging family of four cluster proteins. This family includes E. coli DmsB (of DmsABC), FdnH (of the formate dehydrogenase, FdnGHI), HycB (of formate-hydrogen lyase), and NarY (of the alternative nitrate reductase, NarZYV), as well as many other proteins from other organisms (3Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 4Weiner J.H. Rothery R.A. Sambasivarao D. Trieber C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has recently been suggested on the basis of sequence alignments that the enzyme contains a fifth cluster, a [4Fe-4S] cluster, ligated by a cluster of Cys residues located toward the N terminus of NarG (3Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 25Breton J. Berks B.C. Reilly A. Thomson A.J. Ferguson S.J. Richardson D.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the structure of formate dehydrogenase H (FdhF) (10Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), an N-terminal Cys group ligates a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is in close proximity to one of the pterins of the Mo-bisMGD cofactor. In the Thiosphaera pantotrophaperiplasmic nitrate reductase (NapA), a cluster was detected by EPR spectroscopy (10Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) which can also be assigned to the N-terminal Cys group. In both these enzymes, a role for the cluster can be envisioned in electron transfer to or from the Mo-MGD cofactor. Although many of the bacterial molybdoenzymes have an N-terminal Cys group in their catalytic subunit, there are important subclasses with different spacings between the putative cluster ligands (26Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In both NarGHI and DmsABC, there is no evidence for the presence of a cluster within the catalytic subunit (22Guigliarelli B. Asso M. More C. Augier V. Blasco F. Pommier J. Giordano G. Bertrand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Trieber C.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4620-4626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the enzymes both belong to a specific subclass. In this paper, we have investigated the effect of a mobABmutation on the assembly of Mo-MGD into the soluble NarGH dimer and the membrane-bound NarGHI holoenzyme. We have compared the effect of the mobAB mutation with the effect of the molybdenum antagonist tungsten and have investigated the effect of the absence of Mo-MGD on the midpoint potentials of the NarH [Fe-S] clusters.

Cells were grown microaerobically in 2-liter batch cultures of Terrific Broth (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.1989Google Scholar) at 30 °C in the presence of 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin and ampicillin. Where appropriate, the growth medium was supplemented with 15 mm sodium tungstate. A 10% innoculum was used, and NarGHI overexpression was achieved by addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). Following addition of the innoculum and the IPTG, cells were grown overnight with gentle shaking at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH7). Membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (30Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purified NarGH was prepared from wild-type and mobABgenetic backgrounds as described previously (20Augier V. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Lyophilized NarGH was resuspended in 100 mm Tris and 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.3). The presence of MPT in membrane vesicles was assayed by acid denaturation followed by I2 and KI oxidation to produce an extract that contained the Form A fluorescent derivative of MPT that will be referred herein to as a “Form A extract” (12Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 mg of membrane protein was used as starting material. Prior to the recording of fluorescence spectra using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer, small aliquots (100–200 μl) of the acid-denatured iodine-oxidized extract were added to 3 ml of 1 m NH4OH in a fluorescence cuvette. The presence of MPT in purified NarGH was assayed by preparation of an extract containing the Form B fluorescent derivative of MPT that will be referred to herein as a “Form B extract” (31Johnson J.L.

Protein samples containing 2 mg of NarGH were diluted with 1 ml of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and were incubated at 100 °C for 25 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 25 min. Aliquots of the supernatant fraction (200 μl) were added to 3 ml of 1 mNH4OH in a fluorescence cuvette. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The amount of molybdenum present in membrane fractions was determined by wet ashing the samples and performing inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICPES). The molybdenum content of membrane vesicles from TP1000/pVA700 (mobAB mutant) and LCB2048/pVA700 (wild-type) was analyzed by ICPES. The NarGHI content of the membranes used in the ICPES studies was determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis as described previously (20Augier V. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Bertrand P. Frixon C. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Blasco F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were assayed by the Lowry method, modified by the inclusion of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in the incubation mixture to solubilize membrane proteins (33Markwell M.A.D. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were suspended at a protein concentration of 30 mg ml−1 in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mmEDTA (pH 7.0). Dithionite-reduced (5 mm) samples were incubated under argon at 23 °C for 5 min. Oxidized samples were prepared by incubating membranes in the presence of 0.2 mmpotassium ferricyanide for 2 min. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Spectrospin ESP-300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 flowing helium cryostat. Instrument conditions and temperatures were as described in the individual figure legends. Redox titrations were carried out under argon at pH 8.0 in 100 mm Tricine and 5 mm EDTA as described previously (34Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H.

Membranes prepared in 100 mm MOPS and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7) (see above) were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in the pH 8.0 buffer. The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 50 μm: quinhydrone, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, duroquinone, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigodisulfonate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, phenosafranine, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. All samples were prepared in 3-mm internal diameter quartz EPR tubes, were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled ethanol, and were stored under liquid nitrogen until use. We have previously shown that in a mobABmutant, no detectable Mo-MPT is assembled into the DmsABC holoenzyme (16Rothery R.A. Simala Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result contrasts with reports that the NarGH dimer purified from a mobAB mutant contains Mo-MPT (13Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reconcile these results, we subjected membrane-bound NarGHI holoenzyme to acid denaturation followed by I2 and KI oxidation to produce the fluorescent Form A derivative of MPT (12Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control for these experiments, we also studied Form A extracts from membranes from tungstate-grown cells. Fig. 1 A, a and d, shows excitation and emission spectra of a Form A extract from NarGHI overexpressed from a wild-type strain. Noticeable in these spectra are intense peaks at approximately 390 and 445 nm in the excitation and emission spectra, respectively, consistent with the fluorescent species present being the Form A derivative of Mo-MPT (12Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A, b and e, show equivalent spectra obtained from membranes prepared from wild-type cells grown in the presence of 15 mm tungstate. Noticeable in these spectra are the absence of intense peaks attributable to the Form A derivative of Mo-MGD. Fig. 1 A, c and f, show equivalent spectra from an extract from membranes containing overexpressed NarGHI from mobAB mutant cells. EPR spectroscopy (see below) demonstrates that normal levels of overexpressed NarGHI are accumulated into the membranes in cells grown in the presence of tungstate and in mobAB mutant cells, suggesting that the mobAB mutation and tungstate have a similar effect on the cofactor composition of NarGHI, viz.elimination of detectable membrane-bound Mo-MPT or Mo-MGD. To determine if there is a correlation between pterin and Mo content, we subjected membrane samples containing overexpressed wild-type and mobAB mutant NarGHI to ICPES analysis. Wild-type enzyme contains approximately 0.90 mol of Mo/NarGHI heterotrimer, whereas the mobAB mutant enzyme contains only 0.01 mol of Mo/NarGHI heterotrimer. These results are in agreement with previous studies of DmsABC (16Rothery R.A. Simala Grant J.L. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated reconstitution of BV⨥:nitrate oxidoreductase activity of the purified NarGH dimer from amobAB mutant strain in which the only source of Mo-MPT has been suggested to be the purified enzyme (13Palmer T. Vasishta A. Whitty P.W. Boxer D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Santini C. Iobbi-Nivol C. Romane C. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of fluorescent derivatives obtained from the mobAB mutant membranes prompted us to reinvestigate the Mo-MPT content of NarGH purified from a mobAB mutant strain. Fig. 1 Bshows fluorescent spectra of Form B extracts from wild-type (Fig. 1 B, a and c) and mobABmutant (Fig. 1 B, b and d) NarGH. In spectra of the wild-type sample, intense peaks were observed in the excitation spectrum at approximately 290 and 410 nm. In the emission spectrum, an intense peak was observed at 480 nm. These wavelengths are consistent with the species released from the wild-type NarGH being the Form B derivative of Mo-MGD. In fluorescence spectra of the mobAB mutant NarGH extract (Fig. 1 B, b and d), the features of the fluorescence spectra are diminished, with a diffuse peak in the excitation spectrum at 365 nm and a small peak at approximately 475 nm in the emission spectrum. These results suggest that, in a mobAB mutant, Mo-MPT is either absent from NarGH or is present at very low occupancy (see “Discussion”). To investigate the functional relationship between Mo-MGD cofactor of NarG and the NarH [Fe-S] clusters, we recorded EPR spectra at 12K of dithionite-reduced and ferricyanide-oxidized membrane samples containing wild-type and mobAB mutant NarGHI. Fig. 2 a shows the spectrum of dithionite-reduced wild-type NarGHI in membranes at pH 7.0. We have previously demonstrated that in the absence of redox-mediators, the Em,8.3 = −400 mV cluster remains oxidized in the presence of excess dithionite (24Magalon A. Rothery R.A. Giordano G. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5037-5045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the spectrum in Fig. 2 a corresponds to this partially reduced form of the enzyme. Fig. 2 b shows an equivalent spectrum of mobABmutant NarGHI. This spectrum corresponds to that of the fully reduced enzyme reported by Guigliarelli et al. (22Guigliarelli B. Asso M. More C. Augier V. Blasco F. Pommier J. Giordano G. Bertrand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The spectrum of NarGHI in membranes from tungstate-grown cells is essentially identical to that of mobAB mutant NarGHI (data not shown), indicating that the cofactor-deficient form of the enzyme may have significantly altered [Fe-S] cluster midpoint potentials. Fig. 2, c and d, shows spectra of ferricyanide-oxidized wild-type and mobAB mutant NarGHI in membranes, showing the spectrum of the [3Fe-4S] cluster of NarH. Only minor differences are apparent between the two spectra, indicating that the EPR lineshape of the [3Fe-4S] cluster is not significantly altered by the absence of Mo-MGD. Three observations prompted us to examine the effect of the absence of Mo-MGD on the redox potentiometry of the NarH [Fe-S] clusters: (i) the dithionite-reducibility of the lowest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster in cofactor-deficient NarGHI (Fig. 2); (ii) the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in close proximity to the Mo-bisMGD of FdhF of E. coli (10Boyington J.C. Gladyshev V.N. Khangulov S.V. Stadtman T.C. Sun P.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar); and (iii) the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in NapA of T. pantotropha (25Breton J. Berks B.C. Reilly A. Thomson A.J. Ferguson S.J. Richardson D.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows representative EPR spectra of redox-poised samples at pH 8.0 for NarGHI-enriched membranes from a wild-type strain. Between +332 and +243 mV, the spectrum is dominated by the oxidized [3Fe-4S] cluster. The EPR spectrum of this cluster in membrane-bound NarGHI has a slightly axial line shape, with a peak atg = 2.02 (gz), and a peak-trough atg = 1.99–1.96 (gxy). Between +243 and +129 mV, the spectrum of the [3Fe-4S] cluster diminishes and is substantially replaced by that of the highest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster of NarGHI. As reported by Guigliarelli et al. (22Guigliarelli B. Asso M. More C. Augier V. Blasco F. Pommier J. Giordano G. Bertrand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the spectrum of this species appears to arise from two conformations, characterized by features at approximately g = 2.05, 1.95, 1.87 and g = 2.01, 1.89, 1.87, respectively (22Guigliarelli B. Asso M. More C. Augier V. Blasco F. Pommier J. Giordano G. Bertrand P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The spectrum is also complicated by an overlapping Mo(V) signal at approximately g = 1.98. As the Eh is further reduced from +129 to +23 mV, the Mo(V) signal disappears, and the composite spectrum of the highest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster remains, revealing an additional peak atg = 2.01. Between −83 and −268 mV, there is a subtle increase in the intensity of the g = 2.05 peak and g = 1.89–1.87 peak-trough and a slight decrease in the intensity of the g = 1.95 peak-trough. Between −371 and −540 mV, the spectrum is extensively broadened by the interaction of the lowest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster with the other reduced clusters. This broadening is accompanied by the appearance of a deep trough at g = 1.92. Similar redox-poised spectra are obtained from TP1000/pVA700 (mobAB) membranes (Fig. 4), the notable exceptions being: (i) the absence of a Mo(V) signal atg = 1.98 in any of the spectra recorded; and (ii) at approximately +132 mV, there is an absence of the spectrum of the reduced highest potential [4Fe-4S] cluster, and a significant amount of oxidized [3Fe-4S] cluster remains. These results suggest that the absence of Mo-MGD in the mobAB mutant NarGHI affects the midpoint potentials of the two highest potential clusters of NarH. Redox-poised membranes from LCB79/pVA700 grown in the presence of 15 mm sodium tungstate to prevent Mo-MGD assembly yield essentially similar spectra to those reported for membranes from TP1000/pVA700 membranes (data not shown). Plots of the intensity of the g = 2.02 peak of the oxidized [3Fe-4S] cluster versus redox potential (Eh) (Fig. 5 A) indicate that in the wild-type and mobAB mutant enzymes, this center has two major subpopulations with"

The Ca2+-induced cross-linking of this cytoskeletal element seems to be mediated by the intrinsic transglutaminase of lens, because the reaction could be blocked at the monomeric state of vimentin by the inclusion of small synthetic substrates of the enzyme dansylcadaverine or dansyl-ε-aminocaproyl-Gln-Gln-Ile-Val. These compounds are known to compete against the Gln or Lys functionalities of proteins that would participate in forming the N ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine protein-to-protein cross-links. The cytosolic transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions could be reproduced with purified bovine lens vimentin and also with recombinant human vimentin preparations. Employing the latter system, we have titrated the transglutaminase-reactive sites of vimentin and, by sequencing the dansyl-tracer-labeled segments of the protein, we have shown that residues Gln453 and Gln460 served as acceptor functionalities and Lys97, Lys104, Lys294, and Lys439 as electron donor functionalities in vimentin. The transglutaminase-dependent reaction of this intermediate filament protein might influence the shape and plasticity of the fiber cells, and the enzyme-catalyzed cross-linking of vimentin, in conjunction with other lens constituents, may contribute to the process of cataract formation.

Complementary experiments, in which the intrinsic Ca2+-activated TGase was allowed to promote the cross-linking of endogenous proteins, revealed that among the soluble constituents of the lens, primarily a small subset of crystallins was targeted by the enzyme (1Lorand L.

Enzyme-specific probes, such as dansylcadaverine, dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV, or similar biotinylated analogues were synthesized for the identification and analysis of the substrates of the enzyme. These compounds compete against the TGase-catalyzed cross-linking of proteins, and by becoming incorporated in the enzyme-driven reaction into the biological substrates themselves, they could be employed for locating the Gln (or acceptor) and the Lys (or donor) functionalities exhibiting the unique specificities (1Lorand L.

Therefore, we undertook to examine changes occurring in the skeletal proteins of the lens as the latent TGase becomes activated by Ca2+ in the tissue. This line of research was greatly spurred by our recent finding that a TGase antigen became tightly bound to the IF network in some fibroblasts and keratinocytes (13Trejo-Skalli A.V. Velasco P.T.

The present report focuses on the intermediate filament protein vimentin as substrate for the cross-linking enzyme. Notwithstanding the mesenchymal preference for the expression of the vimentin-encoding gene and the epithelial origin of the ocular lens (15Sax C.M. Farrell F.X. Zehner Z.E. Piatigorsky J. Dev.

We have now identified the TGase-reactive Gln and Lys side chains of vimentin, which can act as acceptor and donor functionalities of the protein in cross-linking onto itself or to other membrane and cytoskeletal elements. Frozen calf lenses (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR) were thawed to room temperature and decapsulated, and the cortex was separated from the nucleus. Cortical portions from two lenses were homogenized by hand in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl in a Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder.

Examination of proteins by SDS-PAGE showed that in the control lens specimen, vimentin partitioned mostly into the insoluble portion of the homogenate (compare bands on the immunoblots of the 45–60-kDa region (Fig. 1 A, lane 4), representing the supernatant, with those representing the sediment fraction (Fig. 1 B, lane 4)), whereas the crystallins (21–32 kDa) (Fig. 1,A and B, lane 1, stained with Amido Black) were present mostly in the soluble phase. Except for a faint band, seemingly corresponding to a trimeric or tetrameric species of vimentin, in Fig. 1 B, lane 4, no high molecular weight forms of the intermediate filament protein were seen in this bovine lens preparation. However, the mere addition of Ca2+ to the homogenate generated significant amounts of a series of vimentins withMr > 60,000 (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 5 and 6, X). The production of these higher vimentin species seemed to be somewhat enhanced if leupeptin, a calpain inhibitor that is known to suppress the proteolytic degradation of vimentin in rabbit lens (29Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Velasco P.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), was included in the incubation mixture (Fig. 1, A and B,lane 6). The higher molecular weight vimentin product separated mainly with the insoluble phase of the homogenate (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6), whereas some of the lower multiples of vimentin (Mr ≤ 200,000) appeared also in the supernatant (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6). The endogenous cross-linking of vimentin could also be documented at lower concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 C) by incubating the lens homogenate over a longer time period (21 h). These SDS-PAGE experiments, carried out after reducing the proteins with dithiothreitol in urea, demonstrated that the cross-linked vimentin species were produced in the lens tissue by covalent bonds other than disulfides. The additional findings presented in Fig. 2 provided clear proof for the involvement of the Ca2+-activated, endogenous TGase in the observed reaction. As a primary amine, dansylcadaverine is known to compete against the Lys residues of proteins in the TGase-mediated cross-linking reaction (18Lorand L. Rule N.G. Ong H.H. Furlanetto R. Jacobsen A.

Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence of either of these compounds (2 mm) during treatment of the homogenate with Ca2+ reduced the amount of cross-linked vimentin products, as is best seen in Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6. Probing the transblots with a monoclonal antibody against the dansyl moiety (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8) visualized monomeric vimentin at about 55 kDa, as well as the other TGase-reactive proteins in the lens homogenate.Figure 2The inclusion of synthetic substrates for TGase, i.e. dansylcadaverine or dansyl-ε-aminocaproyl-QQIV, in the reaction of the calf lens homogenate with Ca2+ inhibits the formation of the high molecular weight vimentin species. Experiments were carried out as in Fig. 1 in the presence of 2 mm leupeptin, 8 mm CaCl2 with either 2 mmdansylcadaverine (lanes 2, 5, and 7) or dansyl-ε-aminocaproyl-QQIV (lanes 3, 6, and 8) added. After centrifugation, the supernatants (A) and pellets (B) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Blots were stained for protein with Amido Black (lanes 1–3) and were immunostained with antibody to vimentin (lanes 4–6) or to dansyl (lanes 7 and 8). For experimental details, see “Materials and Methods.” The position of vimentin at 55 kDa (V) is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two well-defined preparations of vimentin were employed to demonstrate that the intermediate filament component was capable of acting as a bifunctional substrate for TGase, that its cross-linking could be blocked essentially at the monomeric stage with the inclusion of either synthetic substrate of TGase (dansylcadaverine or dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV) in the reaction mixture, and that the dansyl-containing tracers could be employed for labeling predominantly the monomeric parent vimentin. As illustrated by the experiments in Fig. 3, all criteria for TGase catalysis were realized with the purified bovine lens vimentin (A), as well as with the recombinant human vimentin as substrates (B). Under the experimental conditions employed (TGase:vimentin ratio of 1:25; pH 7.5; 37 °C), in the absence of dansylcadaverine, only a trace amount of monomeric vimentin remained at 2 h (Fig. 3, A and B, sets a, lanes 2), and the large cross-linked products of the enzymatic reaction could barely enter into the stacking gel during SDS-PAGE. However, with the inclusion of 2 mm dansylcadaverine (sets b and c) or dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV (sets d and e) in the incubation mixture, cross-linking of the protein could be blocked essentially at the monomeric stage. Lower concentrations of the inhibitors (0.5 and 1 mm) still allowed for the formation of some vimentin products of intermediate size. Photographs of the gels taken under UV illumination showed (sets c for dansylcadaverine and sets e for dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV) that with 2 mm of either blocking agent in the mixture, the fluorescent label was found almost exclusively in monomeric vimentin. The incorporation of the dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV tracer, apparently by labeling more than a single donor site in the parent vimentin molecule, caused a noticeable upward shift from the original molecular mass value of 55 kDa of the protein in SDS-PAGE (sets d and e). The experiments described in Fig. 3 were used as a guide for identifying the TGase-reactive acceptor and donor functionalities of vimentin. Details are given under “Materials and Methods,” and Fig. 4 is a summary of the protocol employed for analyzing the reaction of recombinant vimentin with cytosolic TGase. A key feature of the procedure was the use of an anti-dansyl affinity column (6Lorand L. Velasco P.T. Murthy S.N.P. Wilson J. Parameswaran K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11161-11163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Murthy S.N.P. Wilson J. Zhang Y. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22907-22911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for separating the fluorescent peptides that carried the dansyl hapten from all the other fragments in the tryptic digest of the enzyme-modified vimentin samples. The HPLC profile of the dansylcadaverine-labeled peptides is shown in Fig. 5 A, and that of the fragments obtained from the reaction with dansyl-ε-aca-QQIV is presented in Fig. 5 B. Edman degradation (12 cycles) of the two major fluorescent peaks marked I and II in Fig. 5 A, eluting at approximately 58 and 67 min, respectively, showed that these peptides were derived from the same segment of the C-terminal tail of the vimentin molecule, corresponding to the DGXVINETSXHH sequence from residue 451 through 462 (30Ferrari S. Battini R. Kaczmarek L. Rittling S. Calabretta B. de Riel J.K. Philiponis V. Wei J.F. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 11: 3614-3620Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the sequencing of the peak II material, no known amino acid (X) was recovered in the 3rd and 10th Edman cycles where Gln453 and Gln460 would be expected, and this was taken to indicate that both Gln residues carried the dansylcadaverine adduct. By contrast, sequencing of the peak I material comprising the same 451–462 segment of vimentin yielded Gln in the 3rd and the 10th cycles, although only in amounts of about half of what would have been expected without derivatization by dansylcadaverine. The data are consistent with the idea that the peak I material, actually appearing almost as a double peak on HPLC, represented a mixture of two peptides of the same sequence, one in which Gln453 and one in which Gln460 was decorated with the dansylcadaverine label DGQVINETSXHH and DGXVINETSQHH. Altogether, it was quite remarkable to find that TGase reacted with high selectivity with only 2 of the 33 Gln residues present in vimentin. It was equally interesting that the two TGase-titratable acceptor side chains of this intermediate filament protein (Gln453 and Gln460) were located close to each other in the primary sequence in the C-terminal unfolded domain of the molecule.Figure 5Identification of transglutaminase-reactive residues in vimentin. A, isolation of dansylcadaverine-labeled peptides from the trypsin digest of TGase-modified vimentin. The fluorescent peaks marked I and II, emerging from the C8 HPLC column (see “Materials and Methods”) at 58 and 67 min, respectively, were collected, concentrated, and subjected to amino acid sequencing. B, isolation of dansyl-ε-aminocaproyl-QQIV-labeled peptides from the trypsin digest of TGase-derivatized vimentin. The fluorescent peaks marked I–V were collected, concentrated, rechromatographed, and submitted for amino acid sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TGase-mediated titration of Lys side chains with dansyl-ε-aminocaproyl-QQIV provided a more complex picture. Five fluorescent peaks (marked I–V in Fig. 5 B) were collected following the HPLC separation of the tryptic digest of labeled vimentin. Each of these was rechromatographed and submitted for sequencing. High confidence sequences were obtained for the peak II, III, and IV materials, identifying Lys97 and Lys104 unambiguously as residues reacting with TGase (Table I). The peak I material appeared to be a mixture of several labeled fragments, sequences for which could not be resolved by Edman degradation. Peak V turned out to be a mixture of two labeled peptides, present in essentially equal amounts; reliable reading of the double sequence, however, could be accomplished by knowing the amino acid sequence of vimentin itself. The two peptides were derived from protein segments starting with Ser293 and Glu425, respectively, providing evidence that residues Lys294 and Lys439 could also act as TGase-reactive donor side chains. As illustrated in Fig. 6, in the vimentin molecule Lys294 is located near the interface of the helical 2B subdomain (121 residues) with the L2 linker segment (8 residues), whereas Lys439, like the two TGase-reactive acceptor side chains Gln453 and Gln460, is in the 55 residue-length non-helical C-terminal tail. On the other hand, the donor residues Lys97 and Lys104, which were identified with high confidence from sequencing the peak II, III, and IV peptides (Fig. 5 B and Table I), straddle the zone of transition from the non-helical N-terminal H1 segment (18 residues) to the helical rod of vimentin, designated as 1A (35 residues).Table ISequencing the TGase-reactive, dansyl-ɛ-aminocaproyl-QQIV-labeled Lys residues of human vimentinPeak numberSequencesII1-2001High confidence sequence.Thr94GluPheX 97AsnThrArgIII1-2001High confidence sequence.Thr101AsnGluX 104ValGluLeuGlnGlnLysIV1-2001High confidence sequence.Thr101AsnGluX 104ValGluLeuGlnV1-bNear equimolar mixture of two peptides, sequenced simultaneously.

Open table in a new tab The Gln and Lys residues highlighted in Fig. 6 are potential sites for various posttranslational possibilities by TGase. These include the hydrolysis of Gln residues, i.e. a Gln→Glu transition; the incorporation of low molecular weight primary amines; cross-linking of vimentin to vimentin or to other proteins by formation of N ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptides or by a polyamine bridge (spermine, spermidine, or putrescine) between two reactive Gln residues. It is clear from our data that vimentin could act as a bifunctional substrate cross-linking onto itself, carrying TGase-reactive acceptor (Gln) as well as donor (Lys) residues. This may be contrasted with the substrate qualities of involucrin in human keratinocytes, the anion transporter band 3 in human red cells or αB crystallin in bovine lens, each of which is known to act only as a monofunctional substrate for the enzyme. Involucrin and the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 contain just a single enzyme-reactive Gln in their sequences: Gln496, located in the C-terminal region of involucrin (31Simon M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Gln30, in the N-terminal portion of band 3 (19Murthy S.N.P. Wilson J. Zhang Y. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22907-22911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); bovine αB crystallin was reported (5Groenen P.J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J.

A. 1992; 89: 11161-11163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to carry only an enzyme-reactive Lys, Lys175, at the C-terminal end of the protein (although there is evidence that in the lens tissue, under the influence of the intrinsic TGase, the penultimate Lys174 of αB crystallin also reacts 2S. N. P. Murthy and L. Lorand, unpublished data. ). It is interesting to note that the TGase-reactive sites of the vimentin molecule (Fig. 6) are present in regions of the protein that are also known to be susceptible to other posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolysis (32Nelson, W. J., and Traub, P. Mol. Cell. Biol., 3,1146–1156.Google Scholar, 33Geisler N. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Ando S. Tanabe K. Gonda Y. Sato C.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In general, in terms of the architecture of intermediate filament proteins, TGase seems to act with high selectivity at functionally important areas of vimentin. The tail domain (comprising the TGase-reactive Gln453, Gln460, and Lys439 residues; see Fig. 6), by interacting with the α helical rod, is known to stabilize the correct filamentous assembly of vimentin in vitro as well asin vivo (38McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and was also shown to bind with actin structures (39Klymkowsky R. Evans R. Domingo A. Backhus J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1609-1622PubMed Google Scholar). Tail-less vimentin mutants display an unusual tendency for abnormal type of aggregation (38McCormick M.B. Kouklis P. Syder A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Eckelt A. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 319-330PubMed Google Scholar, 41Rogers K.R.

A nine-amino acid sequence β-motif, present in the tail domains of all type III IF proteins, including vimentin, has been shown to be essential for normal IF assembly. Remarkably, a single G→V mutation at position 452 (adjacent to the TGase-reactive Gln453 residue) is known to interfere with normal assembly (42Kouklis P.D. Hatzfeld M. Brunkener M. Weber K. Georgatos S.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 919-928PubMed Google Scholar). The area comprising two of the TGase-reactive Lys donor sites (Lys97 and Lys104), located at the beginning of the rod domain (Fig. 6), is highly conserved across several types of intermediate filament proteins. This structural domain is considered to be critical for the assembly of the keratin units (43Coulombe P.A. Chan Y.M. Albers K. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3049-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); a single point mutation in this segment can disrupt filament formation in vitro as well asin vivo (44Coulombe P.A.

The Lys residues of keratins involved in cross-linking to two of the cell envelope proteins, loricrin and involucrin, are all located in the head domains (cross-linking to loricrin utilizes Lys73 in keratin 1, Lys70 in keratin 2e, and Lys9 in keratin 10 (51Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); cross-linking to involucrin occurs at Lys73 with keratin 1, Lys69 with keratin 2e, and Lys71 with keratin 5 (52Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). It is interesting that this N-terminal domain is missing in the type III IF vimentin molecule (53Steinert P.M. Parry D.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 41-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Intermediate filaments of 10 nm in diameter were long thought to be static cytoskeletal elements of cells. Recently, however, it has been shown that their polymerization state in vivo is governed by an equilibrium between soluble vimentins, V, and the polymerized form of this protein: nV ⇆Vn (54Vikstrom K.L. Lim S.S. Goldman R.D. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TGase activity could conceivably influence the normal distribution and partitioning of vimentin in the cell. For example, if the enzyme modified mainly the soluble vimentin species, mV → mV′ (e.g. by deamidation or cross-linking, where m < n), there might be a disruption of the IF network by depletion of the soluble vimentin pool available for normal polymerization. If, on the other hand, TGase acted by preferentially cross-linking (xl) the assembled subunits of vimentin in situ((V)n →xl(V)n), the dynamic nature of the network could become compromised because the covalent fusion of subunits would preclude the dissociation of the IF ensemble. Either of these possibilities could have major consequences for cell function and survival. The change in filament stability may be important in regulating changes in cell shape that occur during development. In support of this idea, it has been shown that intermediate filaments play major roles in cell shape and the mechanical properties of cytoplasm (55Goldman R.D. Khuon S. Chou Y.H. Opal P. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Close analogy for some of the changes that might occur in the IF network is the stabilization of fibrin clots by activated Factor XIII, a member of the TGase family of enzymes. Dissection of the biochemical steps in the last stages of blood coagulation (56Mann K.G. Lorand L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that the reversible self-assembly of fibrin molecules into the clot,n(fibrin) ⇆ (fibrin)n, is followed by the enzyme-catalyzed cross-linking of the fibrin network: (fibrin)n → xl(fibrin)n. The ordered assembly of molecules into the (fibrin)n structure was shown to accelerate greatly the rate of the enzymatic reaction (57Samokhin G.P. Lorand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21827-21832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,58Lorand L. Parameswaran K.N. Murthy S.N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1998; 95: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the introduction of a fewN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine covalent side chain bridges at strategic locations into the clot results in an approximately 5-fold increase in clot stiffness (59Mockros L.F. Roberts W.W. Lorand L. Biophys. Chem. 1974; 2: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 60Shen L. Lorand L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1336-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen when and how TGase becomes activated in the lens. We have recently shown 3S. N. P. Murthy, P. T. Velasco, and L. Lorand, unpublished data. that the cross-linking activity of the purified lens enzyme is inhibited by GTP. In fact, the sensitivity of the lens TGase to GTP (which probably reflects on the affinity of the enzyme for binding the nucleotide) is about an order of magnitude greater than that of the guinea pig liver enzyme. Thus, like the liver TGase, which was shown to function as a G protein in signal transduction (61Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol.

Under the appropriate signal, it may mediate the activation of phospholipase C. Otherwise, it could function in remodeling reactions, as described in this report for the modification of vimentin. The concentration of GTP would affect the cross-linking potential of the lens enzyme, and a significant drop in the concentration of the nucleoside triphosphate, as it may occur in cataract formation, would greatly favor the expression of this activity. We thank Dr. Ying-Hao Chou for helpful discussion."

JNK/SAPK is a MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; MST, MKN28-derived nonreceptor type of serine/threonine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MalE, maltose-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MLK, mixed lineage kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MAPKKK, MAPKK kinase; MST, MKN28-derived nonreceptor type of serine/threonine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MalE, maltose-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MLK, mixed lineage kinase.-related protein kinase mainly involved in cellular responses against cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, Fas-ligand, and interleukin-1, and stress-inducing agents, such as ultraviolet light, osmotic pressure, and heat (1Dérijard B.

The diversity of the JNK/SAPK-inducing extracellular stimuli indicates the presence of multiple pathways to activate this protein kinase. In fact, there have been an increasing number of MAPKKK class protein kinases acting in the JNK/SAPK pathway now being reported, and these might be involved in the activation of JNK/SAPK by distinct extracellular stimuli (4Minden A.

We and others have reported that members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family, MUK/DLK/ZPK, SPRK/PTK1/MLK3, and MST/MLK2, activate the JNK/SAPK pathway (8Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i.

Furthermore, we have shown that MST/MLK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate SEK1, a MAPKK class protein kinase that activates JNK/SAPK (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Therefore, MST/MLK2, and probably other members of the MLK family as well, acts as a MAPKKK in the JNK/SAPK pathway. A direct activator of JNK/SAPK, the MAPKK class protein kinase SEK1/MKK4/JNKK1/SKK1 has been cloned, and its involvement in the activation of JNK/SAPK by MEKK1 has been demonstrated (13Sánchez I.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two JNK/SAPK activators have been identified in the column fractions of rat 3Y1 cell extracts and three in human KB cell extracts (16Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y.

One of these activators corresponds to SEK1, but the others appear to be distinct new activators the primary structures of which are not known. More recently, a second JNK/SAPK activator, MKK7/JNKK2/SKK4, has been cloned (18Tournier C. Whitmarsh A. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Intensive studies to identify the MKK7 substrate have demonstrated that MKK7 selectively activates JNK/SAPK and has very little ability to activate other MAP kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, or p38 MAP kinases (18Tournier C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, little is known about the MAPKKKs that act on MKK7. MLKs have been shown to comprise a new family of protein kinases that share a characteristic protein kinase domain that shows structural features of both tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases and two leucine-zipper-like motifs located proximal to the C-terminal end of the protein kinase domain (23Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The functional significance of these motifs is still unclear; however, the physical interaction of a small GTP-binding protein, Cdc42, and a hematopoietic progenitor kinase, HPK1, with SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 in vitro has been reported (24Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Both Cdc42 and HPK1 could be involved in the regulation of SPRK/PTK1/MLK3 or other members of the MLK family. SEK1 has been reported to be a substrate of MLKs. MLKs activate epitope-tagged SEK1 in cultured cells and phosphorylate SEK1 in vitro (9Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J.

We developed a unique system to identify the JNK/SAPK activators activated by MST/MLK2. This system involves an in vitroreconstitution assay of the kinase cascade using recombinant MST/MLK2 and JNK1 and the JNK/SAPK activators to be tested. By subjecting a fractionated COS-1 cell lysate to this system, we found at least two MST-dependent JNK/SAPK activators. Furthermore, using recombinant SEK1 and MKK7 proteins, we found that MST/MLK2 activates MKK7 more effectively than SEK1, whereas MEKK1 activates both to a similar extent. To construct a bacterial expression vector for MEKK1 fused to GST, a cDNA encoding the C-terminal 687 amino acids of mouse MEKK1 (MEKK1DN) (8Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector. A bacterial expression vector for GST-CREBP1/1–143, which served as a substrate in gel kinase assay, was constructed with pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a cDNA encoding the N-terminal 143 amino acids of CREBP1/ATF2. GST-MKK7 was constructed with pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a cDNA encoding mouse MKK7 (22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial expression vectors for MST deletion mutants fused to MalE were constructed with pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs) vector and cDNAs encoding different parts of MST as indicated in Fig. 4. These cDNAs were also cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the SRα promoter and an N-terminal His/T7-tag sequence. Mammalian expression vectors for MST and JNK1 and bacterial expression vectors for MalE-MST/10–757, GST-SEK1, and GST-JNK1 have been described elsewhere (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). GST and MalE fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli (DH5) and purified by standard protocols on glutathione-Sepharose and amylose resin, respectively. To obtain MalE-free MST/10-444, 500 μg of MalE fusion protein was mixed with 5 μg of factor Xa (Sigma) in 500 μl of 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at 25 °C for 2.5 h. Then, excised MalE protein and uncut MalE fusion protein were removed by passage through a 1-ml amylose resin column equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Recombinant c-Jun was produced in bacteria using a PET8c expression vector (8Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar). Protein solutions were dialyzed against 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C until use. COS-1 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells grown in ten 10-cm dishes (∼5 × 107 cells) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of TG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer by 40 strokes with a tight pestle and left to stand on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml Q Sepharose column (HiTrap Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with TG buffer. The protein bound to the column was eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in TG buffer, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The unadsorbed fractions from the Q Sepharose column were loaded onto a 0.1-ml Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biothech) equilibrated with TG buffer. The protein bound to the column was eluted with a 2-ml linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1-ml fractions were collected. For the assay of JNK activators in COS-1 cell lysates, 2 μl from each of the Q Sepharose column fractions or 1 μl from each of the Mono S column fractions was added to 20 μl of ice-cold assay buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 12.5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml maltose-binding protein, 30 mm maltose, 100 μm ATP) containing 0.2 μg (140 nm) of GST-JNK1 and 3 μg (∼1.1 μm) of MalE-MST/10–757 or 1.5 μg (∼700 nm) of GST-MEKK1DN and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Then, 2 μl of a substrate mix containing 25 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of recombinant c-Jun was added to each tube, and the samples were further incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the phosphorylation of c-Jun was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The amount of32P incorporated was quantified with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. For the assay of recombinant JNK activators, 0.5 μg of GST-SEK1 and GST-MKK7 were used instead of the COS-1 cell lysate column fractions. The amounts of MalE-MST/10–757, GST-MEKK1DN, or other MalE-MST deletion mutants used in the assays are indicated in the figure legends. To check the intrinsic kinase activities of MalE-MST/10–757 and GST-MEKK1DN, 1 μg of each protein was incubated in the 20 μl of assay buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 60 min. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. COS-1 cells were transfected by an electroporation method using 16 μg of DNA for 5 × 106 cells seeded in four 10-cm dishes. After transfection, the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before harvest. Cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the activity of the His/T7-tag JNK1 expressed in the cells was measured by in gel kinase assay (8Hirai S.-i. Izawa M. Osada S.-i. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar) using GST-CREBP1/1–143 as a substrate. SEK1 was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit antibody against recombinant XMEK2, a Xenopushomologue of human SEK1 (16Moriguchi T. Kawasaki H. Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12969-12972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MKK7 was detected using a rabbit antibody against recombinant mouse MKK7 (22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). His/T7-tagged protein was detected using an anti T7-tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen). A peroxidase-linked antibody against rabbit or mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody and detected by an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have reported that the overexpression of MST in COS-1 cells causes the activation of JNK1 (Ref. 12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 3). Even though MST directly phosphorylates and activates SEK1 (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), other substrates of MST could be acting in COS-1 cells to activate JNK. To identify any MST-dependent JNK activator(s) in COS-1 cells, we fractionated COS-1 cell lysates and assayed each fraction for MST-dependent JNK activator activity with an in vitro reconstitution assay system. The assay mixture contained recombinant GST-JNK1 and its substrate c-Jun, and the JNK-activating activity in the fractionated cell lysates was estimated by the ability of GST-JNK1 to phosphorylate c-Jun. COS-1 cell lysates were first chromatographed on Q Sepharose, and the unbound fraction was chromatographed on Mono S (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of MST, a single weak peak of JNK-activating activity was observed in the Mono S fractions (Fig. 1 C). The addition of a recombinant MST, MalE-MST/10–757, to the assay system induced the appearance of three peaks, one in the Q Sepharose fractions (Fig. 1 B) and the others in the Mono S fractions (Fig. 1 C). One of peaks observed in the Mono S fractions was located at the same position as the weak peak observed in the absence of MST. These three peaks were also observed when a recombinant MEKK1, GST-MEKK1DN, was added instead of MST. Notably, the addition of MEKK1 produced a higher peak in the Q Sepharose binding fraction, whereas the height of the two peaks in the Mono S fractions was rather lower than those seen in the presence of MST (Fig. 1, B and C). The difference in the relative height of each peak in response to MST and MEKK1 reflects the different substrate specificity of these two MAPKKKs on different JNK activators present in each peak. The different substrate specificities of MST and MEKK1 are also shown by the observation that more than half of the MEKK1-dependent JNK-activating activity found in the total cell lysate bound to Q Sepharose, whereas a large part of the MST-dependent JNK-activating activity passed through the Q Sepharose column (see Fig. 1 B, Total and RT).Figure 1Identification of MST- and MEKK1-dependent JNK activators in COS-1 cell lysates.COS-1 cell lysates were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, and each fraction was analyzed for MST- and MEKK1-dependent JNK-activating activity by an in vitro reconstitution assay.A, schematic drawing of the strategy of fractionation.B, JNK-activating activity measured with HiTrap Q (Q Sepharose column) fractions.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the JNK activators found in the fractionated COS-1 cell lysates correspond to SEK1 and MKK7, proteins in each fraction were analyzed by Western blot using anti-XMEK-2, a frog homologue of SEK1, or anti-MKK7 antibody. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1 D, SEK1 was found in the Q Sepharose fractions where the MST- or MEKK1-dependent JNK-activating activities were found. On the other hand, MKK7 was found in the Mono S fractions containing the MST- or MEKK1-dependent JNK-activating activities represented as the first higher peak (Fig. 1 E, lower panel). Smaller amounts of MKK7 were also detected in the Mono S fractions corresponding to the latter lower peaks of MST- or MEKK1-dependent JNK-activating activity. The reason that MKK7 eluted at two different positions is not clear. Variants might be formed by posttranscriptional or posttranslational modification or by association with other proteins. Alternatively, the two peaks could correspond to two different gene products, both of which react with the anti-MKK7 antibody. In any case, both are relatively good substrates for MST compared with the Q Sepharose-bound JNK activator, SEK1. To confirm that MST and MEKK1 activate MKK7 and to further verify the difference in the substrate specificities of MST and MEKK1, we used recombinant SEK1 and MKK7 (Fig. 2 A) for the in vitro reconstitution assay system. The abilities of MST and MEKK1 to activate these MAPKKs were monitored by measuring their abilities to activate JNK1, the activity of which was in turn estimated by its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun. Both MalE-MST/10–757 and GST-MEKK1DN activate GST-SEK1 as previously reported. However, the ability of MalE-MST/10–757 to activate GST-SEK1 is much lower than that of GST-MEKK1DN; when 1 μg of MalE-MST/10–757 or GST-MEKK1 was used for the assay, only a 2.0-fold activation of the JNK-pathway was observed with MalE-MST/10–757, whereas a 14.9-fold activation was observed with GST-MEKK1DN (Fig. 2 B). When the amount of MalE-MST/10–757 was increased to 4 μg, the observed activation was greater than 5-fold (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, this value is still smaller than that obtained with less GST-MEKK1DN. On the other hand, both of these MAPKKKs activate GST-MKK7 to a comparable extent: approximately 4-fold and 6-fold for MalE-MST/10–757 and GST-MEKK1DN, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Although relatively more GST-MEKK1DN was degraded than MalE-MST/10–757, the kinase activity of GST-MEKK1DN was much higher than that of MalE-MST/10–757 when estimated by the level of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, right panel). Therefore, the greater ability of GST-MEKK1DN to activate GST-SEK1 may be explained in part by the higher intrinsic kinase activity of this recombinant protein. However, it is obvious that MalE-MST/10–757 and GST-MEKK1DN show different substrate specificities for GST-SEK1 and GST-MKK7 and that MalE-MST/10–757 activates GST-MKK7 more efficiently than GST-SEK1. Notably, no induction of JNK activity was observed when GST was used instead of GST-SEK1 or GST-MKK7, and no c-Jun phosphorylation was observed when GST was used instead of GST-JNK1 (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Therefore, all of the activities of MalE-MST/10–757 and GST-MEKK1DN discussed above depend highly on those MAPKK- and MAPK-class protein kinases. MST/MLK2 has an SH3 domain in its N-terminal portion and two leucine-zipper-like motifs and a putative Rac/Cdc42 binding motif proximal to the C-terminal end of its kinase domain. To test whether these motifs contribute to substrate specificity, we constructed MST deletion mutants lacking these motifs. First, the ability of these mutants (Fig. 3 A) to induce JNK1 activity in COS-1 cells was tested by a cotransfection experiment followed by the in gel kinase assay to monitor the activity of the epitope-tagged JNK1 cotransfected with each MST mutant. As shown in Fig. 3 B, lower panel, all mutants except MST/KN, the kinase domain of which was partly deleted, were able to activate JNK1 in COS-1 cells. Although all C-terminal deletion mutants showed higher activities than tag-MST/10–953 carrying an intact C-terminal domain, this higher activity can mostly be explained by the higher expression level of these mutants (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). Therefore, the specific ability of MST to induce JNK1 in COS-1 cells is not significantly affected by the deletion of amino acids flanking its kinase domain. Next, we tested whether deletion of nonkinase domains would affect the substrate specificity of MST for JNK activators found in COS-1 cell lysates. MST deletion mutants were produced in bacteria as fusion proteins with a maltose-binding protein (Fig. 4, A and B) and used in the in vitro reconstitution experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 C, all MalE-fused deletion mutants, including the naked kinase domain, showed very similar substrate specificities;i.e. they were more effective activators of JNK activators in the Mono S-bound fractions than in the Q Sepharose-bound fractions. Substrate specificity was also tested using recombinant GST-SEK1 and GST-MKK7 (Fig. 4 D). Again, the deletion of regions outside the kinase domain did not affect the substrate specificity of MST. With respect to the GST-SEK1-dependent JNK-activating activity, all MalE-MST mutants showed only 13–20% of the activity observed for GST-MEKK1DN, whereas the values rose to 75–80% for the GST-MKK7 dependent JNK-activating activity. To eliminate the possibility that the fused MalE protein is responsible for the more effective activation of MKK7 by the recombinant MalE-MST fusion proteins, MST/10-444 was released from MalE-MST/10-444 fusion protein by using a site-specific protease, factor Xa, and used for the in vitro reconstruction experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 D, the substrate specificity of MST/10-444 is very similar to that of the MalE-MST/10-444 fusion protein. Therefore, fusion to MalE is not responsible for the substrate specificity of MST. We identified two MST-dependent JNK activators in fractionated COS-1 cell lysates by an in vitroreconstitution assay system using recombinant MST and JNK1. Western blot analysis indicated that one of these activators corresponds to SEK1/MKK4/JNKK1/SKK1 and the other to the recently identified JNK activator MKK7/JNKK2/SKK4. The activation of these MAPKKs by MST/MLK2 was further verified by the assay using recombinant proteins. Notably, the ability of MST/MLK2 to activate MKK7 was much higher than its ability to activate SEK1. MKK7 selectively activates JNK, whereas other MAP kinases, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38-MAP kinases, are only partially activated (18Tournier C. Whitmarsh A. Cavanagh J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, SEK1 activates p38 MAPK, as well as JNK (15Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 21Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the above findings are in line with our previous observation in vitrothat MST is a rather selective activator of the JNK pathway (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The experiment using sek1 −/− ES cells verified the involvement of SEK1 in the activation of JNK by anisomycin, heat shock, and the overexpression of MEKK1 (26Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the endogenous or overexpressed SEK1 in culture cell lines, such as HeLa, KB, and NIH3T3 cells, is activated by anisomycin, osmotic shock, or the overexpression of MEKK1 (17Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, MKK7 is activated by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α, which hardly activate SEK1, as well as by anisomycin, osmotic shock, and the overexpression of MEKK1, all of which also activate SEK1 (20Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24994-24998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, SEK1 and MKK7 must have different specific upstream activators in addition to some common activators. Our finding that MST is a more effective activator of MKK7 than SEK1 provides a clue to the molecular basis for the selective activation of MKK7 by certain stimuli. The selective activation of MKK7 by interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor α (21Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the involvement of MST in the activation of MKK7 by some of these stimuli. However, the signaling pathway by which MST activity is induced is not clear. Notably, overexpressed MST acts as a potent JNK activator without any stimulus, and the deletion of the kinase domain-flanking region does not produce any significant changes in its ability to activate MKK7 in vitro or in JNK activation in COS-1 cells (Figs. 3 and 4). Therefore, the activity of MST might be regulated by controlling the amount of protein in addition to posttranslational modification. The substrate specificity of MST depends on its kinase domain, but other typical structures in MST, including the SH3 domain, the leucine-zipper-like domain, and the Rac/Cdc42 binding motif, are not essential for the preferential activation of MKK7. The kinase domains of members of the MLK family, including MST, show higher homologies to those of TAK and Raf than to that of MEKK1. When MAPKKK class protein kinases are classified according to the amino acid sequences of their kinase domains, MLK family members and MEKK family members fall into different groups (12Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15167-15173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the difference in the amino acid sequences of the MAPKKK kinase domains manifests itself as the different substrate specificities of MAPKKKs for two JNK activators, whereas the difference is not related to downstream specificity at the MAP kinase level. It would then be interesting to know whether JNK-activating MAPKKKs that belong to the same group as MST, such as MUK/DLK/ZPK, SPRK/PTK1/MLK3, and TAK, preferentially activate MKK7 as MST does. Is there any selective activator of SEK1? It has been reported that the activation of JNK by the ectopical expression of MEKK1 is severely impaired in sek1 −/− ES cells. On the other hand, ultra violet light or osmotic shock induces JNK activation in sek1 −/− ES cells as in sek1 +/+ ES cells (26Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Science. 1997; 385: 350-353Google Scholar, 27Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M. Lu H.-T. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and this may depend on another MAPKK, MKK7. These observations indicate that MEKK1 is a selective activator of SEK1, and this conclusion appears to be inconsistent with the observation made by us and others that MEKK1 activates both SEK1 and MKK7 (21Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be explained by the absence of MKK7 and the presence of an unidentified type of JNK activator (22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in ES cells that is activated by ultraviolet light or osmotic shock but not by MEKK1. Alternatively, the interaction of MKK7 with MEKK1 could be blocked by a more stable interaction of MKK7 with other MAPKKKs in ES cells. Despite the increasing information about the differences upstream of SEK1 and MKK7, little is known about the specific roles of these protein kinases in cellular responses. The rather ubiquitous distribution of both enzymes in mouse tissues and cultured cell lines (18Tournier C. Whitmarsh A. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 20Holland P.M. Suzanne M. Campbell J.S. Noselli S. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) decreases the possibility that their functions are segregated in different cell types. Why then do two, and possibly more, MAPKKs act on JNK? The activity of each MAPKK might be regulated by a different set of MAPKKKs, as partially shown in this paper, which are activated by different sets of stimuli. Therefore, the presence of multiple MAPKKs increases the number of stimuli that can induce JNK activation. Moreover, SEK1 can activate MAPKs other than JNK, such as p38 MAPK (15Dérijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 21Lawler S. Cuenda A. Goedert M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the ability of SEK1 to induce specific cellular responses that cannot be induced by MKK7. From another point of view, each MAPKK might be localized in different places in cells by interacting with specific cellular proteins, as reported for SEK1, which interacts with actin-binding protein p280 (28Marti A. Luo Z. Cunningham C. Ohta Y. Hartwig J. Stossel T.P. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2620-2628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is then conceivable that each MAPKK activates a different set of JNK molecules in a cell, and this may induce a specific cellular response. Therefore, MST might be involved in the regulation of a specific part of the cellular response that results from JNK activation. The identification of such cellular response(s), as well as the MST-activating mechanism, will verify the physiological significance of the MST-JNK signaling pathway. We thank Drs.

Entamoeba histolytica is the protozoan responsible for human amoebiasis.

The transfection with the EhPgp1 gene, cloned in front of the actinpromoter, also confers emetine resistance to sensitive trophozoites (13Ghosh S.K. Lohia A. Kumar A. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A membrane glycoprotein (Pgp), encoded by mdr genes, functions as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump, maintaining the intracellular drug concentration below cytotoxic levels (14Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). mdr genes are amplified or overexpressed in resistant cell lines exposed to drugs, hormones, or metals (15Van der Bliek A.M. Kooiman P.M. Schneider C. Borst P. Gene. 1988; 71: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In cell lines and cancers, the increased expression of the Pgp may be caused by transcriptional regulation alterations, gene amplification, promoter mutations, DNA rearrangements, or mRNA stability (16Shen D.W. Fojo A. Chin J.E. Roninson I.B. Richert N. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1986; 232: 643-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The multigenic mdr families consist of three mdrgenes in rodents and two in humans (17Hsu S.I.-H. Cohen D. Kirschner L.S. Lothstein L. Hartstein M Horwitz S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3596-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas there are twomdr genes in P. falciparum (9Cowman A.F.

Ayala O. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 200-202Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Gene. 1995; 164: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They have between 61 and 67% homology among them and 41% homology with the human MDR1 gene (18Descoteaux S. Ayala O. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 200-202Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the drug-resistant clone C2, the EhPgp1 gene is constitutively transcribed independently of drug concentration; the EhPgp2transcript has not been detected but the EhPgp5 gene is transcribed at high emetine concentrations (19Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Gene. 1995; 164: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Orozco E. Pérez D.G. Gómez M.C. Ayala P. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 473-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that their expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. Like the EhPgp1 gene, the human MDR1 gene is constitutively expressed. MDR1 mRNA has been detected in several normal tissues, suggesting a role for its encoded protein in toxin or steroid transport (21Fojo A.T. Ueda K. Slamon D.J. Poplack D.G. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Several tumors, including leukemia and lymphoma, express high levels of MDR1. Thus, tissue-specific factors appear to be important in the regulation of the Pgp expression in normal and transformed tissues (22Madden M.J. Morrow C.S. Nakagawa M. Goldsmith M.E. Fairchild C.R. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8290-8297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation in E. histolytica and the underlying mechanisms for the EhPgp genes activation are poorly understood. This study presents the functional and structural analysis of the EhPgp1 promoter isolated from clone C2 as a step toward elucidating the mechanisms involved in the control of its constitutive expression. Nucleotides −244 to +24 of the EhPgp1 promoter efficiently directed the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in clone C2, but reduced activity was detected in the drug-sensitive clone A. Gel shift analysis showed interesting differences between nuclear factors from clones C2 and A bound to the first −244 bp of the EhPgp1promoter. This suggests that specific transcriptional regulators may be involved in the constitutive expression of the EhPgp1 gene in clone C2. Trophozoites of clones A and C2 (strain HM1:IMSS) (5Orozco E. Hernández F. Rodrı́guez M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were axenically cultured in TY1-S-33 medium (23Diamond L.S. Harlow R. Cunnick C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 73: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). the EhPgp1 promoter of clone C2 was obtained from a recombinant pBluescript (pBS) (Stratagene, CA) plasmid (p7) containing 2230 bp of the EhPgp1 coding region and 1770 bp upstream from the ATG start codon. This plasmid was previously isolated from a genomic DNA library constructed in Lambda Zap II vector with DNA from clone C2 (18Descoteaux S. Ayala O. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 200-202Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The EhPgp1 promoter of clone A was isolated by PCR of total DNA using the primers EhPgp1-S28 and EhPgp1-AS33 described below, and the PCR product was cloned in pBS. As a negative control, we used the EhPgp1-AS33 primer and the reverse primer from pBS. Sequence was done with overlapping oligonucleotides by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar) using Sequenase, version 2.0, DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence data analysis and sequence alignments were done with Fasta algorithm (25Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9327) Google Scholar) in the EMBL and GenBank data bases. The localization of consensus sequences was performed with the software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (26Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Assays were done using a reverse transcriptase sequencing kit (Promega, Madison, WI) (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA from clones A and C2 were hybridized to a γ-end-labeled 18-bp primer (5′TACTCCTGCATACTGAAA3′) (5 × 105 cpm) complementary to nucleotides +110 to +128 of the EhPgp1gene. Annealing was carried out at 45 °C for 25 min, and the extension reaction was performed at 42 °C for 30 min with 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Nucleic acids were phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and separated by electrophoresis on 8% urea-polyacrylamide gels. The product length was determined by comparison with the corresponding DNA sequence obtained with the same primer. For transfection experiments several plasmids were constructed using PCR-amplified DNA fragments, inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pBS plasmid. The promoterless pBSCAT-ACT plasmid was constructed after PCR amplification of the bacterial CAT reporter gene (659 bp) and the 3′-flanking sequence of the actin gene (600 bp) from the pA5′A3′CAT vector (28Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The CAT-ACT fragment was amplified using the sense CAT-S26 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGAGAAAAAAATCAC-3′) and the antisense oligonucleotides Eh-Ac3′-AS29 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTCTCTCTCCTGTGTACACC-3′) (28Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of the pBS vector. The 964-bp fragment was PCR-amplified using the p7 plasmid as template and the sense EhPgp1-S28 (5′-AAAACTGCAGTGAAGTGTCAGCACTTAA-3′) and antisense EhPgp1-AS33 (5′-CCCAAGCTTAAACTCACTTTCAGTTATATCCAT-3′) oligonucleotides. For the 268-bp fragment, the sense IIIs (5′-TAAATGAACTAAAAAATA-3′) and the antisense EhPgp1-AS33 oligonucleotides were used. These fragments contained 940 and 244 bp of the EhPgp1 promoter, respectively, and 24 bp of its coding region. The 964-bp fragment was cloned into the PstI and HindIII sites (p964Pgp1), and the 268-bp fragment was cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites (p268Pgp1) in front of the CAT gene, into the pBSCAT-ACT vector (see Fig. 3 A). The orientation and sequence of constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52237) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out by electroporation as described previously (28Nickel R. Tannich E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106trophozoites were transfected with 100 μg of the p964Pgp1, p268Pgp1, pA5′A3′CAT, or pBSCAT-ACT plasmids. Electroporated trophozoites were transferred into plastic flasks (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) containing 30 ml of TYI-S-33 medium and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. CAT activity was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (29Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-446Google Scholar) using 150 μg of trophozoite extracts, 0.5 mm acetyl coenzyme A, and 1 μCi (37 kBq) of [14C]chloramphenicol (50–60 mCi/mmol) incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. In other experiments, CAT activity was determinated by the two-phase diffusion assay (30Buß H. Lioutas C. Dobinsky S. Nickel R. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of trophozoite extracts and 200 μl of chloramphenicol (1.25 mm), which were incubated with [14C]butyryl-CoA (NEN Life Science Products) for 2 h. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar). CAT activities were expressed as cpm of the butyrylated derivatives. The background given by the pBSCAT-ACT plasmid transfected into the trophozoites was substracted from the positive results obtained with the other plasmids. CAT activity was determined in the linear range of the assay. NEs were prepared from trophozoites of clones A and C2 by a modified Schreiber's protocol (32Schreiber E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 trophozoites were harvested, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, resuspended in 4 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated 20 min at 4 °C. The trophozoites were centrifuged at 8600 rpm in a JA-20 Beckman rotor and resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer A supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2 mm benzamidine; 5 μg/ml of each aprotinin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and E-64). The trophozoites were homogenized with 25 strokes in an all-glass Dounce homogenizer using a pestle. Integrity of the nuclei was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. The nuclei were lysed by incubation for 40 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of the protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation, NEs were microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar). Reagents were purchased from Sigma. Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (33López-Bayghen E. Vega A. Cadena A. Granados S.E. Jave L.F. Gariglio P. Alvarez-Salas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 512-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, three different overlapping ∼100-bp fragments, corresponding to the first 244 bp upstream from the ATG start codon, were amplified and labeled by PCR. The PCR mixture contained [α-32P]dATP, 2 mm cold nucleotides, 50 ng of template DNA and 0.5 units of Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The reaction was carried out during 28 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 35 s) in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 Thermal Cycler. The oligonucleotides used as primers for each fragment were as follows: Is (5′-TTTTAGATTTAATGTGTT-3′) and Ias (5′-CACTTTCAGTTATATCCA-3′) for fragment I, IIs (5′-TAACAAAGGAGAGAAAAT-3′) and IIas (5′-ACCAAACACTAACACATT-3′) for fragment II, and IIIs and IIIas (5′-CTTATTATTTTCTCTCCT-3′) for fragment III. The labeled fragments were separated on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and purified after elution. DNA fragments (0.5–1 ng) were incubated with 15 μg of NEs from clones A or C2, 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)] (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and 10% glycerol in DNA-protein binding buffer (12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 4 °C. The bound and unbound complexes were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 25 °C and 100 V for 4 h and visualized by autoradiography. Competition assays were performed using a 150-fold excess of the same unlabeled fragments or unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing consensus sequence for the following transcription factors: C/EBPαfrom rat albumin (5′-GGTATGATTTTGTAATGGGGTAGG-3′) (34Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Garcı́a C.A. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), a putative C/EBPβ-like sequence represented several times in different E. histolytica promoters (5′-ATTCAATTGGGCAATCA-3′), GATA-1 (5′-GTTGCAGATAAACATT-3′), HOX (5′-GTAAGAGTTATTATTGAT-3′), OCTα(5′-ACATAGTTTATGCAACCGAAA-3′) and OCTβ(5′-AGCTAATTGCATACTTGGCTTGTAC-3′) oligonucleotides or 1.5 μg of poly[d(I·C)] as a nonspecific competitor (350-fold excess). The 942 bp upstream from the ATG start codon from EhPgp1 gene were sequenced using as template the p7 plasmid (18Descoteaux S. Ayala O. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 200-202Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or the pBluescript plasmid containing a PCR-amplified fragment obtained from total DNA of clone A (Fig. 1). The EhPgp1 promoters isolated from both clones were 99.7% identical, except for three changes at the position −501, −928, and −930. The PCR made with the pBS reverse primer did not amplify any fragment from clone A. This region was 75% A/T rich with different-sized repeated and palindromic sequences (Fig. 1 B, underlined). The −325 to −33-bp region presented 61% identity with the −472 to −700-bp region of the EhPgp5 promoter (58Pérez D.G. Gómez C. López-Bayghen E. Tannich E. Orozco E. J. Biol.

Homology of 53–66% with promoter regions of discoidin (−448 to −1046 bp), D19(−820 to −1164 bp), dynein (−360 to −886 bp) and ecm A (−1530 to −1783 bp) genes from Dictyostelium discoideum (35Poole S.J.

Leippe M. Lioutas C. Tannich E. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 925-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was not detected, but two putative initiator (Inr) elements at positions −18 and −67 (Fig. 1 B, boxes) were found. The Inr element found at −18 bp (GAACTAA) contains the conserved sequence CE2 (GAAC) recently reported for several 5′-flanking regions in E. histolytica genes (40Purdy E.J. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 5′-flanking region of the APorC gene of E. histolytica (40Purdy E.J. Pho L.T. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) also has the GAACTAA sequence localized at −18 bp, whereas the putative Inr element (TTAGATT) is identical to that described in mammalian cells (41Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In other gene promoters, mainly in the TATA-less promoters, Inr elements interact with transcriptional factors to influence accurate transcription (42Smit J.J. Mol C.A. van Deemter L. Wagenaar E. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Primer extension experiments with total RNA were used to identify the 5′ end of the EhPgp1 transcript. The major extension product of the EhPgp1 gene from clone C2 initiated at the base A of the ATG start codon, although other, fainter bands were visible at positions +16, +19, and +55 (Fig. 2, lane C2), but no open reading frame was found. In clone A, the major extension product also mapped at the ATG start codon; however, the amount of the main product was less than that in clone C2 (Fig. 2,lane A, right), indicating that the EhPgp1 gene is also transcribed in clone A, even though transcripts were not detected by Northern blot assays (19Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Gene. 1995; 164: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the differential amount of the EhPgp1 transcript in sensitive and resistant clones may be the regulating mechanism of the MDR phenotype in E. histolytica. Results were highly reproducible, supporting the specific binding of the primer. Transfection assays were done to examine whether the region upstream from the EhPgp1 gene had a functional promoter. The p964Pgp1 and p268Pgp1 plasmids, which contain 24 bp of the open reading frame and −940 and −244 bp of the EhPgp1promoter, respectively (Fig. 3 A), were transfected into clones A and C2. Both plasmids drove the CAT expression in the resistant and sensitive clones. However, after 2 h of incubation of the trophozoite extracts with the substrate, CAT activities were significantly higher in trophozoites of clone C2 compared with clone A (Fig. 3 A), suggesting the presence of positive transcriptional regulators in clone C2, which may be absent, diminished, or modified in clone A. To define a shorter region with promoter activity, the p268Pgp1 plasmid was transfected into trophozoites of clones C2 and A. Interestingly, no differences in CAT expression were detected in trophozoites of clone A transfected with p964Pgp1 or p268Pgp1 plasmids, whereas when clone C2 was transfected with p268Pgp1, it had more CAT activity than when it was transfected with the p964Pgp1 plasmid (Fig. 3 A). The latter proved that the EhPgp1 core promoter is located within the first 244 bp. In contrast to the strong EhPgp1 promoter activity, the EhPgp5 promoter presented little activity in clone C2 grown without drug (Fig. 3 B and Ref. 58Pérez D.G. Gómez C. López-Bayghen E. Tannich E. Orozco E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7285-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). CAT activity of the plasmid carrying the actin promoter was similar for clones A and C2 but less than that obtained with the p964Pgp1 and p268Pgp1 plasmids when activity was measured after 2 (Fig. 3 A) or 16 (Fig. 3 B) h of incubation. In both experiments the negative control, the promoterless pBSCAT-ACT plasmid and the cpm obtained from the trophozoites transfected with this plasmid (basal activity) were substracted from the activity obtained with the p964Pgp1, p268Pgp1, and pA5′A3′CAT plasmids (Fig. 3). The structural analysis of the EhPgp1promoter was done using the 244 bp upstream from the ATG start codon of the EhPgp1 gene because transfection experiments indicated that the core promoter was located in this region. Overlapping DNA fragments of approximately 100 bp each (fragments I, II, and III), covering bp −244 to +19 were PCR-amplified using specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 A, bottom) and their interactions with NEs from clones C2 and A were studied by gel shift assays. NEs from clone C2 incubated with fragment I (−74 to +19 bp) formed five main complexes (Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, and Ie). Interestingly, complex Ia was not detected in experiments carried out with NEs from clone A (Fig. 4 B). Additionally, NEs from clone A formed complex If, which was not detected in clone C2 (Fig. 4 B). Fragment II (−167 to −47 bp) formed five complexes with NEs from clone C2 (IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, and IIe) (Fig. 4 C). Except for complex IId, all complexes were more abundant in clone C2 than in clone A; this was particularly clear for complex IIa, which was very strong in clone C2 and very faint in clone A. In contrast, the doublet IIf and IIg, present in clone A, was not detected in clone C2 (Fig. 4 C). Fragment III (−244 to −144 bp) (Fig. 4 D) formed four complexes (IIIa, IIIb, IIIc, and IIId) with NEs from clone C2, one of which (IIIc) was not detected in clone A. All of the complexes were specifically competed by the same cold fragments and were maintained in the presence of poly[d(I·C)], used as nonspecific competitor. In summary, from gel shift assays, complexes Ia, IIa, and IIIc, detected mainly with NEs from clone C2, were identified. These complexes may be involved in the constitutiveEhPgp1 gene expression. On the other hand, complexes If, IIf, and IIg, which were reproducibly detected only with NEs from clone A, may be acting as negative regulators and may be responsible for suppressing the EhPgp1 expression. Their specific function is currently under study by mutation and transfection experiments. Promoters share common structural features, reflecting similar interaction with RNA polymerase. This fact has allowed the identification of DNA consensus sequences for different transcriptional factors. The EhPgp1promoter was scanned for potential consensus sequences candidates that might participate in the binding of transcriptional regulatory factors (Table I and Fig. 4 A). To investigate the identity of some of the sequences and complexes formed by fragments I, II, and III and the NEs from clones A and C2, we carried out competition experiments using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for transcription factors present in these fragments (Table I and Fig. 4 A). Two different putative C/EBP binding sequences were used to compete the complexes formed on fragment I: (i) the C/EBPα binding sequence from the rat albumin gene (34Cereghini S. Raymondjean M. Garcı́a C.A. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Cell. 1987; 50: 627-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and (ii) a C/EBPβ-like, putative sequence represented several times in some E. histolytica sequences upstream from the ATG start codon. The C/EBPα oligonucleotide competed complex Ia formed exclusively with NEs from clone C2, whereas the C/EBPβ oligonucleotide did not compete any complex (Fig. 5 A). The C/EBPαsequence shares 9 of 12 bases of the putative C/EBP sequence found between −43 and −54 bp in the EhPgp1 promoter (Fig. 5,B and C), whereas the C/EBPβ-like sequence shares only 5 bases (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest the presence of a C/EBP-like transcription factor interacting with the EhPgp1 promoter that could be involved in the expression of the EhPgp1 gene in clone C2 but not in clone A.Table IPutative consensus sequences for transcriptional factors in the EhPgp1 promoterFactor1-2001Consensus sequences are given in parentheses.PositionRef.bpC/EBP(TGTTTGGTAGTT, ATTGG) −54 to −4343Grange T.

Much of our understanding of the regulation of muscle contraction derives from studies of vertebrate skeletal muscle. The process is controlled by the reversible binding of Ca2+ to the thin filament protein troponin (1Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6894-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although there are differences in the known details of this process in different muscles, the basic process is similar (1Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol.

The detailed structure and protein domains involved in the formation of the tropomyosin-troponin complex, and hence the details of how it functions, are not known (3Ruegg J.C.

The role of the highly asymmetric TnT 1The abbreviations used are: TnT, troponin T; TDT, tergal depressor of the trochanter; IFM, indirect flight muscles; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. protein in the regulatory mechanism of muscle contraction is still unclear, but previous reports in vertebrate muscles indicate that it is a key component in linking together and regulating all the components of the complex, i.e. tropomyosin, troponin I, and troponin C (4Ohtsuki I. Nagano K. Adv. Biophys. 1982; 15: 93-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Fisher D. Wang G. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

In addition, it increases the cooperativity of actin-tropomyosin and provides Ca2+ sensitivity to the thin filament (7Schaertl S Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TnT is one of the proteins known to present a very complex isoform pattern both at the transcript level through differential splicing and at the protein level through post-translational modification (8Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in cardiac TnT are responsible for a large proportion of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases (9Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and changes in cardiac TnT isoform expression have been correlated with heart disease (10Anderson P.A.W. Malouf N.N. Oakeley A.E. Pagani E.D. Allen P.D. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 73-77Google Scholar). In Drosophila, mutant analysis revealed phenotypes with muscle abnormalities, indicating a possible effect of this protein on myofibrillar assembly and/or stability (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently, the analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants in TnT have demonstrated that they are defective in embryonic body wall muscle cell contraction, sarcomere organization, and cell positioning (12Myers C.D. Goh P.-Y. Allen T. Bucher E.A. Bogaert T J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This information justifies the increasing interest in this molecule, recognizing a more important role for TnT in muscle contraction than previously thought. An organism such as Drosophila offers important advantages for biochemical studies, as they can be complemented with genetic investigations (see Refs. 13Fyrberg E. Beall B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 126-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 14Epstein H.F. Bernstein S.I. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Drosophila develops two distinct sets of muscles during its life cycle, embryonic/larval and adult musculature. Larval muscles, including the body wall musculature, the gut and the dorsal heart muscles, are supercontractile nonfibrillar muscles. In the adult, the hypodermic musculature and the tergal depressor of the trochanter (TDT) are tubular and contract synchronously. TDT is involved in jumping, a preparatory step in the initiation of the flight response. In the thorax, however, the majority of the musculature is made up of the large indirect flight muscles (IFM), which are responsible for flight. As in the larva, the adult gut and all the visceral muscles, including the dorsal heart vessel, are tubular supercontracting muscles (15Bernstein S.I. O'Donnell P.T. Cripps R.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 63-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Drosophila flight muscles have been one of the historically used models in the studies of striated muscle (16Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. White D.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Tregear R.T. Insect Flight Muscle. North Holland, London1977Google Scholar). Unlike vertebrate muscles, calcium activation results in low tension and low ATPase activity and they show the property of stretch activation in the presence of Ca2+; a stretch of just 1–3% in muscle length triggers a large amplitude delayed rise in tension. This is the underlying mechanism that allows wing beat frequencies of up to 300 Hz in Drosophila or even higher in other insects. Although this phenomenon is present in all muscles, only in IFM and mammalian heart muscles are its effects large enough to be functionally significant (18Pringle J.W.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1978; 201: 107-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFM are also classified as asynchronous, since the frequency of wing beats does not correspond to the frequency of nerve impulses. Drosophila fibers contain homologues of the proteins found in vertebrate muscles: actin, myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains, α-actinin, tropomyosin, troponin C, I, and T (15Bernstein S.I. O'Donnell P.T. Cripps R.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 63-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In fact, all these contractile proteins are members of isoform families usually encoded in several divergent genes, a molecular diversity that reflects the functional diversity of the different muscles. The type- or stage- isoform specificity in muscle fibers has been maintained in many cases across evolution, suggesting specific roles for each isoform (8Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 15Bernstein S.I. O'Donnell P.T. Cripps R.M. Int. Rev.

However, the functional significance of expressing specific isoforms in different muscles remains a critical unsolved issue (8Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). in Drosophila, in contrast, contractile protein isoforms arise mainly by alternative splicing of one or a few genes (20Smith C.W.J. Patton J.M. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Often this diversity is increased by post-translational modifications (13Fyrberg E. Beall B. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 126-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Bernstein S.I. Hansen C.J. Becker K.D. Wassenberg D.R., II Roche E.S. Mol. Cell.

Recently, the importance of phosphorylation in the regulation of flight muscle activity has been shown in three muscle proteins, the myosin regulatory light chain, flightin and miniparamyosin (23Sparrow J.C.

Arredondo J.J. Goulding D. Marco R. Bullard B. Cervera M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of Drosophila as in other invertebrate protostomes, TnT is considerably larger than in chordate counterparts carrying a carboxyl-terminal extension (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 12Myers C.D. Goh P.-Y. Allen T. Bucher E.A. Bogaert T J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1061-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, some insect muscles contain peculiar myofibrillar proteins such as arthrin, troponin H, flightin, and mp20 (15Bernstein S.I. O'Donnell P.T. Cripps R.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 63-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The presence of specific protein components and/or specific isoforms in these muscle-types should explain, at least in part, their special mechanical properties (27Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Becker D.K. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S.I. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The evident complexity of TnT regulation makes the study of TnT mRNA expression in Drosophila of particular interest. Several specialized muscles, for example IFM or TDT, are relatively homogeneous, facilitating biochemical studies correlating isoform-specific mRNA and protein expression with fiber type. A comparative analysis in Drosophila and other species could be important to the understanding of regulation and function of TnT gene splicing. In this article, we report the complete characterization of the gene encoding the Drosophila TnT (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The gene has several interesting structural features, including a first untranslated exon of 80 nucleotides, a microexon of just 3 nucleotides in length and two polyadenylation sites that are used somewhat differentially during development. A single promoter is utilized for the expression of the four TnT mRNA products generated by developmentally regulated alternative splicing. The transcripts present muscle-type specificity. The results strongly indicate the existence of post-translational regulation for the smallest IFM/TDT specific isoform, together with a direct or indirect role of these modifications in flight and/or jump function. Two genomic DNA libraries (EMBL3 from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis) were screened following a standard protocol (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two TnT cDNA probes were used: probe P2 (395-bp fragment) covering exon 2 to exon 6 and probe H2 (510-bp fragment) covering exon 8 to exon 11. The exon numbering used here (see Fig. 1) modifies that previously described (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Positive clones and subclones were purified and cloned in pUC18 and pBluescript and mapped for positions of restriction endonuclease cleavage and by Southern analysis with TnT cDNA probes and oligonucleotides derived from the TnT cDNA sequences (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). FourD. melanogaster clones were obtained containing overlapping inserts of 11, 11.5, 14.5, and 15 kb, covering a region of 25 kb (Fig. 1). One D. virilis clone was obtained containing an insert of 11.3 kb. The 15-kb D. melanogaster clone covers almost the complete gene, including 5 kb upstream from the trancriptional initiation site. The D. virilis clone covers the complete gene (in this case, approximately 9.2 kb) as well as close to 2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start. Several oligonucleotides covering distinct regions of the DNAs, were synthesized and used as primers for the sequencing of the clones (35Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Primer extension assays were conducted basically as described (36Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar). The primers used were: E2R (5′-CTCTTCATCGTCGGACAT-3′) and E3R (5′-CTCCTCGCGGGTTTCCTC-3′) complementary to nucleotides 26–43 and 71–88, respectively, of the TnT cDNA sequence (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with 50 μCi [γ-32P]-ATP and annealed at 65 °C/20 min with 25 μg total RNA from different developmental stages. The annealed primers were extended with 25 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) at 42 °C/120 min. The same primers were used on cloned genomic DNA templates to generate dideoxy sequencing ladders that were compared with the primer extension products to determine the distance in nucleotides from the designated primers to the TnT transcription initiation sites. The primer extensions were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. RT-PCR using RNA from distinct developmental stages, dissected muscles as well as body parts of flies, were performed according to standard protocols (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides covering different exons were used as primers. For exon 1 (5′-TAGTCGAACCGCAGCATT-3′) was used; for exon 2 (5′-CGACGATGAAGAGTACAC-3′); for exon 6 (5′-CACGCCTGCATCCTCTT-3′) and (5′-GGAGAGGGCGATCCAGAG-3′); for exon 11 (5′-CCTCGTCCTCCTGATCTT-3′) and (5′-TGAATAGCAAGTTGTTAA-3′); for exon 5 of D. virilis (5′-TCGGCTGGTGTCTGAGGT-3′). Products were analyzed in 2% agarose gels. Bands were excised, cloned in pGEMT, and sequenced using T3 and T7 primers as described (35Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). To determine the presence of two functional polyadenylation signals, assays were performed as follows: A first step was carried out using oligo(dT) as a primer to retrotranscribe exclusively polyadenylated RNAs from different stages of development, namely, embryos, larvae, late pupae, and adults. Next, a PCR amplification was carried out using, in this case, an oligonucleotide covering exon 11 of the TnT gene as a direct primer and oligo(dT) as an indirect primer. Two different oligonucleotides were used as probes for Southern blot analysis of the products; the first, hybridizing a sequence just after the first polyadenylation signal and the second, after the second polyadenylation signal. PCR fragments were amplified through 30 cycles (94 °C/30 seg, 55 °C/30 seg, 72 °C/30 seg) usingTaq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized with the 66-bp sequence corresponding to exons 3 and 5. For cloning in pGEMT, ApaI and NsiI sequences were added as adapters on each end. The pGEMT polylinker was eliminated to avoid nonspecificity in the riboprobe. APstI/NsiI fragment (275 bp) from exon 6 was also cloned in the same vector. Riboprobes were labeled with digoxigenin using the DIG RNA labeling kit (T7) (Boehringer Mannheim). For in situ hybridizations, specimens were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles) and frozen at −80 °C. 20-μm sections were mounted on slides and hybridized at 55 °C overnight. After washing, sections were incubated overnight with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody at 4 °C. Embryos, larvae, pupae, or adult flies were homogenized in York buffer (16Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. White D.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, pellets containing the insoluble cytoskeletal proteins were electrophoresed and immunoblotted as described previously (27Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against TnT were prepared in the laboratory against the purified D. melanogaster TnT protein (37Domingo A. González-Jurado J. Maroto M. Vinós J. Carrasco C. Cervera M. Marco R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The staining was done with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of protein loaded in each lane was approximately 20 μg. After screening of two EMBL3 genomic libraries from twoDrosophila species using TnT cDNA probes from the 5′ and 3′ regions of the gene, four different genomic clones from D. melanogaster and one from D. virilis were isolated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Clones covering the TnT genes and 5′ upstream regions were subcloned and the restriction mapping completed (Fig. 1). Primer extension analysis (Fig. 2) confirmed that the published TnT cDNAs were incomplete at the 5′ end. Different approaches were used in the identification of the 5′-untranslated exon(s). Comparison of D. melanogaster and D. virilis genomic sequences allowed the identification of a 97% conserved region of 80 nucleotides, 2.3 kb away from the 5′ end of the published cDNAs (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The size of this sequence, the putative first exon, matched very well with the results previously obtained by primer extension. The existence of this exon was finally demonstrated by RT-PCR using RNAs from different stages of development. The sequence of the first exon of the D. melanogaster TnT gene is presented in Fig. 2 B. The primer extension assays also indicated the existence of several transcriptional initiation sites. Five different initiation sites were distributed throughout a 19 nucleotide sequence and were used with almost the same intensity throughout Drosophiladevelopment (Fig. 2 A). In addition, during our analysis of the differential muscle-type RNA expression of the TnT gene (see below), the presence was demonstrated of another unidentified exon (exon 4), which is only 3 nucleotides in length. When RNA from late pupae were cloned by RT-PCR and sequenced, comparison revealed the existence of a GAA trinucleotide in one cDNA absent in the already published TnT cDNA clones (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The following experiments were done to confirm the existence of a possible trinucleotide exon. First, we found that the trinucleotide was conserved in the sequenced D. virilis adult cDNA (Fig. 3 A) even though D. melanogaster and D.virilis diverged more than 50 million years ago. This conservation through evolution indicates the importance of this trinucleotide for insect TnT function. Second, the introns in which the putative exons should appear were sequenced in both species, revealing that a GAA trinucleotide was, indeed, present in both genomic sequences (Fig. 3 B). The microexon was flanked by acceptor and donor splice consensus sequences, namely the AG at 3′ splice junction and GT at the 5′ splice junction of the gene (38Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P. Gestland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1993: 303-357Google Scholar,39Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). As expected for an exon, both a pyrimidine-rich region in the upstream region of the GAA and a possible branch point (an adjacent A), upstream of the pyrimidine region, were also present in both species (38Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P. Gestland R. Atkins J. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1993: 303-357Google Scholar, 39Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Finally, the intron-exon boundaries for the 11 exons of the Drosophila TnT gene have been sequenced and compared. All donor and acceptor splice sites correlate with the splice junction consensus for Drosophila (40Mount S.M. Burks C. Hertz G. Stormo G.D. White O. Fields C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In particular, GTAAGT was the donor splice sequence in 8 of the 11 exons, including the microexon (data not shown). Comparison of the genomic clones of both species at the 3′ end of the genes also revealed the existence of another conserved polyadenylation site, AATAAA, in the D. melanogaster gene at 96 bp of the one previously published (11Fyrberg E. Fyrberg C.C. Beall C. Saville D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether the newly identified polyadenylation signal was functional, PCR assays were carried out (see “Experimental Procedures”). The analysis indicated that both signals were used all through development. The first signal appears to be used preferentially in embryos, whereas both are found in the transcripts in the adult musculature (data not shown). Regions extending 250–400 bp upstream of the initiation starts in bothDrosophilidae were sequenced. The alignment of both sequences allowed the identification of putative functional motifs in the proximal 5′ regions of both genes. Analysis of these two regions confirmed that they contained regulatory elements of the TnT genes (Fig. 4). The pentanucleotide TCAGT, a consensus sequence for the eukaryotic promoter capsite (41Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and for the regulatory initiator element (42Purnell P.A. Emanuel P.A. Gilmour D.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), is present in the sequenced TnT transcriptional initiation sites and is highly conserved in the twoDrosophilidae. Furthermore, TnT proximal sequences in both species show AT-rich regions, between −35 and −40 from the initiation site. A region extending to around 90–100 nucleotides upstream of the initiation starts was more than 85% conserved, indicating that these regions may correspond to the TnT minimal promoters. A conserved CCAAT element was also detected at approximately the canonical distance, between −101 and −106 from the initiation start. In addition, two conserved E boxes (the binding site for nautilus, the Drosophila MyoD), found to be critical in numerous vertebrate muscle promoters (43Olson E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), were also detected at −170 and −245 in the D. melanogaster 5′ region of the TnT gene. On the other hand, the CG elements, also important in eukaryotic promoters, have not been clearly detected in the proximal promoter regions of TnT genes. In summary, it is possible to say that Drosophila TnT gene is organized into 11 exons using two polyadenylation sites separated 96 bp in different muscle types. Moreover, the gene appears to be controlled by a single promoter that regulates the expression of the different mRNAs. As a first approach, RT-PCR was performed with RNA from distinct stages of development, as well as from different body parts of flies (heads, thoraces, and abdomens). The presence of at least three transcripts was detected (Fig. 5). Two of them appeared in the embryonic and adult musculature, whereas the smaller one was found exclusively in the adult musculature and was detected first in late pupae. To study these mRNA in more detail, the different products of the RT-PCR were isolated, subcloned in pGEMT and sequenced. In the analysis of the 5′ region of the mRNA, oligonucleotides covering the amplification of DNA fragments from exon 1 to exon 6 were used as primers (Fig. 5 A). Detailed comparison of the cloned and sequenced RT-PCR products obtained from larvae and late pupae allowed the identification of four different transcripts that differ in the choice of exons 3, 4, and 5. In Fig. 5 B, the exonic organization of the alternative spliced 5′ regions of the transcripts is indicated. The larger transcripts detected in larvae and pupae differ only in the presence of the microexon (exon 4). To explore whether the 3′ region was alternatively spliced and since exon 11 encodes for a long polyglutamic tail that may be implicated in the regulation of contraction by Ca2+ (37Domingo A. González-Jurado J. Maroto M. Vinós J. Carrasco C. Cervera M. Marco R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the expression of this region more carefully using three distinct oligonucleotides as primers. In this case, an oligonucleotide covering exon 6 as a direct primer and two different ones as reverse primers were used. The first allowed the amplification of the first part of exon 11 and the second, amplification of the whole exon, including the sequence encoding the polyglutamic tail (Fig. 5 C). The complete analysis of the RT-PCR sequenced products revealed that TnT transcripts showed only alternative splicing in the 5′ region sharing the last 8 exons. The muscle specificity of these transcripts was examined in greater detail. RT-PCR assays using RNA of dissected muscles were performed with TDT, IFM, visceral muscles from larvae, adult, and larval hypodermic muscles (Fig. 6). Since alternative splicing had been detected only in the 5′ end of TnT, the study was focused on this regio"
https://openalex.org/W1998793317,"We constructed 18 single amino acid mutants of the adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) and 17 of the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), at locations in the fatty acid (FA) binding sites. For each mutant protein, we measured thermodynamic parameters that characterize FA binding. Binding affinities ranged from about 200-fold smaller to 30-fold larger than the wild type (WT) proteins. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that binding affinities often inaccurately reported changes in protein-FA interactions because changes in the binding entropy and enthalpy were usually compensatory and larger than the binding free energy. FA-FABP interactions were quite different for I-FABP and A-FABP proteins. Binding affinities were larger and decreased to a greater degree with increasing FA solubility for most of the I-FABP as compared with the A-FABP proteins, consistent with a more hydrophobic binding site for the I-FABP proteins. In A-FABP, Ala substitutions for Arg106 and Arg126, which interact with the FA carboxylate, reduce affinities by about 100-fold, but in I-FABP, R106A increases affinities up to 30-fold. Moreover, in A-FABP, the thermodynamic parameters predict that the FA carboxylate location switches from the 126-position in R106A to the 106 position in R126A. Finally, the A-FABP proteins, in contrast to the I-FABP proteins, reveal significant heat capacity changes (ΔCp) upon FA binding, and substitutions at residues Arg106 and Arg126 reduce the magnitude of ΔCp.

Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) 1The abbreviations used are: FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; AA, arachidonate (20:4); A-FABP, adipocyte FABP; I-FABP, intestinal FABP; FA, fatty acid; LA, linoleate (18:2); LNA, linolenate (18:3); OA, oleate (18:1); PA, palmitate (16:0); SA, stearate; WT, wild type; GdnHCl, guanidine HCl. are approximately 15-kDa cytosolic proteins that probably play important roles in fatty acid (FA) metabolism (1Bass N.M.

FABPs have been found in a wide variety of cells and form a family of proteins whose amino acid sequence identity varies between about 25 and 95% (3Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of this family of proteins differ, their backbone structures are virtually identical (3Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography and NMR studies indicate that the dominant feature of the FABP structure is a “clam shell” formed by 10 orthogonal β-strands (Fig. 1 A). These studies also reveal that the FA binds to a site that is internal to the protein (5Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol.

Although the three-dimensional structures of the proteins are quite similar, the conformation of the FA within the binding site differs considerably for the different members of this family. In particular, in the mouse adipocyte (A-FABP) the FA conformation is curved relative to the FA bound in the rat intestinal FABPs (I-FABPs), which shares only about 25% sequence identity with the adipocyte protein (Fig. 1 A). Because of these FA conformation and amino acid sequence differences, the amino acids interacting with the FA within the binding cavity differ appreciably for these two FABPs (Fig. 1, B and C). In the adipocyte, the FA is within 4.5 Å of about 18 amino acid residues and about 9 of these residues are hydrophobic, while in the intestinal FABP, 19 amino acid residues are within 4.5 Å of the FA and about 14 are hydrophobic (12Sacchettini J.C.

FA binding affinities for the adipocyte and intestinal FABP are in the 1–400 nm range, and thermodynamic measurements reveal that binding to both proteins is predominately enthalpically driven (14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Binding characteristics do, however, differ for the two proteins. In particular, affinities for most FAs are larger for I-FABP than A-FABP. Moreover, the change in binding enthalpy (−11 kcal/mol) is virtually independent of FA type for I-FABP, but it decreases monotonically from −5 to −12 kcal/mol, with increasing FA solubility from arachidonate to palmitate, for A-FABP. To understand how the interactions between the FA and amino acids within the binding cavity of I-FABP are related to binding affinities, we have investigated the binding thermodynamics for FA binding to single amino acid mutants of I-FABP, in which the single amino acid substitutions were generated for most of the amino acid residues that form the binding cavity (16Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Results of these studies revealed that binding affinities alone do not accurately reflect the change in the underlying molecular interactions caused by the amino acid substitution. A more accurate understanding of the interactions is obtained by measurements of the change in binding enthalpy and entropy induced by each mutant. In the present study, we have extended this investigation to the adipocyte protein and several additional I-FABP mutants both to understand the interactions in A-FABP and to attempt to relate the differences in FA conformation and binding affinities in these two proteins. In particular, we have investigated the effect of single amino acid substitutions at 15 sites within the FA binding cavity of A-FABP. We measured binding affinities for FA to each mutant as a function of temperature and used van't Hoff analysis to obtain the thermodynamic parameters of binding. These results revealed enthalpy-entropy compensation effects in the adipocyte proteins as observed previously for mutants of the intestinal protein, and in addition, mutants of the adipocyte protein reveal substantial changes in heat capacity for single amino acid substitutions. All measurements were done, as described previously (14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Richieri G.V.

All binding measurements were done in a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm NaHPO4, at pH 7.4. The fluorescent free fatty acid probe, ADIFAB (acrylodated I-FABP), was prepared from acrylodan-derivatized recombinant rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (rI-FABP) as described (17Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is available from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mutants were constructed by extension of overlapping oligonucleotides, which together spanned restriction endonuclease sites in I-FABP, and insertion of the resulting double-stranded DNA as described (16Richieri G.V.

Mutant and WT proteins were expressed in the pET/BL21 system (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described previously (14Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Five of 20 A-FABP mutants produced inclusion bodies (Y19A, D76A, R78A, I104A, and Y128A), and of these, soluble protein (between 14 and 90 mg) was recovered for Y19A, D76A, and R78A by solubilizing the inclusion bodies in 4 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and then renaturing by dialysis against a Tris buffer as described (16Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Y128A precipitated from solution at 37 °C during Lipidex delipidation and consequently binding was not measured for this protein. The I104A mutant precipitated from solution upon renaturing the protein from GdnHCl and therefore binding was not measured for this protein as well. Although R78A and D76A also precipitated from solution, this occurred at 45 and 50 °C, respectively; therefore, measurements were done with these proteins. In general, I-FABP mutants had fewer problems of recovery and higher yields than the A-FABP mutants. After isolation, the proteins were stored at 4 °C in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% sodium azide at pH 8.0. The I-FABP mutants were found to be stable; binding affinities for the I-FABP mutants were unchanged after many months of storage. However, the A-FABP mutant proteins were much less stable. Certain of the mutants (in particular M20A and M40A) showed large decreases in binding affinity over a few months after purification, indicating a general refolding or denaturation of the protein. Moreover, the V115A mutant, although revealing a constant affinity, showed a decrease in stoichiometry (from 1 to less than 0.3) over a period of several months, suggesting a loss of protein through denaturation. The results presented here were obtained using protein within a few weeks of purification. Measurements of the binding of FA to FABP were done by using ADIFAB fluorescence to monitor the binding of the sodium salts of the FA to each FABP at temperatures between 10 and 45 °C as described (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For both A-FABP and I-FABP mutants, the binding affinities were measured for six FA (PA, SA, OA, LA, AA, and LNA) at 37 °C. For I-FABP, the affinities for four FA (PA, OA, LA, and AA) were measured from 10 to 45 °C. Binding isotherms for I-FABP exhibited linear van't Hoff behavior, and ΔH 0 values were determined from the slopes of each of the van't Hoff plots. 2Although the binding constants are given as dissociation constants (Kd), the thermodynamic parameters throughout the paper are for the association reaction, as in our previous studies (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The parameters for association are simply the negative of those for dissociation. ΔG 0 values were evaluated from the Kd values measured at 25 °C, and −TΔS 0 was calculated as ΔG 0 − ΔH 0. For the A-FABP mutants, the affinities of OA and AA were measured at temperatures ranging from 10 to 50 °C. The isotherms for the A-FABP proteins did not in general reveal linear van't Hoff behavior, and these data were analyzed using the integral form of the van't Hoff expression to obtain values for ΔH 0 and −TΔS 0 as well as for Δ Cp0 (19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of I-FABP and A-FABP WT and mutants proteins to denaturation by GdnHCl was determined by measuring tryptophan fluorescence (λext = 290 nm; λemis = 340 nm) with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. These results were analyzed assuming a two-state model using the methods described previously for FABPs (20Ropson I.J. Gordon J.I. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9591-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Prinsen C.F.M. Veerkamp J.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, for each curve, the intensities at 0 and 3 m GdnHCl were assumed to represent the completely native protein and denatured proteins, respectively. These values were used to calculate the ratio of denatured to native protein (K) and therefore ΔG, from ΔG =RTlnK, at each GdnHCl concentration. Furthermore, we determined from the denaturation curves the concentration of GdnHCl at which fluorescence was reduced by 50% ([D]50), the slope (mG) of the variation of ΔG with [GdnHCl], and the free energy difference (ΔGapp) between the native and denatured states extrapolated to zero [GdnHCl]. We engineered Ala substitutions at 15 A-FABP locations that are within 4.5 Å of the FA (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we generated Gln substitutions at residue positions 106 and 126 and a Gly substitution at position 57. We also engineered Ala substitutions in I-FABP at positions analogous to 12 of the 15 locations of the adipocyte protein (Fig. 1 C). In addition, we substituted Gln at 106 and 126, Gly at 55, and Cys and Phe at 27. Results for nine of the 12 Ala (positions 14, 17, 18, 23, 55, 115, 117, 106, and 126) and one of the Gln (position 106) substitutions in I-FABP were reported previously (16Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and are reproduced here for comparison. For each of these mutants, we measured binding affinities for several long chain FAs at 37 °C (Table I) using the ADIFAB method as described previously (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J.

The results of these measurements are also shown as the differences in the free energy of binding between the mutant and WT proteins (ΔΔG 0) in Figs. 2 and3. The results for A-FABP reveal that, relative to the WT protein, the single amino acid substitutions result in affinities that are virtually unchanged to ones that range from 50% (V32A) to about 150-fold (Y19A and R126Q) smaller than the WT. In contrast, the I-FABP mutants reveal a number of substitutions that increase as well as decrease binding affinities so that mutant affinities range from about 30-fold lower (ΔΔG 0 = +2 kcal/mol) to 30-fold higher (ΔΔG 0 = −2 kcal/mol) than the WT protein. These differences are particularly evident for the Ala substitutions at positions 106 and 117 that result in lower affinities for the adipocyte but higher ones for the intestinal proteins.Table IDissociation constants for I-FABP and A-FABP proteinsProteinI-FABPPASAOALALNAAAWT206.02790367200Y14A147.72445121147F17A5627.073211461205M18A14993.036674816402300I23A9432.01865091109589K27A92.91757184163K27C185.936136169400K27F73.0133598140F55A10454.024847813761515F55G179128.051096033003240R56A374405.0832216610,0005800D74A15683.0533131345371260R106A41.124108R106Q21742.090153247227Q115A135.8194912760Y117A52.34103520R126A148148.035252012501550R126Q150140.046081022002400A-FABPWT777661100196140F16A22001500920160050002500Y19A11,50029003900760016,0005300M20A590430240410390V25A6701050510600960660T29A170170110260335290V32A9014586140340230M40A681104286109F57A263180200300317260F57G6805004806401240880K58A11014090152205283D76A710380147390800740R78A1440980432101420201260R106A723144473100021001000R106Q320050003400610013,0004500V115A621005492235153C117A190437150475328518R126A250030002000760090004150R126Q740013,000650011,50022,0008400 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Free energy differences for FA binding between mutant and WT I-FABP proteins.

Biol. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have therefore carried out measurements of the binding affinities for each of the WT and mutant proteins as a function of temperature and have used the differential or integral form of the van't Hoff expression to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the binding reaction (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 16Richieri G.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the temperature dependence for the WT adipocyte protein was consistent with the differential form of the van't Hoff expression, implying no change in heat capacity (ΔCp) upon ligand binding (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, more extensive study of the binding characteristics of the adipocyte proteins reveals a curvature in their van't Hoff plots that is distinct from the linear behavior of the intestinal proteins (Fig. 4). We have therefore analyzed the WT and mutant forms of the adipocyte proteins with the integral form of the van't Hoff expression to obtain the heat capacity change upon binding as well as the enthalpy. The lack of significant heat capacity changes observed for the WT form of the intestinal protein are consistent with calorimetry measurements (23Kurian E. Kirk W.R. Prendergast F.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3865-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Results at 25 °C for the differences in enthalpy (ΔΔH 0), entropy (TΔΔS 0), free energy (ΔΔG 0), and heat capacity (ΔΔ Cp0) of oleate and arachidonate binding between each mutant and the WT adipocyte protein have been arranged in Fig. 5 so that the ΔΔG 0 values increase monotonically. The results demonstrate that changes in affinities (ΔΔG 0) are not correlated with ΔΔH 0,TΔΔS 0, or ΔΔ Cp0 because ‖ΔΔH 0‖ and ‖TΔΔS 0‖ are large, relative to ‖ΔΔG 0‖, and tend to compensate in these binding reactions. Results for the I-FABP proteins also reveal enthalpy-entropy compensation and a lack of correlation of these changes with ΔΔG 0 (Fig. 6). These results include for I-FABP the Ala substitutions for Lys27, Arg56, and Asp74 as well as K27F, F55G, and R126Q, in addition to those discussed previously (16Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the overall patterns of enthalpy and entropy changes are similar for the adipocyte and intestinal proteins, the intestinal proteins are all consistent with zero changes in heat capacity. In addition, the magnitude of ‖ΔΔH 0‖ and ‖TΔΔS 0‖ for the intestinal proteins are generally greater (average of 4 kcal/mol) than the adipocyte proteins (average of 2 kcal/mol), but at the same time the ‖ΔΔG 0‖ values for the adipocyte are equal to or greater than those for the intestine, implying weaker interactions and a smaller degree of enthalpy-entropy compensation in the adipocyte than the intestinal proteins.Figure 6Mutant-WT changes in thermodynamic parameters for I-FABP proteins. Values for ΔΔG 0, ΔΔH 0, and TΔΔS 0 were calculated as in Fig. 5. ΔG 0, ΔH 0, and −TΔS 0 were determined at 25 °C for PA, OA, LA, and AA and are in units of kcal/mol. The results in this figure have been arbitrarily arranged so that ΔΔG 0 values for linoleate increase monotonically. The scale for ΔΔG 0 is amplified 2–3-fold relative to those for ΔΔH 0 and TΔΔS 0. Negative values for all three parameters indicate more favorable binding. S.D. values (in kcal/mol) are approximately 0.1–0.2 for ΔΔG 0 and 1–2 for ΔΔH 0 and TΔΔS 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Protein stability of the adipocyte and intestinal WT and mutant proteins was assessed by the GdnHCl-induced changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Results shown in Fig. 7 and in Table II reveal that the half-concentration for denaturation ranges between 0.8 and 1.6 m and that WT A-FABP is somewhat more stable than WT I-FABP. Also shown in the table are the mutant-WT differences in free energy change for denaturation. A plot of these values versus the ΔΔG 0 for binding reveals that mutation-induced changes in stability and binding affinity are not correlated (Fig. 8). This lack of stability-binding affinity correlation is consistent with results for DNA binding and stability of the gene V protein of bacteriophage f1 (24Sandberg W.S. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl.

Single amino acid substitutions produced proteins that had binding affinities ranging from about 200-fold smaller to 30-fold larger than WT. Although affinities of the 17 intestinal FABP variants revealed decreases as well as increases, the 18 A-FABP variants had affinities that were either equal to or less than the WT. The thermodynamic parameters for both sets of proteins revealed that binding affinities often inaccurately reported changes in protein-FA interactions because changes in the binding entropy and enthalpy were large and usually compensatory, as described previously for I-FABP (16Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, the A-FABP proteins, in contrast to those from I-FABP, reveal significant heat capacity changes upon FA binding, and the magnitude of ΔCp was altered by specific single amino acid substitutions. Binding affinities of FA for FABPs reflect FA-water interactions involved in the desolvation step and FA interactions with amino acids and bound water within the FABP binding cavities. In the desolvation step, the hydrophobic effect drives FA out of the water phase and into the FABP, yielding a favorable contribution to the free energy of binding of about −10 kcal/mol that is primarily entropic (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite this large and favorable entropic contribution to the binding free energy, the binding free energy is almost entirely enthalpic, because the FA-FABP interaction within the binding cavity involves a favorable enthalpy but a nearly compensating unfavorable entropy change of about +10 kcal/mol (15Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Relatively small mismatches in these nearly compensatory contributions to the free energy give rise separately to the observed FABP specificity for different FA and to the magnitude of the binding affinity. Although certain amino acid substitutions (e.g.F17A, R106A or R106Q, Y117A, and R126A in I-FABP and V25A, R106A, and C117A in A-FABP) change the specificity of FA binding (Table III), virtually all of the amino acid substitutions in I-FABP or A-FABP yield proteins that reveal increases in affinity with decreasing FA solubility, indicating the importance of aqueous solubility in determining the specificity of FA binding to FABPs.Table IIISummary of thermodynamic parameter changes in Ala mutants of adipocyte and intestinal FABPsPair3-2001Pairs of roughly corresponding positions (see “Discussion” and Fig. 1) in A-FABP and I-FABP, respectively.Affinity3-bAffinity changes less than 2-fold are indicated as “0.”ΔΔH°3-2003Values of ‖ΔΔH°‖ and ‖TΔΔS°‖ less than about 1.5 kcal/mol are indicated as “0” (except for F57A), values between 1.5 an"
https://openalex.org/W1976018547,"There is strong evidence that Asp-378 of the yeast PMA1 ATPase plays an essential role in ATP hydrolysis by forming a covalent β-aspartyl phosphate reaction intermediate. In this study, Asp-378 was replaced by Asn, Ser, and Glu, and the mutant ATPases were expressed in a temperature-sensitive secretion-deficient strain (sec6–4) that allowed their properties to be examined. Although all three mutant proteins were produced at nearly normal levels and remained stable for at least 2 h at 37 °C, they failed to travel to the vesicles that serve as immediate precursors of the plasma membrane; instead, they became arrested at an earlier step of the secretory pathway. A closer look at the mutant proteins revealed that they were firmly inserted into the bilayer and were not released by washing with high salt, urea, or sodium carbonate (pH 11), treatments commonly used to strip nonintegral proteins from membranes. However, all three mutant ATPases were extremely sensitive to digestion by trypsin, pointing to a marked abnormality in protein folding. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the mutant ATPases could not be protected against trypsinolysis by ligands such as MgATP, MgADP, or inorganic orthovanadate. Thus, Asp-378 functions in an unexpectedly complex way during the acquisition of a mature structure by the yeast PMA1 ATPase. There is strong evidence that Asp-378 of the yeast PMA1 ATPase plays an essential role in ATP hydrolysis by forming a covalent β-aspartyl phosphate reaction intermediate. In this study, Asp-378 was replaced by Asn, Ser, and Glu, and the mutant ATPases were expressed in a temperature-sensitive secretion-deficient strain (sec6–4) that allowed their properties to be examined.

The yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase, encoded by the PMA1 gene (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), belongs to a widespread and versatile family of cation transporters known as the P2-ATPases (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Like other members of the group including the Na+,K+-, H+,K+-, and Ca2+-ATPases of animal cells, it has a 100-kDa catalytic subunit that is anchored in the lipid bilayer by four hydrophobic segments at the N-terminal end and six hydrophobic segments at the C-terminal end (reviewed in Refs. 3Serrano R.

Overall, the P2-ATPases share ∼20% amino acid sequence homology, with the best-conserved stretches found in the central catalytic region of the protein. By contrast, the membrane segments have diverged markedly during evolution, presumably to handle the array of different cations (H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Cd2+) that are pumped. The catalytic mechanism of the P-ATPases has been the subject of intense study during the past several decades, starting with the pioneering work of Post, Albers, and their colleagues on the Na+,K+-ATPase (8Post R.L.

During the reaction cycle, the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP is transferred to an aspartyl residue embedded in a strongly conserved sequence motif (CSDKTGTLT) near the beginning of the central hydrophilic loop. The resulting β-aspartyl phospho-intermediate can be recognized by its instability at alkaline pH, sensitivity to hydroxylamine, and borohydride-mediated reduction to homoserine (11Degani C. Dahms A.S. Boyer P.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 242: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the PMA1H+-ATPase of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a phospho-intermediate with the same properties has been detected and carefully documented (12Amory A. Foury F. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9353-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Amory A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4723-4730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been studied in the closely related H+-ATPase of Neurospora crassa (14Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2931-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10724-10730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by (16Malpartida F. Serrano R. Eur. J.

Although the relevant phosphopeptide has not yet been isolated and directly sequenced in fungi, the fungal enzymes do contain the hallmark CSDKTGTLT motif (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar,18Hager K.H. Mandala S.M. Davenport J.W. Speicher D.W. Benz Jr., E.J. Slayman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17549-17555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptide purification and sequencing has been accomplished for the very similar H+-ATPase from corn roots, where the phosphorylated Asp residue was found to be located in the familiar CS/TDK sequence (21Walderhaug M.O. Post R.L. Saccomani G. Leonard R.T. Briskin D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3852-3859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Asp-378 seems certain to play a key role in catalysis by the yeast H+-ATPase. With the cloned PMA1 gene in hand, efforts are now under way to probe structure-function relationships of the yeast ATPase by site-directed mutagenesis. We have introduced a new experimental strategy for this purpose (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar) based on a sec6 yeast strain with a temperature-sensitive block in the last step of the secretory pathway (23Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The same strain carries both wild-type and mutant copies of the PMA1 gene, which have been placed under control of GAL1 and heat shock promoters, respectively. In galactose medium at 23 °C, the wild-type gene is expressed, and the normal form of the ATPase is delivered to the plasma membrane where it can support growth. In glucose medium at 37 °C, on the other hand, expression shifts to the mutant gene, and newly synthesized mutant ATPase becomes trapped in secretory vesicles. The vesicles are abundant, easily isolated (24Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and lend themselves well to assays of ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven H+ translocation (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). As an early application of the new expression strategy, we undertook recently to analyze the functional role of amino acids in the phosphorylation domain of the yeast H+-ATPase. Mutant forms of the ATPase with substitutions in several of the conserved amino acid residues (Lys-379, Thr-380, Thr-382, and Thr-384) were expressed in secretory vesicles and characterized with respect to enzymatic, transport, and structural properties (25Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the fact that these particular residues are found in all known P-ATPases, they proved essential for activity of the yeast enzyme, and only the most conservative substitutions (Lys to Arg or Thr to Ser) could be tolerated. However, mutations of the phosphorylated residue (Asp-378) proved to have surprisingly complex consequences. Our initial study showed that replacement of Asp-378 by Ser or even by Asn or Glu interrupted ATPase biogenesis at a step before the secretory vesicles; the same amino acid substitutions also behaved as dominant lethal mutations, preventing growth when coexpressed with a wild-type PMA1 gene (26Rao R. Nakamoto R.K. Verjovski-Almeida S. Slayman C.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). An important insight came when Harris et al. (27Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10531-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) detected an abnormal proliferation of intracellular membranes during the induction of D378N. By means of immunofluorescence staining, coexpressed wild-type ATPase was shown to accumulate in the same membranes, which also contained the endoplasmic reticulum marker, Kar2. Similar results have since been reported by Portillo (28Portillo F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, Asp-378 plays a critical role in ATPase biogenesis. In the current study, we have explored the molecular basis for this behavior. Although the D378N, D378S, and D378E mutant ATPases are synthesized and inserted into the membrane at a reasonably normal rate, limited trypsinolysis has revealed a profound defect in protein folding. It seems likely that the poorly folded proteins are detected by a “quality control” mechanism within the secretory pathway, preventing their export from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and resulting in membrane proliferation. Two strains of S. cerevisiae were used for this project: SY4 (ura3–52; leu2–3,112;sec6–4; GAL;pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1) and SY9 (ura3–52;leu2–3,112; sec18–1; GAL;pma1::YIpGAL-PMA1). In each case, the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene was placed under galactose control by gene disruption (29Cid A. Perona R. Serrano R. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with the integrating plasmid, YIpGAL-PMA1 (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). In addition, SY4 contains the temperature-sensitive sec6–4mutation to block fusion of the secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, and SY9 contains the temperature-sensitivesec18–1 mutation to disrupt membrane flow from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (23Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). All three strains were derived from NY605 (MATa; ura3–52;leu2–3,112; GAL), kindly supplied by Dr. Peter Novick of the Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine. Growth conditions and media were as described by Rao and Slayman (25Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6708-6713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mutagenesis of residue 378, the 495-base pair StyI to BamHI fragment of the PMA1 gene (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a modified Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single-stranded DNA was generated in Escherichia coli strain TG1 with the helper phage M13K07, and site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method of Taylor et al. (30Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). After the sequence of the mutated fragment was confirmed by double-stranded sequencing, it was moved into pPMA1.2 (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar), and the 3.8-kilobase HindIII toSacI fragment containing the full-length mutant gene was placed under heat shock control in the centromeric plasmid YCp2HSE (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). For constitutive expression, the PMA1 promoter (31Capieaux E. Vignais M.-L. Sentenac A. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7437-7446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained within the 1.1-kilobase HindIII to ClaI fragment of the PMA1 genomic clone (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) was used to replace the HindIII to ClaI region in pPMA1.2. The 4.7-kilobase HindIII to SacI fragment containing the reconstructed gene was then moved to the LEU2centromeric plasmid, YCplac111 (32Geitz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into yeast by the lithium acetate method of Ito et al. (33Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for secretory vesicle isolation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting together with assays for ATPase activity and protein have been described previously (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). Synthesis of plasmid-encoded ATPase protein was assayed by35S-labeling and immunoprecipitation under conditions permitting expression of the plasmid-borne but not the chromosomalPMA1 gene (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar). SY4 cells transformed with the appropriate plasmid were grown to mid-exponential phase in minimal medium + 2% galactose at 23 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in minimal medium + 2% glucose for an additional 3 h period, still at 23 °C. The concentration of cells was then adjusted to give 25 ml of culture with A600 = 1.0, and the suspension was shifted to a shaking waterbath at 39 °C. After 30 min, 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the incubation was continued for 1.5 h. Sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.14 ml of 10 mm NaN3. After the addition of 0.14 ml of 2.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, 55 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.5, and zymolyase 20T (0.7 mg/ml), the suspension was incubated at 39 °C for 35 min. Digestion was then terminated by the addition of 3.0 ml of cold 1.4 msorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, 50 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.5. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 4.0 ml of cold lysis buffer (12.5% w/v sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm triethanolamine, adjusted to pH 7.5 with acetic acid, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture as described previously; Ref. 22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar), and lysed by homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 418 × g to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant fraction was carefully removed and centrifuged for 45 min at 175,000 × g. Finally, the total membrane pellet was resuspended by Teflon glass homogenization in 200 μl of 1 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris-containing protease inhibitors as described above. Aliquots (50 μl) were frozen at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots (10 μl) were diluted into 0.5 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate and treated as described by Chang and Slayman (34Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the closely related plasma membrane H+-ATPase of N. crassa(18Hager K.H. Mandala S.M. Davenport J.W. Speicher D.W. Benz Jr., E.J. Slayman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7693-7697Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Radiolabeled total membranes were diluted to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 1 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris (no protease inhibitors). 5 μl of membrane suspension were added to 10 μl of 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, including 0.1 mm sodium vanadate or 5 mm MgADP when indicated. After preincubation at 30 °C for 2 min, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) was added to give the desired trypsin:protein ratio. At the end of the incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Samples were immunoprecipitated as described (34Chang A. Slayman C.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) followed by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Fluorography was performed by impregnating the fixed gels with 1 msodium salicylate (30 min at room temperature), and the gels were dried and exposed to film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham). In the immunofluorescence study by Harriset al. (27Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H. Haber J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10531-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the substitution of Asn for Asp-378 in the PMA1 ATPase caused a proliferation of intracellular membranes that were related to (and very likely derived from) the endoplasmic reticulum. The membranes could be labeled with antibody against an epitope-tagged D378N construct, consistent with the idea that newly synthesized mutant ATPase became arrested at this early step in the secretory pathway. Indeed, parallel work in our laboratory has provided direct evidence that the arrest is virtually complete. In the experiment of Fig. 1, D378N, D378S, and D378E mutant alleles were placed under control of the heat shock promoter in plasmid YCp2HSE and transformed into yeast strain SY4, which carries a temperature-sensitive block in the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane. The transformed cells were then grown in galactose medium at 23 °C and transferred to glucose medium at 39 °C. As described by Nakamoto et al. (22Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 7940-7949Google Scholar), this maneuver should lead to the specific appearance of newly synthesized plasmid-encoded ATPase in the vesicles that accumulate as a result of the block. Secretory vesicles were isolated, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 B) or immunoblotting with anti-ATPase antibody (Fig. 1 A). Little or no ATPase protein was seen in vesicles from any of the three mutants, even though a substantial amount was present in the wild-type control (12% of total secretory vesicle protein, as judged by gel scanning). There were no other appreciable differences in the protein pattern of the mutant vesicles, suggesting that the mutational block in biogenesis was specific for the PMA1 ATPase. To ask whether there was a defect in the synthesis of the mutant ATPases or whether they were abnormally susceptible to degradation, a modified version of the same experiment was performed in which [35S]methionine was added to the cell suspension 30 min after the temperature shift to 39 °C. After an additional 15-, 30-, 60-, or 90-min incubation, the cells were lysed, and total membranes were isolated and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ATPase antibody. The experiment included two different controls in which plasmid containing the wild-type PMA1 gene had been transformed into cells carrying temperature-sensitive alleles of sec6 and sec18, respectively. This made it possible to compare wild-type ATPase that had reached the secretory vesicles (WT/sec6) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild-type; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid. with that arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum (WT/sec18), the same location at which the mutant ATPases become arrested in D378N/sec6, D378S/sec6, and D378E/sec6. As shown in Fig. 2, newly synthesized ATPase was readily detected in the total membrane fraction from both wild-type controls and from all three mutants, and although there were minor differences in the time course and extent of labeling, the mutant ATPases were indistinguishable in molecular size (100 kDa) from the wild-type polypeptide. Thus, the failure of the mutant ATPases to reach the secretory vesicles in the experiment of Fig. 1 did not reflect a problem with synthesis or stability; rather, it was caused by a defect in membrane trafficking. To test whether the D378N, D378S, and D378E ATPases were properly inserted into the lipid bilayer, total35S-labeled membranes from the experiment of Fig. 2 were treated with reagents commonly used to strip nonintegral proteins from the membrane: 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11, 1.0 m NaCl, or 1.6 m urea. After exposure to the various reagents, the membranes were collected by centrifugation, and supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ATPase antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 3, there was little or no difference between wild-type ATPase arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum (WT/sec18) and any of the three mutants (D378N/sec6, D378S/sec6, D378E/sec6). Only in the case of D378S was a visible amount of ATPase seen in the supernatant fraction after treatment with urea, and even here, quantitative densitometry indicated that more than 90% of the ATPase remained in the pellet. Thus, like their wild-type counterpart, the mutant ATPases appear to become embedded in the membrane at an early step in their biogenesis. To ask whether the mutant proteins might be poorly folded, limited trypsinolysis was employed. This method, which gives information about the accessibility of Arg and Lys residues to proteolytic attack, has been widely used to probe the structure of P-ATPases and other membrane proteins. In previous studies with the yeast H+-ATPase, for example, Perlin and Brown (35Perlin D.S. Brown C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6788-6794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the tryptic degradation pattern of the 100-kDa polypeptide depended upon the presence or absence of physiological ligands, consistent with the idea that the ATPase could exist in at least two different conformational states. Chang et al. (36Chang A. Rose M.D. Slayman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5808-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have since shown that vanadate- and ADP-protectable proteolytic fragments are seen 5 min after the incorporation of [35S]methionine and cysteine into newly synthesized H+-ATPase, suggesting that a mature conformation is achieved quite early in biogenesis. The first step in the present study was to compare the sensitivity of wild-type and mutant ATPases to trypsin. In the experiment of Fig. 4, 35S-labeled total membranes were prepared from cells expressing plasmid-encoded ATPase, incubated at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:20 for 0–20 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-ATPase antibody. For newly synthesized wild-type enzyme that had reached the secretory vesicles (WT/sec6), the 100-kDa mature protein was clipped almost immediately by trypsin to give a 97-kDa form, which remained in appreciable amounts for the rest of the experiment. Even when wild-type ATPase was kept in the endoplasmic reticulum through use of the temperature-sensitive sec18 allele (WT/sec18), a similar pattern was obtained. By comparison, the three mutant ATPases (D378N/sec6, D378S/sec6, and D378E/sec6) were exceedingly sensitive to proteolysis. Even without trypsin, there was noticeable degradation, presumably mediated by an endogenous protease, whereas incubation at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:20 caused the 100-kDa polypeptide to disappear completely after only 0.5 min, with no trace of the 97 kDa form. Because vanadate ions have been shown to protect the wild-type yeast ATPase against trypsinolysis, presumably by binding to the 100-kDa polypeptide in the E2 conformation (35Perlin D.S. Brown C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6788-6794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed worthwhile to ask whether the mutant ATPases might be similarly protectable. As background for this experiment, wild-type and mutant enzymes were incubated for 10 min over a range of trypsin concentrations to find conditions that led to equivalent amounts of degradation; comparable results were obtained at trypsin:protein ratios of 1:4 for WT/sec6 and WT/sec18 and 1:50 for D378N/sec6, D378S/sec6, and D378E/sec6(not shown). Next, 35S-labeled membranes were incubated at these trypsin:protein ratios over a range of vanadate concentrations (0–100 μm), and the digests were immunoprecipitated and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 A, wild-type ATPase that had reached the secretory vesicles (WT/sec6) was visibly protected by vanadate at concentrations as low as 1 μm. Significant protection was also seen for wild-type enzyme arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum (WT/sec18). For the three mutant ATPases, however (D378N/sec6, D378S/sec6, and D378E/sec6), there was no detectable effect of vanadate, even at the highest concentration tested (100 μm). Thus, vanadate fails to bind to the altered phosphorylation domain of the D378N, D378S, and D378E ATPases or, if it does bind, fails to elicit the conformational change that normally protects the protein against trypsinolysis. Fig. 5 B illustrates the results of a parallel experiment with a different ligand, MgADP. In the case of wild-type ATPase located in secretory vesicles (WT/sec6) or endoplasmic reticulum (WT/sec18), the addition of 5 mm MgADP during the incubation with trypsin led to the accumulation of a 62-kDa fragment, whereas higher concentrations of MgADP (10 and 20 mm) gave noticeable protection of the larger 97-kDa form. For all three mutants, however, the highest concentration of MgADP tested (20 mm) had little or no effect on the 62-kDa fragment and no detectable effect on the 97-kDa fragment. Therefore, there is no convincing evidence that the mutant ATPases can interact with 20 mm MgADP; similar results were obtained with MgATP (not shown). Asp-378 has been strongly conserved throughout the P-ATPase family, and there is abundant biochemical evidence that it reacts with the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP during the catalytic cycle. As expected, replacement of the corresponding Asp residue by Asn, Glu, Ser, Thr, His, or Ala in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase gave an enzyme that was no longer capable of Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation or Ca2+ transport (37Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). When Asp-378 was mutated to Asn in the yeast PMA1 ATPase, however, the enzyme surprisingly appeared able to form a phosphorylated intermediate, split ATP, and pump protons (38Portillo F. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Data from the present study, together with the findings of Harriset al. (27Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), point to an explanation for this puzzling result. It is now clear that mutant PMA1 ATPases carrying substitutions of Asp-378 are synthesized and inserted into the membrane but are unable to move along the secretory pathway to the cell surface. At the same time, they prevent the concurrent processing of the wild-type ATPase, as shown by experiments with epitope-tagged protein (27Harris S.L. Na S. Zhu X. Seto-Young D. Perlin D.S. Teem J.H.

Because a functional ATPase is required for growth (1Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), the result is a strong selective pressure for genetic events that eliminate the mutant form. In the study by Harris et al.

The three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 RT, which assumes a hand-like structure, shows that the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains form the template-binding cleft and may be involved in determining the degree of processivity. To assess the influence of fingers subdomain of HIV-1 RT in polymerase processivity, two insertions were engineered in the β3-β4 hairpin of HIV-1NL4-3 RT.

When polymerase activities were measured under conditions that allow a single cycle of DNA polymerization, both of the mutants displayed 25–30% greater processivity than wild type enzyme. Homology modeling the three-dimensional structures of wild type HIV-1NL4-3 RT and its finger insertion mutants revealed that the extended loop between the β3 and β4 strands protrudes into the cleft, reducing the distance between the fingers and thumb subdomains to ∼12 Å.

In addition to its being a target for drug development, HIV-1 RT is unusual in its structural features, versatile use of both RNA and DNA templates, high error rates (1Preston B.D. Poiesz B.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer containing 66- and 51-kDa polypeptides, termed p66 and p51 (5Goff S.P. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 817-831PubMed Google Scholar, 6Le Grice S.F.J. Skalka A. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 163-191Google Scholar). The p51 is generated by the proteolytic cleavage of the p66 subunit (7Lightfoote M.M. Coligan J.E. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Martin M.A. Venkatesan S. J.

Biophys. 1989; 273: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of its likeness to a right hand, the subdomains of HIV-1 RT are named fingers, palm, and thumb which are joined to the RNase H domain via a connection subdomain (9Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J.

The fingers, palm, thumb, and connection subdomains of p66 constitute the polymerase domain of RT and form a cleft for template-primer binding and for the polymerase active site (9Kohlstaedt L.A.

The p51 subunit lacks the RNase H domain, and its three-dimensional structure, in contrast to that of p66, is more globular with no cleft (13Wang J. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Rice P.A. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The precise roles played by the various subdomains in the polymerase function of HIV-1 RT are unknown. The palm subdomain contains the catalytic triad of aspartates and therefore plays a key role in catalysis (9Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

In the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of the apo-RT and of RT complexed with template-primer or a non-nucleoside inhibitor, the thumb subdomain has been shown to occupy different positions with respect to the fingers (9Kohlstaedt L.A.

Clark A.D. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Structure. 1996; 4: 853-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, and the fact that the thumb domain intimately interacts with the template-primer (10Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D.J. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), it is proposed that the thumb subdomain mediates the translocation of the enzyme along template (12Hsiou Y. Ding J. Das K. Clark A.D. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Structure. 1996; 4: 853-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The palm, thumb, and fingers subdomains are all thought to contact the template-primer, and together they constitute the template-primer cleft of HIV-1 RT. To understand the role of the fingers subdomain of HIV-1 RT on the polymerase processivity, we engineered two gross alterations into the β3-β4 hairpin creating insertions within the flexible loop connecting the β strands. Both mutants were characterized for polymerase activity, sensitivity to nucleotide triphosphate analogs, kinetic constants, and finally processivity. The results indicate that the fingers subdomain plays an essential role in determining the processivity of polymerization by HIV-1 RT. Modeling the three-dimensional structure of RT with the extended fingers provided insight into the possible role of the β3-β4 hairpin in increasing the processivity of RT. The Escherichia colistrain DH5αF′IQ (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for expression of HIV-1 RT. The sequences of the RT employed in this study were derived from the molecular clone NL4-3 (15Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector used is pRT6H-NB/PROT containing an RTHXB2 p66 cassette and a separate HIV-1 PR expression cassette and is a version of pRT6H-PROT (16Le Grice S.F.J. Gruninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) containing NotI at the 5′-end. pL6H-PROT is a version of pRT6H-NB/PROT in which the RT sequences are replaced by a polylinker sequence. First, the RTHXB2sequences of pRT6H-NB/PROT were replaced with corresponding sequences from NL4-3 via polymerase chain reaction followed by digestion of the products by NotI and BglII and ligation of the fragment into the corresponding sites in pL6H-PROT. The deletion and insertion mutants were created by cassette mutagenesis as described previously (17Boyer P.L. Ferris A.L. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yang G. Song Q. Charles M. Drosopoulos W.C. Arnold E. Prasad V.R. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1996; 11: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a gap was created in RT fingers region lacking the codons 60–79 to facilitate both insertions and deletions into the region. This intermediate clone was digested withBspMI to release the central fragment, and double-stranded adaptors were ligated to the BspMI sites to generate the deletion and insertion mutants (Fig. 1). The mutant RTs were analyzed by sequencing before subcloning the RT NotI/BglII insert into the expression construct, pL6H-PROT, which places a hexahistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus of p66. Bacteria carrying the appropriate expression vector were induced for expression by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as described previously (19Kew Y. Song Q. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15331-15336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets of induced bacteria were lysed with lysozyme (1 mg/ml, for 20 min on ice), sonicated, and lysates cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor). The purification of the finger extension mutants was essentially similar to the procedure we used previously (19Kew Y. Song Q. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15331-15336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that all binding, washing, and elutions were done by the batch method. The specific activities of the wild type, FE20, and FE103 RTs were 3030, 1515, and 3333 units/mg, respectively (1 unit is defined as the activity equivalent to incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP in 10 min at 37 °C using poly(rA)·oligo(dT)). The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) assays on heteropolymeric templates were performed in a 16-μl reaction mix containing 53 pm 16 S rRNA template-22-mer primer (5′TAACCTTGCGGCCGTACTCCCC3′), 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm[α-32P]dGTP (2.7 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and 50 μm each of dCTP, dATP, and dTTP and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Duplicate reactions were stopped by spotting onto DE81 filter squares and washed with 2× SSC (30 mm sodium citrate, 300 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.0)) for 10–15 min four times to remove unincorporated dNTPs. The filters were dried and the counts/min determined via a scintillation counter (1218 Rack Beta, LKB-Wallac, Sweden), and the picomoles of dNMP incorporated were calculated. The RDDP assays on homopolymeric template-primers were similar to the above conditions, except that we used 1 μmpoly(rA)·oligo(dT) along with 10 μm[α-32P]dTTP (2.3 Ci/mmol) or 1 μmpoly(rC)·oligo(dG) along with 10 μm[α-32P]dGTP (2.3 Ci/mmol). The sensitivity to each of the four ddNTPs was separately measured in the heteropolymeric RNA template assay described above. The concentration of three dNTPs (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was each at 25 μm. The fourth dNTP, for which a competing ddNTP is also present in the reaction, was at 5 μm and was α-32P-labeled (2.3 Ci/mmol). The ddNTP concentration in each case (Boehringer Mannheim) ranged from 0.25 to 1 mm. The reactions, run for 15 min, were stopped as described above, and dNMP incorporation was quantitated as before. The kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, were determined for RDDP activity on poly(rA)·oligo(dT). The reactions utilized 0.5 ng/μl RDDP reaction and were carried out as described above. The kinetic constants were determined as described previously (19Kew Y. Song Q. Prasad V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15331-15336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processivity assays were carried out using the heparin trap method. The two RNA templates used, from HIV-1 or influenza genomes, were derived by in vitro transcription from plasmids pKSNL/RN and pBS-M1, respectively. pKSNL/RN was constructed by ligating anEcoRV-NsiI fragment of pNL4-3 into pBluescript-KS (Stratagene) vector digested with EcoRV and PstI. pKSNL/RN was linearized with BamHI and pBS-M1 (20Bui M. Whittaker G. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8391-8401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) kindly provided by Matthew Bui (Yale University) with AflIII prior to in vitro run-off transcription using the T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively (Ambion Corp.). The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in combination with HIV-1 and M1 RNA template are 5′CGCTTTCAAGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA3′ and 5′AGTGGATTGGTTGTTGTCACCAT3′, respectively. A 10-μl reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1.5 units of RT enzymes, and 10 nmtemplate-primer (HIV-1 or influenza virus M1 RNA) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Subsequently, 25 μm dNTPs and 40 μg of heparin were added together and incubated at 37 °C for another 5 min. The reactions were stopped with 10 μl of stop solution (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Six microliters of the final mixture were separated on denaturing gels. A titration of the trapping activity of heparin was performed against each of the three enzymes. No differences were revealed suggesting that the ability of heparin to quench the three enzymes was very similar (data not shown). A model of the FE20 and FE103 finger-extension mutants was generated from coordinates of RT bound with the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor, α-APA R95845 (1HNI) (21Ding J. Das K. Tantillo C. Zhang W. Clark A.D.J. Jessen S. Lu X. Hsiou Y. Jacobo-Molina A. Andries K. Pauwels R. Moereels H. Koymans L. Janssen P.A.J. Smith R.H.J. Kroeger Koepke M. Michejda C.J. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Structure. 1995; 3: 365-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Single residue substitutions were incorporated into the model to change the HXB2 sequence used for the x-ray structure determination to the wild type NL4-3 sequence used here. Residues that were modeled as alanines in the crystal structure because of weak electron density were also changed to conform the actual wild type NL4-3 RT sequence. The loop extensions of FE20 and FE103 RTs were introduced to the model of wild type NL4-3 RT using the loop-building function in the Homology package. The models of the three proteins, which included all atoms of their respective residues (including the inserted residues), were minimized using steepest descents with a CVFF forcefield in two steps using the Discover package (Biosym). In the first minimization, all residues present in the original crystallographic coordinates were constrained, and in the second, all non-hydrogen atoms were fixed. Next, a model of A-type DNA was made using the Builder package (Biosym). This model includes the 5 base pairs of A-form DNA that were positioned based on the phosphorous positions available from the RT-DNA co-crystal coordinates (1HMI) (10Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D.J. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In addition, a 10-base overhang in the template strand was modeled assuming that the single-stranded extension maintained an A-type conformation. Although the phosphate backbone of the single-stranded region is flexible, it is plausible that this DNA is in the A-form and such an assumption has been made by others (22Boyer P.L. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) attempting to model template extensions. The sequence of the template strand is thus 5′-AAAAAAAAAAATGGC-3′. The overhang modeled is not in the original coordinates. The double-stranded region positioned based on experimental coordinates and 5 residues of which were fixed throughout the minimization and dynamics calculations served as an anchor for the single-stranded region. Each protein-DNA model was minimized in sequential rounds, in which residues 105–112 and 178–191 (which together include the catalytic triad of aspartates) were fixed along with residues 12–15 of the template DNA and all 5 residues of the primer strand. The protein residues were fixed to prevent unreasonable distortions from occurring in the polymerase active site, particularly at or near Met-184 which is part of a turn containing unusual φ and ψ angles. The remaining portions of the model were restrained during minimization. Restraints were gradually lowered as minimization proceeded. Minimizations used a steepest descents algorithm initially and then switched to conjugate gradients when a maximum derivative limit of 2.5 kcal/mol Å had been reached, continuing to a final maximum derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol Å. Next, the structures were submitted to a dynamics calculation. Again, amino acid residues 105–112, 178–191, template residues 12–15, and all primer residues were fixed. Additionally, residues 388–560 and all 440 residues of p51 subunit were fixed. This simplification reduced computational times. Residues 388–560 are too far away to interact with the model DNA or residues binding the DNA. The dynamics calculation was carried out for 5 ps in 1-fs intervals at 298 K using a canonical ensemble. Following the dynamics calculation, coordinates were minimized using cff91 forcefield with the pH set to 7.5. These structures were again minimized, with residues 105–112, 178–191, and 388–560 of p66, all residues of p51, and template residues 12–15 and primer residues 1–5 fixed as before. Minimization was implemented to a derivative cut-off of 0.001 kcal/mol Å, before being resubmitted to further 11 ps of dynamics. The resulting coordinates were then minimized in an Amber forcefield to allow simulation of the effects of bulk solvent. A distance-dependent dielectric was employed with an r = 4 dependence for the dielectric constant, and 25-ps dynamics simulations were calculated. The root mean square deviations for the wild type HIV-1RTNL4-3, FE20, and FE103 models with respect to 1HNI starting coordinants were 1.6, 1.7, and 1.7 Å, respectively, when the palm residues were superpositioned. Superpositioning the fingers region yields root mean square deviations of 2.7, 3.0, and 3.6 Å, and root mean square deviations of 2.4, 2.1, and 2.8 Å result from superimposing the thumb residues of the wild type, FE20, and FE103 models on 1HNI coordinants. The only collisions seen between model residues and template is that between tyrosine 183 (wild type numbering) and template residue 12 (−2 position with respect to the template base that base pairs with incoming dNTP). The distance between Tyr-183 Cα and N-2 of the template residue 12 is 2.5 Å. This is a result of the constraints against movement imposed on these atoms to keep the active site aspartates or the template anchor residues from moving. No collisions are observed between finger residues and the extended template. Mutations were introduced into the fingers subdomain of recombinant pRTNL4-36H-PROT expression construct which contains separate expression cassettes for HIV-1NL4-3 RT p66 and HIV-1 protease (PR). Insertions in the β3-β4 hairpin were based on the structure reported by Jacobo-Molina et al. (10Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D.J. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In the original design of the finger extension, we wished to simply increase the bulk of the flexible loop. In the absence of suitable foreknowledge, we did not want to introduce electrostatic interactions which might adversely affect translocation and/or processivity as a result of altered enzyme-template-primer interactions, leading to an inactive state. Since serine residues avidly form hydrogen bonds and glycine residues have a high degree of main chain flexibility, we inserted a sequence that is rich in these residues to extend the size of the flexible loop (FE103, Fig. 1). During the process of mutagenesis to generate this insertion mutant, a fortuitous base deletion-insertion event within the inserted sequence led to the formation of an unintended mutant with an altered sequence in the insert (FE20, see Fig. 1). To assess the impact of alterations in the β3-β4 region on the polymerization function, lysates of bacteria induced for RT expression were initially tested for RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity on both heteropolymeric and homopolymeric RNA templates. RDDP assays on heteropolymeric RNA template revealed that the activities of two insertion mutants were very similar to that of wild type RT (Table I). When homopolymeric templates were used, the finger insertion mutants were more active on poly(rA) compared with poly(rC), a characteristic feature of wild type HIV-1 RT (Table I).Table IRNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activities of finger insertion mutantsEnzymeRNA-dependent DNA polymerase activityPoly(rA)Poly(rC)16 S rRNApmolratiopmolratiopmolratioWT411.03.01.01.51.0FE20280.682.40.80.90.6FE103390.952.70.91.61.1 Open table in a new tab Since the β3-β4 hairpin is a hot spot for nucleoside analog resistance mutations (14Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), it is of interest to assess how gross alterations in β3-β4 affect the sensitivity of HIV-1 RT to such drugs. Therefore, the sensitivities of the finger insertion mutants to inhibition by each of four standard 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP; ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) were determined in an RDDP assay utilizing 16 S rRNA as template. As shown in Table II, the insertion mutants demonstrated wild type levels of sensitivity to all ddNTPs.Table IISensitivities of the finger insertion mutants to ddNTPsRTddATPddCTPddGTPddTTPIC50RatioIC50RatioIC50RatioIC50Ratioμm-foldμm-foldμm-foldμm-foldWT3.510.510.810.51FE203.00.860.51.00.91.10.71.4FE1033.20.910.751.52.53.11.53 Open table in a new tab Both of the results described above indicate that the insertions into the finger β3-β4 hairpin did not affect the gross properties of the polymerase function of HIV-1 RT. Since the insertion mutations minimally affect the polymerase activity of RT, they were suitable to test the effect of finger alterations on the processivity of polymerization. To facilitate an in-depth analysis, the insertion mutants (FE20 and FE103) and the wild type HIV-1NL4-3 RT were purified to near-homogeneity (Fig. 2). The protein preparations were tested for contaminating RNase and DNase activities and were found to be free of both (data not shown). The kinetic constantsKm, dTTP and Vmax were determined for these RTs in RDDP assays on poly(rA)·oligo(dT) template-primer (summarized in Table III). Both the Km and Vmax for the mutants were similar to those of wild type RT. The Vmax/Kmratios for the mutant RTs, although reduced from wild type levels, suggest that the catalytic efficiencies were not significantly compromised by the large insertions in the β3-β4 hairpin.Table IIIThe kinetic constants for insertion mutants of HIV-1NL4-3HIV-1 RT(NL4-3)Km, dTTPVmaxVmax/Kmμmpmol/minWT8.8 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.050.31FE2012.1 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.030.17FE10310.6 ± 0.62.3 ± 0.050.22 Open table in a new tab To test the hypothesis that the overall size of the β3 and β4 strands (including the connecting loop) correlates with processivity of polymerization, RDDP assays were performed in the presence of a polymerase trap (heparin). A heteropolymeric RNA template consisting of u3, r, and u5 regions of the long terminal repeat and the primer binding site was prepared by in vitro transcription. A 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide (PBS-G) complementary to the primer binding site was used as primer. RT was first allowed to bind to preannealed template-primer, and polymerization was initiated by simultaneous addition of dNTP substrates and an excess of heparin. The presence of the heparin trap ensures a single cycle of polymerase binding, DNA synthesis, and dissociation during the reaction. Analysis of the products generated during the processive synthesis indicates that both FE20 and FE103 were able to generate longer DNA products than the wild type RT (Fig. 3,A and B). Interestingly, FE103 produced more of the larger products than did FE20. The effectiveness of the trap was confirmed by mixing the template-primer with excess heparin before adding RT and initiating the reaction with dNTP substrates. This reaction produced no polymerization products (data not shown). When heparin was omitted from the reaction, allowing detection of products synthesized during multiple rounds of DNA synthesis, no differences were observed in the intensities of full-length product and the intermediate products produced by the wild type and mutant RTs (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, we used the influenza virus M1 RNA as template to assess whether the enhanced processivity of the mutants is a unique property of the template sequences. The mutant RTs were again able to produce larger products than wild type (Fig. 3, C and D) showing that the increased processivity is not limited to HIV-1 genomic RNA template. The FE103 RT still produced more of the larger products in comparison with the wild type and the FE20 RTs. The processivity of FE20 and FE103 mutants appears to be increased by 25–30% as indicated by the size of the products generated on either HIV-1 or M1 RNA template. Plots of individual band intensities as a percentage of total band intensities (Fig. 3, B and D) illustrate the positions at which the RT molecules dissociated from the template. These represent the pause sites on the template due to secondary structures (4Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or runs of the same nucleotide on the template (23Williams K.J. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18682-18689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In processive synthesis with the wild type RT on HIV-1 RNA, two strong pause sites (at 59 and 97 bases from the primer terminus) and several weaker ones (between positions 100 and 150) are observed (Fig. 3 B). Most of the weak pause sites are absent or reduced in intensity for the two mutant RTs. In addition, FE20 RT shows significantly reduced pausing at position 97, whereas FE103 RT displays significant reduction at both positions 59 and 97 (Fig. 3 B). On M1 template, the three major pause sites corresponding to positions 86, 106, and 130 were observed with wild type and FE20 RT; however, with FE103 RT, stalling at these sites was significantly reduced (Fig. 3 D).

Sodium/calcium exchange was first discovered in invertebrates (1Baker P.F. Blaustein M.P. Hodgkin A.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Physiol. 1969; 200: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but received much attention in the last decade because of its implied role in maintaining calcium homeostasis in mammalian tissues, particularly heart, brain, and kidney. Two generic activities have been described in animal tissues, one exchanges only sodium and calcium ions, the other also co-transports a potassium ion along with a calcium ion (for a review, see Nicoll et al. (2Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137c: 199-227PubMed Google Scholar)). Following cDNA cloning, coding for the protein of the first type, a “cardiac exchanger” (3Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), structurally related cDNAs were discovered in numerous animal species, from nematodes to man (see Kraevet al. (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and references therein). It was shown that in mammals this protein is encoded by a small multigene family (5Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with one gene, NCX1, being nearly ubiquitously expressed and featuring complex tissue-specific alternative splicing, the other two genes having relatively restricted tissue distribution of expression and limited splicing options (6Nicoll D.A.

Although it was readily obvious from data accumulated in sequence data bases, a study in rat (7Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first conclusively demonstrated that NCX1 transcripts in different tissues have at least three different 5′-untranslated leaders, which are spliced to a common core containing the protein coding sequence. A recent publication linked these leaders to three “heart,” “kidney,” and “brain” alternative promoters (8Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in the catNCX1 gene. While most eukaryotic genes are controlled by a complex array of cis-regulatory elements modulating transcriptional activity at a single site, a substantial number of genes have recently been found to utilize multiple promoters (9Ayoubi T.A.Y.

Here, we present data on the cloning and functional characterization of the colinear multipartite promoters of the rat and human NCX1 genes. The three transcription start sites of the gene, spread over 35 kb, 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; STS, sequence tagged site; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells. 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcriptase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; YAC, yeast artificial chromosome; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; STS, sequence tagged site; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells. apparently act together in a specific quantitative pattern, in which one ubiquitous promoter drives a low level of unspecific expression, augmented in specific tissues by two additional, spatially distinct promoters. Transcript initiated from any of the three promoters undergoes splicing via a transient intermediate, containing two noncoding exons, of which the downstream one is removed from the terminal splicing product. An alignment of rat and human three-exon cluster that includes two promoter regions has also revealed unusually conserved areas downstream of the alternative first exons, a feature previously observed in the the calcium pump PMCA1 gene (16Hilfiker H.

Bacterial strains and rat genomic library in λ FIX II were purchased from Stratagene AG (Basel, Switzerland). Methods for nucleic acid isolation and genomic library screening have been described previously (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed on an automated sequencer Li-Cor 4000L (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE), using a modified thermostable polymerase dCode (a generous gift of Dr. D. Clark, DNamp Ltd., Farnborough Hunts, UK). The sequencing data were processed by a sequence assembly program Sequencer (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) and further analyzed by a GCG package version 8.0 (17Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69650) Google Scholar) searches of DNA and protein sequence data bases were run on a WWW server of the Swiss Cancer Institute (ISREC, Epalinges s/Lausanne). Human YAC clone 809_b_6, containing the entire NCX1 gene, was described previously (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human BAC clones, overlapping STS DS2329 (accession no. X92368) were received from Center d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (Paris, France). BAC DNA was isolated on a Qiagen tip-100 column, following a protocol provided by the manufacturer for low copy number plasmids, except that the elution buffer was prewarmed to 65 °C. BAC DNA was mapped by essentially standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 3.16.1-3.16.9Google Scholar), except that digests were performed with 100-ng DNA portions, and gels were stained with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes BV, The Netherlands). Gels were blotted to positively charged nylon membranes and hybridized to PCR fragments, labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Blots were visualized by a digoxigenin-chemiluminescent detection kit (Boehringer) and exposed to Fuji RX films. Fragments of interest were subcloned into plasmid vectors, using standard procedures (19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 3.16.1-3.16.9Google Scholar). Whole cells RNA was prepared from frozen rat tissues or from fresh pellets of cultured rat cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared with an Oligotex kit (Qiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland). Human brain and heart poly(A)+ RNA and human kidney poly(A)+ RNA were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). In the “standard protocol” first strand cDNA was prepared either from 10–20 μg of total RNA or from 0.5–1 μg poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Duebendorf, Switzerland) and amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer Int., Rotkreuz Branch, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). In an “enhanced protocol” cDNA was synthesized with Expand reverse transcriptase (Boehringer), and the cDNA was immediately amplified (without purification or freezing) either as above or with Expand thermostable polymerase mixture. Typically, 10% of a cDNA synthesis reaction was amplified in a 50-μl PCR reaction for 40 cycles, using 0.3 μm exon 2-specific primer and one of several primers, specific for alternative first exons. The primer sequences are available on request. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and stained with SYBR Green I or blotted to a positively charged nylon membrane, as described above. Gel images were recorded with a Minolta RD-175 digital camera and processed with Adobe Photoshop 3.0 software. Blot images were recorded on a PhosphorImager model 425 and processed with ImageQuant 1.1 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA, synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, was treated with 0.2 unit of RNase H (Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min at 37 °C and purified by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen. The single-stranded cDNA was treated with terminal transferase (Boehringer) for 15 min at 37 °C, essentially as suggested by the manufacturer, except that dATP was used at 50 μm. The reaction was again purified by ethanol precipitation, and the entire pellet was taken into a 50-μl PCR reaction, made up with a 1 μm exon 2-specific primer, 0.01 μm Not-dT20 primer (included in the Pharmacia cDNA synthesis kit), and 1 μm anchor primer, specific for the 5′-terminal part of the Not-dT20 primer. The reaction was subjected to the following cycling program: five times (94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min), then 35 times (94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s), using Expand thermostable polymerase mixture (Boehringer). The resultant product was cloned into a pUCBM20 vector (Boehringer), and clones were screened with an exon 2-specific probe. Positive clones were sequenced, using an exon 2-specific dye primer. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were isolated from rat aorta (female, Wistar-Kyoto strain, 6–8 weeks old) and recultured several times essentially as described previously (20Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar) on Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. The cells were passaged weekly and used between passages 5 and 15. Relevant rat DNA fragments covering the three 5′-flanking regions of NCX1 leader-encoding exons were amplified from λ clones or plasmid subclones and inserted into a reporter vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the fireflyluc gene. DNA was prepared from these constructs, using Qiagen tip-100 columns and quantitated by fluorimetry (minifluorometer TKO100, Hoefer Instruments, San Francisco, CA). A second normalizing plasmid pRL-TK (Promega), containing the Renilla luc gene under control of the thymidine kinase promoter was prepared in a similar way. A mixture of a promoter construct plasmid and a normalizer plasmid (weight ratio of 20:1) was introduced into cultured aortic cells, prepared as above, using a lipotransfection reagent Tfx (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were made as triplicates in a 24-well plate. The SV40 promoter-luciferase plasmid pGL3 served as a positive control, and the same plasmid with the SV40 promoter deleted served as a negative control. Following transfection the cells were incubated in serum-containing medium for about 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer supplied with the Dual-Luciferase kit (Promega). Luciferase activities in extracts were assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions and recorded on a Berthold luminometer model LB 9507. Values of the firefly luciferase activities were normalized against the Renilla luciferase activity and averaged to produce a value that was taken as a measure of a construct's activity. The dexamethasone (Sigma Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) treatment was done essentially as described elsewhere (21Smith L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27527-27531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A riboprobe was designed that contained a complete exon 1c and 124 bases upstream of it (see Fig. 2). To synthesize the probe, a T7 promoter sequence was incorporated into the respective fragment by PCR, and the probe was subsequently synthesized, using a Maxi-Script kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and [α-32P]CTP (Amersham). The probe was gel-purified, and dilutions of it were used to analyze samples of transfected and nontransfected VSMC with a Direct Protect Lysate RPA kit (Ambion). The protected products were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% Sequagel (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), and the gel was dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 2 days. Previous studies in rat (7Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized four alternative 5′-untranslated regions from various tissues, of which three (Br1, Br2, and Kc1) apparently corresponded to distinct sites in the genome. Initially, these sequences were used to design primers to retrieve short (100–300 bp) fragments from rat genomic DNA using PCR. The fragments were cloned into an M13 vector, and clones were subsequently used to prepare high specific activity probes by limited second strand synthesis in the presence of radiolabeled dNTPs (22Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar). These probes were used to screen a rat genomic library in λ FIXII. Isolated clones were checked for cross-hybridization, and it was found that those hybridizing to the Kc1 5′-leader (accession no. U04934) also hybridized to the Br1 5′-leader (U04935). The subcloning of relevant areas into plasmid vectors was followed by sequence analysis. About 4 kb of DNA covering the areas, hybridizing to the Kc1 and Br1 5′-leaders, were sequenced, as well as about 2 kb covering the Br2 5′-leader (accession no. U04936). All three 5′-leader sequences were found to represent distinct exons, and the 3′-exon/intron junction sequences complied with the standard consensus sequence. Since λ clones containing Kc1/Br1 and Br2 exons did not overlap, the distance between them was assumed to be the same as that determined by long range mapping on the human YAC clone (see below). A human exon similar to the rat Br1 exon had previously been mapped about 30 kb upstream of the first “coding” exon 2, in proximity of the STS D2S2328 (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This allowed the isolation of corresponding BAC clones from a CEPH human genomic library in BeloBACII. Two independent clones with 140-kb inserts were studied in detail, using standard mapping methods, and a 6-kb EcoRI fragment, hybridizing to the human exon 1 (accession no. X92368X92368), was subsequently cloned into a plasmid vector and completely sequenced.BamHI sites were mapped within the 70-kb XhoI fragment, covering this exon and exon 2 (Fig. 1), using a probe hybridizing to the area proximal to the conserved XhoI site in exon 2. A portion of the alternative exon coding for the 5′-leader, similar to the rat Br2 exon, was isolated by RACE (see below) from human heart mRNA and mapped on the previously characterized YAC clone 809_b_6, essentially as described previously (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The data obtained in the cloning and mapping experiments are summarized in Fig. 1. Genomic sequences around the Br1 exon in the rat gene and around the human “exon 1” were determined from the subcloned fragments of a λ clone and a BAC clone, respectively. These sequences were analyzed for similarity to each other and to other NCX15′-leaders found in nucleotide sequence data bases. Since the similarity of the Br1 exon to human exon 1 was 65–70%, only regions having this degree of similarity among mammalian species were considered meaningful. Several regions of similarity to other mammalian genomic and cDNA sequences were found in the human genomic sequence (Fig. 2): a region of about 240 bp, previously defined as “exon 1,” similar to the rat Br1 5′-leader; a region of about 120 bp similar to a 5′-leader (accession no. L35846) isolated from feline heart; and a region of about 200 bp similar to the Kc1 5′-leader sequence, isolated from rat kidney (accession no. U04934U04934), and at the same time similar to clone p17, isolated from bovine heart (accession no. L06438). Close examination of genomic DNA sequences within a few bases around the left border of similar regions revealed the presence of a plausible exon-intron consensus sequence. It was hypothesized that the regions of similarity, some of which have been identified as alternative 5′-untranslated regions in different mammalian tissues, represented alternative exons spliced to the common core encoded in exon 2, located 30 kb downstream (Fig. 1). However, although the position of the clustered three putative first exons is very similar in rat and human genomic DNA (Figs. 1 and 2), the pattern of their expression in different tissues (see below and also under “Discussion”) does not seem to agree with the simple model recently presented in Barnes et al. (8Barnes K.V. Cheng G. Dawson M.M. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11510-11517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since the previously used terms “brain-,” “heart-,” and “kidney”-specific exons appear confusing, they were replaced by a neutral designation “exon 1a, 1b, 1c,” and so forth. Specifically, human exon 1/rat Br1 was designated as “exon 1a,” the exon similar to the bovine heart/rat kidney 5′-leader as “exon 1c,” and the feline kidney exon (also found in rat kidney in this work, see below) as “exon 1b” (Fig. 2). The region of similarity to rat Br2 5′-leader (accession no. U04936U04936) was not found in the vicinity of exons 1a–1c. However, a human heart RACE product having the structure shown in Fig. 2 was isolated in this work; it apparently contained an incomplete exon 1c intervening between exon 2 and a new sequence, similar to the rat exon Br2. The new sequence, designated exon 1d (although it was not actually sequenced on human genomic DNA), was mapped ∼35 kb upstream of exons 1a–1c on the human YAC clone 809_b_6 (Fig. 1). It was initially assumed that regions of similarity between rat and human DNA around exon 1 represented potential alternative exons and primers were therefore designed to test if this region was indeed found spliced to the common core of exon 2 in various human and rat tissues (Table I). The approach was adopted based on experience that RACE analysis of rare transcripts, such as NCX1 transcript, is conducive to preferential isolation of 5′-end RNA sequences that are more easily amplified by PCR instead of providing a faithful representation of alternative 5′-ends from the original RNA pool. It was also prompted by the apparent inconsistency of the finding that, while there was no sequence similarity between cat and rat “kidney-specific” exons, regions of similarity to both could still be mapped upstream of the obviously analogous exon 1a in rat and human DNA. Finally, it was necessary to confirm that the human alternative first exons, initially identified by sequence similarity to the corresponding rat exons, were indeed found in the NCX1 transcripts in human tissues. In the first round of experiments a primer complementary to exon 2 was positioned relatively close to the splicing junction (Fig. 2, primer 2-1), so that a relatively small (<1 kb) product could be amplified. To counteract possible differences in the amplification efficiency of relatively short fragments, sharing the same end, an alternative primer (Fig. 2, 2-2) was used in later experiments, which produced ∼2-kb fragments, containing the entire exon 2, so that addition of alternative first exons resulted in small size differences between the PCR products.Table IComposition of alternative 5′-leaders and respective RT-PCR product sizes5′-Leader compositionExon 1-specific primerExpected RT-PCR product sizeWith exon 2-specific primer 2–1With exon 2-specific primer 2–2bpExon 1a-exon 21a-14201900Exon 1b-exon 21b-15812061Exon 1c-exon 21c-16252105Exon 1c-exon 21c-25712051Exon 1c-exon 21c-34231903Exon 1d-exon 21d-14331913Exon 1d-exon 21d-23641844 Open table in a new tab The results of a rat tissue screening are presented in Fig. 3. Clearly, exon 1a was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues derived from live rat (albeit to a different extent), as expected from published data (7Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, most immortalized or tumor-derived cell lines from brain failed to show expression of any of the 5′-leaders and thus failed to express the NCX1 gene (not shown). Finally, exon 1d was expressed in heart and brain, as predicted by the published data. A more complex situation was observed in the expression of exons 1c and 1b. The use of the promoter region upstream of the tandem exon 1c-1b was implied from the results of the transfection studies (see “Discussion”), as well as from the results of the RT-PCR experiments on human tissues. However, when total RNA was used in RT-PCR experiments according to the “standard protocol” (see “Materials and Methods”), expression of this exon was detected in rat kidney but not in heart or smooth muscle. In contrast, with the “enhanced protocol” a prominent product was detected (Fig. 3) in rat heart and smooth muscle with some of the primers specific for this exon. With the same protocol, both exons 1c and 1b were found in rat kidney mRNA, using exon 1c- or exon 1b-specific primers (Fig. 3 B), although the product containing exon 1c was clearly dominant. The conflict between the data on cat and rat kidney-specific exons, evident from the published data, was thus resolved, since both were found spliced to exon 2 in rat kidney (see also “Discussion”). Unexpected results were obtained in the RT-PCR experiment on human heart cDNA when an exon 2-specific primer, positioned about 1.5 kb away from the splicing junction, was used with an exon 1a-specific primer. Two closely sized products were observed (Fig. 4 A). The larger was found to contain an additional sequence inserted between exon 1a and exon 2, this additional sequence representing yet another exon (designated 1e in Fig. 2) bound by standard consensus sequences and located 7 kb downstream of exon 1a. The shorter product was a fusion of exon 1a and exon 2 without intervening DNA stretches. Similarly, a product containing exon 1d and incomplete exon 1c together was isolated from human heart and kidney. Since such splicing products were never detected in rat tissues, it was suggested that a two-exon-containing leader represents a transient splicing intermediate, which accumulates post mortem. To check this possibility, RNA was isolated from a rat that was left at room temperature for 2 h after decapitation. Indeed, a specific pattern of leader expression, observed in a quickly frozen tissue, was largely lost, so that every possible exon combination now could be found in brain and heart (Figs. 3 and 4 B). Sequences upstream of the rat exons 1a, 1c, and 1d were cloned into reporter vectors, using PCR and/or oligonucleotide adaptors. Constructs containing various fragments upstream of the firefly luciferase gene were contransfected into rat VSMC together with a normalizing plasmid, containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter. The results of these experiments (Fig. 5) supported the existence of three separate promoters upstream of exons 1a, 1c, and 1d. Since all three constructs were routinely assayed in the same series of transfections, it could be concluded that the 1.6-kb fragment upstream of 1a had the highest absolute activity in rat VSMC, followed by the 1c upstream fragment, which was 2-fold less active. The lowest, albeit significant, activity was that of the 1d upstream fragment. The transfection of deletion constructs showed that a minimal level of activity was retained by a 312-bp 1a upstream fragment. These results are partially at variance with the RT-PCR data, which showed only a small amount of endogenous 1c-driven transcript in these cells (Fig. 3 A). Mapping of the start point of this transcript showed two low intensity bands, which could not be adequately interpreted. However, upon transfection of VSMC with p1c DNA RNase protection experiments repeatedly revealed a strong band, which did not disappear after DNase I treatment (not shown). Apparently, transcription in this construct was initiated at a site located >110 bases upstream of exon 1c, a finding that implies the existence of a “cryptic” promoter, obviously not used in VSMC in vivo. The dexamethasone treatment required the use of a serum-free medium, and the transfection experiment had to be modified to include the media-accommodation step. At the concentration previously used for immortalized cardiac myocytes (21Smith L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27527-27531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the addition of dexamethasone to VSMC failed to yield any conclusive data. Our previous work had found the “ubiquitous” 5′-untranslated leader of the NCX1 mRNA encoded in exon 1 located about 30 kb away from the remainder of the gene (4Kraev A.S. Chumakov I.M. Carafoli E. Genomics. 1996; 37: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This leader, termed “Br1” by others, is consistently found in rodent, feline, and human brain cDNA clones (see Fig. 2). The analysis of the data on available mammalian NCX1 5′-leaders, together with the results of genomic mapping experiments, has allowed to unambiguously assign them to five distinct exons. The physical map of the human genomic DNA, constructed in this work from the BAC and YAC clone analysis, shows that alternative first exons are spread over a large distance, although three of them are clustered in an 1.5-kb stretch (Figs. 1 and 2). The map, together with the RT-PCR studies, integrates all earlier observations made in rat and cat (7Lee S.-L. Yu A.S.L. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Menick D.R. Barnes K.V. Thacker U.F. Dawson M.M. McDermott D.E. Rozich J.D. Kent R.L. Cooper G.IV Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with the few changes outlined below. These changes affect both the definition of tissue specificity of alternative promoters, as well as the composition of alternative 5′-leaders. An earlier study implied that different 5′-leaders were spliced to the common core in a tissue-specific way, so that a single leader dominated in NCX1 transcripts foun"

The data obtained demonstrated the importance of Gla10 and Gla14 in stabilizing binding of the highest affinity Ca2+ site and in governing the conformational change induced by Ca2+.

It is among a vast number of small peptides, typically 10–30 amino acids in length, employed by these and other species of cone snails to immobilize their prey and their predators (2Olivera B.M.

The targets of this array of peptides are neuroreceptors and skeletal muscle receptors, and the remarkable selectivity shown by this general class of peptides has also encouraged their use as laboratory reagents to block specific classes of these receptors (4Myers R.A. Cruz L.J. Rivier J.E. Olivera B.M. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 1923-1936Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Adams M.E. Myers R.A. Imperial J.S. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12566-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, a general class of Conus peptides, the conotoxins, which contain a relatively high number of disulfide bonds, interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α-conotoxins), voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (ω-conotoxins), and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (μ-conotoxins) (6Olivera B.M. Rivier J. Scott J.K. Hillyard D.R. Cruz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22067-22070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conantokins, such as the 17-amino acid residue peptide con-G (7McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the homologous 21-residue con-T (1Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

They have been shown to function as noncompetitive inhibitors of the enhancement by spermine and spermidine of Ca2+ flow into neurons, by targeted action on glutamate/glycine receptors of the NMDA subclass (8Chandler P.

Certain structural features of these small peptides are relevant to their functions. con-G and con-T contain five and four residues of Gla/mol of peptide, respectively (1Haack J.A. Rivier J.

Because of this feature, both peptides interact with divalent cations that are important to the functions of neuronal cells, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ (3Myers R.A. McIntosh M. Imperial J. Williams R.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as other metal ions (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Skjaerbaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2291-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ and similar cations induces a large conformational change in con-G (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) from an essentially random structure to an α-helix. On the other hand, con-T, although it also interacts with these cations, does not undergo as dramatic a conformational change, because apo-con-T is already highly organized in an α-helical conformation (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The conantokins possess the potential to serve as agents that inhibit the flow of Ca2+ into neurons via the NMDA receptor route and thus eliminate the harmful effects of entry of this cation into neuronal cells. However, these peptides cannot readily be directly employed as pharmaceutical agents for this purpose in humans because they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Thus, as part of a rational drug design program, elucidation of the structure-function relationships of these peptides is essential. A recent emphasis on this topic is witnessed by publications on elaboration of the NMR-derived, three-dimensional structures of apo-con-G (13Skjaerbaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P.

Most of these investigations have focused on backbone conformations, but one has rigorously defined side chain orientations of apo con-T (14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present phase of our efforts in this area, we have defined the three-dimensional conformation of the Ca2+·con-T complex and have employed mutant con-T peptides to attempt to understand the role of individual Gla residues in defining its metal binding properties and its bioactivity. The results of this study are summarized in this report. The derivatized Gla was synthesized by previously described methodology (17Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except for the resolution of the d- andl-isomers of Nα-Z-(γ,γ′-di-O-tBu)-Gla-OMe, which was accomplished by the method involving enzymatic hydrolysis of thel-isomer using papain (18Clapes P. Valverde I. Jaime C. Torres J.L. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 417-418Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized on a 0.1 mmol scale on a PAL resin support (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A peptide synthesizer, as described previously (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purification of con-T and mutant con-T peptides was accomplished by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Bioscale DEAE-20 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mmNaBO3, pH 8.0. A 500-ml linear gradient of NaCl, from 10 mm NaBO3, pH 8.0 (start solution), to 10 mm NaBO3, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (limit solution), was employed. The target material was pooled, lyophilized, and then desalted on a Sephadex G-15 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column that was equilibrated and eluted with 0.1% NH4OH. The peptides were characterized by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and delayed extraction-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, as described in an earlier communication (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ binding isotherms for each peptide were determined by potentiometry at 25 °C using a semi-micro Ca2+-selective electrode (Orion, Los Angeles, CA). A fused double-walled titration vessel with inlet and outlet ports was attached to a circulating water bath for precise temperature control in these titrations. Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad)-treated peptides (1–2 mm peptide in 10 mm NaBO3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) were titrated with CaCl2. Data analyses were conducted as described previously (19Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm on an Aviv model 62DS spectrometer. Peptides were dissolved in 10 mm NaBO3, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of 35 μm. A 1-cm-path-length cell was employed. Spectra representing the average of five scans were collected at a 1.0-nm bandwidth at 1.0-nm intervals. The α-helical contents at various Ca2+ concentrations were calculated according to a previously published method (20Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). The peptide was dissolved in 10 mm NaBO3, 100 mmNaCl, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of approximately 2 mm. A volume of 50 μl of 2H2O was added to 450 μl of the peptide solution to provide the NMR deuterium lock signal. The internal reference was 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-l-sulfonate. Dilute HCl to was added to adjust the pH of the sample to 6.5 to minimize the loss of NH signals that would occur at higher pH values. One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer. The data were collected, processed, and analyzed as described previously for structure determination of apo-con-T (14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, sequence-specific assignments of the proton resonances for con-T in the presence of Ca2+ were achieved by combining the procedures of spin system identification using TOCSY and DQF-COSY, followed by sequential assignments through NOE connectivities (21Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Assigned NOE cross-peaks were characterized as strong, medium, or weak as determined from the number of contours and converted to distance upper bounds of 2.7, 3.7, and 5.0 Å, respectively. Spectral processing was carried out using FELIX (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) and an in-house program, nmrDSP, on Silicon Graphics workstations. Spectral contrast-enhancement methods were applied to resolve severely overlapped proton resonances (22Zhu Y. Technical Report, Department of Electrical Engineering. Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY1992Google Scholar, 23Levy, G. C., Jeong, G. N., Zhu, Y., Proceedings of the 33rd Experimental NMR Conference, 1992, 152.Google Scholar). The Sybyl software package (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was used for spectral visualization. Peptide conformations, free from steric overlaps and consistent with the NMR data, were generated by DG calculations using the fixed bond lengths and bond angles provided in the ECEPP/3 data base (24Némethy G. Gibson K.D. Palmer K.A. Yoon C.N. Paterlini G. Zagari A. Rumsey S. Scheraga H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1992; 96: 6472-6484Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar). All side chain-side chain or side chain-main chain medium range (i + 2 and i + 4) constraints were set to an upper bound of 5 Å and a lower bound of 2.0 Å. In the absence of metal coordination sites, we chose not to employ energy minimization as a structural refinement because of the potential bias that this could introduce in the side chain orientations. Because the major backbone NOE contacts in apo-con-T and in Ca2+·con-T were essentially the same, our approach to modeling the Ca2+·con-T NMR-derived structure was to start with the 10 energy-minimized convergent structures of apo-con-T (14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as templates for the DG calculations, with the view that the generated structures that satisfied the distance constraints would be the best approximations of metal-loaded, energy-minimized structures. Initial structures that were generated from well resolved NOEs allowed several degenerate resonances to be assigned. Remaining NOEs were inputted as ambiguous constraints that take into account all of the possible interactions in an unbiased manner. Docking of the metal ions in con-T and further energy minimization-based refinement of the metal-bound structure was accomplished by the genetic algorithm-molecular dynamics simulation approach described previously (25Li L. Darden T.A. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Smith H. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The initial coordinates for con-T were those determined by NMR in this study for the Ca2+·con-T complex. The genetic algorithm was employed to determine the initial positions of the Ca2+ ions by searching through the O-O midpoints that were within 6 Å of each other, using all oxygen atoms in the midpoint calculation. A total of 150 midpoints was found. The lowest Amber (26Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E.I. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A.

Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15971) Google Scholar) molecular dynamics simulation. For this simulation, the peptide was solvated in a 9.0-Å box of TIP3P water. The H2O, Na+, and Ca2+ were then energy-minimized at constant volume as described (25Li L. Darden T.A. Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Smith H. Hiskey R.G. Pedersen L.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Next, a Particle Mesh Ewald molecular dynamics simulation was performed on Na+, Ca2+, and H2O for 100 ps, followed by energy minimization. Another Particle Mesh Ewald molecular dynamics simulation was then performed for 150 ps on side chain residues, the ions, and H2O for 150 ps, with fixed backbone, followed by data collection over 300 ps. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by decapitation after being administered isoflurane vapor. Forebrains were removed and processed as described previously (9Skolnick P. Boje K. Miller R. Pennington M. Maccecchini M.-L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that use of this anesthetic did not affect the con-T inhibition isotherms. Inhibition assays were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 500 μl in 5 mm Na+-Hepes, 4.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the nominal absence of glycine and glutamate, with varying concentrations of peptide. The final concentrations of [3H]MK-801 (New England Nuclear, 23.9 Ci/mmol) and spermine were 5 nm and 50 μm, respectively. Binding was initiated by the addition of 300 μl of membrane suspension containing 100–200 μg of protein, and incubation was carried out at room temperature for 2 h. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filter strips (presoaked in assay buffer containing 0.03% polyethyleneimine) using a Brandel (Gaithersburg, MD) 24-well cell harvester. Two 5-ml washes with cold buffer followed. Basal [3H]MK-801 binding was defined as the amount of radioligand bound in the nominal absence of spermine. Observed enhancements in [3H]MK-801 binding at 50 μm spermine versus basal levels varied among different membrane preparations and were in the range of 60–300%. However, these differences in basal [3H]MK-801 binding had no bearing on the absolute IC50 value for con-T in different experiments. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 μm MK-801 and represented 5–10% of total ligand bound in the presence of 50 μm spermine. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that the CD spectrum of con-T underwent a small change to a more α-helical conformation consequent to the binding of Ca2+ to this peptide (12Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present study, the nature of this conformational alteration was further explored, with the ultimate goal of elucidating the Ca2+-bound structure of con-T. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of Ca2+·con-T showed well resolved resonances, similar to those observed earlier for apo-con-T (14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This allowed ready assignment of all of its proton resonances using a combination of TOCSY, DFQ-COSY, and NOESY experiments. An example of the NOESY spectrum of the αNH-αCH fingerprint region of Ca2+·con-T illustrating some of the sequential assignments is provided in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Several of the proton resonances of con-T in the presence of Ca2+ were shifted from those previously obtained for apo-con-T, and this is revealing in terms of possible differences in the structures of these peptides. A graphical summary of the chemical shift differences between Ca2+·con-T and apo-con-T of the αNH and αCH backbone protons for each of the residues of this peptide are illustrated in Fig. 2. Also present in this figure are representative differences in the terminal (farthest sequentially removed from the β-carbons) nonexchangeable side chain protons (e.g. εCH2 of Lys, δCH3 of Leu, δCH2 of Arg, and so forth) between these two peptides. The largest chemical shift changes observed in the backbone protons occur in the residue 10–18 region for the amide protons. Smaller differences are present in the αCH protons, except for that of Gla10, which undergoes a particularly large alteration. Of the terminal side chain protons, Gln6and Arg13 show the most dramatic shifts. Differences between the observed αCH chemical shifts and their random coil values provide valuable secondary structural information (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Specifically, upfield shifts of these proton spins of ≥0.1 ppm from their random coil values indicate the presence of helical structure, if these values occur uninterrupted over four or more consecutive residues. The random coil values of each con-T residue were determined experimentally by obtaining the spectrum in 6 m urea. The differences between the αCH proton chemical shifts for Ca2+·con-T from their same values in 6 m urea are illustrated in Fig. 3. Also plotted in Fig. 3, for comparison, are the values similarly obtained for apo-con-T (14Warder S.E. Chen Z. Zhu Y. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the case of Ca2+·con-T, as with apo-con-T, residues 2–21 possess relative chemical shifts >0.1 ppm, indicating a high content of α-helical structure. This is especially evident in the region of residues 5–17, where chemical shift differences >0.6 ppm are found, indicating the presence of a significant population of α-helices. The αCH proton chemical shift of Gla10, however, is opposite in sign from that expected for a residue in an α-helical conformation. This was also observed in a previous work (13Skjaerbaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2291-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), in which it was attributed to the unknown random coil chemical shift value of the αCH proton of Gla10. However, our data, which show that this chemical shift is not anomalous, allow this interpretation to be abandoned. Because neither CD nor NOESY data demonstrate any serious disruption in the continuum of α-helix of this peptide, we attribute the observation of the positive chemical shift of the αCH proton of Gla10 to the previously unknown consequence of direct Ca2+ coordination to this residue. This is also a very likely explanation for the slightly smaller relative αCH proton chemical shifts for several other Ca2+·con-T residues as compared with those of apo-con-T (Fig. 3). The structure of con-T in complex with Ca2+ was primarily derived from DG calculations utilizing NOE connectivities present in this peptide. A summary of the NOE connectivities for intraresidue sequential (i + 1) and medium (i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4) NOEs used in the DG calculations are shown in Fig. 4. The high α-helical content of this peptide is readily noted from the strong backbone αNH-αNH NOEs (nn(i + 1)), the stronger (nn(i + 1)) cross-peaks as compared with those of αCH-αNH (αn(i + 1)) connectivities, and the presence of many (αn (i + 3)) and (αn(i + 4)) NOEs. In addition, three-bond αCH-αNH coupling constants (3JαN) were approximately 5 Hz for all residues with well resolved αCH-αNH correlation peaks; these data are also strongly suggestive of the presence of α-helical structure. In addition to αn(i + 3) NOE contacts observed for most pairs of residues, backbone-side chain NOE connectivities were found between many proton pairs (Table II), such as those present between Lys18-αCH and Ala21-βCH3, between Gln6-αCH and both Leu9-γCH and Leu9-δCH3, and between Leu9-αCH and Leu12-δCH3, among many others. Furthermore, side chain-side chain NOE connectivities were found between a number of residues, including Gln6-γCH2 and Leu9-δCH3, Arg13-ηNH and Val17-γCH3, and Glu16-γCH2 and Asn20-δCH2. All of this information strongly suggests a high structural order for con-T in complex with Ca2+, consistent with an α-helical nature.Table IIDistance constraints used for Ca2+ · con-T structure calculationsIntraresidueIntraresidue5HD5HA5.0, 2.011HD11HB5.0, 2.05HE5HN5.0, 2.011HD11HA5.0, 2.0SequentialSequential1HA2HN3.7, 2.04HB5HN3.7, 2.02HA3HN3.7, 2.05HB6HN2.7, 2.03HA4HN3.7, 2.06HB7HN2.7, 2.04HA5HN3.7, 2.08HB9HN2.7, 2.05HA6HN3.7, 2.09HB19HN2.7, 2.06HA7HN3.7 2.010HB11HN2.7, 2.08HA9HN3.7, 2.011HB12HN3.7, 2.09HA10HN3.7, 2.012HB13HN2.7, 2.010HA11HN3.7, 2.012HM13HN5.0, 2.011HA12HN3.7, 2.013HN14HG5.0, 2.014HA15HN3.7, 2.013HG14HN5.0, 2.015HA16HN3.7, 2.013HE14HG5.0, 2.016HA17HN3.7, 2.013HE14HN5.0, 2.017HA18HN3.7, 2.013HB14HN2.7, 2.020HA21HN3.7, 2.014HB15HN2.7, 2.03HN4HN2.7, 2.015HM16HN2.7, 2.05HN6HN2.7, 2.020HB21HN5.0, 2.06HN7HN2.7, 2.03HN4HG5.0, 2.07HN8HN3.7, 2.03HG4HN3.7, 2.08HN9HN3.7, 2.03HG4HA5.0, 2.08HM9HM5.0, 2.03HG4HG5.0, 2.08HB9HN5.0, 2.05HD6HG5.0, 2.08HM9HN5.0, 2.05HD6HA5.0, 2.010HN11HN2.2, 2.05HE6HG5.0, 2.011HN12HN3.7, 2.05HD6HN5.0, 2.012HN13HN3.7, 2.05HN6HG5.0, 2.013HN14HN3.7, 2.06HE7HN5.0, 2.014HN15HN3.7, 2.010HG11HN5.0, 2.015HN16HN2.7, 2.010HN11H"

The poly(rU)-stimulated ATPase activity was inhibited by F− in a time-dependent manner during ATP hydrolysis. Inhibition was the result of trapping an enzyme-bound ADP-poly(rU) ternary complex generated during the catalytic cycle and was not the result of generating enzyme-free ADP that subsequently inhibited the enzyme. However, catalysis was not required for efficient inhibition by F−. The stimulated and the intrinsic ATPase activities were also inhibited by treatment of the enzyme with F−, ADP, and poly(rU). The inhibited enzyme slowly recovered (t½ = 23 min) ATPase activity after a 2000-fold dilution into assay buffer. The onset of inhibition by 500 μm ADP and 15 mm F− in the absence of nucleic acid was very slow (t½ > 40 min). However, the sequence of addition of poly(rU) to a diluted solution of ADP/NaF-treated enzyme had a profound effect on the extent of inhibition. If the ADP/NaF-treated enzyme was diluted into an assay that lacked poly(rU) and the assay was subsequently initiated with poly(rU), the treated enzyme was not inhibited. Alternatively, if the treated enzyme was diluted into an assay containing poly(rU), the enzyme was inhibited. ATP protected the enzyme from inhibition by ADP/NaF. The stoichiometry between ADP and enzyme monomer in the inhibited enzyme complex was 2, as determined from titration of the ATPase activity ([ADP]/[E] = 2.2) and from the number of radiolabeled ADP bound to the inhibited enzyme ([ADP]/[E] = 1.7) in the presence of excess NaF, MgCl2, and poly(rU). The Hill coefficient for titration of ATPase activity with F− (n = 2.8) or MgCl2 (n = 2.1) in the presence of excess ADP and poly(rU) suggested that multiple F− and Mg2+ were involved in forming the inhibited enzyme complex.

Helicase motifs Ia, V, and III were implicated in single-stranded DNA binding, motifs I and IV were involved in nucleotide binding, and motifs II and IV possibly functioned in the coupling of nucleotide and single-stranded DNA binding (9Korolev S. Hsieh J Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the protein was crystallized in the absence of a divalent metal cofactor such as Mg2+, which is required for ATP hydrolysis and nucleic acid unwinding. Crystal structures of DNA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (10Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1966; 85: 379-383Google Scholar) and of RNA helicase from HCV have also been reported. In neither case was the divalent metal cofactor present. Nonetheless, these structures suggested a single nucleotide binding site per monomer. HCV helicase has an intrinsic ATPase activity and an nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase activity. Single-stranded DNA or RNA increased the kcat value of HCV helicase ATPase activity, at most, 50-fold (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, poly(rU) enhancedkcat 30-fold. In contrast, the kcat values for ATPase activities of bacterial helicases such as Rep helicase and helicase II are stimulated over a 1000-fold by single-stranded DNA (8Wong I. Moore K.J.M. Bjornson K.P. Hsieh J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Turnover numbers for HCV helicase and Rep helicase determined in the presence of single-stranded nucleic acid are similar (8Wong I. Moore K.J.M. Bjornson K.P. Hsieh J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5726-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The differential DNA stimulation of these enzymes is the result of the large intrinsic ATPase activity of HCV helicase in the absence of single-stranded nucleic acid. This observation suggests that either HCV helicase ATPase activity is associated with a single site that is not tightly coupled to nucleic acid binding or HCV helicase may have ATPase activity associated with two separate sites on the enzyme. The latter possibility could be verified by determining the stoichiometry for ATP binding to the enzyme. However, the ATPase activity of the enzyme would require nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues for titration of ATP sites. Unfortunately, the affinity of the enzyme for nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues was very low, e.g. the Ki for ADPNP was 200 μm (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which was too high for stoichiometry determination. The complex between F− and Al3+ or Be2+ is an alternative class of inhibitors that is useful for mechanism studies with phosphotransferases. These complexes, which mimic phosphate, bind tightly to numerous nucleoside triphosphatases in the presence of the nucleotide diphosphate (13Troullier A. Girardet J.-L. Dupont Y. J. Biol.

In the present studies, the ATPase activity of HCV helicase was inhibited with the combination of ADP, F−, MgCl2, and poly(rU) in the absence of Al3+ or Be2+.

The concentration of ADP in solution was estimated with ε258 = 14.4 mm−1cm−1. Poly(rU) and poly(rA) were Amersham Pharmacia Biotech products. The concentration of nucleobase in solutions of poly(rU) and poly(rA) was estimated with an ε260 = 9.35 mm−1 cm−1 and ε258= 9.80 mm−1 cm−1 (per nucleobase), respectively.

HCV helicase was purified as described previously (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol.

ATPase activity was assayed at 25 °C by monitoring the formation of ADP spectrophotometically at 340 nm. The absorbance change was due to the oxidation of NADH that was coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as described previously (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The standard assay was 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 350 μm NADH, 2.0 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1.0 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml poly(rU) prepared in the standard buffer. The definition of a unit of pyruvate kinase or lactate dehydrogenase was that of the supplier. The spectrophotometric ATPase assay was initiated by two methods. For the first method (Method Ia), the assay was initiated by dilution (1:100) of the enzyme directly into the standard assay containing poly(rU). For the second method (Method Ib), treated enzyme was diluted (1:100) into the standard assay lacking poly(rU). This solution was equilibrated for 60 s to allow dissociation of readily reversible complexes of enzyme with inhibitor. The assay was initiated with 100 μg/ml poly(rU). The “fluorokinase” activity associated with pyruvate kinase (24Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1962: 95-113Google Scholar) was not significant under these assay conditions. The enzyme was incubated at 21 °C in the standard buffer with 30 mm NaF, 200 μg/ml poly(rU), and [2,8-3H]ADP (46 μCi/μmol) for 20 min. The enzyme-bound nucleotide was separated from free nucleotide by size exclusion chromatography on a centrifuge column (1 ml disposable syringe filled with Bio-Rad P-6 resin equilibrated in the standard buffer at 21 °C analogous to the method of Penefsky (25Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The bound nucleotide was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting using ICN EcoLume scintillation mixture. The time course for hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (P(t)) was described by Equation 1, whereVi was the initial velocity of the reaction,Vf was the final velocity of the reaction, and kobs was the apparent first-order rate constant for transition from Vi toVf. P(t)=Vi−Vfk(1−e−kobst)+VftEquation 1 The dependence on NaF concentration of the uncorrectedkobs values (uncorrected for inhibition of initial velocity by NaF) for inhibition was described by a linear function (Equation 2). The initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis was inhibited significantly by NaF. It was assumed that the rate constant for onset of inhibition was directly proportional to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Consequently, kobs values were dividing by the fractional initial velocity in the presence of NaF to yield corrected kobs values. The dependence of the corrected kobs values on NaF concentration was described by an exponential function (Equation 3). The value of n was an indication of the number of NaF molecules involved in the inhibition process. kobs=axEquation 2 kobs=axnEquation 3 The effect of pyruvate kinase concentration onkobs was described by a linear function (Equation 4), where the concentration of pyruvate kinase was expressed in units of enzyme/ml. A unit of enzyme was based on the value supplied by the manufacturer. kobs=a[pyruvate kinase]+bEquation 4 Titration of helicase (E) with ADP in the presence of excess F− and Mg2+ was monitored by the decrease in ATPase activity. It was assumed that the titration could be described by the simplified mechanism shown in Reaction 1, whereK was the dissociation constant of E for ADP. E+ADP⇌KE·ADPREACTION 1 It was also assumed that the fractional activity remaining after treatment (A([ADP])) was related to the total concentration (sum of free and bound) of added ADP ([ADP]) by Equation 5, in which ΔA∞ was the fractional activity decrease resulting from conversion of E toE·ADP. A([ADP])=1−ΔA∞[E·ADP][Et]Equation 5 Et was the total concentration (sum of free and bound) of ADP binding sites on the enzyme (i.e. for n sites per monomer Et wasn[E], where [E] was the molar concentration of enzyme monomer). Because the concentration of enzyme was comparable to the dissociation constant of the enzyme for ADP, the concentration of E·ADP was related to [ADP] by Equation6. [E·ADP]=[ADP]+[nE]+K2−12([ADP]+[nE]+K)2−4[nE][ADP]Equation 6 If more than one binding site for ADP was present on the enzyme, the concentration of E was multiplied by n, wheren was a fitted parameter. This assumed that the ADP bound to each site on E independently. If the fit of Equations 5 and6 to the data was significantly better when n was greater than 1, the calculated “dissociation constant (K)” of E for ADP was the concentration of free ADP, for which 50% of E was in the E·ADP form. The value of n from this fitting routine was an estimate of the number of binding sites on the enzyme for ADP. The time courses for inhibition of helicase in the absence of poly(rU) were described by Equation 7, where A(t) was the normalized activity (initial velocity) at time equal to t,Af was the activity at the end of the reaction, and k was the pseudo first-order rate constant for transition from the initial activity (1.0) to the final activity (Af). A(t)=Af+(1−Af)e−ktEquation 7 Titration of ATPase activity with MgCl2 or NaF in the presence of fixed concentrations of poly(rU) and ADP was described by the logistic equation (Equation 8), whereA([L]) was the ATPase activity at a ligand concentration of [L] (L was NaF or MgCl2), and ΔA∞ was the maximal decrease in activity at an infinite concentration of L. A([L])=1−ΔA∞[L]nKn+[L]nEquation 8 Titration data for inhibition of ATPase activity by (dU)18 in the presence of excess NaF, ADP, and Mg2+ was modeled by Equations 9 and 10 for irreversible binding of an inhibitor to an enzyme. The ATPase activity at a total concentration of (dU)18 was normalized to that of untreated enzyme to give A([(dU)18]). A([(dU)18])=1−1−ba[(dU)18],[(dU)18]<aEquation 9 A([(dU)18])=b,[(dU)18]≥aEquation 10 b was the final ATPase activity, and a was concentration of (dU)18 that stoichiometrically inhibited the ATPase activity. Absorbance and conventional kinetic data were obtained from a Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer at 25 °C or on a Spectramax 250 plate reader at 21 °C. The appropriate equations were fitted to the data by nonlinear least squares using SigmaPlot from Jandel Scientific (Corte Madera, CA). The ATPase activity of helicase (>200 nm) was stable at room temperature in the standard buffer for over 30 min. However, the enzyme (230 nm) lost >95% of its ATPase activity after a 10-min reaction with 25 mmNaF, 1.25 mm ATP, and 250 μg/ml poly(rU). If the enzyme was reacted with NaF and ATP in the absence of poly(rU), the ATPase activity was not affected significantly (<10% inhibition). The inhibited enzyme slowly recovered activity (t½ ∼ 20 min) after a 100-fold dilution into the standard assay. Thus, the time course for the onset of inhibition of helicase by 10 mm NaF, 2.0 mm ATP in the presence of 100 μg/ml poly(rU) could be readily monitored on a conventional spectrophotometer (Fig. 1). In the absence of NaF, the rate of hydrolysis of ATP was relatively constant, whereas in the presence of 10 mm NaF, the rate of ATP hydrolysis decreased exponentially (Fig. 1 A). Equation 1 was fitted to the latter time course with Vi = 0.339 ± 0.003 μm s−1,kobs = (5.1 ± 0.2) × 10−3s−1, and Vf = 0.018 ± 0.003 μm s−1. Each mol of enzyme hydrolyzed approximately 25,000 mol of ATP molecules during the inhibition process under these conditions. In contrast to these results, the intrinsic ATPase activity measured in the absence of poly(rU) was not significantly affected by 40 mm NaF (Fig. 1 B). Time courses similar to those of Fig. 1 A for inhibition of the ATPase activity by 1.0 mm ATP and 30 mm NaF were determined with 300 μm(nucleobase) poly(rU), (dU)18, poly(A), a 45-mer, and a 16-mer as the trapping nucleic acid. Each of these nucleic acids caused a time-dependent inhibition of the ATPase activity in the presence of ATP. The pseudo first-order rate constants for onset of inhibition (kobs) were (8.3 ± 0.4) × 10−2 s−1, (3.6 ± 0.1) × 10−2 s−1, (6.9 ± 0.3) × 10−2 s−1, (3.51 ± 0.06) × 10−3 s−1, and (4.73 ± 0.06) × 10−4 s−1, respectively. Poly(rU) was selected for a more detailed investigation into the mechanism of inhibition of the ATPase activity. Inhibition of some ATPases by NaF has been attributed to formation of an aluminum or beryllium fluoride complex with enzyme-bound nucleotide diphosphate (15Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Deferoxamine, a chelator of trivalent metal ions such as aluminum, diminishes the inhibitory effect of NaF and ADP on this class of enzymes, whereas AlF3stimulates the inhibitory effect of NaF (15Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, deferoxamine or AlF3 had little effect on kobs for onset of inhibition of the HCV helicase ATPase activity in the standard buffer with 20 mm NaF, 100 μg/ml poly(rU), and 2.0 mm ATP. The value of kobs was 0.0153 ± 0.0002 s−1 in the absence of deferoxamine and 0.0136 ± 0.0003 s−1 in the presence of 1.0 mm deferoxamine. Similarly, the value of kobs was 0.0120 ± 0.0003 s−1in the absence of AlF3, and 0.0157 ± 0.0004 s−1 in the presence of 400 μmAlF3. In the absence of poly(rU), 250 μmAlF3 and 10 mm NaF did not inhibit the ATPase activity significantly. A divalent metal was required for the helicase-associated ATPase activity (25Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous inhibition experiments used MgCl2 as the metal cofactor. Because MnCl2 can substitute for MgCl2 in the ATPase reaction with comparable efficiency (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the inhibition experiments were repeated with 3.5 mm MnCl2 to determine the selectivity of the inhibitory process for the divalent metal cofactor. The kobs for inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by 2.4 nm helicase with 10 mm NaF in the presence of 2.0 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml poly(rU) and 3.5 mm MgCl2 was (6.5 ± 0.1) × 10−3 s−1. When MnCl2 was substituted for MgCl2, the value of kobs was (7.8 ± 0.2) × 10−4s−1. The ratio of the kobs value for onset of inhibition with Mn2+ as the divalent metal cofactor to that with Mg2+ was 0.12. The value of the first-order rate constant for onset of inhibition of ATPase activity (kobs) was determined at varying NaF concentration with 2.0 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml poly(rU), 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 2–20 nm helicase. The value of kobsincreased linearly with NaF concentration (Fig. 2, open symbols). Equation 2was fitted to these data with a = 0.00113 ± 0.00006 μm−1 s−1. However, when the values of kobs were corrected for the decrease in initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis at high concentrations of NaF, the value of kobs increased exponentially with the concentration of NaF (Fig. 2, closed symbols). Equation 3 was fitted to these data withn = 1.77 ± 0.05 and a = (8 ± 2) × 10−5 μm−2s−1. This value of n suggested that multiple NaF molecules were in the inhibited enzyme complex. Inhibition of the ATPase reaction by NaF and poly(rU) occurred during the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP (Fig. 1 A). Even though enzymatically generated ADP was phosphorylated to ATP by the coupling enzymes in the reaction, a finite steady-state concentration of free ADP existed during the inhibition reaction. The steady-state concentration of free ADP should be inversely related to the concentration of pyruvate kinase. If free ADP were the reactive species in the inhibitory reaction, the concentration of ADP and consequently the value of kobs should be inversely related to the concentration of pyruvate kinase. However, the value of kobs for inhibition of the ATPase activity with 100 μg/ml poly(rU), 2.0 mm ATP, and 10 mm NaF was not affected significantly by a 32-fold change in pyruvate kinase concentration (Fig. 3). These results suggested that enzymatically generated free ADP was not the active species in the inhibitory process. Furthermore, increasing the ATP concentration from 125 to 2000 μm (Km∼ 200 μm) resulted in only a 30% decrease in kobs. These data suggested that inhibition of the enzyme by NaF during hydrolysis of ATP was the result of trapping the enzyme-bound ADP by Mg2+ and F− prior to the release of ADP and was not the result of a ternary complex of free ADP, Mg2+, and F− binding to the ATP site. The ATPase activity of a 5 μm enzyme solution was inhibited >95% after treatment for 20 min at 21 °C with 55 μm ADP, 33 mm NaF, and 133 μg/ml poly(rU) in the standard buffer that contained 3.5 mm MgCl2. Because the recovery of ATPase activity by inhibited enzyme was slow (t½ ∼ 20 min; see below), the extent of slow reversible inhibition could be determined from the initial velocity after dilution (1:100) of the treated enzyme sample into the standard assay (Method Ia). The ATPase activity of a 5.4 μmsolution of helicase treated with 33 mm NaF, 160 μg/ml poly(rU), and varying concentrations of ADP was determined. Time courses of selected inhibition reactions established that 20 min at 21 °C was sufficient time for establishing equilibrium. The ATPase activity was normalized to that of untreated enzyme or enzyme treated with all of the components except NaF (Fig. 4). Equations 5 and 6 were fitted to these data to give ΔA∞ = 0.98 ± 0.03,K = 0.2 ± 0.2 μm, and n = 2.2 ± 0.1 (open circles). The stoichiometry between enzyme and ADP was firmly established by these data, whereas the value of the apparent dissociation constant (K) had significant error associated with it because the enzyme concentration was much greater than the value of K. If the titration was repeated in the absence of poly(rU) (Fig. 4,closed circles), the treated enzyme solution lost ATPase activity when assayed by Method Ia (enzyme diluted into a poly(rU)-containing assay). However, if assay Method Ib (enzyme diluted into an assay without poly(rU) followed by initiation of the reaction with poly(rU)) was used, the treated enzyme solution retained full ATPase activity (Fig. 4, closed squares). This differential effect was not observed with enzyme that had been treated with NaF, ADP, and poly(rU), but was only observed for enzyme that was treated with NaF and ADP in the absence of poly(rU). The poly(rU)-stimulated ATPase activity was slowly inhibited by NaF and ADP in the absence of poly(rU). For example, reaction of 140 nm helicase with 500 μm ADP and 15 mm NaF resulted in a time-dependent decrease in ATPase activity that was not dependent on exposure of the treated enzyme solution to poly(rU). Enzymatic activity was determined in the standard assay by initiating the reaction with 100 μg/ml poly(rU) (Method Ib). Initial velocity data were normalized to the activity of untreated enzyme. Equation 7 was fitted to these data to give ΔAf = 0.110 ± 0.008 and k = 0.0179 ± 0.0005 min−1. This corresponded to at½ for inhibition of 40 min. For comparison, inhibition of the ATPase activity under these conditions in the presence of excess poly(rU) had a t½ that was <10 s. NaF and poly(rU) inhibited the ATPase activity of HCV helicase in the presence of nucleotide diphosphates other than ADP. For example, incubation of 3.3 μm helicase with 200 μg/ml poly(rU), 25 mm NaF, and 10 μm CDP, GDP, UDP, and 2′-deoxyADP for 20 min at 21 °C resulted in 90.3%, 40.7%, 92.4%, and 87.8% inhibition relative to ADP, respectively, when assayed by Method 1b. Pyrophosphate did not substitute for these nucleoside diphosphates in the inhibition reaction. The ATPase activity of HCV helicase was titrated with NaF at fixed concentrations of MgCl2 (3.5 mm), ADP (40 μm), and poly(rU) (160 μg/ml). The solution was equilibrated for 20 min at 21 °C before the ATPase activity was determined by Method Ia. The activity data were normalized to that of untreated enzyme (Fig. 5 A). Equation 8 was fitted to these data with ΔA∞ = 0.95 ± 0.02,K = 4.3 ± 0.2 mm, and n = 2.8 ± 0.3. Similarly, the ATPase activity was titrated with MgCl2 for fixed concentrations of NaF (20 mm), ADP (40 μm) and poly(rU) (160 μg/ml). Equation 8 was fitted to these data with ΔA∞= 0.89 ± 0.03, K = 1.05 ± 0.05 mm, and n = 2.1 ± 0.2 (Fig. 5 B). Helicase has a poly(rU)-stimulated ATPase activity and an intrinsic ATPase activity in the absence of poly(rU). The extent of inhibition of these activities was determined for enzyme that had been partially inhibited by 30 mm NaF, 70 μmADP, and 5 μg/ml poly(rU). Helicase (4.6 μm) was treated with the combination of poly(rU), NaF, and ADP or with poly(rU) alone for 20 min at 21 °C. The stimulated and intrinsic activities of the treated enzyme was determined after 100-fold dilution into the standard assay in the presence or absence of poly(rU). The concentration of poly(rU) introduced into the assay (∼0.2 μm base) with the treated enzyme was not sufficient to cause significant stimulation of the ATPase activity (Km ∼ 20 μm). The poly(rU)-stimulated ATPase activity of enzyme treated with the combination of reagents versus enzyme treated with poly(rU) alone was reduced by 89%, whereas intrinsic ATPase activity determined in the absence of poly(rU) was only reduced by 67%. Poly(rU) was required for efficient inhibition of helicase by ADP and NaF. Because of the heterogeneous nature of poly(rU), determination of an interpretable stoichiometry between enzyme and poly(rU) in the inhibition reaction was not feasible. However, (dU)18 was active in the inhibition process and, in contrast to poly(rU), forms a 1 to 1 complex with free enzyme (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Helicase (4.9 μm) was incubated with 30 mm NaF, 60 μm ADP and selected concentrations of (dU)18 (0 to 20 μm) for 20 min at room temperature. Enzymatic activity was determined in the standard assay by initiating the reaction with 100 μg/ml poly(rU) (Method Ib). The ATPase activity was normalized to that for untreated enzyme. ATPase activity decreased linearly as the concentration of (dU)18 was increased. Equation 9 was fitted to the data to yield a minimal (dU)18 concentration of 6.0 ± 0.2 μm (dU)18 for maximal inhibition. This corresponded to a stoichiometry of 1.2 mol of (dU)18/mol of enzyme inhibited. Reversibility of the inhibition reaction was established by monitoring the increase in ATPase activity after dilution of inhibited enzyme into the assay (Method Ia). The enzyme was inhibited by reacting 4.6 μm enzyme in the standard buffer with 200 μg/ml poly(rU), 70 μm ADP, and 30 mm NaF for 20 min at 21 °C. The inhibited enzyme was diluted 2000-fold into the standard assay buffer (Fig. 6). Equation 1 was fitted to the time course to give Vf = 0.189 ± 0.007 μm−1 s−1, Vi= (8.2 ± 0.1) × 10−3μm−1 s−1, and kobs = (4.9 ± 0.3) × 10−4s−1. For untreated enzyme, the value of Vf = 0.1751 ± 0.0003 μm−1 s−1. Because the recovery of ATPase activity from the inhibited enzyme complex was slow, the stoichiometry between E and ADP in the inhibited complex could be determined by size exclusion chromatography. Reaction of 4.6 μm helicase in the standard buffer with 14 μm adenosine-2,8-3H 5′-triphosphate, 30 mm NaF, and 200 μg/ml poly(rU) for 15 min at 21 °C resulted in loss of over 90% of the ATPase activity. The bound and free ADP were separated by size exclusion chromatograph on a 1-ml column of P-6 resin equilibrated in the standard buffer. In a typical experiment, 27% of the total radiolabel was eluted in the column void volume. The recovery of ATPase activity of untreated enzyme in the column void volume was 58%. In the absence of enzyme, 0.8% of the total counts was eluted in the void volume. In the absence of NaF, 1.4% of the total counts was eluted in the void volume. From these data, the stoichiometry of ADP per monomeric helicase was 1.70 after normalizing for loss of enzymatic activity in the untreated sample of enzyme. A repeat of this experiment, yielded a stoichiometric ratio of 1.64. Slowly reversible inhibition of ATPase activity by ADP and NaF required the presence of a nucleic acid such as poly(rU). However, enzyme treated with ADP and NaF in the absence of poly(rU) was partially inhibited (Fig. 4) when the treated enzyme solution was diluted into an assay containing excess poly(rU) (Method Ia). If the treated enzyme was diluted into a solution without poly(rU) and equilibrated for 60 s prior to the addition of poly(rU) to the assay (Method Ib), the enzyme was not inhibited. These results suggested that enzyme was forming a labile complex with ADP, MgCl2, and NaF that could be trapped with poly(rU) or could rapidly dissociate in the absence of poly(rU). Formation of this labile complex was inhibited by ATP. Thus, preincubation of 10 μm ADP and 30 mm NaF with 0.67 μm helicase for 10 min in the absence of poly(rU) yielded 63% inhibition of the ATPase activity when measured by Method Ia (100-fold dilution of the treated enzyme into the poly(rU) containing assay). If 1.0 mm ATP was included in the preincubation mixture, the enzyme was only 14% inhibited. The combination of F− and ADP and Mg2+ in the presence of nucleic acid (poly(rU) was a slowly time-dependent inhibitor (t½ for dissociation was 23 min−1) of the HCV associated-ATPase activity. The combination of nucleotide diphosphates, F−, and multivalent cations such as Al3+ and Be2+modulates the activity of numerous phosphotransferases (13Troullier A. Girardet J.-L. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Antonny B. Chabre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chabre M.

For example, transducin is potently activated by GDP, fluoride, and Mg2+ (23Antonny B. Bigay J. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This activated form of the enzyme was rapidly deactivated upon dilution (t½ ∼ 5 s), whereas enzyme activated in the presence of Al3+ or Be2+ was deactivated slowly (t½ > 500 s). In contrast to transducin, sarcoplasmic reticulum CaATPase and the Na,K-ATPase are potently inhibited by MgFxx −2complexes (17, 19 - 22). MgFxx −2 complexes were slowly time-dependent inhibitors that formed an inhibited enzyme species that reactivated slowly upon dilution (t½ = 6 min (1 mm Ca2+) and t½ = 3 min (150 mm NaCl), respectively). The stable complex between Mg2+ and F− with transducin and GDP has been suggested to be MgF3−1, based upon the Hill coefficient for activation (23Antonny B. Bigay J. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas the analogous complex with Na,K-ATPase and ADP has been suggested to be MgF2 based upon the dependence of the rate constant for onset of inhibition (11Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In these complexes, MgFxx −2 is proposed to bind at the γ-phosphate binding site for the nucleotide triphosphate (23Antonny B. Bigay J. Chabre M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). HCV helicase has an intrinsic ATPase activity and nucleic acid-dependent ATPase activity. The intrinsic activity was not the result of a small amount of contaminating protein with high ATPase activity (12Preugschat F. Averett D.R. Clarke B.E. Porter D.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24449-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the intrinsic ATPase activity (kcat = 3.3 s−1) and the nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase activity (kcat = 80 s−1) may be associated with different sites on the enzyme. Both of these activities were inhibited by treatment of the enzyme with F−, ADP, and poly(rU) to yield an inhibited form of the enzyme that slowly regained activity upon dilution (t½ = 23 min). Because Al3+ did not increase the rate of inhibition and deferoxamine, a chelator for Al3+, did not decrease the rate of inhibition, contaminating Al3+ was not involved in the inhibition process. The two ATPase activities in a sample of partially inhibited enzyme were not inhibited to the same extent (89% versus67%). Furthermore, the stoichiometry for inhibition of the ATPase reaction indicated that 2 mol of ADP and 1 mol of nucleic acid were in the inhibited enzyme complex. The Hill coefficients for the titration of ATPase activity with F− and Mg2+ were greater than 1. This result suggested that multiple Mg2+and F− were involved in formation of the inhibited enzyme complex. If the Hill coefficients could be equated to the number of moles of F− and Mg2+ per mol of enzyme in the complex, then 2 mol of Mg2+ and 3 mol of F−were involved in formation of 1 mol of inhibited enzyme. These results suggested two different sites on HCV helicase with ATPase activity. The effect of ATP on the rate constant for onset of inhibition of HCV helicase by NaF and the effect of pyruvate kinase on this process suggested that MgFxx −2trapped an enzyme-bound ADP prior to its release during the catalytic cycle and that the inhibition process was not the result of the reaction of free ADP and NaF with the enzyme. Nonetheless, ADP and F− also inhibited the ATPase activity in the presence of poly(rU) and in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. An analogous result was recently observed by Berdis and Benkovic (27Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by T4 44/62 protein in the presence of Al3+ and F−. Inhibition was observed in the presence of the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase coupling system, which rapidly phosphorylated any free ADP in solution. It was proposed that AlF4− was inhibiting the reaction by trapping 44/62·ADP prior to dissociation of the complex. This was analogous to the mechanism proposed here for the inhibition of HCV helicase associated ATPase during ATP hydrolysis in the presence of poly(rU). The studies described herein have measured the stoichiometry between ADP and HCV helicase monomer for inhibition of the ATPase activity (n = 2.2) and for ADP binding (n = 1.7) in the presence of F− and poly(rU), and Mg2+. It was assumed that ADP and MgFxx −2 form a complex at the ATP binding site, such that the stoichiometry for ADP in the inhibited enzyme complex represented the stoichiometry for ATP binding to the enzyme. The finding that ATP protected the enzyme against inhibition by ADP and MgFxx −2 was consistent with this assumption. The major source of error in the determination of the stoichiometry between ADP and monomeric HCV helicase was estimation of active protein concentration. The error in the concentration of ADP used for titration of the enzyme was minimized by spectrophotometrically determining the concentration of ADP in each solution. In these studies protein concentration was calculated with an extinction coefficient based upon (rU)15 binding sites (ε280 = 88 mm−1cm−1(12)). Thus, the stoichiometry reported herein was actually the measured stoichiometry between ADP and DNA binding sites. The stoichiometry of (dU)18 binding to enzyme monomer in the inhibited enzyme complex was 1.2, which was consistent with the value of this extinction coefficient. The suggestion that HCV helicase has two ATP binding sites per monomer (DNA binding site) could have significant implications for the mechanism of helicase activity, such as the requirement of for the coupling of hydrolysis of ATP at two sites during the unwinding of duplex DNA. The interaction of ATP with other single-stranded nucleic acid-dependent ATPase appears to be a multistep process. For example, the first cycle of interaction of ATP with by E. coli recA was too slow to be on the catalytic pathway for ATP hydrolysis (28Stole E. Bryant F.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Wong and Lohman (6Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have suggested from studies on the K28I mutant of Rep helicase that a global conformational change of the protein occurs prior to the first turnover. Possibly, these results are suggesting multiple binding sites for ATP on these enzymes as well. We gratefully acknowledge S. Short and E. Furfine for helpful discussions during the course of this work."

Human cells, like other eukaryotic cells, express at least six Mcm proteins conserved in the central region. We have earlier described the primary structures of five human Mcm proteins, but the primary structure of the sixth human Mcm protein, MCM6, was identified only recently. We now use antibodies, specific for the MCM6 protein, to assess its intranuclear distribution. We find that a fraction of MCM6 protein occurs in the nucleosol, forming multiprotein complexes with other Mcm proteins. More importantly, we use for the first time micrococcal nuclease as a tool to investigate the association of MCM6 protein with chromatin. After short digestion times, a considerable fraction of the MCM6 protein is released from chromatin as a multiprotein complex that includes other Mcm proteins as well. In addition, fractions of MCM3 and MCM6 proteins are released by nuclease digestion as monomeric proteins indicating that at least these two Mcm proteins may also occur as single molecules on chromatin. The data also suggest that the chromatin regions with bound Mcm proteins are more vulnerable to nuclease attack than bulk chromatin and may therefore differ in the arrangement of nucleosomes.

The data also suggest that the chromatin regions with bound Mcm proteins are more vulnerable to nuclease attack than bulk chromatin and may therefore differ in the arrangement of nucleosomes. Mcm proteins have recently attracted considerable attention because they are thought to perform an essential function in the regulation of chromatin replication (reviewed in Refs. 1Chong J.P.J. Thömmes P. Blow J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 102-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 2Kearsey S.E. Maiorano D. Holmes E.C. Todorov I.T. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells express six evolutionarily conserved Mcm proteins. They were so named because the first members of this family of nuclear proteins were discovered through genetic screens of yeast mutants unable to maintain the extrachromosomal replication of minichromosomes (Mcm, minichromosome maintenance) 1The abbreviations used are: Mcm, minichromosome maintenance; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: Mcm, minichromosome maintenance; bp, base pair(s). (3Tye B.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mcm proteins are abundant nuclear proteins with copy numbers ranging 104 to 106 per cell nucleus. They occur either free in the nucleosol or are bound to nuclear chromatin. The fraction of chromatin-bound Mcm proteins is highest at the end of the G1 phase or the beginning of the S phase of the cell cycle but gradually decreases as S phase proceeds (4Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J.

In postreplicative cells, essentially all Mcm proteins are free in the nucleosol and disperse throughout the cell upon nuclear breakdown in mitosis, but they rapidly reassemble on chromatin sites in nuclei after mitotic telophase. Binding of Mcm proteins appears to make chromatin competent for replication. This can be concluded from biochemical work withXenopus egg extracts (7Chong J.P.J. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo V.Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Madine M.A. Khoo C.Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Kubota Y.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) as well as from genetic experiments with yeast mutants. Data strongly suggest that an association of Mcm proteins with chromatin depends on the previous binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and requires the function of additional proteins such as the Cdc6 protein (11Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 12Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Biol. 1997; 17: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Since only Mcm-containing chromatin, but not Mcm-free chromatin, is able to replicate, the replication-dependent release of bound chromatin appears to be a powerful mechanism that prevents the re-replication of chromatin during S phase. Thömmes et al. (15Thömmes P. Fett R. Schray B. Burkhart R. Barnes M. Kennedy C. Brown N.C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) detected the first mammalian Mcm protein by serendipity, whereas Hu et al. (16Hu B. Burkhart R. Schulte D. Musahl C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5289-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) used an antibody directed against a central protein region, common to all Mcm proteins, to isolate additional Mcm sequences from a human HeLa cell cDNA library. Holthoff et al. (17Holthoff H.P. Hameister H. Knippers R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) isolated and sequenced the last of the six human Mcm cDNAs, originally described as p105Mcm (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but now known as MCM6. Human MCM6 protein (MCM6p) consists of 821 amino acids with an electrophoretic molecular mass of 105 kDa and is very similar in sequence to protein Mis5, first discovered as a replication protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (19Takahashi K. Yamada H. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A cDNA, encoding human MCM6p, was also isolated and described by Tsuruga et al. (20Tsuruga H. Yabuta N. Hosoya S. Tamura K. Endo Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the preparation of MCM6-specific antibodies which we have used to assess the distribution of MCM6p in the nucleus and the interaction of MCM6p with chromatin from HeLa cells. For this purpose, we degraded chromatin with micrococcal nuclease and separated the resulting chromatin fragments by glycerol gradient centrifugation. We partially recovered MCM6p in association with chromatin fragments while another part of MCM6p appeared as free protein. We conclude that MCM6p resides in chromatin regions that differ in structure or organization from bulk chromatin. HeLa cells were cultivated on plastic dishes unter previously described conditions (21Schulte D. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Hu B. Schlatterer C. Hameister H. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For synchronization, cells were arrested in early S phase by two subsequent thymidine blocks (22Johnson R.T. Downes C.S. Meyn R.E. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 1-24Google Scholar) and released into the cell cycle by removing excess thymidine. Progression through S phase was monitored by pulse-labeling with [3H]-thymidine (1 μCi/60 min) (21Schulte D. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Hu B. Schlatterer C. Hameister H. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporated radioactivity was determined in acid precipitates by scintillation counting. The number of mitotic cells was determined according to Ohyashiki et al. (23Ohyashiki J.H. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1988; 34: 159-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nuclei were prepared either in buffers with 40 μg/ml digitonin essentially as described by Adam et al. (24Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or after swelling of washed HeLa cells in hypotonic buffer A (10 mmHepes, pH 7.5; 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40) by Dounce homogenization as described previously in detail (25Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared from digitonin nuclei by 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 150 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA. Unsoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was analyzed by immunoblotting (see below) or through glycerol gradient centrifugation (40 to 5% glycerol in the sodium acetate buffer described above). Chromatin was prepared as originally described by Hancock (26Hancock R. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on plates were washed three times with 50 ml of hypotonic buffer B (1 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA). The cells, still attached to the plates, were incubated with 0.25 mm EDTA. Nuclei, released from the swollen cells were washed and resuspended in buffer B plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 ×g through a 20-ml sucrose cushion (0.1 m sucrose in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer B at a final concentration corresponding to 700 μg of DNA/ml. DNA concentrations were determined with Hoechst 33258 by fluorimetry (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). Chromatin was treated with micrococcal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 under the conditions described below (see Fig. 5). The reaction was stopped with 8 mm EDTA. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Fragmented chromatin in the supernatants were analyzed by centrifugation (15 h at 40,000 rotations/min in a Beckman SW40 rotor) through glycerol gradients (40 to 5%; 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA). The gradients were pumped after centrifugation through a quartz cuvette to monitor the absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm. DNA fragments were analyzed after deproteinization of chromatin fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis (27Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To prepare MCM6-specific antibodies, a synthetic peptide, corresponding to amino acid positions 9–26 of the MCM6 coding sequence (17Holthoff H.P. Hameister H. Knippers R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), was linked to hemocyanin as carrier and used for the immunization of rabbits. Antibodies were prepared according to Harlow and Lane (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1988Google Scholar). Affinity-purified MCM3-specific antibodies (21Schulte D. Burkhart R. Musahl C. Hu B. Schlatterer C. Hameister H. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and antibodies directed against a region in the conserved Mcm domain (DEFD-antibodies) have been described (16Hu B. Burkhart R. Schulte D. Musahl C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5289-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used for immunoblotting (Western) experiments essentially as originally described by Towbinet al. (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44911) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (30Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Membranes, carrying the transferred proteins, were washed extensively in a Tris-NaCl buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 and developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (ECL) according to the manufacturer instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A synthetic peptide, encoding amino acid residues 9 to 26 of the MCM6p sequence (Fig. 1 A), was coupled to hemocyanin as a carrier and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Since the antigenic peptide corresponds to a section of MCM6p that is not conserved among Mcm proteins, we expected that the antibodies obtained are specifically directed against MCM6p while ignoring the other Mcm proteins. To test this prediction, we subjected a crude protein extract from HeLa cell nuclei to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred the polypeptide bands to a nylon membrane for immunostaining with the affinity-purified MCM6-specific antibodies (Western blotting). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the antibodies recognized only one polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa as expected from previous experiments (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Preincubation of the antibodies with the peptide used as antigen effectively suppressed the immune reaction (not shown), and preimmune antibodies gave negative results (Fig. 1 B). For comparisons, we used affinity purified antibodies specifically directed against protein MCM3 (MCM3p), which has electrophoretic properties similar to MCM6p (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The MCM3p-specific antibodies reacted with a polypeptide band (Fig. 1 B) that migrated slightly slower under the electrophoretic conditions used and could therefore be clearly distinguished from MCM6p. Finally, polyclonal rabbit antibodies, directed against a peptide from the central protein region containing the highly conserved Mcm “signature sequence” (including the amino acid sequence motif DEFD; see Fig. 1 A), recognized in the crude nuclear extracts the six known human Mcm proteins including MCM6p (16Hu B. Burkhart R. Schulte D. Musahl C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5289-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the results of Fig. 1 show that the newly prepared antibodies are specific for MCM6p and can therefore be used as a tool to investigate the intracellular distribution of MCM6p by immunoblotting. To determine the intranuclear distribution of MCM6p, we used two different procedures to prepare nuclei from proliferating HeLa cells. In one procedure, we treated cells with digitonin at concentrations which effectively disrupt the cytoplasmic membrane but not the nuclear envelope (24Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore all nuclear proteins, soluble and structure-bound, can be recovered in the nuclear pellet. In the second procedure, nuclei were prepared in the presence of EDTA and the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 to partially degrade the nuclear envelope (25Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consequently, free nucleosolic Mcm proteins diffuse into the surrounding medium while chromatin-bound Mcm proteins remain in the nuclear pellet. We determined the presence of MCM6p in the nuclear pellets and in the postnuclear supernatants by Western blotting using MCM6-specific antibodies as well as the DEFD-antibodies that recognize all Mcm proteins. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane 3), most MCM6p, together with other Mcm proteins, remained in nuclei prepared by the digitonin method. The minor fraction of MCM6p that appeared in the cytosolic supernatant of these preparations (Fig. 2, lane 2) originated most probably from mitotic cells where Mcm proteins disperse throughout the cell after nuclear breakdown (25Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, when nuclei were prepared with EDTA and Nonidet P-40, approximately one-half of the Mcm proteins, including MCM6p, appeared in the postnuclear supernatant (Fig. 2, lane 4) while the second half remained associated with the nuclear pellet (Fig. 2,lane 5). This result is in agreement with earlier observations showing that only a fraction of Mcm proteins is associated with chromatin in asynchronously proliferating HeLa cells (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Burkhart R. Schulte D. Hu B. Musahl C. Göhring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, in the present experiments, MCM2 protein (MCM2p) was not recovered in the nuclear pellet but appeared entirely in the postnuclear supernatant (Fig. 2, compare lanes 4 and 5). This was unexpected since an association of MCM2p with mammalian cell chromatin has been unambiguously shown by Todorov et al. (5Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We could show though that the behavior of MCM2p in the present experiments is most likely due to the low ionic strength conditions used because 40 mm NaCl rather than 10 mm NaCl in hypotonic buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures”) prevented the loss of MCM2p (not shown). It has been noted before that human MCM2p only weakly interacts with other Mcm proteins (10Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Zakisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and may have different chromatin binding properties (20Tsuruga H. Yabuta N. Hosoya S. Tamura K. Endo Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the conditions under which the binding of MCM2p to chromatin becomes sensitive to low salt remains to be investigated in detail. Following the observations of Fujita et al. (32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we could already demonstrate that ATP (1–5 mm) stabilizes the interaction of MCM2p with chromatin in buffer A. According to previous experiments, nucleosolic MCM6p can be expected to participate in the formation of multiprotein complexes with other Mcm proteins (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, these earlier conclusions were based on indirect evidence because specific tools for the detection of MCM6p had not been available. To directly demonstrate the presence of nucleosolic MCM6p in high molecular weight complexes with other Mcm proteins, we centrifuged the protein supernatants, obtained after disintegration of the nuclear envelope (see “Experimental Procedures”), through glycerol gradients. MCM6p could be recovered in two peaks, one of which sedimented faster while the other sedimented slower than the catalase sedimentation marker (Fig. 3, lower panel). Using the DEFD-antibody for Western blotting, we could show that the faster moving MCM6p cosedimented with the five other Mcm proteins, while the slower moving MCM6p fraction cosedimented with MCM4p and MCM7p (Fig. 3, upper panel). We interprete the data of Fig. 3 in light of previous reports according to which Mcm proteins are able to interact forming large multiprotein complexes as well as more stable subcomplexes. One of these subcomplexes had been shown to contain MCM4p and MCM7p as well as a third 105-kDa Mcm-related protein (10Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Zakisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Thömmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that we are now able to identify as MCM6p. In initial experiments, we treated nuclei, prepared in the presence of EDTA and Nonidet P-40, with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease or with micrococcal nuclease to investigate the chromatin-bound fraction of MCM6p. Using incubation conditions optimal for enzymatic activity, we observed a degradation of chromatin but no release of Mcm proteins from the nuclei. Kimura et al. (4Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have reported similar observations before. Following these authors, we assumed that Mcm proteins may aggregate or precipitate within the nuclei, and we therefore decided to use isolated chromatin as substrate for nuclease digestion. However, chromatin preparations in buffers, containing 10–20 mm Tris or Hepes plus 40–120 mm NaCl or KCl, tend to loose bound Mcm proteins when incubated at temperatures required for nuclease activity, as has also been recently observed by Fujita et al. (32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This prompted us to use the chromatin preparation procedure of Hancock (27Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) who had shown that a treatment of carefully washed cells with Nonidet P-40 in very low ionic strength buffers removes the nuclear envelope and yields spherical “chromatin bodies” that can be well handled by routine laboratory procedures such as pipetting and centrifugation. As already demonstrated by Hancock (27Krude T. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6257-6267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the low ionic strength conditions do not lead to detectable rearrangements in chromatin structure and composition when compared with isolated nuclei. To determine whether MCM6p is bound to these chromatin preparations in a physiologically meaningful way, we isolated chromatin bodies from HeLa cells arrested at the G1/S phase boundary by a double-thymidine block as well as from cells at different times after release from the thymidine block. We expected that MCM6p behaves much like other Mcm proteins (4Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dissociates from chromatin as a consequence of chromatin replication. We found indeed that relatively high amounts of MCM6p were present on chromatin from cells in early S phase and that MCM6p dissociated from chromatin later in S phase but rapidly bound again after completion of mitosis (Fig. 4). When the experiment of Fig. 4 was carried out in the presence of aphidicolin, a potent inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases, MCM6p remained on chromatin prepared at different cell cycle phases (not shown; see Ref. 13Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dissociation of MCM6p from chromatin required active DNA replication. We conclude that the presence of MCM6p on isolated chromatin faithfully reflects the in vivo cycle of replication-dependent dissociation of Mcm proteins from chromatin and their post-mitotic reassociation with chromatin. Next, we treated early S phase chromatin with micrococcal nuclease and found that the amounts of released MCM6p as well as of other Mcm proteins increased in parallel with the fraction of digested DNA in a manner depending on enzyme concentration (Fig. 5 A) and on time of incubation (Fig. 5 B). Micrococcal nuclease is a useful and important tool in chromatin research (reviewed in Ref. 34Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). The enzyme preferentially attacks the linker DNA between nucleosomes and therefore produces chromatin fragments carrying one, two, or more nucleosomes depending on the extent of nucleolytic degradation. In the experiment leading to Fig. 6, we have treated chromatin bodies for 5 min with micrococcal nuclease. Insoluble material was removed by low speed centrifugation while the supernatant was centrifuged through a glycerol gradient. The position of chromatin fragments in the gradient was determined by measuring the optical density at 254 nm (Fig. 6 A) and verified by an analysis of DNA fragments after deproteinization (Fig. 6 B). Western blotting experiments with the DEFD-antibodies revealed that Mcm proteins were distributed over many fractions of the glycerol gradient (Fig. 6 C), but a maximum, including all Mcm proteins (except Mcm2p; see above), appeared in gradient fractions 15–16 together with DNA fragments of about 900-bp lengths (Fig. 6 C). A second peak, also comprising all Mcm proteins, sedimented at a sedimentation rate of 11 S, together with mononucleosomes (Fig. 6 C,fractions 8–9). In addition, a considerable amount of Mcm proteins in the 105-kDa size range remained close to the top of the gradient (Fig. 6 C, fractions 3–5). This group of apparently uncomplexed proteins included MCM3p and MCM6p as shown by specific antibodies in Western blot experiments (Fig. 6, D and E). Therefore, MCM3p and MCM6p can be recovered from nuclease-treated chromatin as components of two different fast sedimenting larger Mcm complexes but also as apparently free molecules close to the top of a glycerol gradient. Are Mcm proteins in the larger complexes bound to chromatin fragments? This point was investigated by treating chromatin more extensively with micrococcal nuclease. As expected, more extensive nuclease treatment mainly produced mono- and dinucleosomal chromatin fragments (Fig. 7, A and B). The distribution of Mcm proteins in this gradient was significantly different from that obtained after short nuclease digestion times since the larger Mcm-carrying structures were converted to a major 11 S peak (Fig. 7 C, fractions 9–11) with a shoulder extending into faster moving regions. This leading shoulder of the Mcm peak disppeared upon further incubation with micrococcal nuclease (not shown). The 11 S peak of Mcm proteins only partially overlapped with the peak of mononucleosomes. In fact, an analysis of the 11 S peak material by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that Mcm proteins migrated much slower than mononucleosomes (35Schlaeger E.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3167-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (not shown), strongly suggesting that Mcm proteins in the 11 S peak were not bound to nucleosomes. Furthermore, the peak of free MCM3p close to the top of the glycerol gradient (Fig. 7 D, fraction 5) appeared to be more prominent and symmetric after longer nuclease digestion times, suggesting that residual pieces of DNA which remained bound to MCM3p after short digestion times (Fig. 6 D) were degraded after longer treatment with micrococcal nuclease. The distribution of MCM6p in the glycerol gradient was significantly different from that of MCM3p. Most MCM6p sedimented faster than free MCM3p (Fig. 7 E), and a considerable amount of MCM6p appeared in leading gradient fractions suggesting that MCM6p, released from chromatin, tends to form fast sedimenting aggregates. It has yet to be determined whether these aggregates are composed only of MCM6p or whether they also contain chromatin proteins other than MCM6p. Using MCM6-specific antibodies as a tool, we could unambiguously detect MCM6p in protein extracts from HeLa cell nuclei. This has not been possible in earlier experiments because MCM6p could not be well separated from MCM3p by standard polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We can show now that MCM6p, like other Mcm proteins, partitions between two nuclear compartments and occurs either as free protein in the nucleosol or bound to chromatin. Nucleosolic MCM6p participates in complex formation. The largest of these complexes has a sedimentation coefficient of 14–15 S in glycerol gradients and most likely includes all six Mcm proteins (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) although its precise stoichiometry has yet to be determined and may vary with the cell cycle (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 25Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A smaller complex, including MCM6p together with MCM4p and MCM7p, was also detected in the glycerol gradient of nucleosolic proteins (Fig. 3). It is not known whether this subcomplex exists in vivo because high molecular weight nucleosolic Mcm protein complexes tend to disintegrate under certain extraction conditions. For example, it has been noticed that high salt conditions induce a dissociation of the large nucleosolic Mcm protein complex into more stable subcomplexes including a trimeric complex of MCM6p with MCM4p and MCM7p (18Musahl C. Schulte D. Burkhart R. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and sedimentation through sucrose gradients, rather than glycerol gradients, also causes a disintegration of high molecular weight complexes. 2H. P. Holthoff, unpublished data. We add that the Mcm proteins in Xenopus oocytes as well as in the nucleosol of a variety of cells from different eukaryotes also form large complexes that tend to dissociate into subcomplexes, of which one contains MCM4p, MCM6p, and MCM7p (33 and references therein). A novel and probably more important aspect of the work reported above concerns Mcm proteins on isolated chromatin. For reasons explained above, we have used the classic Hancock procedure for the isolation of chromatin from HeLa cells. This procedure requires the use of the detergent Nonidet P-40 in a buffer with very low ionic strength. We show that most Mcm proteins remain associated with isolated chromatin. An exception is MCM2p which is specifically lost during chromatin isolation although previous experiments in vivo had clearly shown that MCM2p can bind to chromatin just like other Mcm proteins (5Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One reason for the loss of MCM2p could be that MCM2p requires ATP for tight chromatin binding (32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We could indeed show that an addition of ATP to the extraction buffer prevents the dissociation of MCM2p from Hancock chromatin. 3A. Richter, unpublished observations. In any case, MCM6p as well as other Mcm proteins remain rather firmly bound to isolated chromatin which clearly excludes the possibility that Mcm proteins are tethered to chromatin by MCM2p (36Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MCM6p as well as other Mcm proteins appear to be bound to isolated chromatin in a physiologically meaningful manner because their amount was found to be highest in chromatin, prepared from cells arrested at the G1/S phase boundary, but the amount decreases in chromatin from cells at later stages of the cell cycle and rapidly reassociates with chromatin at the end of mitosis. This cycle of dissociation and reassociation mirrors the behavior of Mcm proteins in HeLa cells as investigated by in vivo immunofluorescence studies (6Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To learn more about the chromatin binding of MCM6p, we treated isolated Hancock chromatin with micrococcal nuclease and could show that MCM6p is released during chromatin digestion at a rate that was similar to the rate by which other Mcm proteins were mobilized. This could probably indicate that all detectable Mcm proteins are located in chromatin regions of similar general organization. Chromatin fragments, obtained by micrococcal nuclease digestion, were analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. A major observation was that MCM6p, together with other Mcm proteins, were not evenly distributed among chromatin fragments. The data show instead that, after short exposure to nuclease, a considerable amount of Mcm proteins were enriched in glycerol gradient fractions with DNA fragments of about 900-bp lengths as well as in slower moving fractions with a sedimentation coefficient of about 11 S. Mcm proteins in the faster moving complexes were bound to DNA because these complexes disappeared upon longer nuclease digestion times and were at least partially converted into 11 S forms. The 11 S forms of Mcm complexes cosedimented, but were not associated, with mononucleosomes and seem to contain little, if any, DNA because their sedimentation properties did not change even after extensive treatment with nucleases. The presence of five different Mcm proteins in the 11 S forms of chromatin-digestion products is consistent with the possibility that Mcm proteins on chromatin interact and constitute multiprotein complexes (10Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S. Masuda T. Nojima H. Zakisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, only one part of the recovered MCM3p occurs in complexes with other Mcm proteins, whereas another part of MCM3p appears in a free uncomplexed form close to the top of glycerol gradients, even after short digestion times (Fig. 7). It will be interesting to investigate whether free MCM3p has a function distinct from the multiprotein Mcm complex and whether MCM3p is transiently released from the multiprotein complex during chromatin replication. Similar to MCM3p, a fraction of MCM6p, mobilized by nuclease treatment of chromatin, sedimented independently of other Mcm proteins (Fig. 7). In fact, much of the recovered MCM6p was widely distributed over fractions in the leading part of glycerol gradients and seems to occur in aggregates, possibly as a consequence of the release of MCM6p from chromatin sites. Aggregation is specific for chromatin-derived MCM6p since a nucleosolic MCM6p was never found to aggregate (see Fig. 3). An interesting possibility is that the tendency to aggregate is determined by the state of Mcm protein phosphorylation because chromatin-bound Mcm proteins are generally less highly phosphorylated than nucleosolic Mcms (4Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J.

In sum, our chromatin digestion experiments suggest that the five recovered Mcm proteins interact with chromatin in the form of 11 S complexes. In addition, two proteins, MCM3p and MCM6p, may independently occur on chromatin as monomeric units not tightly linked to other Mcm proteins. We could also show that Mcm proteins reside on chromatin sites that appear to be more vulnerable to nuclease attack than bulk chromatin. Further experiments are necessary to define the Mcm-carrying chromatin sites with respect to the underlying DNA structure and sequence and to additional proteins in the vicinity of bound Mcms. If Mcm proteins change their location from origins to replication forks, as has recently been suggested (38Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), we may expect to find different chromatin environments and different protein neighbors before and after initiation of chromatin replication."
https://openalex.org/W1973586968,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play an important role in stimulus-dependent receptor phosphorylation and desensitization of the receptors. Mammalian rhodopsin kinase (RK) and β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) are the most studied members among known GRKs. In this work, we purified RK from octopus photoreceptors for the first time from invertebrate tissues. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 80 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and this was 17 kDa larger than that of the vertebrate enzymes. Unlike vertebrate RK, octopus RK (ORK) was directly activated by βγ-subunits of a photoreceptor G protein. We examined the effects of various known activators and inhibitors of GRKs on the activity of the purified ORK and found that their effects were different from those on either bovine RK or βARK. To analyze the primary structure of the enzyme, we cloned the cDNA encoding ORK from an octopus retinal cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA was highly homologous to βARK over the entire molecule, including a pleckstrin homology domain located in the C-terminal region, and homology to RK was significantly lower. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of various octopus tissues with an antibody against the purified ORK showed that ORK is expressed solely in the retina, which confirmed the identity of the enzyme as rhodopsin kinase. Thus, ORK appears to represent a unique subgroup in the GRK family, which is distinguished from vertebrate RK.

Thus, ORK appears to represent a unique subgroup in the GRK family, which is distinguished from vertebrate RK. Many G protein-coupled receptors such as rhodopsin and β-adrenergic receptors are known to be phosphorylated in a light- or agonist-dependent manner by a member of the specific protein kinase family called G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). 1The abbreviations used are: GRKs, G protein-coupled receptor kinases; RK, rhodopsin kinase; βARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; ORK, octopus rhodopsin kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate; APMSF, 4-(amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. This stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of the receptors is thought to be involved in the desensitization of these receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. J.

The kinases responsible for phosphorylating the activated forms of rhodopsin and β-adrenergic receptors are rhodopsin kinase (RK or GRK1) (3Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4389-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and β-adrenergic receptor kinases (βARK1/2 or GRK2/3) (4Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), respectively. Both of these kinases have been purified to homogeneity, and their specificities and activities have been examined in reconstituted systems (5Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and two kinds of βARK (8Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Whitney M. Joazeiro C.A. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11067-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (14Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J. Connell M. Copsey T. Cooper J. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that βARK is capable of phosphorylating rhodopsin in a totally light-dependent fashion and that RK can phosphorylate the agonist-occupied β-adrenergic receptors (15Benovic J.L. Mayor F.J. Somers R.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1986; 321: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Both kinases are insensitive to cyclic nucleotides and Ca2+and inhibited by 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmZnCl2, detergents, and polyanions (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these similarities, some differences are present in the characteristics of RK and βARK. Polycations activate RK (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but not βARK (17Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between the two kinases is not high, and the differences are most evident in the C-terminal regions (7Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RK lacks ∼120 C-terminal residues present in the corresponding region of βARK. This region in βARK is referred to as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and has been identified as the site where the enzyme interacts with G protein βγ-subunits and plasma membranes upon phosphorylation of substrate receptors (18Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kontani K. Katada T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7753-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast with the case of βARK, which interacts with and is activated by Gβγ (21Haga K. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,22Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of receptors catalyzed by RK is not affected by Gβγ (23Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2222-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is reasonable since RK does not possess a PH domain. Instead of a PH domain, RK has a C terminus sequence unique within the GRK family, the motif termed CAAX boxes (where C is cysteine, A is an aliphatic residue, and X is any amino acid). CAAX boxes are one of the known C-terminal isoprenylation motifs, and bovine RK is farnesylated at its C-terminal cysteine (24Anant J.S. Fung B.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isoprenylation has been reported to be essential for the expression of full enzymatic activity of RK (25Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is required for light-induced translocation of the enzyme to the disc membranes (26Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and therefore seems to play a very important role in the physiological action of RK. Thus, βARK and RK, as far as the present understanding, represent different subgroups in the GRK family in terms of both their structure and regulatory mechanisms. We have previously shown that octopus rhodopsin is phosphorylated in a light-dependent manner and that light-induced phosphorylation of octopus rhodopsin in the microvillar membranes is markedly enhanced by GTPγS (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which suggests that octopus rhodopsin kinase (ORK), like βARK, could be activated by βγ-subunits of G protein in contrast with bovine RK. Since light depolarizes invertebrate photoreceptor cells, whereas it hyperpolarizes vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptor cells, the underlying phototransduction machinery, including that for desensitization, in invertebrate photoreceptor cells could be quite distinct from that operating in vertebrate photoreceptors (28Tsuda M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 45: 915-931Crossref Google Scholar). In an effort to explore the molecular and enzymatic properties of ORK, we purified the enzyme to apparent homogeneity for the first time as an invertebrate enzyme and cloned the cDNA encoding it. Here we report the very unique characteristics of ORK, which differ from its vertebrate counterpart and are closer to those of βARK. Mono Q 5/5, concanavalin A-Sepharose, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit, and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Sulfate-Cellulofine was from Seikagaku Kogyo Inc. (Tokyo). Extractigel-D was from Pierce. [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Achromobacter protease I was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Taq polymerase and restriction enzymes were from TaKaRa (Otsu, Japan). Lambda ZAP II vector was from Stratagene. pT7Blue(R) vector was from Novagen. Other reagents used were the highest grade commercially available. Microvillar membranes of octopus photoreceptors were prepared from eyes of Octopus dofreini as described previously (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Microvillar membranes were isolated by sucrose flotation (repeated twice) from the retinal homogenate. The isolated microvillar membranes were washed three times with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.4 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm APMSF (isotonic buffer). Rhodopsin kinase activity was extracted by freezing and thawing the washed microvillar membranes. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then thawed by homogenizing the frozen pellet in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.4 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm APMSF. The extracted proteins were separated from the membranes by centrifugation at 42,000 × g for 20 min after each freeze-thaw cycle, and five portions of successive extract were pooled together. The extract was diluted to 0.2 m NaCl and applied to a sulfate-Cellulofine column (2 × 3.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm APMSF, and 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. After the column was thoroughly washed with the equilibration buffer, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 m NaCl in 60 ml and collected in fractions of 3 ml. The fractions were assayed for rhodopsin kinase activity with rhodopsin-containing phospholipid vesicles as a substrate. ORK was eluted at ∼0.4 m NaCl as a single peak. The fractions containing ORK were combined; dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm APMSF, and 20 mm NaCl; and applied to a Mono Q 5/5 column equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–200 mm NaCl in 20 ml and collected in fractions of 1.5 ml. The fractions were assayed for rhodopsin kinase activity, and the purity of the separated kinase was estimated by SDS-PAGE on 11% gels. The purified enzyme was mixed with an equal volume of ethylene glycol as a stabilizer and stored at −30 °C until use. Octopus rhodopsin was affinity-purified with concanavalin A-Sepharose from the detergent extract of the microvillar membranes. The membrane extract with 1% (w/v) sucrose monolaurate was applied to a concanavalin A column (2 × 3.5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% sucrose monolaurate, and the column was thoroughly washed with the equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to the base-line level. Rhodopsin was eluted from the column with 250 mmα-methyl-d-mannopyranoside in the same buffer. The amount of rhodopsin was measured by absorbance at 476 nm (molecular extinction coefficient = 30,000 (29Tsuda M. Terayama Y. Takahashi M. J. Lib. Arts Sci. Sapporo Med. Coll. 1982; 23: 37-41Google Scholar, 30Koutalos Y. Ebrey T.G. Tsuda M. Odashima K. Lien T. Park M.H. Shimizu N. Derguini F. Nakanishi K. Gilson H.R. Honig B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2732-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Reconstitution of octopus rhodopsin into phospholipid vesicles was carried out as described by Cerione et al.(31Cerione R.A. Codina J. Benovic J.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Birnbaumer L. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4519-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified rhodopsin (∼8 μm) in a buffer containing 2.5 mg/ml azolectin (Sigma), 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was passed through a 1-ml Extractigel-D column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. Turbid fractions after the void volume were collected. Rhodopsin in the reconstituted vesicles retained its photoreversibility between rhodopsin and metarhodopsin. Phosphorylation of octopus rhodopsin was carried out according to the method described previously (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the rhodopsin-containing vesicles (∼3 μm rhodopsin) was incubated with the sample containing ORK in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/μl) at 15 °C in the dark or light. The reaction was terminated by addition of an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer. Incorporation of radioactivity into rhodopsin was visualized by autoradiography or measured with a Fuji BioImage BAS2000 analyzer after SDS-PAGE on 11% gels. The purified ORK (∼1 nmol) was dialyzed against 8 m urea and digested overnight withAchromobacter protease I (EC 3.4.21.50) in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5) and 4 m urea. The digested peptides were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and amino acid sequences of the peptides in the peak fractions were analyzed with an Applied Biosystems Model 473A Protein Sequencer. One of the octopus photoreceptor G proteins (32Tsuda M. Tsuda T. Terayama Y. Fukada Y. Akino T. Yamanaka G. Stryer L. Katada T. Ui M. Ebrey T.G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 198: 5-10Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Gq, was purified to apparent homogeneity from the detergent extract of the microvillar membranes as described previously (33Kikkawa S. Tominaga K. Nakagawa M. Iwasa T. Tsuda M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15857-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 1% sucrose monolaurate extract of the microvillar membranes was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, and bound proteins including Gq were eluted stepwise with a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% cholate. A trimeric Gq preparation was obtained after gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To obtain the α-monomer and βγ-dimer, the subunits were further separated on Mono Q PC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gq and its subunits thus prepared were homogeneous as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Poly(A)+RNA was prepared from an octopus retina with Oligotex-dT30 Super (TaKaRa) and used to construct a cDNA library in Lambda ZAP II vector. A pair of PCR primers were synthesized on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences determined from peptide fragments generated by Achromobacter protease I digestion of the purified ORK: ork-f1, 5′-CCIGA(AG)(CA)GICA(AG)CA(TC)AA(AG)-3′; and ork-r1, 5′-CA(AG)AA(AG)TT(TC)TC(AG)TAIA(AG)(TC)TG-3′ (where I is deoxyinosine). DNA fragments were amplified by PCR using this pair of primers and the octopus retinal cDNA library as a template. The PCR products that matched the predicted size between the primer regions (∼360 base pairs) were cloned into the plasmid vector pT7Blue(R), and the inserts were analyzed for their DNA sequences. DNA sequence was determined according to the chain termination procedure using the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit and an SQ-3000 DNA sequencer (Hitachi, Tokyo). All nucleotide sequences were determined for both strands from several independent clones. All PCR clones for which the insert DNA sequence was determined had an identical insert, and they contained the sequence corresponding to the peptide fragment obtained from the purified protein (clone P-1). To determine the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences, 5′- and 3′-PCRs were carried out with the same cDNA library as a template. For the amino-terminal sequence, the first 5′-PCR was carried out with a gene-specific primer, ork 5′-1 (5′-ATCTCCACTGACATGGAATC-3′), and a vector-specific primer, P8 (TOYOBO, Tokyo), with the retinal cDNA library as a template. The amplified DNA was then used as a template DNA for the second 5′-PCR with a gene-specific primer,ork 5′-2 (5′-GACATTCATTGTCATAGTCA-3′), and a vector-specific primer, SK (TOYOBO). The PCR fragments obtained after the second amplification were cloned and sequenced. For the carboxyl terminus, the 3′-PCR was likewise carried out using ork 3′-1 (5′-GCAGATGCTTTTGATATTGG-3′) and P7 (TOYOBO) and then ork3′-2 (5′-GATGATACAAAAGGAATCAG-3′) and a vector-specific primer, T7, for the promoter sequence of T7 polymerase (TOYOBO). The PCR clone that contained the entire coding region, named ork, was finally obtained by cloning the PCR products amplified with two sets of primers corresponding to 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions, ork-N1 (5′-ACGAGGGTAAAGCTCTCAAG-3′) and ork-C1 (5′-GTAGGAAATGGTTGGCAACA-3′) and ork-N2 (5′-ATACCAGAAGTACGAAATCC-3′) and ork-C2 (5′-CCAATATCTAGAAGTCTCT A-3′), and then its nucleotide sequences were determined for both strands from several independent clones. The purified ORK was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and used to subcutaneously inoculate rabbits (∼0.1 mg each). The rabbits were boosted 3 weeks after the first inoculation (incomplete adjuvant was used for the booster) and bled 1–2 weeks after the booster. The IgG fraction was collected from the antisera by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Anti-ORK antibody was then affinity-purified on a Sepharose 4B column coupled with the purified ORK. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). Protein blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed following the method of Towbin et al. (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44916) Google Scholar) using a transfer buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 15% (v/v) methanol. For immunological detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. About half of the rhodopsin kinase activity in the microvillar membranes was extracted by freeze-thaw methods. The extracted proteins were loaded onto a heparin-like polyanion affinity matrix sulfate-Cellulofine column. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the rhodopsin kinase activity was bound to the column (no rhodopsin kinase activity was detected in the flow-through fractions) and eluted as a single activity peak on a linear gradient of 0.2–1.0 m NaCl. ORK was eluted at ∼0.4 m NaCl, and fractions 11–17 contained an 80-kDa protein as a major component (data not shown). These fractions were pooled, dialyzed to reduce salt concentration, and further purified by Mono Q chromatography. Fig. 2 shows the elution profile of ORK on a Mono Q 5/5 column. The proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 20–200 mm NaCl. ORK was eluted at ∼100 mm NaCl as a single peak. The peak fractions eluting from the Mono Q column consisted of only one detectable protein with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3). Purification to apparent homogeneity was thus achieved at this step. The summary of the purification is documented in Table I and Fig. 3.Figure 2Elution profile of ORK on a Mono Q 5/5 column. The pooled fractions from the sulfate-Cellulofine column were applied to a Mono Q 5/5 column (0.5 × 5 cm). A, the absorbance at 280 nm of eluted proteins was monitored (——). Rhodopsin kinase activity in the eluted fractions (•——•) was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the fractions eluted from the column were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel.

Phosphorylation of rhodopsin did not occur in the dark, whereas intensive phosphorylation was observed when the reaction was carried out in the light. Since phosphorylation of octopus rhodopsin in the membrane preparation markedly increased with addition of GTPγS (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a photoreceptor G protein could be involved in regulation of rhodopsin phosphorylation. Thus, we investigated the effects of octopus photoreceptor Gq on rhodopsin phosphorylation in a well defined reconstituted system using highly purified proteins. Phosphorylation of the purified octopus rhodopsin in phospholipid vesicles by the purified ORK was examined in the presence or absence of the subunits of Gq isolated from the microvillar membranes. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, addition of the purified βγ-subunits of Gq increased rhodopsin phosphorylation 2.5-fold. On the other hand, the purified α-subunit of Gqshowed no effect regardless of the presence of GDP or GTPγS. The heat-denatured βγ-subunits were completely inactive, showing that the functionally intact subunits are required for activation. These results agree with those obtained with βARK, which possesses a PH domain, but are quite different from the results obtained with RK. To characterize ORK biochemically, we studied the effects of various compounds known to affect mammalian GRKs on ORK activity. Polycations such as polyamines and polylysine act as activators of bovine RK (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but they were potent inhibitors of ORK (Fig. 6 A). Spermine weakly (up to 20% activation) activated ORK at low concentrations, but showed strong inhibition at higher concentrations. Its IC50 was ∼5 μm. Spermidine (Fig. 6 A) and polylysine (data not shown) did not show any activation, and their IC50 values were 10 μm and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Polyanions such as heparin, dextran sulfate, and polyglutamic acid inhibit both bovine RK (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and βARK (17Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they also exhibited similar inhibition of ORK; heparin and dextran sulfate were strong inhibitors, and polyglutamic acid was a weak inhibitor (Fig. 6 B). The IC50 values for heparin and dextran sulfate were ∼1 and 0.3 μg/ml, respectively. The receptor-mimetic peptide mastoparan, which acts as an activator of both RK (36Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and βARK (37Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was, on the contrary, a potent inhibitor of ORK (Fig. 6 C), and its IC50 was ∼0.1 mm. To isolate the octopus cDNA clone encoding ORK for determination of its primary structure, PCR was conducted with an octopus retinal cDNA library as a template. Degenerative primers for screening of the library were synthesized on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences determined from peptide fragments generated byAchromobacter protease I treatment of the purified ORK. Sequences from several peptide fragments showed homology to βARK, and two regions were selected to synthesize the degenerative primers (data not shown). The full-length ork gene contains a single 2070-base open reading frame encoding a 80-kDa polypeptide, and the deduced amino acid sequence matched all the protein sequences obtained from anAchromobacter protease I digest of the purified enzyme (Fig. 7). Thus, we concluded thatork cDNA encodes the ORK that we had purified. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence displayed 64% identity to bovine βARK1. The amino acid identity to bovine RK was 34%, which is significantly lower than that to βARK. It is also notable that PH domain-like sequence, which is found in mammalian βARK but not in RK, was found in the C-terminal region of ORK, although the sequence similarity to βARK was lower in this region than in other regions. To examine the tissue distribution of this enzyme, Western blot analysis was conducted with an antibody raised against the purified kinase. As shown in Fig. 8, ORK was abundantly expressed in the retina and was not detected in all the other tissues tested (brain, optic lobe, testis, liver, muscle, salivary gland, and skin). Thus, ORK was specifically, or at least predominantly, expressed in the retina, which is consistent with its identity as rhodopsin kinase. In this paper, we report the first rhodopsin kinase that has been purified from invertebrate photoreceptors to apparent homogeneity using octopus photoreceptors. Rhodopsin kinase activity is present in both the soluble and membrane fractions of octopus retinal homogenate. As we have previously reported, rhodopsin kinase activity is present even in thoroughly washed microvillar membranes (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This indicates that a considerable amount of ORK remains as a membrane-bound form in the washed microvillar membrane preparation; thus, we intended to isolate the enzyme from the membrane extract. We found that roughly more than half of the rhodopsin kinase activity is detached from the washed microvillar membranes by freeze-thawing the membranes in isotonic buffer. Since this freeze-thaw extract contains relatively small number of proteins and is free of detergents that interfere with phosphorylation of rhodopsin, it is suitable as a starting material for purification. We used sulfate-Cellulofine, a sulfated cellulose resin, for the affinity chromatography since it gave better resolution of proteins than the widely used immobilized heparin under our experimental conditions. By two steps of successive chromatography on sulfate-Cellulofine and Mono Q columns, ORK was purified to apparent homogeneity. The apparent molecular mass of the purified ORK was estimated as 80 kDa by SDS-PAGE, which differs from that of RK (67 kDa) (5Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but is similar to that of βARK (80 kDa) (6Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also consistent with the molecular mass predicted from the sequence of the ork gene (80 kDa). ORK also resembles mammalian βARK in terms of regulation of activity. ORK is activated by βγ-subunits of a photoreceptor G protein, Gq. This is consistent with our previous observation that phosphorylation of rhodopsin in the microvillar membrane preparation is enhanced in the presence of GTP (27Tsuda M. Hirata H. Tsuda T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1167-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which suggests regulatory action of a G protein. The result that ORK is activated by Gβγ implies that the C-terminal region of ORK can serve as an interface domain between Gβγ, as expected from its sequence similarity to the PH domain present in βARK. RK does not possess a PH domain (7Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and it is not activated by Gβγ (23Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2222-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) either. Isoprenylation, which occurs at the C terminus of RK but not of the octopus enzyme, plays an important role in regulation of the enzymatic activity (25Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of regulation of rhodopsin kinase seems to be quite different between vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors. Mammalian rhodopsin couples with the photoreceptor-specific transducin, whereas octopus rhodopsin couples with multiple photoreceptor G proteins (38Tsuda M. Tsuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), including the more widely expressed Gq (33Kikkawa S. Tominaga K. Nakagawa M. Iwasa T. Tsuda M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15857-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ORK also has many properties common to βARK, which is expressed in a wide range of tissues. Together with the fact that the depolarizing photoresponses of invertebrate photoreceptors are the same as those of the typical mammalian neurons, these findings show that invertebrate photoreceptors have adopted signaling machinery common to typical mammalian neurons in their evolutionary process. In terms of sensitivity to activators and inhibitors, ORK differs from both βARK and RK. Mastoparan, a wasp venom that activates βARK (37Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine RK (36Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not activate, but instead inhibits ORK. Since mastoparan is thought to mimic the third intracellular loop of the receptor that acts as an interface on activation of G protein by the receptor (39Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one may assume that its effects on βARK are also alike (37Haga K. Kameyama K. Haga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12594-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mastoparan does not affect GTP binding to octopus photoreceptor Gq 2S. Kikkawa, unpublished data. ; thus, it probably does not mimic octopus rhodopsin against both Gqand ORK. As one may presume from their sequence differences, ORK is not activated by activators of bovine RK such as polyamines (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the contrary, polyamines are very potent inhibitors of ORK. Polyamines also inhibit βARK (17Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although less potently than they inhibit the octopus enzyme. Polyanions such as heparin, dextran sulfate, and polyglutamic acid inhibit all three enzymes (16Palczewski K. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8764-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their potencies vary with regard to each kinase. Finally, ORK is affected by all the drugs tested in a different way compared with both mammalian βARK and RK. Sequence analysis of the ork gene shows striking structural similarity of ORK to βARK, but only moderate similarity to RK. The amino acid sequence identity of ORK is much higher to βARK (64% identity) than to RK (34% identity). In addition, ORK seems to possess a PH domain in the C-terminal region, which is thought as an interaction domain with G protein βγ-subunits present in βARK, but absent in RK (1Haga T. Haga K. Kameyama K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 40Gibson T.J. Hyvoenen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the CAAXmotif for C-terminal isoprenylation, which is present in RK (7Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8715-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), is not found in ORK. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of the GRK family reveals that ORK pairs with the βARK group, not with the RK group (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that ORK is evolutionarily closely related to an ancestor of mammalian βARK and belongs to a family distinct from RK. Drosophila GPRK-1 (13Cassill J.A. Whitney M. Joazeiro C.A. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11067-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) has also been reported to be highly homologous to βARK, although no adrenergic signaling system has been identified in Drosophila. Taken together, it is interesting to hypothesize that a βARK-like enzyme may represent a prototype of all GRKs including RK and that ORK (possibly as well as other invertebrate rhodopsin kinases) may remain in a less differentiated structure than highly differentiated RK. Mammalian βARK is expressed in a wide range of tissues, and Drosophila GPRK-1 also does not show retina-specific expression (13Cassill J.A. Whitney M. Joazeiro C.A. Becker A. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11067-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since ORK is structurally similar to these enzymes, its expression also may not be limited to the retina, but may range over a variety of tissues. When several octopus tissues were subjected to Western blot analysis with an antibody generated against the purified ORK, immunoreactivity to the antibody was detected only in the retina among the tissues tested, and the expression level of ORK in the retina was very high. This abundant and specific expression pattern of ORK in the retina, which is quite similar to that of RK, affirms that this enzyme is indeed “rhodopsin kinase” and is not merely one representative of invertebrate GRKs targeting multiple receptors. In conclusion, ORK is structurally closely related to βARK, but has enzymatic properties that are unique among the known GRKs. Thus, we propose that it represents a novel subgroup, possibly that of invertebrate rhodopsin kinases, in the GRK family. Validity of this hypothesis will be examined through characterization of the corresponding enzymes in photoreceptors of other invertebrates. We thank Dr. T. Miyata for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree of the GRK family and helpful discussion and Drs. T. Haga and K. Palczewski for critical reading of the manuscript."

The burst phase ends in the dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus (about 15 ms), whereas the slow phase completes in about 10 min. A Job's plot tests of the binding stoichiometry demonstrates that there is one ANS binding site on AK, but only about 70% of the enzyme can rapidly bind with ANS, indicating that the conformation of native AK molecules is not homogeneous. Further kinetic analysis shows that the effects of ANS and substrates concentration on the burst and slow phase fluorescence building agree well with the multiple native forms mechanism. One form (denoted N1) binds with ANS, whereas the other (denoted N2) does not. ANS binding to N1 results in a burst phase fluorescence increase, followed by the interconversion of N2 to N1, to give the slow phase ANS binding. Under urea denaturation conditions, N2 is easily perturbed by urea and unfolds completely at low denaturant concentrations, whereas N1 is relatively resistant to denaturation and unfolds at higher denaturant concentrations. The existence of multiple native forms in solution may shed some light on the interpretation of the enzyme catalytic mechanism.

The existence of multiple native forms in solution may shed some light on the interpretation of the enzyme catalytic mechanism. It has been accepted that a globular protein in its native state adopts a single, well defined conformation. However, this concept has been challenged by several reports that some proteins may exist in more than one distinct folded form in equilibrium. Evidence for distinguishing multiple native forms of staphylococcal nuclease has come from electrophoretic and NMR studies (1Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol.

Based on the comparison of AK crystal structures representing the enzyme in different ligand forms, apo-form (from pig muscle), enzyme-AMP binary complex (from beef heart mitochondrial matrix), and enzyme-AP5A complex (fromEscherichia coli), Schulz and co-workers (15Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Deiderichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggested that AK undergoes large structural changes upon substrates binding. These conformational changes can be subdivided into two steps; the first change, corresponding to binding to AMP, only involves the displacement of the small α-helical domain (residues 30–59 in E. coli AK), whereas the second change, occurring with additional binding of substrate ATP, mainly involves the displacement of the LID domain (residues 122–159 in E. coli AK). However, it is not clear whether the enzyme achieves its catalytic conformation only upon substrate binding or whether the above conformation is an intrinsic property (15Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Deiderichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In other words, is there more than one distinct folded native form of AK in the absence of the substrate in solution?Two crystalline forms of adenylate kinase from pig muscle have been reported, which can be interconverted into each other depending on the pH of the medium. The conformational change from form A to B is believed to be an intrinsic property of the enzyme (22Dreusicke D. Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 23Dreusicke D. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Russellet al. (14Russell Jr., P.J. Chinn E. Williams A. David-Dimarino C. Taulane J.P. Lopez R. J. Biol.

Sinev et al. (21Sinev M.A. Sinev E.V. Ittah V. Haas E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6425-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) performed measurements of time-resolved dynamic radiation-less energy transfer of mutant E. coli AK in which the solvent-accessible residues valine 169 and alanine 55 were replaced by tryptophan (the donor of excitation energy), whereas the cysteine was labeled with either 5- or 4-acetamidosalicylic acid (the acceptor), respectively. The experimental results confirmed the stepwise manner of the domain closure of the enzyme upon binding substrates and revealed the presence of multiple conformations of E. coli AK in solution. However, despite numerous studies using 1H NMR on AK with different ligands, AMP, ADP, ATP, and AP5A (13Kalbitzer H.R. Marquetant R. Rösch P. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,24McDonald G.C. Cohn M. Noda L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6947-6954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rösch P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6808-6818Google Scholar), the information on the solution structures is limited due to the relatively large size of the enzyme.In a previous study from this laboratory (28Sheng X.R. Zhang H.J. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it was found that the time course of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) binding to AK was a biphasic process. The burst phase ended in the dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus (about 15 ms), whereas the slow phase completed in about 10 min. The results were interpreted to indicate either conformational changes during AK binding with ANS or the existence of multiple forms of the enzyme. In the present study, a kinetic approach was used to explore the mechanisms of the fluorescence building. The results clearly reveal the existence of at least two native forms of AK in equilibrium in solution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, NADP, ADP, and ANS were Sigma products; urea was from Nacalal Tesque Inc. (Japan); and other reagents were local products of analytical grade. Urea solution was always freshly prepared.Preparation and Activity Assay of Adenylate KinaseThe enzyme was prepared essentially according to Zhang et al. (29Zhang Y.L. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The yield was usually about 60 mg of pure enzyme/kg of rabbit muscle. The final preparation usually had a specific activity greater than 1600 units/mg and showed only a single peak in SDS electrophoresis, gel filtration, and reversed-phase FPLC. One unit is defined as 1 μmol of ATP generated from ADP/min.The activity assay was made by following the reduction of NADP in a coupled enzyme solution with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mm ADP, 2.1 mm Mg acetate, 6.7 mm NADP, 20 units hexokinase, and 10 units glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.1) The concentration of AK was determined by the absorption at 280 nm with A1cm1% = 5.2.MethodsJasco-720 and Jasco-500A spectropolarimeters were used for CD measurements in the far ultraviolet range from 200 to 250 nm. For the time course of unfolding, the ellipticity was followed at 222 nm for the changes in the helix content. UV absorbance at 287 nm was measured with a DU-7500 UV spectrophotometer for steady state and with a Carry 219 spectrophotometer for the time course of unfolding. The data were obtained after subtracting the base line under the same conditions.The time course of ANS binding to AK fluorescence was measured using a SPF-17 stopped-flow system with a syringe ratio of 1:1 (Applied Photophysics Ltd.). One syringe contains a fixed concentration of ANS in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.1, 25 °C, whereas the other syringe contains the appropriate protein sample. The concentration of adenylate kinase was 5.0 μmfor all experiments unless otherwise specified. The concentration of ANS was determined using the extinction coefficient ε360 nm = 4.95 × 103m−1 cm−1 in aqueous solution. The samples were excited at 378 nm, and the emission above 410 nm was detected using a wavelength cut-off filter. The dead-time in these experiments was about 15 ms. In all measurements, the base line was calibrated with ANS solution.Digitized kinetic traces were analyzed using the software provided with the Applied Photophysics Kinetic Spectrometer Workstation (Archimedes). Apparent observed first-order rate constants (kobs) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares fits of the data to Equation 1. At=As(1−exp(−kobst))+AfEquation 1 At is the total fluorescence intensity measured at time t, Af is the amplitude of the burst phase reaction, As is the amplitude of the slow phase reaction, and kobs is the observed rate constant of the slow phase reaction.KineticsTwo possible mechanisms can be proposed to interpret the biphasic fluorescence increase of ANS binding to AK. 1) The rapid formation of AK·ANS complex is followed by a slow conformational transformation to result in the slow phase reaction (this is designated as a conformational transformation mechanism). 2) At least two native forms of AK exist in solution, of which one binds rapidly with ANS and the other does not (designated as a multiple forms mechanism). These two mechanisms can be distinguished by kinetic analysis.Conformational Transformation MechanismThe conformational transformation mechanism can be expressed by Reaction 1. AK+ANS↔burst[AK·ANS]↔slowAK·ANSREACTION 1 AK and ANS first rapidly complex to form an intermediate ([AK·ANS]), resulting in the burst phase fluorescence. This intermediate then undergoes a conformational adjustment to give the slow phase fluorescence increase. If this mechanism is correct, the fraction of burst and slow phases should remain constant with varying ANS concentration.Multiple Forms MechanismConsider that there are two native forms of AK in equilibrium in solution, as shown in Reaction 2. One form (denoted N1) binds with ANS, whereas the other (denoted N2) does not. ANS binding to N1 makes the burst phase fluorescence, as shown in Reaction 3. N2 is then converted to N1 and binds with ANS to give the slow phase fluorescence increase, as shown in Reaction 4. N1↔k1/k−1N2REACTION 2 K1=[N1]0[N2]0Equation 2 and [N]0=[N1]0+[N2]0Equation 3 N1+ANS→k2N1·ANSREACTION 3 N2→k−1N1+ANS→k2N1·ANSREACTION 4 N1+ATP→k3N1·ATPREACTION 5 Here, [N1]0, [N2]0, and [N]0 are the equilibrated concentration of forms N1, N2, and total enzyme, respectively. The kinetics of ANS binding to AK are based on the following assumptions. 1) Steady-state conditions are instantaneously reached between N1, ANS, and N1·ANS and also between N1, ATP, and N1·ATP, and the interconversion of N2 to N1 is the rate-limiting step. 2) Only N1 binds with ANS and ATP. The first assumption is justified because the enzyme binding with substrates or substrate analogs is usually a very fast reaction. The second assumption seems also to be justified because experiments of soaking of crystals with ANS or ATP revealed that crystalline form B of AK binds with ANS or ATP (12Pai E.F. Sachsenheimer W. Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Under the above conditions, we obtain the following equations.

One form (denoted N1) rapidly binds with ANS, whereas the other (denoted N2) does not. N1binding with ANS causes the burst phase fluorescence increase. N2 is slowly converted to N1 and then binds with ANS, resulting in the slow phase of fluorescence increase.ANS is widely used as a probe of hydrophobic region in protein structures. The fluorescence intensity of ANS bound to a protein is dependent on the microenvironment of the binding site (32Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lin W.-Y. Yu C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Experiments wherein AK crystals were soaked with ANS or ATP revealed that ANS or ATP binding occurred only with AK of crystalline form B. ANS occupies the pocket formed between the β-sheet, loop 16–22, helix 23–30, and the C-terminal helix. This pocket was originally assigned to the adenosine moiety of AMP site (12Pai E.F. Sachsenheimer W. Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but has recently been recognized as the ATP site (33Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 34Abele U. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Compared with the results obtained in the present study, it appears highly suggestive that N1 relates to the crystalline form B, and N2 to crystalline form A.AK undergoes a domain movement when it binds with substrates or their analogues. ANS binding to AK should also induce a conformational change of the enzyme. If the slow phase fluorescence comes from this domain movement, the fraction of the burst and slow phases should keep constant with varying ANS concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”). Our observation is that the fraction of the burst phase decreases and that of the slow phase increases with increasing ANS concentration, and this is incompatible with the conformational transformation mechanism.The present experimental results demonstrate that the fraction of N1 decreases and that of N2 increases at higher pH, consistent with the study of crystal structures. N1 and N2 equilibrate with each other in solution. The fractions of N1 and N2 depend on the solution pH. High and low pH values favor N2 and N1 respectively consistent with the observation of the prevalence of crystalline forms A and B at different pH values. The report by Russell et al.(14Russell Jr., P.J. Chinn E. Williams A. David-Dimarino C. Taulane J.P. Lopez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11804-11809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that AK adopts a more open conformation at higher pH in the presence of 1 mm DTT seems to contradict our observations and crystal studies. This contradiction may arise from the different definitions of the “open” and “closed” forms. The open and closed forms determined by apparent Mr refer to the whole size of the enzyme, whereas the open and closed forms discussed here and in the crystal structure studies refer to the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme. According to the data provided by Sachsenheimer and Schulz (11Sachsenheimer W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the crystal size of form A, which has a closed hydrophobic pocket, is slightly bigger than that of the form B, which has an open hydrophobic pocket.Under urea denaturation, the unfolding amplitude of the burst phase is independent of the urea concentration in the range of 2.3–3.5m, whereas the amplitude of the slow phase increases at higher urea concentrations, suggesting the existence of at least two native forms of AK in solution. The biphasic process of unfolding cannot be interpreted as the formation of an unfolding intermediate, because the unfolding amplitude of the burst would not then remain constant. Perhaps one form of AK is easily perturbed by urea and unfolds completely at lower concentrations of urea, so that the unfolding amplitude of the burst phase is independent of the denaturant concentration. The other form is then relatively resistant to urea denaturation and its unfolding fraction increases at higher denaturant concentrations. The fraction of the burst phase of ANS binding fluorescence is very close to that of the slow phase of the urea denaturation, and the fraction of the slow phase of ANS binding fluorescence is very close to that of the burst phase of urea denaturation. This suggests that the form which unfolds slowly can rapidly bind with ANS, whereas the other form which unfolds fast can not. The equilibrium constant K′1 (equilibrium concentration ratio of N2 to N1, equivalent to 1/K1) can be calculated from either the unfolding or the ANS binding experiment.From unfolding amplitudes, we obtain Equation 29. K1′=[N2]/[N1]=[burst unfolding phase]/[slow unfolding phase]=0.3/0.7==0.43Equation 29 From ANS binding amplitude, we obtain Equation 30. K1′=[N2]/[N1]=[slow binding phase]/[burst binding phase]=0.32/0.68=0.47Equation 30 Here N1 denotes the form which unfolds slowly and can bind with the ANS burst, and N2 denotes the form which unfolds burst and cannot bind with ANS. The equilibrium constants calculated from both experiments agree very well and the interconversion free energy ΔG 0 from N1 to N2 is calculated according to Equation31. ΔG0=−RT lnK1′=1.87kJ/molEquation 31 A previous study reported that the slow phase fluorescence building can be catalyzed by peptidyl prolyl cis/transisomerases (28Sheng X.R. Zhang H.J. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The calculated free energy ΔG 0 from N1 to N2 is close to that of proline isomerization, giving further evidence that the interconversion of the two forms involves the cis/transpeptidyl prolyl isomerization of proline residue.The urea denaturation kinetics of the AK·ANS complex also confirms the suggestion of at least two native forms of AK in equilibrium in solution. At equilibrium with 0.2 mm ANS, about 65% of the AK molecules are in the form of N1·ANS complex, 25% in the form of N1, and 10% are in form of N2. N1·ANS and N1 unfold fast, whereas the unfolding of N2 is relatively too small to observe, so the observed unfolding curve is single phase.From the above discussion, the mechanisms of ANS binding and urea denaturation of AK can be written as shown below, where U represents the denatured state of AK. can bind toANS and ATP←N1k−3↖↘⇌k−1k−1k3 k−2U↗↙N2k2can't bind toANS and ATP→Scheme 1 The multiple forms of AK co-existent in solution may shed some light on the interpretation of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. One form of AK may fit the substrates MgATP and AMP as well as fit the inhibitor AP5A, so that AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction, whereas the other form can fit the substrates MgADP and ADP, but not fit the inhibitor AP5A, so that AP5A acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor for the reverse reaction.In summary, the evidence presented here suggests that at least two native forms of AK co-existent in solution. One form unfolds slowly and binds rapidly with ANS, whereas the other form unfolds quickly and does not bind with ANS. In the absence of substrates, these two folded forms equilibrate with each other in solution. Changes of the solution pH or the presence of substrates shifts the equilibrium to fit the new conditions. Furthermore, interconversion of these two forms may involve the cis/trans peptidyl prolyl isomerization. It has been accepted that a globular protein in its native state adopts a single, well defined conformation. However, this concept has been challenged by several reports that some proteins may exist in more than one distinct folded form in equilibrium. Evidence for distinguishing multiple native forms of staphylococcal nuclease has come from electrophoretic and NMR studies (1Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol.

In this study, HS was purified fromXenopus embryos to investigate its disaccharide composition and binding ability to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and follistatin (FS), the latter being provided in two isoforms with core sequences of 315 and 288 amino acids (designated FS-315 and FS-288) originating from alternative mRNA splicing. Disaccharide composition analysis of the purified Xenopus HS showed the preponderance of a disulfated disaccharide unit with uronic acid 2-O-sulfate and glucosamine 2-N-sulfate, which has been implicated in the interactions with bFGF. Specific binding of the HS to bFGF and FS-288, the COOH-terminal truncated form, was observed in the filter binding assay, whereas HS did not bind to FS-315, indicating that the acidic Glu-rich domain of FS-315 precluded the binding. The binding of the HS to bFGF or FS-288 was markedly inhibited by heparin (HP) and various HS preparations, but not by chondroitin sulfate, supporting the binding specificity of HS. The binding specificity was further investigated using FS-288 and bovine intestinal [3H]HS. Competitive inhibition assays of the HS binding to FS-288 using size-defined HP oligosaccharides revealed that the minimum size required for significant inhibition was a dodecasaccharide, which is larger than the pentasaccharide required for bFGF binding. The binding affinity of FS to HS increased in the presence of activin, a growth/differentiation factor, which could be inactivated by direct binding to FS. These results, taken together, indicate that the structural requirement for binding of HS to bFGF and FS is different. HS may undergo dynamic changes in its structure during early Xenopus embryogenesis in response to the temporal and spatial expression of various growth/differentiation factors. Enzymatic elimination of heparan sulfate (HS) causes abnormal mesodermal and neural formation in Xenopusembryos, and HS plays an indispensable role in establishing the embryogenesis and tissue morphogenesis during early Xenopusdevelopment (Furuya, S., Sera, M., Tohno-oka, R., Sugahara, K., Shiokawa, K., and Hirabayashi, Y.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HS-PG) 1The abbreviations used are: HS-PG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; FS, follistatin; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HP, heparin; ΔHexA, 4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid; HexA, hexuronic acid; IdceA, l-iduronic acid; 2S, 2-O-sulfate; 6S, 6-O-sulfate; NS, 2-N-sulfate; rh-bFGF, recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor; rhFS, recombinant human follistatin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. are ubiquitous components of the extracellular matrix and cell surface of eukaryotic cells, where they exert a variety of biological functions (for a review, see Ref. 1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). In recent years, various effects of HS-PG on growth factor-related cellular events have been observed. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a typical growth factor and has been detected as a complex with HS-PG in the extracellular matrix. Thus, HS-PG is involved in protecting bFGF from protease digestion or heat/acid-driven inactivation (2Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 58: 575-606Crossref Google Scholar). More importantly, bFGF binds to the cell surface HS-PG and the binding is essential for the interaction of bFGF with its high affinity receptor molecule (3Yayon A. Klagsbrum M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). HS-PG has also been postulated to participate in mesoderm formation in earlyXenopus embryos (4Brickman M.C. Gerhart J.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 484-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Development. 1994; 120: 2703-2711PubMed Google Scholar, 6Furuya S. Sera M. Tohno-oka R. Sugahara K. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 337-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry using the anti-HS mouse monoclonal antibody, HepSS-1, revealed that HS-PG occurs mainly in the animal hemisphere in the early gastrulae, and then appears predominantly on the sheath of the neural tube, the notochord and the epithelium (6Furuya S. Sera M. Tohno-oka R. Sugahara K. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 337-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, elimination of HS-PG by heparitinases induced abnormal mesodermal differentiation. Embryogenesis is thought to be regulated by signaling factors, such as FGFs (7Song J. Slack J.M.W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), bone morphogenetic proteins (8Wilson P.A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A.

Development. 1995; 121: 2337-2347PubMed Google Scholar), which are expressed in early stages in Xenopus embryogenesis. Since most of these growth factors have a heparin (HP)/HS binding property, at least some of these signaling factors, probably exert their functions during embryogenesis through interactions with HS-PG. In early Xenopus development, the expression of bFGF is turned on simultaneously from anterior and posterior regions at mid-neurula stage and greatly increases during the late neurula and tailbud stages (7Song J. Slack J.M.W. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Disruption of the bFGF signaling pathway resulted in severe inhibition of invagination and neural tube closure in the posterior region of embryos (18Amaya E. Musci T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 257-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), suggesting that the bFGF signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of the posterior and mesoderm in Xenopus embryogenesis. Follistatin (FS), which was originally identified as an endogenous inhibitor for section of follicle-stimulating hormone from pituitary cells (for a review, see Ref. 19Michel U. Farnworth P. Findlay J.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is a potential neural inducer. FS occurs as two isoforms (FS-315 and FS-288) originating from alternatively spliced mRNA. FS-288 lacks the unique carboxyl-terminal extension with a glutamic acid cluster present in FS-315 (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both FS-288 and FS-315 neutralize the diverse actions of activin by forming a complex with activin (21Kogawa K. Nakamura T. Sugino K. Takio K. Titani K. Sugino H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,22de Winter J.P. ten Dijke P. de Vries C.J.M. van Achterberg T.A.E. Sugino H. de Waele P. Huylebroeck D. Vershueren K. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, which induces dorso-anterior mesoderm. Although FS-288 shows affinity for HS-PG, FS-315 does not, probably due to the presence of the carboxyl-terminal extension (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, FS most likely plays a significant role in the regulation of various actions of activin. During the Xenopus embryogenesis, FS is expressed predominantly in the Spemann organizer and the notochord, tissues known to be potent neural inducers. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that FS functions as a potential neural inducer through blocking of activin actions (23Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Kelly O.G. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 283-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 24Koga C. Tashiro K. Shiokawa K. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1995; 204: 172-179Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since HS-PG is also expressed in the notochord (6Furuya S. Sera M. Tohno-oka R. Sugahara K. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 337-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it may be involved in the blocking of activin by FS. FS has been shown to associate with the cultured rat granulosa cell surface was markedly inhibited by HP and HS, and also by treatment of the cell surface with HP/HS-degrading enzymes (25Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that FS has a high affinity for the cell surface HS-PG. In this study, the binding specificities of bFGF and FS toXenopus embryo HS were comparatively investigated as representatives of HP/HS-binding growth/differentiation factors. The relationship between the fine structure and the bFGF binding ability of HP/HS has been investigated by several groups (26Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and the minimum pentasaccharide sequence required for bFGF binding (28Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been elucidated, although the biologically functional domain is larger than the binding domain (30Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the structural requirement of HS for FS binding is not well understood. As mentioned above, the spatial and temporal expression patterns of bFGF and FS, as well as their roles in early Xenopus development, are different. Hence, the precise structural requirement for the binding of bFGF and FS within the HS chains may vary. In this study, HS was isolated from early Xenopus embryos and its interactions with bFGF and FS were investigated to compare structural requirements for the binding. Heparan sulfate (HS) from Xenopusembryos (stage 30) was prepared by exhaustive chondroitinase ABC digestion of the sulfated GAG fraction that was purified from the early tailbud embryos as reported (6Furuya S. Sera M. Tohno-oka R. Sugahara K. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 337-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). HS preparations from bovine kidney and bovine intestinal mucosa were purchased from Sigma. Porcine intestinal HP was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Chondroitin sulfate isoforms A, B, C, D and E, heparitinases I and II (Flavobacterium heparinum), heparinase (Flavobacterium heparinum), and chemically modified HP derivatives were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). A king crab cartilage chondroitin sulfate K preparation was a gift from the late Dr. Nobuko Seno (Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan). Bovine liver glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were isolated basically as described previously (31Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and further purified by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column through stepwise elution with 1.0 m LiCl (fraction 1) and 2.0m LiCl (fraction 2). Fractions 1 and 2 contained HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 1:1 and 7:3, respectively, as judged by amino sugar analysis. Bovine lung HS was provided by Dr. Martin B. Mathews (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). HS produced by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor was isolated as described previously (31Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human recombinant bFGF (rh-bFGF) was a gift from Dr. Koichi Igarashi (Discovery Research Loboratories II, Takeda Chemical Ind. Ltd., Tsukuba, Japan) (32Iwane M. Kurokawa T. Sasada R. Seno M. Nakagawa S. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Human recombinant FS-288 (rhFS-288) and FS-315 (rhFS-315) were gifts from Dr. Shunichi Shimasaki (University of California, San Diego, CA) and Dr. Yuzuru Eto (Ajinomoto Co., Kawasaki, Japan), respectively. Porcine glycosylated follistatin isoforms FS-288–1CHO and FS-303–1CHO, as well as activin isoforms activin A, B, and AB, were purified from porcine ovaries. [3H]Acetic anhydride (500 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan). Xenopus embryo HS (1.0 μg) was digested with a mixture of 1.3 mIU of heparinase, 1.3 mIU of heparitinase I, and 0.7 mIU of heparitinase II in a total volume of 75 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm Ca(OAc)2 at 37 °C for 3 h. Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min. Resultant disaccharides were analyzed according to recently developed methods (33Kinoshita, A., Sugahara, K., Abstracts of XIXth Japanese Carbohydrate Symposium, August 5–7, 1997, Nishinomiya, Japan, 1997, 106.Google Scholar), whereby disaccharides were tagged with a fluorophore 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) and analyzed by HPLC. Briefly, after the sample was concentrated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator, a 5-μl aliquot of a 0.25m 2-AB solution in glacial acetic acid/dimethyl sulfoxide (7/3, v/v) and 50 μl of a 1.0 m NaCNBH3solution were added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h, and concentrated to dryness. An aliquot of the sample corresponding to 16 ng was analyzed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column basically as described (34Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 was made from 16 to 800 mm over 60 min. Eluates were monitored using a fluorometric detector RF-535 (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. N-[3H]Acetyl labeling of HS was carried out basically according to the procedure of Shaklee and Conrad (35Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Xenopus embryo HS or bovine intestinal HS (180 μg each) was mixed with 100 μl of hydrazine monohydrate (Nacalai Tesque) containing 1.0 mg of hydrazine sulfate in a test tube, which was then sealed and heated at 96 °C for 6 h. The mixture was concentrated to dryness, reconstituted in 100 μl of water, and evaporated to dryness. This process was repeated once more to remove hydrazine. The polysaccharides were isolated by gel filtration on a column (0.8 × 56 cm) of Sephadex G-25 eluted with 0.25m NH4HCO3, 7% propanol. The polysaccharide fraction was desalted by repeated evaporation with water and dissolved in 200 μl of 10% methanol containing 0.05m Na2CO3. The solution was mixed with 2.5 mCi of [3H]acetic anhydride on ice in a fume hood. The pH of the reaction mixture was kept at 7.0 by addition of 10% methanol containing 0.05 mNa2CO3. The reaction was continued for a total of 2 h, with repeated addition of 2.5 mCi of [3H]acetic anhydride every 20 min. During a 1-h period, 1 μl of unlabeled acetic anhydride was added three times. The pH was maintained at 7.0 by adding 10% methanol containing 0.05 mNa2CO3. The reaction mixture was applied to a column (1 × 46 cm) of Sephadex G-50, which was eluted with 0.25m NH4HCO3, 7% propanol. Labeled materials excluded from the gel were pooled, concentrated to dryness, and desalted by repeated evaporation with water. Various amounts of rh-bFGF were incubated with Xenopus embryo [3H]HS in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 130 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 3 h. The growth factor, along with any bound [3H]HS, was recovered by quick passage of the samples through nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius, pore size 0.45 μm; 25 mm diameter), which had been placed onto a 12-well vacuum-assisted manifold filtration apparatus. The filters were prewashed with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, before application of the samples, which was immediately followed by washing five more times with 2 ml of the same buffer. Protein-bound radioactivity was determined after submersion of the filters in 1 ml of 1 m NaCl, 0.05 m diethylamine, pH 11.5, for 30 min; radioactivity in the eluate was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka LSC-700) using a scintillation fluid containing 1.2% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole and 33% (w/v) Triton X-100. FS (rhFS-288 or rhFS-315) was incubated with Xenopus embryo [3H]HS in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 3 h. In competition experiments, various unlabeled GAGs were included as inhibitors in the incubation mixture. Binding of [3H]HS to FS was determined as for bFGF. Examination of effects of activin on the interaction between FS and HS was performed as follows. Activin (0.6 μg of activin A, B, or AB isoform) was preincubated with FS (0.3 μg of rhFS-288 or rhFS-315) in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then incubated with bovine intestinal [3H]HS (50 ng, 10000 cpm) in a total volume of 50 μl of the same buffer at room temperature for 2 h. Binding of [3H]HS to the activin-FS complex was determined as described above. Even numbered HP oligosaccharides were generated by enzymatic degradation. HP (15 mg) was digested with 20 mIU heparinase in a total volume of 1 ml of 30 mm acetate-NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3 mmCa(OAc)2 and 1% bovine serum albumin. When the reaction reached a plateau after 1 h as monitored by absorption at 232 nm, it was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 1 min. The digest was adjusted to 1.0 m NaCl and fractionated into even-numbered species on a column (1.6 × 95 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10, which was equilibrated and eluted with 1.0 m NaCl, 10% ethanol. Elution was performed with the same solution. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and monitored by absorption at 232 nm. The separated fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted by gel filtration on a column (1.5 × 46.5 cm) of Sephadex G-25, and lyophilized. Uronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (36Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5205) Google Scholar). Our previous results suggested that HS played an indispensable role in establishing the fundamental body plan during the earlyXenopus development (6Furuya S. Sera M. Tohno-oka R. Sugahara K. Shiokawa K. Hirabayashi Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 337-346Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this study, HS was purified from stage 30 embryos and characterized for its structure, as well as for the ability to interact with bFGF and FS as representatives of typical HS-binding growth/differentiation factors. Xenopus embryo HS was subjected to a disaccharide composition analysis after digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II. The resulting disaccharides were labeled with a fluorophore 2-AB and analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC according to the recently developed fluorophore-tagging method (33Kinoshita, A., Sugahara, K., Abstracts of XIXth Japanese Carbohydrate Symposium, August 5–7, 1997, Nishinomiya, Japan, 1997, 106.Google Scholar). Nearly 55% of the disaccharides were N-sulfated, 24% contained a hexuronate 2-O-sulfate residue, and 17% were 6-O-sulfated and relatively low as compared with N- or 2-O-sulfate (Table I). These findings were in good agreement with the results obtained by the disaccharide composition analysis after deamination with HNO2 followed by reduction with NaB3H4 (data not shown). The levels of the N-sulfation and 2-O-sulfation were higher, whereas that of 6-O-sulfation was lower, if compared with a commercial reference compound bovine kidney HS (37Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with HS from porcine and bovine organs, the Xenopus HS was characterized by a higher content of the HexA(2S)-GlcN(NS) disaccharide unit representing 17.9% of the total disaccharides (Table I), where HexA, 2S, and NS represent hexuronic acid, 2-O-sulfate, and 2-N-sulfate, respectively. These results may be relevant to the importance of N- and 2-O-sulfations for the binding of the Xenopus embryo HS to FS and/or bFGF as described below.Table IDisaccharide composition analysis of Xenopus embryo HSDisaccharideProportion%ΔHexAα1–4GlcNAc38.7ΔHexAα1–4GlcNAc(6S)6.0ΔHexAα1–4GlcN(NS)26.1ΔHexAα1–4GlcN(NS,6S)4.8ΔHexA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS)17.9ΔHexA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS,6S)6.5 Open table in a new tab 3H labeling of the HS preparation was conducted byN-deacetylation with hydrazine followed byN-reacetylation with [3H](CH3CO)2O. The3H-labeled Xenopus embryo HS preparation was incubated with rh-bFGF, and the binding ability was evaluated using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). bFGF, along with any bound carbohydrate, was recovered through nitrocellulose filters. The filters were examined in a scintillation spectrometer. Specific binding of the Xenopusembryo HS to rh-bFGF was concentration-dependent as shown in Fig. 1. The direct binding of the Xenopus embryo HS to rh-bFGF suggests that the HS contains the pentasaccharide sequence -HexA-GlcN(NS)-HexA-GlcN(NS)-IdceA(2S)- required for specific binding to bFGF (28Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the binding specificity of the Xenopus embryo HS to bFGF, the effects of various kinds of GAGs on the binding were examined. The 3H-labeledXenopus embryo HS was incubated with rh-bFGF in the presence of various GAGs and dextran sulfate (Table II). Dextran sulfate, HP, and HS preparations except for the undersulfated HS produced by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor inhibited the binding, whereas various chondroitin sulfate isoforms exhibited no significant inhibition, supporting the specific binding of the Xenopus embryo HS to bFGF.Table IIInhibition of the binding of Xenopus embryo HS to rh-bFGF by various glycosaminoglycansPolysaccharides[3H]HS binding at concentrations:0.4 μg/ml2.0 μg/ml%None100Xenopus embryo HS6117Bovine liver GAG fraction 12-2001Fractions 1 and 2 contained HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 1:1 and 7:3, respectively.177Bovine liver GAG fraction 22-2001Fractions 1 and 2 contained HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 1:1 and 7:3, respectively.03Bovine kidney HS5320EHS tumor mouse GAG fraction2-bThis GAG preparation was isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor and was a mixture of HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 22:3.9274Bovine lung HS4816Bovine intestinal HS6820Porcine intestinal HP122Chondroitin sulfate A—2-2003—, not determined.94Chondroitin sulfate B—77Chondroitin sulfate C—100Chondroitin sulfate D—100Chondroitin sulfate E—82Chondroitin sulfate K—91Dextran sulfate (Mr = 5000)—02-2001 Fractions 1 and 2 contained HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 1:1 and 7:3, respectively.2-b This GAG preparation was isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor and was a mixture of HS and chondroitin sulfate in a ratio of 22:3.2-2003 —, not determined. Open table in a new tab The binding ability of the Xenopus embryo HS to the two FS isoforms originating from alternatively spliced mRNA were compared using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Fig. 2). the Xenopus embryo HS showed a high affinity for rhFS-288, the human recombinant FS short form, but no appreciable affinity for the long form, rhFS-315. Binding of the Xenopus embryo HS to rhFS-288 was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2), demonstrating direct interaction between the two. Although saturation of the binding was not shown due to a limited availability of rhFS-288, the binding specificity was demonstrated by the inhibition study as described below. The above results are in good agreement with the previous observation that the COOH-terminal truncated isoform (FS-288) bound to the HS on rat granulosa cell surfaces (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FS isoforms containing one N-glycosidic oligosaccharide chain, which were isolated from porcine ovaries and designated as FS-288–1CHO and FS-303–1CHO (20Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were also examined for their affinities to the Xenopus embryo HS. FS-303–1CHO is thought to be derived from FS-315 by post-translation proteolytic cleavage of the 12 COOH-terminal amino acids, and it still contains the carboxyl-terminal glutamic acid cluster. The short form, FS-288–1CHO, bound to the HS whereas the long form, FS-303–1CHO, did not (data not shown), suggesting that HS regulates the action of FS-288 but not that of FS-303, during the Xenopus embryo development and that the carbohydrate chain does not appreciably affect its interaction with HS. To characterize the binding specificity of the Xenopus embryo HS to FS, the effects of various kinds of GAGs on the binding were examined. The 3H-labeledXenopus embryo HS (1.8 μg/ml) was incubated with rhFS-288 in the presence of increasing amounts of various GAGs (0.5–4.0 μg/ml). Unlabeled Xenopus embryo HS precluded the binding of the 3H-labeled Xenopus embryo HS to rhFS-288, and 50% inhibition was observed at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml (Fig. 3). Bovine kidney HS, bovine intestinal HS, and porcine intestinal HP inhibited the binding also, whereas chondroitin sulfate A exhibited no significant inhibition even at 4.0 μg/ml. Undersulfated HS produced by the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor exhibited weak inhibition (data not shown). Porcine intestinal HP was more potent than"
https://openalex.org/W2152704660,"This work provides evidence for interactions between fragments of “19-kDa membranes,” a trypsinized preparation of Na,K-ATPase that retains cation occlusion and ouabain binding. Previously, we reported rapid thermal inactivation of Rb+ occlusion at 37 °C (Or, E., David, P., Shainskaya, A., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1993)J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16929–16937). We describe here the detailed kinetics of thermal inactivation. In the range 25–35 °C, a two-step model (N ↔ U → I, where N is the native species, U is the reversibly unfolded intermediate, and I is the irreversibly denatured form) fits the data. Reversibility of inactivation has been observed at 25 °C, consistent with the model. At 37 °C and higher temperatures, the data can be fitted to the simple mechanism N → I, i.e. U is not significant as an intermediate. Occluded cations (Na+, Rb+, K+, Tl+, NH4+, and Cs+) and ouabain protect strongly against thermal inactivation. Ca2+, Ba2+, and La3+ ions do not protect. Proteolysis experiments provide independent evidence that disorganization can occur in stages, first in transmembrane segments and then in extra-membrane segments of the fragments. Analysis of selective dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment at 37 °C (Lutsenko, S., and Kaplan, J. H. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7936–7940), using a specific antibody, showed that inactivation of Rb+ occlusion precedes dissociation of the fragment, and only ∼50% of the fragment is released when occlusion is fully inactivated. In the presence of Ca2+ions, occlusion is inactivated, but the M5/M6 fragment is not released. The experiments demonstrate that occlusion is inactivated by disruption of interactions between fragments of 19-kDa membranes, and only then does the M5/M6 fragment dissociate. Interactions between the M5/M6 and M7/M10 fragments seem to be essential for maintenance of Rb+ occlusion. This work provides evidence for interactions between fragments of “19-kDa membranes,” a trypsinized preparation of Na,K-ATPase that retains cation occlusion and ouabain binding. Previously, we reported rapid thermal inactivation of Rb+ occlusion at 37 °C (Or, E., David, P., Shainskaya, A., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1993)J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16929–16937).

Reversibility of inactivation has been observed at 25 °C, consistent with the model. At 37 °C and higher temperatures, the data can be fitted to the simple mechanism N → I, i.e. U is not significant as an intermediate. Occluded cations (Na+, Rb+, K+, Tl+, NH4+, and Cs+) and ouabain protect strongly against thermal inactivation. Ca2+, Ba2+, and La3+ ions do not protect. Proteolysis experiments provide independent evidence that disorganization can occur in stages, first in transmembrane segments and then in extra-membrane segments of the fragments. Analysis of selective dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment at 37 °C (Lutsenko, S., and Kaplan, J. H. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 7936–7940), using a specific antibody, showed that inactivation of Rb+ occlusion precedes dissociation of the fragment, and only ∼50% of the fragment is released when occlusion is fully inactivated. In the presence of Ca2+ions, occlusion is inactivated, but the M5/M6 fragment is not released. The experiments demonstrate that occlusion is inactivated by disruption of interactions between fragments of 19-kDa membranes, and only then does the M5/M6 fragment dissociate. Interactions between the M5/M6 and M7/M10 fragments seem to be essential for maintenance of Rb+ occlusion. Recent studies of structure-function relations of the higher P-type active cation pumps have focused on the characterization of functional sites, for ATP and cations or inhibitors such as the cardiac glycoside, or on experimental determination of transmembrane topology (3Møller J. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The consensus number of transmembrane segments in α-subunits of Na,K-, H,K-, and Ca-ATPases is 10, and therefore, the focus of attention is now shifting to the question of their arrangement in the plane of the membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis or chimeric molecules are being used intensively to characterize residues involved in cation occlusion. Site-directed mutations suggest that carboxyl and other oxygen-containing side chains of residues within transmembrane segments M4–M6, and perhaps M8, ligate the occluded cations (4Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 5Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19622-19659Google Scholar, 6Rice W.J. MacLennan D.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 66 (abstr.): A121Google Scholar). Thus, the transmembrane α-helices are arranged so as to create the cation occlusion “cage.” A complementary biochemical approach for the study of cation sites and the organization of transmembrane segments utilizes a preparation of renal Na,K-ATPase extensively digested with trypsin (7Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation, referred to as “19-kDa membranes,” consists of well defined fragments of the α-subunit containing transmembrane segments M7–M10 (apparent molecular mass of ≈19 kDa); the pairs M1/M2, M3/M4, and M5/M6 (apparent molecular mass of 8–11.7 kDa); and the β-subunit partially split into a 16-kDa N-terminal and an ≈50-kDa C-terminal fragment. Cation occlusion and ouabain binding are intact, but ATP binding is absent. These features indicate that cation occlusion sites are located within transmembrane segments. Occluded cations (K+, Na+, and congeners) (7Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also ouabain (9Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) strongly protect the 19-kDa and smaller fragments of the α-subunit and also the 16-kDa fragment of the β-subunit against trypsin. In the absence of occluded cations or if Rb+ ions are displaced by Ca2+ ions, Rb+ occlusion is destroyed, and all the fragments are digested further to limit membrane-embedded peptides (10Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The segments digested away from 19-kDa membranes consist of tails and loops between transmembrane segments outside the membrane. These findings indicated that the fragments interact as a complex in which several transmembrane segments cooperate to occlude the cations, consistent with conclusions based on mutations. Occluded Rb+ or Na+ or ouabain induces interactions between fragments, stabilizing a compact structure that is inaccessible to trypsin. Recently, we have demonstrated directly the existence of a detergent-solubilized complex of all the fragments containing occluded Rb+ ions and bound ouabain (11Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One objective of this work has been to investigate an observation that incubation of 19-kDa membranes at 37 °C in the absence of occluded cations leads to rapid loss of the ability to occlude Rb+ions (1Or E. David P. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Occluded Rb+ or Na+ ions protect against this thermal inactivation as well as against further tryptic digestion of the fragments. Indeed, trypsin digests only thermally inactivated 19-kDa membranes, suggesting that the process involves disorganization of the interacting fragments (10Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10780-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar implication has come from an observation that ouabain binding and electrogenic Na+ binding are thermally inactivated at the same rate (12Schwappach B. Stürmer W. Apell H.-J. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21620-21626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent experiments utilizing chymotrypsin to demonstrate a specific role of the cytoplasmic tail of the β-subunit, loss of Rb+ occlusion has also been found to be a result of thermal inactivation (13Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10309-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We have also proposed that loss of Rb+ occlusion, following reduction of S–S bridges in the β-subunit (14Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), represents accelerated thermal inactivation of a destabilized structure. Thermal inactivation of Rb+occlusion appears to be a general phenomenon accompanying structural perturbations of 19-kDa membranes and can be used as a tool to investigate the structure of the cation-binding domain, the strength of the interactions between different fragments, and the effect of ligands or substrates on stability. Thermal inactivation of the native Na,K-ATPase, with protection by K+ and Na+ions, was described earlier (15Fisher T.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 16Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but 19-kDa membranes, which lack the cytoplasmic loops of the α-subunit, are much more thermolabile than native enzyme and represent a simpler system to analyze the factors determining the stability and interactions between transmembrane segments. Lutsenko and Kaplan (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown recently that, upon incubation of 19-kDa membranes at 37 °C in the absence of Rb+ ions or ouabain, the fragment containing the M5/M6 segments is selectively and irreversibly released into the medium. Dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment is associated with partial inhibition of Rb+occlusion, and loss of Rb+ occlusion has been described as accompanying (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or being caused by (17Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment. Since occluded Rb+ ions prevent dissociation of the M5/M6 fragment and also protect against thermal inactivation, it has become necessary to characterize the relationship between the two phenomena. Na,K-ATPase was prepared from fresh pig kidney red outer medulla by the rapid procedure described by Jørgensen (18Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATPase activity was determined as described previously (18Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Specific activity was in the range 13–20 units/mg of protein. Before use, the enzyme was dialyzed at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of a solution containing 25 mm histidine, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA (Tris). Standard conditions for preparation of tryptic 19-kDa membranes were described by Capasso et al. (8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion, membranes were washed, suspended, and stored in standard medium (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA), to which 2 mm RbCl was added. The Rb+occlusion assays were performed as described by Shani et al.(20Shani M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The medium contained, in a volume of 20–50 μl, 1 mm RbCl plus ≈5 × 106 cpm86Rb+, 12.5 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10–20 μg of 19-kDa membranes. Membranes were centrifuged and suspended in standard medium containing 0.1 mm RbCl and were then washed again and suspended in a Rb+-free medium. The final free Rb+concentration was estimated to be <1 μm. 19-kDa membranes were incubated at 0.5–2 mg/ml, under the conditions indicated in the figure legends, in a thermostatically controlled water bath. At the indicated times, aliquots were placed on ice; reaction medium containing 1 mm RbCl plus ≈5 × 106 cpm 86Rb+ was added; and Rb+ occlusion was measured after a 60-min incubation at 0 °C or 5 min at 20 °C. Experimental points represent averages of duplicate samples. Variability between duplicates was <10%. 19-kDa membranes (150 μg/sample) were diluted with 1 ml of standard medium and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold medium containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm RbCl, or 1 mm CaCl2. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mm) was added to all buffers to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at a certain time and placed on ice. For electrophoretic analyses and immunoblots, the samples were transferred to ice, and thermal inactivation was stopped by addition of ice-cold standard medium containing 10 mmRbCl. The samples were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in standard medium containing 2 mm RbCl. Prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pellets were resuspended in standard medium and dissolved in 4% SDS, and protein was precipitated by addition of 4 volumes of ice-cold methanol and stored overnight at −20 °C. The delipidated protein was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 rpm in a Sorvall centrifuge, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and dissolved in 10% SDS or the sample buffer. The supernatants were collected, lyophilized, and dissolved in the sample buffer. Equal amounts of delipidated membrane protein (∼100 μg for staining and 10 μg for immunoblotting) and equivalent amounts of supernatant and pellet were applied per lane of 10% gels. Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone. /SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done essentially according to Schägger and von Jagow (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) using either 1.5-mm-thick 10% gels (10% T and 3% C separating gel (11.5 cm) plus 4% T stacking gel (1.5 cm)) or 1-mm-thick 16.5% gels (16.5% T and 6% C separating gel (20 cm), 10% T spacing gel (2 cm), and 4% T stacking gel (1.5 cm)). Full details of the electrophoresis procedure are given by Capasso et al.(8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning of transparencies of photographs of gels was performed with a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer. Immunoglobulins raised against the synthetic peptide Leu815–Gln828 were supplied by Dr. J. V. Møller (Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark), and anti-Lys1012–Tyr1016, referred to as anti-KETYY, was supplied by Dr. J. Kyte (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Rabbit antisera, prepared as described (22Grossman Z. Ram D. Markovics A. Tarrab-Hazdai R. Lantner F. Ziv E. Schechter I. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were raised against fragments of 19-kDa membranes (7Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Anti-peptide antibodies were also raised against the synthetic peptides Leu337–Asn348 and Ile263–Pro276, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were diluted 1:100–400 in a solution of 1.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline solution. Samples were delipidated, separated on 16.5 and 10% Tricine gels, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper according to Matsudaira (23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Semi-Phor TE70 semidry transfer apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Immunoblot analysis was described previously in detail by Capasso et al. (8Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Best fit parameters of theoretical equations to experimental data were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the Mathematica and MatLab software programs. First-order rate constants for the thermal inactivation process were determined from least-squares fits of the data to Equation 4 in the “Appendix.” The error estimates of the parameters are calculated by linear approximation (24Bevington P.R. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969Google Scholar). Activation parameters were calculated as described by Huang (25Huang R. Physical Chemistry with Application to Biological Systems. McMillan Publishing Co., New York1981: 348-389Google Scholar). Activation energy (Ea) values were estimated from slopes of Arrhenius plots (ln k versus 1/T). Activation enthalpies (ΔH ‡) for each temperature were calculated from the relation ΔH ‡ =Ea − RT, where R (8.314 J·K−1·mol−1) is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. Activation free energies (ΔG ‡) were calculated according to Equation 1, ΔG‡=−RT lnkrhKb·TEquation 1 where kr (s−1) is the thermal inactivation rate constant, h (6.6265 × 10−34 J·s) is the Planck constant, and Kb (1.3805 × 1023J·K−1) is the Boltzmann constant. Activation entropies (ΔS ‡) were then calculated according to Equation 2. ΔS‡=ΔH‡−ΔG‡TEquation 2 86RbCl was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Dowex 50W-X8 (100 mesh, H-form; converted to the Tris form before use) was obtained either from Sigma or Fluka. Trypsin inhibitor (type 1-S from soybean), bovine serum albumin (fraction V), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, thioglycolate, and molecular mass markers (2.5–16.9 kDa) were from Sigma. Choline chloride (recrystallized from hot ethanol) was obtained from Fluka. TPCK-treated trypsin (bovine pancreas, 240 units/mg) was from Worthington. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all reagents were of electrophoresis grade and were from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride paper was from Millipore Corp. Thallous acetate, lithium chloride, and magnesium chloride were from BDH (Poole, United Kingdom). Cesium chloride was from Fisher. Ammonium and potassium chlorides were from Merck. Lanthanum chloride heptahydrate was from Aldrich. Fig. 1 shows representative time courses of thermal inactivation of Rb+occlusion in the temperature range 25–45 °C and in the absence of Rb+ ions. Because 19-kDa membranes are most stable when stored in medium containing Rb+ ions, removal of contaminating Rb+ ions by thorough washing of the membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”) was essential to ensure maximal reproducibility of time courses for different preparations. If, for example, the membranes were centrifuged only once and were then resuspended in nominally Rb+-free solutions, the occlusion was not fully inactivated at 37 °C, and the final level varied in different experiments. Reports of incomplete thermal inhibition (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Liu L. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14380-14386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) of proteolyzed dog kidney enzyme might be explained by insufficient washing of the membranes. The time courses in Fig. 1 appeared to be biphasic, at least in the range 25–35 °C, and the kinetics were therefore analyzed using the two-step model of enzyme denaturation proposed by Lumry and Eyring (27Lumry R. Eyring H. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 110-120Crossref Scopus (730) Google Scholar) (Equation 3), N⇄k1k2U→k3IEquation 3 where N is the active native enzyme, U is the reversibly unfolded inactive enzyme, and I is the irreversibly inactivated enzyme. The model is described by the three rate constantsk1, k2, and k3. Equation 4 in the “Appendix” assumes that the remaining occlusion activity reflects the value of N and describes a double exponential inactivation kinetic. The continuous lines in Fig. 1 represent best fits to Equation 4. Best fit values of k1, k2, and k3 and also the amplitudes of the two phases (A1 and A2) were calculated and collected together in Table I. In the range 25–35 °C, the double exponential kinetic provided a good fit to the data. At 40 and 45 °C, the kinetics could not be distinguished from a single exponential process due to the shift of the relative amplitudes of the two phases. Most curves at 37 °C were also fitted adequately by a single exponential decay (data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters for inactivation of Rb+ occlusion in the absence of Rb+ ionsTemperaturek1 ± S.E.k2 ± S.E.k3 ± S.E.A1A2°Cmin−1min−1min−1250.03 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.060.02 ± 0.0116.583.5300.17 ± 0.020.11 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.0155.644.4350.38 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.0167.832.2400.60 ± 0.05100451.25 ± 0.1100 Open table in a new tab Although values of k1,k2, and k3 could be obtained only over a limited range of temperatures and the fitting errors are significant, we have estimated activation parameters (ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡) from the Arrhenius plots, for the values are informative with respect to the mechanism of thermal inactivation (Fig. 2 and Table II). The positive values of ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡ for k1 and k3 reflect the fact that k1 and k3 rose as the temperature was raised. However, k2 did not change appreciably between 25 and 35 °C (Table I), and thus, ΔH ‡ is near to zero, whereas ΔS ‡ has a negative value. The data are consistent with the notion that k1 and k3 represent disorganization processes but thatk2 represents a reorganization process (see “Discussion”).Table IIActivation parameters for thermal inactivation of Rb+ occlusionPreparationRate constantsΔG ‡ΔH ‡ΔS ‡kcal · mol−1kcal · mol−1cal · K−1 · mol−119-kDa membranesk1223129 (25 °C)k221−1−73k3222922 Open table in a new tab The Lumry-Eyring mechanism assumes the existence of a reversible equilibrium between the N and U states, followed by an irreversible step to the I state. The obviously biphasic curve at 25 °C in Fig. 1suggested that the U state might be significantly populated and that inactivation might be reversible. As a test of this hypothesis, we incubated 19-kDa membranes in the absence of Rb+ ions at 25 °C for 30 min and then transferred them to ice. Reaction medium was added, and Rb+ occlusion was estimated over several hours at 0 °C. As seen in Fig. 3, the level of Rb+ occlusion, initially ∼70% of the control level, rose slowly and eventually reached ∼95% of the control level. By contrast, after inactivation of occlusion to 60% of the control level by incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 min, no reversibility was detected. The presence of Rb+ ions was not necessary for reactivation of Rb+ occlusion at 0 °C (data not shown). At 25 °C, it was also possible to observe reversibility of inactivation after incubation with Rb+ ions for 1 h or longer. The result at 25 °C is compatible with the Lumry-Eyring model, but the model seems to break down at 37 °C and higher temperatures (see “Discussion”). Previously, we reported that Rb+ or Na+ ions protect against thermal inactivation, but aromatic guanidinium and isothiouronium derivatives, which act as competitive Na+ antagonists, do not protect (1Or E.

Rb+, K+, Tl+, Cs+, NH4+, and Na+ ions protected fully against thermal inactivation under these conditions. The Km for Rb+ions for protection was 89 μm (data not shown).

Thus, it appears that only cations that can be occluded (K+, Na+, and congeners) can protect against thermal inactivation. The ability of occluded Rb+ ions to stabilize against thermal inactivation was analyzed in more detail in Fig. 5, which presents representative time courses of loss of occlusion in the presence of a very high concentration of Rb+ ions (50 mm). 50 mm RbCl was used because, in control experiments, the high concentration was found to be necessary to saturate occlusion at 55 °C (data not shown). A striking feature is that occlusion was significantly inactivated only at 45 °C and higher temperatures. Thus, Rb+ ions greatly slowed down thermal inactivation, the rate at 45 °C being about the same as at 25 °C in the absence of Rb+ ions (Fig. 1). The inactivation curves demonstrated biphasic kinetics in the range 45–50 °C, and again the lines represent best fits to Equation 4 in the “Appendix.” At 52 °C and higher temperatures, inactivation became monoexponential. Fitted rate constants are presented in Table III. Because values for k1, k2, and k3 were obtained only over a 5 °C temperature span (45–50 °C) and the fitting errors are large, it was not possible to obtain reliable quantitative values of activation parameters (ΔH ‡ and ΔS ‡) for comparison with those in the absence of Rb+ ions. Nevertheless, comparison of the fitted rate constants, with or without Rb+ ions, revealed important qualitative features of the mechanism of action of the Rb+ ions (see “Discussion”).Table IIIKinetic parameters for inactivation of Rb+ occlusion in the presence of Rb+ ionsTemperaturek1 ± S.E.k2 ± S.E.k3 ± S.E.A1A2°Cmin−1min−1min−1450.22 ± 0.110.77 ± 0.460.04 ± 0.0120.779.3470.27 ± 0.160.68 ± 0.570.10 ± 0.0324.475.6500.32 ± 0.110.35 ± 0.240.13 ± 0.0446.653.4520.92 ± 0.14100551.78 ± 0.30100 Open table in a new tab Ouabain binds tightly to 19-kDa membranes in the presence of Mg2+ions (K0.5 at 10 mmMgCl2 ≈ 1 μm) (12Schwappach B.

Ouabain plus Mg2+ ions inhibited Rb+ occlusion to ≈37% of the control level, thus complicating the experiment. Nevertheless, in the sample incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with ouabain plus Mg2+ ions, the Rb+ occlusion was ∼88% of that in the unincubated sample. This value can be compared with the Rb+ occlusion level of only 20% of control for the sample incubated at 37 °C without ouabain plus Mg2+. Other control experiments showed that ouabain alone (K0.5 ≈ 1 mm) slowed down the rate of Rb+ occlusion, but did not inhibit the equilibrium level of Rb+ occlusion after incubation of 19-kDa membranes with reaction medium for 1 h at 20 °C (data not shown). Therefore, protection experiments could also be done conveniently in the absence of Mg2+ ions. Fig. 6 shows that ouabain (5 mm) without added Mg2+ ions was indeed able to protect strongly against thermal inactivation.

https://openalex.org/W1965418881,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activity is mediated by a cellular receptor (GM-CSFR) that is comprised of an α-chain (GM-CSFRα), which specifically binds GM-CSF, and a β-chain (β<sub>c</sub>), shared with the interleukin-3 and interleukin-5 receptors. GM-CSFRα exists in both a transmembrane (tmGM-CSFRα) and a soluble form (sGM-CSFRα). We designed an sGM-CSFRα-Fc fusion protein to study GM-CSF interactions with the GM-CSFRα. The construct was prepared by fusing the coding region of the sGM-CSFRα with the CH2-CH3 regions of murine IgG2a. Purified sGM-CSFRα-Fc ran as a monomer of 60 kDa on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but formed a trimer of 160–200 kDa under nonreducing conditions. The sGM-CSFRα-Fc bound specifically to GM-CSF as demonstrated by standard and competitive immunoassays, as well as by radioligand assay with <sup>125</sup>I-GM-CSF. The sGM-CSFRα-Fc also inhibited GM-CSF-dependent cell growth and therein is a functional antagonist. Kinetics of sGM-CSFRα-Fc binding to GM-CSF were evaluated using an IAsys biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Paramus, NJ) with two assay systems. In the first, the sGM-CSFRα-Fc was bound to immobilized staphylococcal protein A on the biosensor surface, and binding kinetics of GM-CSF in solution were determined. This revealed a rapid <i>k</i><sub>off</sub> of 2.43 × 10<sup>−2</sup>/s. A second set of experiments was performed with GM-CSF immobilized to the sensor surface and the sGM-CSFRα-Fc in solution. The dissociation rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>off</sub>) for the sGM-CSFRα-Fc trimer from GM-CSF was 1.57 × 10<sup>−3</sup>/s, attributable to the higher avidity of binding in this assay. These data indicate rapid dissociation of GM-CSF from the sGM-CSFRα-Fc and suggest that<i>in vivo</i>, sGM-CSFRα may need to be present in the local environment of a responsive cell to exert its antagonist activity."

According to these results, the bound proteins are in a “molten globule”-like folding state, marked by the presence of secondary structure, lack of persistent tertiary interactions, and the exposure of hydrophobic structure elements at the protein surface. GroEL has a relatively weak ATPase activity which is regulated by GroES (7Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U.

GroES can bind on top of the GroEL cylinder in the presence of nucleotides. A result of this interaction is an increased nucleotide affinity of GroEL and a tight coordination of the cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and ADP release.The mechanism of GroEL/GroES-mediated protein folding has been subject of extensive investigation. The current data can be summarized in a model (1Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), according to which ATP hydrolysis in the GroEL ring that is opposite GroES leads to release of ADP in the GroES-containing ring, accompanied by transient GroES release and binding of ATP. Once ATP is bound, GroES caps the end of the GroEL cylinder that also contains the substrate protein, thereby discharging the unfolded polypeptide into the shielded cavity for folding. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis in the opposite GroEL ring leads to the release of GroES and allows a folded substrate protein eventually to exit the cylinder. However, polypeptides that fold incompletely and still expose binding sites for the chaperonin after one such reaction cycle, will rebind. Typically, a polypeptide has to undergo several reaction cycles in association with GroEL before it leaves the chaperonin as a native or native-like protein (14Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T.

Binding elements for GroES and polypeptide reside, and partially overlap, within the outer domains, whereas nucleotides bind to the central amino-terminal domains (7Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R.

Electron microscopy studies, and the recently solved GroEL/GroES crystal structure have revealed the significant conformational changes that occur after nucleotide-dependent binding of GroES to GroEL (4Langer T.

Most prominently, the apical GroEL domains move outward about 60°, leading to a significant widening and enlargement of the central cavity. These domain movements seem to be mediated by an intermediary hinge region (residues 134–190 and 377–408) which links the central and apical domains. In addition to its critical role in effecting these GroES-induced conformational changes, the hinge region is also thought to be involved in mediating the changes in the central ATP-binding region which are induced by the binding of substrate protein in the apical domain. Conversely, nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis in the central domain affect binding and release of substrate protein from a distance, and the intermediary domain is expected to be involved in this process as well.We have previously observed that modification of GroEL with NEM 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; [α-32P]8-N3ADP and [α-32P]8-N3ATP, azido-labeled, radioactive adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, respectively; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; [α-32P]8-N3ADP and [α-32P]8-N3ATP, azido-labeled, radioactive adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, respectively; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). leads to structural changes in the intermediary hinge region and, unlike wild-type GroEL, makes it accessible to attack by proteinase K (21Martin J. Goldie K.N. Engel A. Hartl F.-U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, Cys138, a residue located in the intermediate domain, is identified as the target for NEM modification. As it seemed likely that NEM modification not only affects the structure, but has even more profound effects on the function of the GroEL chaperonin, this study analyzes the consequences of NEM modification for the ability of GroEL to successfully mediate the folding of substrate proteins.DISCUSSIONModification of GroEL with NEM changes the properties of the chaperonin profoundly, both structurally and functionally. Only one of the three cysteines in GroEL, Cys138, is modified by NEM. The small intermediate domain (residues 134–190 and 377–408), in which this residue resides, joins the apical domain of a GroEL subunit with its large equatorial domain. It has been proposed that this intermediate segment allows a hinge-like opening and twisting of the apical domain about the common domain junction (Gly192 and Gly375), which is caused by nucleotide binding in the equatorial domains and GroES binding to the apical domains of one GroEL ring (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). As a result, the volume of the central GroEL chamber in the GroES-associated ring increases significantly, forming the cage in which protein folding proceeds. The now dome-shaped cavity is spacious enough to allow the enclosed protein to explore its folding pathway without direct interference from the chaperonin itself. In addition to moving upward the apical domain becomes twisted. The affinity of GroEL for unfolded polypeptide is strongly reduced when GroES is bound in the presence of nucleotides because rotation of the apical domains about the hinge between the apical and intermediate domains then occludes most of the hydrophobic-binding regions in the intersubunit interface. The opening movement of the apical domain is made possible by a downward movement of the intermediate segment toward the central channel which occurs at the domain junction between intermediate and equatorial domain around residues Pro137 and Gly410 (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the importance of that second hinge region comes from the present study showing that modification of Cys138 adjacent to Pro137 with a bulky NEM moiety interferes with this movement. Structural changes in the vicinity of Pro137 can explain not only the observations described here but also our findings from an earlier study (21Martin J. Goldie K.N. Engel A. Hartl F.-U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar) where we analyzed fragments of NEM-GroEL that were obtained after proteolysis in the presence of nucleotides. Cleavage by proteinase K occurred between residues 143 and 153. Whereas Pro137 is highly conserved in members of the chaperonin family, one encounters more variability in the adjacent residue. In addition to Cys, one frequently finds Val at this position, and mutations to other small uncharged residues like Ala or Ser result in functional proteins (32Bochkareva E.S. Horovitz A. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 44-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Luo G.-X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32151-32154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, when we attempted to mimic the NEM effect by exchanging Cys138 to the larger hydrophobic residues Trp or Phe, we found defects similar to that observed with the chemically modified chaperonin. 3J. L. Mark and J. Martin, unpublished results. It appears that only modification with bulky hydrophobic groups perturbs the structural integrity in the complex in such a way that proteinase K gains access to an otherwise inaccessible region.The primary consequences of modification of the critical residue Cys138 in NEM-GroEL are changes in nucleotide binding, rate and cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis, and GroES binding. NEM-GroEL has an increased ATPase activity and binds nucleotides with higher affinity than wild-type GroEL. This phenotype is unique among the various GroEL mutants that have been generated so far in that none of these analyzed mutants is characterized by an accelerated rate of ATP hydrolysis (6Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar); typically, the rate is reduced. In a GroEL·GroES complex the downward movement around Pro137 impedes dissociation of ADP, locking the chaperonin complex in the nucleotide-bound state. It is conceivable that NEM·GroEL adopts a conformation that mimics part of this movement and thereby leads to an increase in nucleotide affinity. This conformational switch could bring Cys138 closer to the nucleotide-binding site, explaining earlier data from cross-linking experiments with ATPγS that had placed Cys138 in the vicinity of the ATP phosphate groups (32Bochkareva E.S. Horovitz A. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 44-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, despite its higer affinity for nucleotides, the affinity of NEM-GroEL for GroES is reduced compared with wild-type GroEL. This result demonstrates that a tighter binding of ATP or ADP to the chaperonin does not automatically correlate with better binding of the chaperonin cofactor as expected. As a consequence of the weak interaction of NEM-GroEL with GroES, the modified chaperonin is compromised in its ability to promote protein folding at 25 °C. Substrate proteins are likely to make contact with GroEL at several of the seven subunits in the cylindrical ring. A coordinated release of substrate from all these sites during ATP hydrolysis would give the protein time to partially fold within the cavity until the high affinity ADP state is regenerated. Without GroES, nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis by the individual GroEL subunits result in nonproductive release of folding intermediates into the bulk solution. For smaller proteins that can fold relatively easily, such as DHFR, release per se may be sufficient. In contrast, for those substrates that are more likely to engage in non-productive intermolecular interactions and are prone to misfolding, such as rhodanese, full coordination of the conformational changes in the individual subunits and the presence of GroES is required for a productive release into the chaperonin cavity. Unsynchronized release of substrate protein, as in NEM-GroEL, would shorten the time window for folding, because at any given time a binding site in NEM-GroEL would be competent for (re)binding the substrate. GroES binding to NEM-GroEL may facilitate coordinated release at least to such a degree that is sufficient for the release and folding of the weakly binding substrate DHFR, whose reactivation consequently becomes GroES-dependent. However, for tight binding substrate proteins like rhodanese, the GroES interaction with NEM-GroEL is still too weak to promote their efficient displacement into the cavity. At 37 °C, several effects may contribute to the partially restored chaperonin activity of NEM-GroEL. First, folding of substrate proteins is expected to occur with faster kinetics, which might enable the folding proteins to escape an untimely rebinding to NEM-GroEL. Second, the conformational changes induced by NEM modification may be less pronounced at 37 °C, or may affect the chaperonin conformation less than at 25 °C due to an increased flexibility of the chaperonin structure. Third, and most importantly, there is a strong improvement in GroES binding to NEM-GroEL at higher temperatures. A firmly anchored GroES is required to displace the substrate protein from its binding site at GroEL which partially overlaps with that of the smaller cofactor. In fact, it appears that this aspect of GroES function is the most critical one, more important than a precise regulation of the GroEL ATPase activity (35Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of GroES to the apical domain after nucleotide binding to the central domain would be made possible by the intermediate domain, coupling not only these two events, but also ATP hydrolysis to productive protein release. The Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL plays a pivotal role in the folding of proteins in the cell. Assisted by the cofactor GroES, it allows newly synthesized polypeptide chains to gain their native state under the crowded conditions of the cytosol (for review, see Refs. 1Martin J. Hartl F.U.

GroEL forms a cylinder composed of two symmetrically stacked rings, each with seven identicalMr 57,000 subunits (3Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P.

Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Typically, only one substrate protein binds to one GroEL tetradecamer (5Braig K. Simon M. Furuya F. Hainfeld J.F. Horwich A.L.

According to these results, the bound proteins are in a “molten globule”-like folding state, marked by the presence of secondary structure, lack of persistent tertiary interactions, and the exposure of hydrophobic structure elements at the protein surface. GroEL has a relatively weak ATPase activity which is regulated by GroES (7Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 13Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This smaller cofactor is comprised of sevenMr 10,000 subunits that are arranged in a single ring. GroES can bind on top of the GroEL cylinder in the presence of nucleotides. A result of this interaction is an increased nucleotide affinity of GroEL and a tight coordination of the cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and ADP release. The mechanism of GroEL/GroES-mediated protein folding has been subject of extensive investigation. The current data can be summarized in a model (1Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), according to which ATP hydrolysis in the GroEL ring that is opposite GroES leads to release of ADP in the GroES-containing ring, accompanied by transient GroES release and binding of ATP. Once ATP is bound, GroES caps the end of the GroEL cylinder that also contains the substrate protein, thereby discharging the unfolded polypeptide into the shielded cavity for folding. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis in the opposite GroEL ring leads to the release of GroES and allows a folded substrate protein eventually to exit the cylinder. However, polypeptides that fold incompletely and still expose binding sites for the chaperonin after one such reaction cycle, will rebind. Typically, a polypeptide has to undergo several reaction cycles in association with GroEL before it leaves the chaperonin as a native or native-like protein (14Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T.

Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), indicating the positions where nucleotides and the unfolded substrate proteins bind. Binding elements for GroES and polypeptide reside, and partially overlap, within the outer domains, whereas nucleotides bind to the central amino-terminal domains (7Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R.

Biol. 1996; 3: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy studies, and the recently solved GroEL/GroES crystal structure have revealed the significant conformational changes that occur after nucleotide-dependent binding of GroES to GroEL (4Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Most prominently, the apical GroEL domains move outward about 60°, leading to a significant widening and enlargement of the central cavity. These domain movements seem to be mediated by an intermediary hinge region (residues 134–190 and 377–408) which links the central and apical domains. In addition to its critical role in effecting these GroES-induced conformational changes, the hinge region is also thought to be involved in mediating the changes in the central ATP-binding region which are induced by the binding of substrate protein in the apical domain. Conversely, nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis in the central domain affect binding and release of substrate protein from a distance, and the intermediary domain is expected to be involved in this process as well. We have previously observed that modification of GroEL with NEM 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; [α-32P]8-N3ADP and [α-32P]8-N3ATP, azido-labeled, radioactive adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, respectively; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). 1The abbreviations used are: NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; [α-32P]8-N3ADP and [α-32P]8-N3ATP, azido-labeled, radioactive adenosine diphosphate and adenosine triphosphate, respectively; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). leads to structural changes in the intermediary hinge region and, unlike wild-type GroEL, makes it accessible to attack by proteinase K (21Martin J. Goldie K.N. Engel A. Hartl F.-U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, Cys138, a residue located in the intermediate domain, is identified as the target for NEM modification. As it seemed likely that NEM modification not only affects the structure, but has even more profound effects on the function of the GroEL chaperonin, this study analyzes the consequences of NEM modification for the ability of GroEL to successfully mediate the folding of substrate proteins. DISCUSSIONModification of GroEL with NEM changes the properties of the chaperonin profoundly, both structurally and functionally. Only one of the three cysteines in GroEL, Cys138, is modified by NEM. The small intermediate domain (residues 134–190 and 377–408), in which this residue resides, joins the apical domain of a GroEL subunit with its large equatorial domain. It has been proposed that this intermediate segment allows a hinge-like opening and twisting of the apical domain about the common domain junction (Gly192 and Gly375), which is caused by nucleotide binding in the equatorial domains and GroES binding to the apical domains of one GroEL ring (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). As a result, the volume of the central GroEL chamber in the GroES-associated ring increases significantly, forming the cage in which protein folding proceeds. The now dome-shaped cavity is spacious enough to allow the enclosed protein to explore its folding pathway without direct interference from the chaperonin itself. In addition to moving upward the apical domain becomes twisted. The affinity of GroEL for unfolded polypeptide is strongly reduced when GroES is bound in the presence of nucleotides because rotation of the apical domains about the hinge between the apical and intermediate domains then occludes most of the hydrophobic-binding regions in the intersubunit interface. The opening movement of the apical domain is made possible by a downward movement of the intermediate segment toward the central channel which occurs at the domain junction between intermediate and equatorial domain around residues Pro137 and Gly410 (19Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the importance of that second hinge region comes from the present study showing that modification of Cys138 adjacent to Pro137 with a bulky NEM moiety interferes with this movement. Structural changes in the vicinity of Pro137 can explain not only the observations described here but also our findings from an earlier study (21Martin J. Goldie K.N. Engel A. Hartl F.-U. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 635-639PubMed Google Scholar) where we analyzed fragments of NEM-GroEL that were obtained after proteolysis in the presence of nucleotides. Cleavage by proteinase K occurred between residues 143 and 153. Whereas Pro137 is highly conserved in members of the chaperonin family, one encounters more variability in the adjacent residue. In addition to Cys, one frequently finds Val at this position, and mutations to other small uncharged residues like Ala or Ser result in functional proteins (32Bochkareva E.S. Horovitz A. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 44-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Luo G.-X. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32151-32154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5303-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, when we attempted to mimic the NEM effect by exchanging Cys138 to the larger hydrophobic residues Trp or Phe, we found defects similar to that observed with the chemically modified chaperonin. 3J. L. Mark and J. Martin, unpublished results. It appears that only modification with bulky hydrophobic groups perturbs the structural integrity in the complex in such a way that proteinase K gains access to an otherwise inaccessible region.The primary consequences of modification of the critical residue Cys138 in NEM-GroEL are changes in nucleotide binding, rate and cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis, and GroES binding. NEM-GroEL has an increased ATPase activity and binds nucleotides with higher affinity than wild-type GroEL. This phenotype is unique among the various GroEL mutants that have been generated so far in that none of these analyzed mutants is characterized by an accelerated rate of ATP hydrolysis (6Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar); typically, the rate is reduced. In a GroEL·GroES complex the downward movement around Pro137 impedes dissociation of ADP, locking the chaperonin complex in the nucleotide-bound state. It is conceivable that NEM·GroEL adopts a conformation that mimics part of this movement and thereby leads to an increase in nucleotide affinity. This conformational switch could bring Cys138 closer to the nucleotide-binding site, explaining earlier data from cross-linking experiments with ATPγS that had placed Cys138 in the vicinity of the ATP phosphate groups (32Bochkareva E.S. Horovitz A. Girshovich A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 44-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, despite its higer affinity for nucleotides, the affinity of NEM-GroEL for GroES is reduced compared with wild-type GroEL. This result demonstrates that a tighter binding of ATP or ADP to the chaperonin does not automatically correlate with better binding of the chaperonin cofactor as expected. As a consequence of the weak interaction of NEM-GroEL with GroES, the modified chaperonin is compromised in its ability to promote protein folding at 25 °C. Substrate proteins are likely to make contact with GroEL at several of the seven subunits in the cylindrical ring. A coordinated release of substrate from all these sites during ATP hydrolysis would give the protein time to partially fold within the cavity until the high affinity ADP state is regenerated. Without GroES, nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis by the individual GroEL subunits result in nonproductive release of folding intermediates into the bulk solution. For smaller proteins that can fold relatively easily, such as DHFR, release per se may be sufficient. In contrast, for those substrates that are more likely to engage in non-productive intermolecular interactions and are prone to misfolding, such as rhodanese, full coordination of the conformational changes in the individual subunits and the presence of GroES is required for a productive release into the chaperonin cavity. Unsynchronized release of substrate protein, as in NEM-GroEL, would shorten the time window for folding, because at any given time a binding site in NEM-GroEL would be competent for (re)binding the substrate. GroES binding to NEM-GroEL may facilitate coordinated release at least to such a degree that is sufficient for the release and folding of the weakly binding substrate DHFR, whose reactivation consequently becomes GroES-dependent. However, for tight binding substrate proteins like rhodanese, the GroES interaction with NEM-GroEL is still too weak to promote their efficient displacement into the cavity.

First, folding of substrate proteins is expected to occur with faster kinetics, which might enable the folding proteins to escape an untimely rebinding to NEM-GroEL. Second, the conformational changes induced by NEM modification may be less pronounced at 37 °C, or may affect the chaperonin conformation less than at 25 °C due to an increased flexibility of the chaperonin structure.

The precipitating event in the initiation of the uPA/plasmin proteolytic cascade remains elusive, as the natural mechanism of activation of uPA is not well understood. Whereas the activation of pro-uPA is presumed to be mediated primarily by plasmin in a feedback mechanism (2Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. Nelles L. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5232-5236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol.

In addition, in plasminogen-deficient mice, uPA is found in its active two-chain form (10Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms other than activation by plasmin are responsible for uPA activation. There is accumulating evidence that the single-chain human uPA through interactions with substrates, inhibitors, cell surface receptors, or fibrin clots (7Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol.

Definitive proof for this mechanism of pro-uPA activation, however, is lacking. In striking contrast to mammalian cells, which generally produce, secrete, and maintain uPA in the single-chain, zymogen form, transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (RSVCEF) consistently produce active two-chain uPA in the complete absence of plasminogen and plasmin (14Berkenpas M. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7768-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It was suggested that malignant transformed cells possess a unique structural or enzymatic process that brings about uPA activation (14Berkenpas M. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7768-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We investigated this plasmin-independent activation of avian uPA in a number of cell culture systems, including recombinant expression systems, and present evidence that the activation of chicken uPA is not dependent on malignant transformation but rather is an autocatalytic event that appears to reflect an intrinsic property of avian uPA. Primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were prepared from 11-day old embryos as described (14Berkenpas M. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7768-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Secondary cultures of CEF were infected with the BH strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) generating highly transformed cultures of RSVCEF that were propagated, maintained, and characterized as described previously (14Berkenpas M. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7768-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cultures of the chicken macrophage cell line, HD11, obtained from M. Hayman (SUNY, Stony Brook, NY) and the duck embryo cell line, CCL 141, obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were maintained under identical culture conditions as CEF and RSVCEF. The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line HEp3 and the mouse myeloma cell line NS0 were cultured and maintained as described previously (15Brooks P.C. Lin J.-N. French D.L. Quigley J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding ch-uPAwt was cloned into Bluescript KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (16Sipley J.D. Alexander D.S. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ch-uPAwt insert was ligated into the EcoRI and BclI restriction sites of the pEE12 expression vector, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression vector obtained from C. Bebbington (Celltech, Slough, UK). The ch-uPAwt-pEE12 vector was transfected by electroporation into mouse myeloma NS0 cells. The transfected cultures were grown in the absence of glutamine under limiting dilution to select for cells expressing glutamine synthetase encoded by the pEE12 vector (17Bebbington C.R. Renner G. Thomson S. King D. Abrams D. Yarranton G.T. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Selected colonies were screened for ch-uPAwt production by casein-plasminogen zymography and immunoblotting. High level ch-uPAwt-expressing colonies were picked, subcloned, expanded in culture, and harvested in serum-free medium. A subclone, 2F7NS0/ch-uPAwt produced 0.1 μg/ml of ch-uPAwt in serum-free conditioned medium. The ch-uPAwt cDNA also was transferred from Bluescript into pVL1392 a baculovirus-based transfer vector that contains the complete polyhedron gene locus of the Autographa californicanuclear polyhedrosis virus (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The ch-uPAwt-containing vector was co-transfected with BaculoGold viral DNA into Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant baculovirus containing the ch-uPAwt insert was amplified through sequential infections of Sf9 cells and then used to infect Hi5 insect cells, a high level protein producer insect cell line (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Infected cells expressing and secreting ch-uPAwt protein were harvested and analyzed for the production and zymogen status of ch-uPA. Treatment with the irreversible serine protease inhibitor, DFP, can differentiate between single-chain zymogen uPA, which is resistant to DFP and two-chain active uPA, which is completely inhibited by DFP. Samples of conditioned media are incubated at 20 °C with 5 mm DFP for 1 h followed by a second 1 h treatment with 5 mm DFP. The samples are then electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12%) under nonreducing conditions alongside untreated samples or solvent (isopropyl alcohol) only treated samples. The gels are then washed two times with 2.5% Triton-X100 followed by a 1 h washing in H2O. The washed gel is placed over an underlay consisting of 1% agarose, 5% nonfat dry milk (casein) and 50 μg/ml chicken plasminogen and incubated at 37 °C until pronounced zones of lysis appear at the electrophoretic position of uPA. Samples of conditioned media are electrophoresed under nonreducing (no βME) or reducing (5% v/v βME) conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gels. The gels are transferred at 30 volts to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes are blocked for 2 h in 5% casein-0.1% Tween 20 then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against ch-uPA. After washing, the membranes are incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and following extensive washing are developed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell cultures that are expressing recombinant wild type or mutant ch-uPA are washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing one-tenth the normal amount of methionine and cysteine and supplemented with [35S]methionine (1100 μCi/mmol) and [35S]cysteine (1100 μCi/mmol) to a total of 75 μCi/ml. The cultures are incubated for 18–20 h to radiolabel the expressed proteins, and the conditioned medium is harvested, centrifuged (3000 rpm for 10 min) and immunoprecipitated to capture the radiolabeled ch-uPA. Immunoprecipitation is carried out by adding 50 μg/ml purified rabbit anti-ch-uPA polyclonal antibody to the radiolabeled conditioned medium and incubating overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, protein A-Sepharose beads are added (1:20 v/v) and incubation continued for an additional 4–6 h. The mixture is centrifuged to capture the immune complexes, washed extensively, resuspended in 7.5 m urea-1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with or without reducing agent (βME), electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gels and processed for autoradiography as described previously (18Quigley J.P. Berkenpas M.B. Aimes R.T. Chen J.-M. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chicken plasminogen was purified from chicken plasma by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described (19Goldfarb R.H. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 19: 5463-5471Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The ch-uPAwt was purified by benzamidine-Sepharose affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography as described (19Goldfarb R.H. Quigley J.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 19: 5463-5471Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to ch-uPA and a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ch-uPA were purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (14Berkenpas M. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7768-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Sullivan L.M. Quigley J.P. Cell. 1986; 45: 905-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Human plasminogen, plasmin, uPA, and antibodies to human uPA were from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). The active site serine residue (Ser353) of ch-uPA was mutated to alanine utilizing the method of splicing by overlap extension and polymerase chain reaction (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pearse L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The internal 5′ primer, 5′-GGGAGATGCTGGCGGCCC-3′, was used to incorporate the nucleotide change (TCT → GCT) that mutates Ser353 to alanine. The resulting cloned DNA was sequenced to verify the mutation and subcloned into both the pEE12 and baculovirus expression vector for expression in NS0 and Hi5 cells, respectively, as described above. The expressed mutant, ch-uPAS353A, was completely inactive catalytically in both the plasminogen-coupled chromogenic substrate assay (16Sipley J.D. Alexander D.S. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the zymographic underlay assay. To investigate the mechanism of activation of chicken uPA, the cDNA was subcloned into a baculoviral expression vector and in a mammalian expression vector for expression in two distinct, heterologous culture systems: Hi5 insect cells and NS0 mouse myeloma cells, respectively. Cells that synthesized and secreted ch-uPA were selected, expanded in culture, and incubated to release ch-uPA into the conditioned medium. All conditioned media were obtained under serum-free conditions in the absence of plasminogen and in the presence of aprotinin, a potent plasmin inhibitor. The recombinant ch-uPA from the two expression systems was tested for its zymogen status by two independent methods. In the first method, which tests the conformational status of the active site, conditioned media from cultures of RSVCEF, Hi5-ch-uPAwt and NS0-ch-uPAwt are left untreated or treated with DFP, an irreversible active site inhibitor of serine proteases that targets only the active form of the enzymes. Subsequently, the samples are subjected to SDS-PAGE and underlay zymography. Active two-chain uPA would be sensitive to DFP, resulting in the diminution of zones of lysis in the zymograph. In contrast, single-chain zymogen uPA would be resistant to inhibition by DFP, displaying a zone of lysis comparable to that created by the untreated sample. As shown in Fig. 1 A, recombinant ch-uPA produced in both expression systems (lanes 3–6) is as sensitive to DFP as the native RSVCEF-produced ch-uPA (lanes 1–2), indicating that ch-uPA presents entirely in its active form. That the expressed recombinant ch-uPA is in the two-chain active protease form was determined by an alternative method based on protein structure, namely electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing or reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting and probing with a polyclonal anti-ch-uPA antibody (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–6). Upon reduction, zymogen ch-uPA would be maintained as a 48-kDa single-chain form, whereas two-chain uPA would dissociate into a 35-kDa B-chain and a 12–14-kDa A-chain. The recombinant ch-uPA secreted in both the insect and the mammalian expression systems (lanes 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, respectively) exhibits only the 35-kDa B-chain upon reduction (A-chain is not immunoreactive with this antibody), with little or no evidence of the 48-kDa single-chain form, indicating that recombinant ch-uPA is found in the two-chain form identically to the native ch-uPA expressed by RSVCEF (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast to avian uPA, human uPA obtained from conditioned medium of human tumor cells is maintained in the single-chain zymogen form, as seen by resistance to DFP treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, recombinant human uPA expressed in the same insect cell expression system was found to be secreted and maintained in single-chain zymogen form (Fig. 1 B,lanes 7 and 8), under identical conditions to those that allowed complete conversion of ch-uPA to the active two-chain form, indicating that there is no ubiquitous single-chain uPA-converting enzyme in the recombinant expression system that had activated the chicken pro-uPA. Thus, the recombinant ch-uPA produced by two heterologous expression systems is found to be in the active two-chain form, indicating that ch-uPA is an intrinsically unstable zymogen that converts rapidly and efficiently to the active two-chain uPA form independent of the culture system in which it is expressed. Interestingly, this intrinsic conversion process generates the same two-chain uPA molecule as plasmin-mediated activation of uPA. Recombinant ch-uPA harvested from NS0-ch-uPAwt cultures was purified and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The B-chain was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing. The first 8 residues obtained were Ile, Val, Gly, Gly, Ser, Gln, Ala, Glu, corresponding to ch-uPA sequence153IVGGSQAE160, indicating that the cleavage site is at Lys152-Ile153, the homologous position in all mammalian uPA's that is cleaved during plasmin-mediated activation. Inhibition of the conversion process using highly specific reagents indicates that the conversion of ch-uPA requires its own catalytic activity. A monoclonal antibody to ch-uPA added to cultures expressing ch-uPAwt (Fig. 2) prevents the conversion reaction, yielding a DFP-insensitive chicken uPA zymogen (lanes 3 and 4). This monoclonal antibody has been shown to be highly specific in blocking the catalytic activity of ch-uPA (20Sullivan L.M. Quigley J.P. Cell. 1986; 45: 905-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight inhibitors of uPA activity such as benzamidine and nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate also prevent chicken pro-uPA conversion, whereas serine protease inhibitors specific for plasmin- or trypsin-like enzymes such as εACA, SBTI, and trasylol had no inhibitory effect on conversion in any of the ch-uPA-expression systems (data not shown). Thus, only specific inhibitors of uPA effectively impede conversion of ch-uPA, suggesting that the catalytic activity of the enzyme is necessary for its own conversion. To test this hypothesis directly, we designed, constructed, and expressed an active site mutant chicken uPA devoid of catalytic activity. This mutant, in which the active site serine (Ser353) was replaced by alanine (ch-uPAS353A), was expressed both in the Hi5/baculoviral expression system and in the NS0 mammalian expression system. The mutant ch-uPAS353A was indistinguishable from wild-type ch-uPA on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and was shown to lack any measurable activity on underlay zymography or in a chromogenic substrate assay (data not shown). However, when the expressed ch-uPAS353A mutant is assessed for single-chain or two-chain status by Western blotting, it presents in the 48-kDa single-chain form under reducing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 2), whereas the wild-type ch-uPAwt expressed in parallel cultures exhibits only the two-chain form (Fig. 3, lane 1), dissociating under reducing conditions into a 35-kDa B-chain and a 14-kDa A-chain. Therefore, abrogating the catalytic activity of chicken uPA by mutagenesis of the active site serine residue completely ablates conversion to the two-chain uPA under conditions identical to those permissive for the generation of the active two-chain form of the wild-type enzyme. This result is consistent with and confirmatory to the preventive effects of the exogenously added uPA-specific inhibitors (Fig. 2) and strongly supports an autocatalytic mechanism of conversion.Figure 3Mutation of the active site serine to alanine in chicken uPA (ch-uPAS353A) results in abrogation of catalytic activity and in the stabilization and maintenance of single-chain ch-uPA. Wild-type chicken uPA (ch-uPAwt, lane 1) and a catalytically inactive mutant (ch-uPAS353A, lanes 2–4) expressed in the insect cell/baculoviral system under identical culture conditions are compared by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting to nitrocellulose membrane and immunostaining with a polyclonal rabbit anti-chicken uPA antibody. Lanes 3 and 4illustrate the dose-dependent conversion of the single-chain catalytically inactive mutant of chicken uPA, ch-uPAS353A, by plasmin (5 and 25 ng, respectively) with the progressive appearance of B-chain, indicative of two-chain formation. Molecular weight markers are shown on the right, and uPA forms are indicated on the left. Identical results were obtained with ch-uPAwt and ch-uPAS353Aexpressed in the NS0 cell culture system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure that the serine to alanine mutation of chicken uPA did not alter its conformation so as to make the activation site (Lys152-Ile153) inaccessible, or the entire molecule incapable of conversion, the mutant ch-uPAS353Awas treated with plasmin, the putative natural activator of uPA. Indeed, the mutant chicken uPA is converted by plasmin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) to yield a B-chain indistinguishable from that of ch-uPAwt. These data attest that the mutant is conformationally capable of being converted but remains in the single-chain form under the identical conditions that allowed for complete conversion of the wild-type chicken uPA to the two-chain form. These results also further support the absence of any distinct converting enzyme in these expression systems. If such a convertase existed, it should be, like plasmin, equally capable of converting ch-uPAS353A as it would ch-uPAwt, yet no two-chain ch-uPAS353A has ever been observed. To demonstrate that ch-uPA autoactivation could be recapitulatedin vitro, the inactive ch-uPAS353A mutant was radiolabeled and utilized as a single-chain substrate for conversion by purified active ch-uPAwt. Fig. 4 illustrates that ch-uPAwt-containing conditioned medium (lane 2) as well as 50–150 ng of purified ch-uPAwt(lanes 3 and 4) can process 1 μg of single-chain ch-uPA (lane 1) to the two-chain form (lanes 2 and 4). This result demonstrates that active ch-uPAwt has the catalytic capability and specificity to autolytically convert inactive single-chain ch-uPA to two-chain ch-uPA. In concert with the evidence for ch-uPA activation in multiple independent expression systems (Fig. 1), the inhibitory effect on conversion of an anticatalytic monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2) and that the active site mutation abrogates conversion (Fig. 3), the ability of ch-uPAwt specifically to convert ch-uPAS353Aargues strongly for an autocatalytic mechanism of conversion of ch-uPA. Finally, it appears that this plasmin-independent generation of active two-chain avian uPA is not unique to the transformed chicken fibroblast culture system. Normal avian macrophages stimulated with phorbol ester also produce active two-chain uPA in the absence of plasmin and in the presence of aprotinin (Fig. 5 A, lane 2), similar to RSVCEF (lane 1). Furthermore, a normal duck cell line, cultured as well in the absence of plasmin and in the presence of the plasmin inhibitor, also produces the active (DFP-sensitive) form of avian uPA (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the unusual occurrence of active two-chain uPA appears to be a distinct feature of the avian fibrinolytic system. This is the first description of autoactivation of a protease of the fibrinolytic cascade. There are, however, other studies that document a mechanism of autoactivation for factor VII (22Nakagi T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Neuenschwander P.F. Fiore M.M. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21489-21492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and factor XII (24Wiggins R.G. Cochrane C.C. J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 1122-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Dunn J.T. Silverberg M. Kaplan A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1779-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8215-8222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the two serine proteases that initiate the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascade, respectively. Furthermore, the initiation of the classical pathway of the complement cascade, namely activation of C1, also is an autocatalytic event (27Dodds A.W. Sim R.B. Porter R.R. Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Bianchino A.C. Poon P.H. Schumaker V.N. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3930-3936PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that activation of PA is believed to be the initiating molecular event in the fibrinolytic cascade, possibly indicating a pattern that the primary initiation of biologically significant proteolytic cascades may be an autocatalytic event. Mammalian uPA is controlled post-translationally at multiple levels, including synthesis and secretion in a stable zymogen form and tight regulation of its catalytic activity and turnover by PA-specific serpins PAI-1 and PAI-2 (29Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 30Loskutoff D.J. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 197-206Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Kruithof E.K. Baker M.S. Bunn C.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that avian uPA is capable of autoactivation, thus precluding the regulatory requirement of another protease to initiate pro-uPA activation. In addition, previous studies in our laboratory have shown that chicken uPA is resistant to inhibition by the PA-inhibiting serpins PAI-1 and PAI-2 (16Sipley J.D. Alexander D.S. Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2933-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that chicken uPA lacks the two major post-translational regulatory mechanisms that control mammalian uPA. The physiological significance of this apparent lack of regulation in the avian fibrinolytic/proteolytic system is not known, but it appears from studies on both avian embryo development and the promoter region of the uPA gene that chicken uPA is regulated spatially and temporally at the level of expression rather than post-translationally (32Valinsky J.E. Reich E. Cell. 1981; 25: 471-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Leslie N.D. Kessler C.A. Bell S.M. Degen J.L. J. Biol.

Jackson J.A. Bahr J.A. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since the existence and location of specific avian PAIs have never been reported, it is difficult to assess how the intrinsic autoactivation of avian uPA is controlled catalytically and spatially at the tissue level. In conclusion, chicken uPA constitutes an interesting natural variant of uPA that can evade most regulatory mechanisms that constrain the behavior of mammalian uPA. Identification of the structural motif(s) that dictate the autoactivating propensity of chicken uPA will not only yield mechanistic insight into the process but also will substantiate the corresponding structural motifs in human uPA that apparently stabilize the zymogen and limit pro-uPA autoactivation. This unusual uPA variant has already shed light on the activation modality of proteolytic cascades in the avian system and may continue to confer insights into the structural/functional features of serine proteases as well as on the exquisite control systems that have developed in the course of mammalian evolution."
