https://openalex.org/W1577296862,"We previously hypothesized that the genetic trait of aromatic hydrocarbon nonresponsiveness (the failure in certain inbred strains of mice of polycyclic hydrocarbons to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, and the diminished sensitivity to the more potent inducer 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is due to mutation which results in an induction receptor with a diminished affinity for the inducing compound. Following the intraperitoneal administration of [14C]TCDD (6 nmol/kg), hepatic accumulation of the radiolabel was greatest in C57BL/6J mice, intermediate in the hybrid B6D2F1/J mice, and least in DBA/2J mice, a pattern which mirrors the strain sensitivity to hydroxylase induction by TCDD (C57BL/6J greater than B6D2F1/J greater than DBA/2J). These data are compatible with receptor mutation theory and suggested that the hepatic uptake of TCDD is determined by the affinity of the receptor. In vitro experiments on the binding of [3H]TCDD to hepatic cytosol from C57BL/6J mice revealed a small pool of high affinity sites which stereospecifically and reversibly bind TCDD. The specific binding of [3H]TCDD to hepatic cytosol had an equilibrium dissociation constant KD of 0.27 nM and a maximum binding capacity of 84 fmol/mg of cytosol protein. Much less high affinity specific binding of [3H]TCDD was observed in hepatic cytosol from DBA/2J mice, but the KD was not estimated because of the limited aqueous solubility of the ligand. The binding affinity of 23 halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans for this hepatic cytosol-binding species closely correlated with the potencies of these compounds as inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. The polycyclic hydrocarbons that induce hepatic hydroxylase activity competed with [3H]TCDD for hepatic cytosol binding, but phenobarbital, pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile, and the steroid hormones had no specific binding. The data suggest that the hepatic cytosol species which binds TCDD is the receptor for the induction of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, and that the mutation in nonresponsive mice results in an altered receptor with a diminished affinity for inducing compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1996303124,"The role of heme in erythroid development is investigated in erythroleukemic (Friend) cells. Exogenous hemin induces the accumulation of globin mRNA and globin protein in T3-Cl2 erythroleukemia cells to levels comparable to those induced by polar solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The hemin concentration required for maximal induction (10−4 M) is the same as that which stimulates globin message translation in reticulocytes or cell-free reticulocyte lysates. Hemin and DMSO together cause T3-Cl2 cells to accumulate 8–9 fold more globin mRNA than either inducer individually. The kinetics of globin mRNA induction in hemin as compared to DMSO are very different: globin message accumulation begins 4 hr after hemin addition, but not until 30–40 hr after DMSO addition. Biliverdin induces 20–40 fold less hemoglobin than hemin; delta-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen do not induce."

https://openalex.org/W1495082944,"Plasma membranes, microsomes, and mitochondria were isolated from mouse fibroblast (LM) suspension cells by modification of several established procedures. Choline analogues such as N,N'-dimethylethanolamine, N-monomethylethanolamine, or ethanolamine were incorporated in vivo into phospholipids of all three cell fractions studied, but to varying degrees depending on the type of analogue used. The in vivo incorporation of these bases into membrane phospholipids produced no significant effect on the activities of seven membrane-bound enzymes: (Na+, K+)-ATPase, 5'-nucleotidase (plasma membranes); TPNH-cytochrome c reductase, glucose-6-phosphatase, inosine diphosphatase (microsomes); and succinate cytochrome c reductase (mitochondria). The incorporation of base analogues into phospholipids was accompanied by several compensatory mechanisms. (a) The quantity of both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine decreased up to 75% and 50% respectively in 3 days. (b) The molar ratio of desmosterol/phospholipid in the plasma membranes of LM cells grown in suspension culture in the presence of choline analogues decreased from 0.65 to 0.45. (c) The percentage of lysophosphatidylcholine increased over 2-fold in the phospholipid of all subcellular fractions studied. The quantity of lysophosphatidylcholine was directly proportional to the number of methyl groups on the nitrogen atom of the base analogue supplemented to the cells. This was a specific effect since the quantity of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, the other major lysophospholipid, remained unchanged. (d) The ratio of zwitterionic phospholipids to acidic phospholipids remained relatively constant in all isolated membrane fractions regardless of analogue supplementation. Neither increase in the degree of unsaturation nor shortening of fatty acid chain length was noted in response to analogue supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2035733505,"Biosynthesis and stability of the mRNA population in DMSO-induced Friend erythroleukemic cells were studied after labeling the RNA with 3H-uridine and then chasing it with nonlabeled uridine. Globin RNA metabolism was studied by hybridization to excess complementary DNA covalently coupled to oligo(dT)-cellulose. After a labeling period of 120 min, 2–4% of the poly(A)-containing labeled RNA was in globin RNA; it decayed with a half-life of 16–17 hr. The rest of the poly(A)-containing RNA was composed of two kinetic populations: 85–90% decayed with a half-life of about 3 hr, while 10% decayed with a half-life of about 37 hr. The portion of globin RNA in labeled poly(A)-containing RNA behaved in an unexpected fashion during the chase period. During the initial chase period, the percentage of globin RNA increased rapidly, reaching a maximum of about 15% at 20 hr, but if subsequently declined gradually. Based on these findings, a model was built that describes the changes in the proportion of globin mRNA in poly(A)-containing RNA during continuous synthesis and after chase of the labeled RNA. It appears that if the parameters described remain constant during the maturation of erythroblasts, then this model would not account for the almost exclusive presence of globin RNA in the reticulocyte. By far the most effective way to achieve this high level of globin RNA is the destabilization of the mRNA population which is more stable than globin RNA, and not the stabilization of globin RNA itself."

https://openalex.org/W2056373147,"Histone DNA of Psammechinus miliaris was obtained in an enriched form by buoyant density gradient centrifugation and was cleaved into 6 kb repeat units (Birnstiel et al., 1975a) by the action of the specific endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII. Since it was suspected that the 6 kb unit harbored all five histone-coding sequences, the histone DNA unit was subdivided into five segments with the aim of providing five fragments carrying just one coding sequence each. This was achieved by the combined use of EcoRI Hindll, Hindlll, and Hpa I. A physical map was constructed from the overlaps arising in these restriction experiments. Each of the five segments was shown to hybridize uniquely with just one of the five highly purified histone mRNAs (Gross et al., 1976a). By this procedure, the order of the mRNA sequences on the histone DNA was found to be a, c, d, b, e (Gross et al., 1976a), and hence of the protein coding sequences H4, H2B, H3, H2A, and H1. Further evidence is presented that the 6 kb repeat unit, amplified by means of a Murray lambda vector phage, contains AT-rich DNA sequences which would be expected not to code for histone proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1619101447,"The 95,000-dalton polypeptide in human red blood cell membranes constitutes about 25% of the membrane protein. Previous labeling studies have shown that different regions of this polypeptide are exposed to the inside and outside of the cell and have suggested a role for the protein in anion exchange across the membrane. This polypeptide has been fragmented by chymotrypsin digestion of intact red cells and by treatment of purified polypeptide with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid, hydroxylamine, and N-bromosuccinimide. The sites of cleavage by each of these reagents have been located relative to the NH-2 and COOH-terminals of the intact 95,000-dalton polypeptide. Polypeptide obtained from cells labeled with 1-isothiocyanate-4-benzene [35S]sulfonic acid (an inhibitor of anion transport), 125I and lactoperoxidase, or 32P has been similarly fragmented and these labels have been assigned to specific regions of the polypeptide. There are at least two sites of phosphorylation of the polypeptide; the major sites lies within 10,000 daltons of the NH2-terminal requiring that this portion of the polypeptide lie inside the cell. Sites of chymotrypsin cleavage and 125I and lactoperoxidase labeling are in a 7,000-dalton region toward the COOH-terminal of the polypeptide; this region must lie outside the cell. Between these two regions the polypeptide must traverse the lipid bilayer an odd number of times. 1-Isothiocyanate-4-benzenesulfonic acid also labels the protein near the site of chymotrypsin cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1534197062,"Coagulation Factor VII from bovine plasma is a glycoprotein containing a single peptide chain. The NH2-terminal sequence of Ala-Asx-Gly-Phe-Leu- is homologous with the NH2 termini of prothrombin, Factor IX, and the light chain of Factor X. Factor Xa in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipid cleaves Factor VII at an Arg-Ile bond in the sequence Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-, producing a two-chain molecule with at least 85 times the coagulant activity of single-chain Factor VII and a new NH2-terminal sequence homologous with the corresponding chains of thrombin, Factor IXa and Factor Xa. A second slower cleavage at an Arg-Gly bond destroys Factor VII activity. Bovine Factor VII, unlike prothrombin, Factor IX, and Factor X, is rapidly inhibited by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (iPr2PF). [3H]iPr2PF is readily incorporated into one-chain, two-chain, and three-chain forms of Factor VII up to ratios of approximately 0.9 moles of [3H]diisopropylphosphate per mole of protein. The radioactive peptides generated from each form of [32P]iPr2PF-inhibited Factor VII by tryptic and thermolytic digestion were found to migrate together on paper electrophoresis. This indicates that the iPr2PF is incorporated stoichiometrically into the same specific site in each form."
https://openalex.org/W1485236458,"(-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol, a potent competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist, has been previously documented to bind to the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor sites in mammalian and non-mammalian tissues. Steady state binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to sites in frog erythrocyte membranes, a model system for adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors, displays characteristics consistent with negative cooperativity among the beta-adrenergic receptors: Scatchard plots are curvilinear with upward concavity and slopes of Hill plots are consistently less than 1.0. The existence of site-site interactions of the negatively cooperative type were demonstrated directly by the ability of unlabeled (-)-alprenolol to accelerate the dissociation of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol under conditions were no rebinding of radioligand occurred. The dissociation rate of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol alone is directly related to temperature and increases with increases in temperature from 4-37 degrees. (-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol dissociation is enhanced by unlabeled (-)-alprenolol at all temperatures studied; however, at 4 degrees, the time required to observe an enhancement of radioligand dissociated is greater than the time required for unlabeled (-)-alprenolol to occupy the empty receptor sites, suggesting that increased rigidity of the biomembrane at 4 degrees may be responsible for the absence of readily observable site-site interactions. The ability of a number of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists to induce negative cooperativity among the beta-adrenergic receptors was directly related to their affinity for the receptor sites rather than their intrinsic activity in the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic system. The ability to induce site-site interactions among the beta-adrenergic receptors occurs at physiological concentrations of beta-adrenergic agents, since occupancy of less than 10% of the receptor sites is sufficient to reduce receptor affinity. Changes in pH from 6.5 to 9.0 did not significantly alter the negatively cooperative site-site interactions among the receptor sites. The negatively cooperative phenomenon was also independent of Mg2+, Ca2+, and NaF concentrations in the buffer medium. The presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog which enhances adenylate cyclase stimulation (Vmax) by beta-adrenergic agonists and decreases the concentration of agonist required to half-maximally stimulate adenylate cyclase, did not alter the ability of either agonists or antagonists to induce negatively cooperative site-site interactions among the beta-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1490068988,"Formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase in sheep liver co-purify 200-fold to yield a homogeneous preparation containing a single protein species observed on discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The synthetase and dehydrogenase activities migrate with the single protein band observed on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in two discontinuous buffer systems near pH 8. The protein sediments with a single symmetrical boundary with sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) = 8.30 S and elutes from molecular exclusion chromatography columns at a position corresponding to a diffusion coefficient (D20,w) = 3.99 X 10(-7) cm2 sec-1. Dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein intramolecularly cross-linked with dimethylsuberimidate shows one protein species of Mr = 218,000 in addition to the species of Mr = 108,500 characteristic of the unmodified protein. NH2-terminal analysis of the protein using 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) chloride in the presence of dodecyl sulfate results in the recovery of a single dansyl amino acid, alanine. The three activities are thus shown to reside in a protein composed of two apparently identical subunits, and the trivial name formyl-methenyl-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase(combined) is proposed for this enzyme to suggest the multiple catalytic activities associated with the single protein species."

https://openalex.org/W2099653432,"Rat liver mitochondria oxidized acetaldehyde (180 muM) at the rate of approximately 12 nmol/min/mg of protein at 37 degrees. This was stimulated by 88% with the addition of ADP. The ADP/O ratio (2.6) was similar to that with glutamate as substrate. 2,4-Dinitrophenol and phenazine methosulfate also stimulated the rate of acetaldehyde oxidation in the mitochondria. By contrast, acetaldehyde metabolism was virtually abolished by rotenone and antimycin A. These results indicate that acetaldehyde oxidation is linked to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and coupled with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, little acetaldehyde was metabolized when mitochondrial membranes were disrupted by sodium deoxycholate. In the disrupted mitochondria, however, acetaldehyde oxidation was fully recovered by addition of NAD+, suggesting that the ability of mitochondria to supply NAD+ controls the rate of acetaldehyde oxidation in intact mitochondria. The stimulatory effect of ADP on mitochondrial acetaldehyde oxidation was diminished by increasing the acetaldehyde concentration. Concomitantly, the ADP/O ratio decreased, suggesting an inhibitory effect of high concentrations of acetaldehyde on mitochondrial respiration. Chronic feeding of ethanol significantly reduced the capacity of intact liver mitochondria to oxidize acetaldehyde. This was associated with a significant reduction of the mitochondrial respiration. By contrast, the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase in disrupted mitochondria remained unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1588585800,"Two variant glycopeptide constituents of an hepatic membrane protein responsible for the clearance of circulating asialoglycoproteins have been isolated and characterized. Their relative abundance has been estimated to be 14 and 2 mol, respectively, per mol of intact protein. The larger component, glycopeptide I, is comprised of sialic acid, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, and aspartic acid in a molar ratio of 3:3:2:5:1. The smaller neutral fraction contains only two sugars and the molar relationship of mannose, glucosamine, and aspartic acid is 8:2:1. Based on the results of sequential digestion with specific glycosidases and periodate degradation, a carbohydrate sequence for both glycopeptides is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1488760813,"The chemistry of antigens controlled by the major histocompatibility complex of the chicken has been investigated. Peripheral blood leukocytes of five chicken strains were radioactively labeled by incorporation of tritiated amino acids, enzymatic iodination, or mild periodate oxidation followed by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride. Membrane-bound antigens were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 and purified by a two-step immunoprecipitation procedure. The resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The chicken major histocompatibility antigens (B antigens) are composed of polypeptide chains with molecular weights (in the reduced form) of 40,000 to 43,000 and 11,000 to 12,000, as deduced from their mobilities in internally calibrated gels. The larger chains, when isolated from different chicken strains, can have slightly different mobilities in such gels; thus the mobilities of the large polypeptides from strains WA and WB correspond to molecular weights of 40,000 and 43,000, respectively. Gels run under nonreducing conditions give similar results; in particular no dimers or oligomers of the larger chains are detectable, thus ruling out an immunoglobulin-like structure for the B antigens. The large chains are labeled by the periodate oxidation-reduction procedure, suggesting that they are glycoproteins (probably containing sialic acid), while the small polypeptides cannot be labeled by this method. An additional protein or proteins of apparent molecular weight about 30,000 could be precipitated from 3H-amino-acid-labeled leukocyte lysates by one particular anti-B serum. This protein(s), named B-L, differs from the B major histocompatibility antigens in that it is not associated with the small chain of molecular weight 11,000 to 12,000 and does not occur on erythrocytes. Thus, at least two protein chains are coded for (or have their synthesis controlled by) genes in the chicken major histocompatibility complex."
https://openalex.org/W1485901842,"The ts CB1200 (antimutator) mutation in bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase increases the accuracy of DNA replication since it results in a decrease in the frequency of mutations in other phage genes. The CB120 polymerases differs from the wild type enzyme in the slow rate at which it copies templates where primer extension requries displacement of polynucleotides base-paired to the template strand, even in the presence of the T4 DNA unwinding protein (gene 32-protein). The ratio of nucleotides turned over (DNA-dependent conversion of deoxynucleoside triphosphate to deoxynucleoside monophosphate) to nucleotides stably incorporated into product is 10 to 100 times higher with the mutant than wild type enzyme, depending on the DNA used as the template. This high turnover rate may increase the efficiency of removal of noncomplementary nucleotides by the antimutator enzyme and is in agreement with the findings of Muzyczka et al, (Muzyczka, N., Poland, R. L., and Bessman, M. J. (1972) J. Biol, Cehm. 247, 7116-7122) with the L141 and L42 antimutator T4 DNA polymerases. Since the 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activity of the CB120 mutant polymerase is not higher than that of the wild type enzyme, it is suggested that the high turnover rate may result from increased opportunity to remove newly incorporated nucleotides due to the slow rate at which the mutant enzyme moves to the next template nucleotide. In the accompanying paper we show that the CB120 antimutator polymerase also initially selects incorrect nucleotides for incorporation less frequently than the wild type enzyme. Thus this antimutator polymerase appears to have both greater accuracy in nucleotide selection and an enhanced ability to remove incorrect nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2039456340,"The electrophoretic separation of labeled ""9S"" histone mRNAs obtained from cleaving sea urchin polysomes was found at first to be highly unreproducible. It became evident that the secondary structure of the individual mRNAs had a greater effect on their relative electrophoretic mobilities than did their molecular weight differentials. We determined the parameters affecting electrophoretic mobility by the novel method of running the labeled polysomal RNA in slab gels across polyacrylamide and urea gradients. The initially complex and species-specific electrophoretic pattern could then, by a judicious choice of denaturing conditions, be simplified to yield five well defined classes of labeled mRNAs. Using optimal conditions for the separation of the RNA components, five messengers were isolated from Psammechinus embryos by preparative disc electrophoresis, four of which, after two electrophoretic separations, exhibited a unimodal distribution. Each of the mRNAs was translated in vitro, four of the five fractions promoting the synthesis of one major protein. The in vitro products were characterized by comparison of their electrophoretic mobilities with those of known sea urchin histones. It was thus possible to correlate individual mRNAs with specific histones. We propose that the five mRNAs designated a-e in order of decreasing electrophoretic mobility code for the histones H4, H2A, H2B, H3, and H1."
https://openalex.org/W1501149994,"The accuracy of nucleotide selection by wild type, L88 mutator, and CB120 antimutator T4 DNA polymerases has been compared by measuring both stable incorporation of complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides into polymer and the DNA-dependent conversion of deoxynucleoside triphosphate to monophosphate. The increased accuracy of the CB120 antimutator enzyme is shown by a ratio of utilization of incorrect to correct nucleotides with poly(dA)-poly(dT) as template which is only 10 to 30% of that of the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the ratio of incorrect to correct nucleotide utilized by the L88 mutator enzyme with this template was higher than that of the wild type enzyme, in agreement with the report of Hershfield (Hershfield, M.S. (1973) J. Biol, Chem. 248, 1417-1423). The antimutator, mutator, and wild type enzymes each have a much higher apparent for the noncomplementary nucleotides than for complementary nucleotides with this template. The L88 mutator polymerase has a higher Km for poly(dA)-poly(dT) than the wild type enzyme in reactions with both complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides. The antimutator polymerase has an elevated Km for polymer only for reactions with noncomplementary nucleotides. The wild type and L88 mutator enzymes also utilized both noncomplementary nucleotides much more frequently than the CB120 antimutator enzymes with poly [d(A-T)] as the template-primer. The T4 gene 32DNA unwinding protein appears to facilitate the correct reading of this template since it decreases the ratio of incorrect nucleotides utilized by both the wild type and L88 mutator polymerases."

An RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase that specifically methylates the 5'-terminal guanosine residue of RNAs ending in the dinucleoside triphosphate G(5')pppN- has been purified from the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Approximately two-thirds of the methyltransferase activity detected in an assay employing umnethylated vaccinia virus mRNA as acceptor was located in the cytoplasm when cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization; 30% of the cytoplasmic activity was associated with ribosomes but was removed by washing with 0.5 M KCl. The enzyme was purified 165-fold from the cytoplasm by removing nucleic acid by phase partition followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, denatured DNA-agarose, and CM-Sephadex. The partially purified enzyme preparation methylated heterologous tRNAs as well as vaccinia mRNA, but the tRNA methyltransferases could be separated from the mRNA activity by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The product of the partially purified enzyme using vaccinia mRNA as substrate was exclusively 7-methylguanosine located in the terminal dinucleoside triphosphate. In addition to RNAs and synthetic polyribonucleotides terminating in a dinucleoside triphosphate, free G(5')pppG could be methylated but GTP, GDP, and G(5')pppG could not. The enzyme also methylated the dinucleoside diphosphate G(5')pppG but much less efficiently than G(5')pppG.

https://openalex.org/W130300138,"Lipid peroxidation, determined by malondialdehyde formation, occurs at a low, but detectable, rate in parenchymal cells isolated from livers of fasted rats. Pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital increased malondialdehyde formation about 2-fold, probably because of the increased amount of endoplasmic reticulum. Lipid peroxidation was increased in the cells by the addition of either NADPH or CCl4, and the effect of the two agents together was more than additive. Phenobarbital pretreatment increased peroxidation due to exposure of the cells to CCl4 but not that associated with NADPH addition. The amount of CCl4 producing a 50% increase in malondialdehyde formation was about 3-fold less for cells from phenobarbital-treated rats than for those from control rats. Decreased cytochrome P450 levels in isolated hepatocytes produced by prior treatment of rats with allylisopropylacetamide enhanced lipid peroxidation from endogenous substrates but did not affect lipid peroxidation caused by the addition of NADPH. Allylisopropylacetamide markedly lowered lipid peroxidation caused by CCl4 in proportion to the loss of cytochrome P450. Malondialdehyde production associated with metabolism of endogenous substrates in the cells, or resulting from incubation of the cells with NADPH was not accompanied by changes in the fatty acid or protein content of three membranous fractions (microsomal mitochondrial, and cell debris) isolated from homogenates of these cells. Exposure of liver cells to CCl4, however, caused major losses in all fatty acids and of protein from the microsomal fraction, but only polyunsaturated fatty acids were decreased in the cellular debris fraction. Incubation with NADPH and CCl4 together enhanced malondialdehyde formation, but caused no further decrease in fatty acid content in these two fractions. Mitochondrial fatty acids were not decreased by any treatments described."
https://openalex.org/W2020986926,"Fragments of histone DNA produced by restriction endonucleases contain 5′ and 3′ termini with defined topologies relative to the histone-coding sequences. After limited resection with λ-exonuclease, the 6 kb HindIII histone DNA fragment (see Schaffner et al., 1976) hybridizes to H4 histone mRNA whether or not the DNA has been denatured. This shows that the coding sequence for the histone H4 is proximal to the 3′ terminus of the HindIII restriction fragment. By contrast, λ-exonuclease digestion of the 6 kb EcoRI histone DNA fragment drastically reduces hybridization of the H4 mRNA. Hence in this molecule, the H4 DNA sequence is near a 5′ terminus of the EcoRI restriction fragment. From these results and those described in the preceding paper (Schaffner et al., 1976), the polarity of the H4 gene is therefore 5′ H2B → H4 → H1 3′. Cloned Psammechinus histone DNA (S. G. Clarkson, H. Smith, W. Schaffner, K. Gross, and M. Birnstiel, manuscript submitted for publication) may be strand-separated by electrophoresis. Highly purified histone mRNAs (Gross et al., 1976) all hybridize almost exclusively to the strand of lesser electrophoretic mobility. It follows that all coding sequences are arranged in tandem within the same DNA strand, and that hence they share the same polarity as the H4 DNA sequences. Transcription therefore proceeds in the gene cluster in the direction H4 → H2B → H3 → H2A → H1."

The same concentration inhibited rat heart NADH-oxidase activity 69 +/- 9%. Inhibition of NADH-oxidase activity by a corresponding concentration of deoxycorticosterone was significantly less in all tissue preparations tested, ranging from 11% to 26%. The inhibition of delta9-THC appeared to be competitive and near the amytal-sensitive site of the electron transport system. Suggestive evidence was also obtained for a second site of action, above the cytochrome c site."

When retained, both interferons cannot be displaced unless ethylene glycol is included in the eluant, indicating a hydrophobic interaction. The interaction takes place under physiologic solvent conditions, thus revealing the high intrinsic hydrophobicity of both interferons."

The supernatant can be replaced by a partially purified S105 protein (SPF) and phospholipids (Tai, H., and Bloch, K. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3767). When washed microsomes are preincubated anaerobically with [14C]squalene and S105 without NADPH, followed by centrifugation and washing to remove the unbound squalene and S105, epoxidation in the presence of O2 and NADPH occurs subsequently at the same rate as in direct assays containing all required components from the start. Partially purified SPF (65-fold) shows the same effect.Washed microsomes preincubated anaerobically with squalene alone, or with bovine serum albumin instead of S105, also take up large amounts of squalene, but the squalene so incorporated is only poorly converted to epoxide. The epoxidation of endogenous squalene formed in liver homogenates from [14C]mevalonate is also stimulated by S105. The incorporation of squalene into microsomes is temperature dependent. 2,3-Oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase (cyclase) also requires S105 for optimal activity. It is suggested that the S105 protein acts internally within the microsomal membrane system facilitating the access of substrate to specific enzyme sites."

The abilities of total rough endoplasmic reticulum, polysomes released from rough endoplasmic reticulum, and free polysomes to incorporate amino acids into the intrinsic protein fraction were tested in vitro. Polysomes bound to endoplasmic reticulum has the greatest capacity to synthesize proteins of this fraction as shown by co-purification of radioactive products and by immunoprecipitation. Although the majority of the radioactive products synthesized by bound polysomes were distinct from those synthesized by free polysomes, certain radioactive products synthesized by free polysomes also co-purified with intrinsic membrane proteins. The results show no absolute segregation between free and bound polysomes in the synthesis of intrinsic membrane proteins. However, the majority of these proteins appear to be synthesized by polysomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum. Several intrinsic proteins found in plasma membranes do not appear in rough endoplasmic reticulum. To determine where these proteins were synthesized, the ability of other endomembrane components to support in vitro incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein was examined. In contrast to plasma membranes, isolated apparatus fractions did incorporate [14C]leucine to an extent greater than could be explained by contamination with rough endoplasmic reticulum. apparatus in situ and isolated from rat liver have polyribosomes associated with a zone of cytoplasm at the apparatus periphery occupied by tubules and vesicles. The polysomes are not directly attached to membranes as with rough endoplasmic reticulum and may represent a special class of Golgi polysomes. The polysomes, when associated with apparatus membranes, incorporated amino acids in vitro. The products synthesized in vitro were analyzed by treatment with KCl and deoxycholate and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Certain proteins synthesized by the apparatus-associated polysomes remained insoluble after the treatment with KCl and deoxycholate. The proteins synthesized by the apparatus fraction had mobilities similar to proteins in plasma membranes which were absent from endoplasmic reticulum, and which were relatively minor components of apparatus..."
https://openalex.org/W2132888663,"The stimulatory effect of starvation on omega oxidation of stearate by the 20,000 X g supernatant fluid of rat liver homogenates was studied. The effect was obtained after starvation for 24 hours. Starvation for longer times did not further increase omega oxidation. The stimulatory effect of starvation on omega oxidation of stearic acid was accompanied by a reduced incorporation of stearic acid into phosphatidic acid, diglycerides, and triglycerides. Substitution of the 100,000 X g supernatant fluid from liver homogenate of starved rats with 100,000 X g supernatant fluid from liver homogenates of control rats reduced the microsomal omega oxidation of stearic acid with a simultaneous increase in incorporation of stearic acid into the different glycerides. Under the latter conditions almost no free stearic acid could be isolated from the incubation mixture after the incubation. Of three different soluble factors necessary for glyceride formation, ATP appeared to be the most important from a regulatory point of view. Thus the soluble fraction of liver homogenate from a starved rat was shown to contain suboptimal concentrations of ATP. Addition of physiological amounts of ATP to the 20,000 X g supernatant fluid of homogenate of liver of starved rats had the same effect as addition of 100, 000 X g supernatant fluid from liver homogenate of control rats, i.e. decrease in omega oxidation and increase in formation of glycerides. Addition of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and CoA-SH in amounts optimal for glyceride formation to the 20,000 X g supernatant fluid of liver homogenate of starved rats had only small effects on omega oxidation and glyceride formation. The results are consistent with a competition for free fatty acids between the acyl-CoA synthetases involved in biosynthesis of glycerides and the microsomal hydroxylase(s) involved in omega oxidation of fatty acids. The concentration of ATP in the soluble fraction is of importance in this competition. The possibility is discussed that this competition is of importance also under in vivo conditions and that a decreased rate of esterification in the starved state is responsible for the higher excretion of omega-oxidized fatty acids in urine in the ketotic state."

https://openalex.org/W2089191559,"Nuclear RNA from immature duck erythrocytes was fractionated into polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated fractions, and globin mRNA sequences were determined by hybridization to DNA complementary to globin mRNA. 80--90% of labeled nuclear RNA is found to be nonpolyadenylated, and 70--80% of the globin mRNA sequences present in the nucleus are found in nonpolyadenylated molecules. These data suggest that polyadenylation does not specifically select for globin mRNA sequences. The nonpolyadenylated globin mRNA sequences present in the nucleus are found mostly in molecules of small size, close to the size of polyribosomal globin mRNA, suggesting that polyadenylation is a later event in globin mRNA formation."
https://openalex.org/W3119406062,"Ribosomes of physiologically nondividing human peripheral blood lymphocytes were studied by ultraviolet absorbance measurements of cytoplasmic extracts subjected to ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients at high and low ionic strength. At least 70% of the total cytoplasmic ribosomes were free ribosomes which sedimented at 80 S in low salt and dissociated to 40 S and 60 S subunits in high salt. These particles were not involved in protein synthesis. The remaining ribosomes were equally divided among native subunits, active monosomes, and larger polysomes. Free ribosomes were shown to exist as 80 S particles in the intact cell, and labeling studies indicated that they did not freely return to the pools of protein-synthesizing components. New ribosomes appeared first as native subunits and in polysomes. After a lag of 15 to 20 min, the particles began to enter the free ribosome pool. Thus, free ribosomes arise in the resting cell by a unidirectional flow which continuously removes particles from the protein-synthesizing pool and sequesters them as an accumulation of inactive 80 S particles. The transition from native subunits to free ribosomes is accompanied by functional changes in association behavior of subunits and by alteration of sedimentation behavior of the subunits. These changes may be due to absence of a protein or proteins from the free ribosomes which is required to permit effective dissociation of subunits prior to initiation of translation. Deficiency of this dissociation factor may be responsible for the continuous formation of free ribosomes in resting cells. Our data also suggest a limitation of the rate of initiation of protein synthesis which may result from deficiency of an initiation factor."
https://openalex.org/W2053987134,"Direct evidence is provided for the formation of hybrid DNA during mitotic recombination in CHO cells. The cells were labeled for one round of replication in medium containing BUdR, so that the density of the DNA was heavy light (HL) and then returned to light medium. Further DNA synthesis, during either repair or chromosome replication, can only result in HL or fully light (LL) DNA; however, the formation of hybrid DNA as part of the process of recombinational repair will produce some fully heavy (HH) DNA. A small fraction of DNA containing regions of HH DNA has been detected on neutral CsC1 gradients, and the amount of this DNA is increased by treatment of the cells with mitomycin C. Increasing doses of mitomycin C produce smimlar increases in both the amount of HH DNA and the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges measured cytologically. This correlation provides evidence that the HH DNA is hybrid DNA, formed as an intermediate in recombinational repair."

https://openalex.org/W207071940,"The regultion of cardiac delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity was studied in rat heart homogenates. Optimal conditions were determined for the measurement of delta-aminolevulinic acid and an appropriate assay was established for the heart. The activity of cardiac delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase was determined in rats either fed ad libitum or starved for 24 or 48 h. Marked decreases in delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity were observed in homogenates or mitochondrial fractions prepared from hearts of fasted animals and an explanation for previous findings that the enzyme is undetectable in heart tissue is provided. Dexamethasone treatment was effective in reversing the decreases brought about by fasting but had no effect on the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity in heart homogenates from fed rats. ACTH treatment had no effect in fed or starved rats. Decreases in delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity induced by fasting were not reversed in homogenates or mitochondrial preparations by succinyl-CoA-generating systems or when alpha-ketoglutarate was substituted for succinate in homogenate preparations. Cardiac delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase levels are not altered by fasting. Agents such as allylisopropylacetamide or 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine, which produce marked increases in hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity, have no effects on the activity of this enzyme in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1532669991,"Rat brain postnuclear preparations catalyzed the alpha-hydroxylation of nervonic acid with an apparent Km of 3 muM. Evidence has been presented which suggests that nervonic acid in the brain is hydroxylated by the same enzyme system which hydroxylates lignoceric acid. The hydroxylase activity in brains of normal (euthyroid) rats increased rapidly from a low in the period immediately following birth to a maximum at the 23rd day and then declined to a low level characteristic of the mature brain. Neonatal hypothyroidism retarded the development of the activity and shifted its peak to the 39th day after birth. Conversely, neonatal hyperthyroidism accelerated the entire developmental pattern and shifted the peak to the 16th day after birth. The hydroxylase activity in mouse brain was also increased by thyroid hormone administration from the 13th through the 18th day after birth. Unlike normal mice, the low activity in jimpy mice was not affected by this treatment. It is concluded that thyroid hormones play an important role in the control of brain fatty acid alpha-hydroxylation. The stimulation of alpha-hydroxy fatty acid synthesis in response to hyperthyroidism during the early postnatal period may be one of the major effects of thyroid hormones in accelerating myelination of the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1525190192,"Phage c341 was shown to cleave off 14C-acetyl groups from a 14C-acetylated polysaccharide, prepared by the enzymatic acetylation of alkali-treated Salmonella anatum O-polysaccharide catalyzed by a membrane fraction from S. anatum (O-10 transacetylase). No deacetylation reaction was detected if the substate was prepared from alkali-treated O-polysaccharide of Salmonella newington. The structural difference of these O-polysaccharides is the anomeric configuration of the linkage between the common mannosyl-rhamnosyl-galactose repeating units. A soluble protein obtained from phage c341 lysate, which has previously been identified as the free form of the baseplate parts of this phage, showed the deacetylase activity, a result indicating that the baseplate is responsible for the enzymatic activity of the phage particles. These results suggest that as in the case of other Salmonella phages such as epsilon15, epsilon34, and P22 that contain glycosidases as baseplates, the baseplate deacetylase of c341 plays a role for phage adsorption through the formation of enzyme-substrate type complexes with the receptor O-polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1500030271,"A recent study by Hokin-Neaverson, M., Sadeghian, K., Majumder, A.L., and Eisenberg, F. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 67, 1537-1544, demonstrates that free myo-inositol in the pancreas is significantly increased during intense cholinergic stimulation of secretion. Incubation of rat pancreatic tissue in medium with 100 mM myo-inositol increases 10-fold the endogenous content of free myo-inositol and elicits a prompt and sustained 50% increase in the rate of release of amylase activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that the electrophoretic pattern of the protein mixture released in the presence of 100 mM myo-inositol is the same as that of the secretory output released in the presence of 10 muM carbamylcholine. Microscopic examination of tissue pieces indicates that there is no significant decrease in zymogen granule content of the pancreatic acinar cells during incubation in medium with 100 mM myo-inositol. Jamieson, J.D., and Palade, G.E. (1967) J. Cell Biol. 34, 597-615, have shown that pulse-labeled secretory proteins in guinea pig pancreas first appear in zymogen granules 1 hour postpulse, becoming maximally accumulated in these storage sites by 2 hours postpulse. myo-Inositol (100 mM) stimulates release of pulse-labeled secretory proteins only if incubation in medium with 100 mM myo-inositol is initiated anytime during the first 80 min postpulse. The findings thus indicate that a high uptake of myo-inositol by rat pancreatic tissue in vitro selectively stimulates the release of just those secretory proteins being packaged in newly forming zymogen granules."
https://openalex.org/W1517615193,"The beta subunits of hemoglobin S showed a higher ellipticity than the beta subunits of the hemoglobin A, both in the Soret and near-ultraviolet regions. The apoderivatives of the beta subunits of hemoglobin S showed a lower helical content and a larger amount of beta conformation than the apoderivatives of the beta subunits of hemoglobin A. The beta(1-55) peptides and beta(1-30) peptides from the beta subunits of hemoglobin A and S have been separated and analyzed. The betaS(1-55) peptide showed a higher content of beta conformation and lower amount of alpha helix when compared to the betaA(1-55) peptide. This difference was present also in different concentrations of methanol. The apoderivative from the beta subunits of hemoglobin S and the betaS(1-55) peptide aggregated with increasing ionic strength. The CD measurement showed that their secondary structure did not change upon a 10-fold dilution of the sample. Very little secondary structure was present in the betaS(1-30) peptide, and the CD spectrum was very similar to that of the betaA(1-30) peptide. No significant difference in aggregation was found between the betaS(1-30) and betaA(1-30) peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2226864376,"DNA-dependent RNA polymerases of immature and castrated rat uteri were studied after estradiol administration. The enzymes were solubilized from either whole uterus homogenate or nuclei and their activities were measured on an exogenous DNA template. alpha-Amanitin was used to distinguish alpha-amanitin-resistant from alpha-amanitin-senitive forms of the enzyme. The number of alpha-amanitin-sensitive RNA polymerase molecules was measured by a binding assay using labeled amanitin. In the first series of experiments RNA polymerases were solubilized from whole uterus homogenate. alpha-Amanitin-sensitive and -resistant activities were constant during the first 6 hours after estradiol treatment, followed by a late and moderate increase in their activities (50% at 12 hours for the resistant form and 40% at 24 hours for the sensitive form). The number of sensitive polymerase molecules evolved in an identical manner to its activity (+40% at 24 hours), suggesting that the increase in activity is due to the synthesis of new enzyme molecules. For both forms, no diffusible stimulatory factor was detected in the uterus of hormone-treated animals. In the second series of experiments, disrupted nuclei were washed with 0.15 M (NH4)2SO4 in order to release only enzyme molecules which were not firmly bound to DNA in a transcription complex. The amount of the sensitive form of polymerase which remains firmly bound to chromatin, was constant for 6 hours after estradiol administration and was doubled by 24 hours. The firmly bound alpha-amanitin-resistant activity was solubilized and was measured in the presence of an exogenous template. There was a progressive increase in activity first detectable in 1 to 2 hours, amounting to 50% at 6 hours and 100% at 24 hours. The reported results show that during the first 6 hours of hormone treatment: (a) the total content of RNA polymerases remains unchanged in the uterus; (b) the number of alpha-amanitin resistant molecules tightly bound to DNA increases progressively while the alpha-amanitin sensitive remains constant. At a later time (24 hours), an increase is observed both for the total amount of enzymes and for their fraction engaged in a transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W2169420793,"Glutaminase-asparaginase from Pseudomonas 7A appears to have four subunits with a molecular weight of 36,000 +/- 500 by sedimentation equilibrium in 5.9 M guanidine HCl and 34,000 by amino acid analysis. Analytic sedimentation equilibrium of the native enzyme showed a molecular weight of 140,000 +/- 3,300 with no signs of association or dissociation. Moving boundary and zone sedimentation in buffer showed normal behavior with sedimentation coefficients of 7.92 and 7.75 S, respectively. In contrast, the enzyme appeared to polymerize during zone sedimentation when the initial protein concentration was greater than 1 mg/ml and the buffer contained asparagine, glutamine, or 5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline. An extension of our method for active enzyme sedimentation is described which utilizes the changes in absorption during hydrolysis of asparagine by low concentrations of enzyme. Polymerization was not seen under these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1546048586,"A series of pyridine derivatives was chosen on the basis of structural similarity to glucose and to the hydrogen bonding capacity of this sugar. These compounds were found to reversibly inhibit glucose transport in a systematic fashion. The inhibition data can be rationalized by assuming that both competitive and noncompetitive binding sites exist on the cell membrane. The competitive site appears to have a much lower dissociation constant than the noncompetitive site for most derivatives. The effects of changes in substituents on the pyridine ring closely match, both in ring position and in the magnitude of the change in binding constant, those reported for derivatives of glucose. The stimulation of fluorodinitrobenzene inactivation of glucose transport by 2-amino-5-chloropyridine is in accord with this analysis. The strongest inhibitors bind about 100-fold more tightly than glucose itself. This series of pyridine compounds would appear to present a useful starting point for the development of site-specific irreversible inhibitors."
