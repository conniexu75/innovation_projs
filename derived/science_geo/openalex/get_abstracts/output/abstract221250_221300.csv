https://openalex.org/W1969644422,"A major challenge of computational protein design is the creation of novel proteins with arbitrarily chosen three-dimensional structures. Here, we used a general computational strategy that iterates between sequence design and structure prediction to design a 93-residue α/β protein called Top7 with a novel sequence and topology. Top7 was found experimentally to be folded and extremely stable, and the x-ray crystal structure of Top7 is similar (root mean square deviation equals 1.2 angstroms) to the design model. The ability to design a new protein fold makes possible the exploration of the large regions of the protein universe not yet observed in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1988714210,"Complete genomic sequences from diverse phylogenetic lineages reveal notable increases in genome complexity from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes. The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies."

We used real-time analysis of gene expression to show synchronized rhythms of clock gene transcription across hundreds of neurons within the mammalian SCN in organotypic slice culture. Differentially phased neuronal clocks are topographically arranged across the SCN. A protein synthesis inhibitor set all cell clocks to the same initial phase and, after withdrawal, intrinsic interactions among cell clocks reestablished the stable program of gene expression across the assemblage. Na+-dependent action potentials contributed to establishing cellular synchrony and maintaining spontaneous oscillation across the SCN."

Real-time observations showed the loss of long-range order that was present in the crystalline phase and the emergence of the liquid structure where only short-range atomic correlations were present; this transition occurred in 3.5picoseconds for thin-film aluminum with an excitation fluence of 70 millijoules per square centimeter. The sensitivity and time resolution were sufficient to capture the time-dependent pair correlation function as the system evolved from the solid to the liquid state. These observations provide an atomic-level description of the melting process, in which the dynamics are best understood as a thermal phase transition under strongly driven conditions."

However, the advancement of carbon nanotube–based electronics requires assembly strategies that allow their precise localization and interconnection. Using a scheme based on recognition between molecular building blocks, we report the realization of a self-assembled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor operating at room temperature. A DNA scaffold molecule provides the address for precise localization of a semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotube as well as the template for the extended metallic wires contacting it."
https://openalex.org/W2075089971,"The development of strategies for addressing arrays of nanoscale devices is central to the implementation of integrated nanosystems such as biological sensor arrays and nanocomputers. We report a general approach for addressing based on molecular-level modification of crossed semiconductor nanowire field-effect transistor (cNW-FET) arrays, where selective chemical modification of cross points in the arrays enables NW inputs to turn specific FET array elements on and off. The chemically modified cNW-FET arrays function as decoder circuits, exhibit gain, and allow multiplexing and demultiplexing of information. These results provide a step toward the realization of addressable integrated nanosystems in which signals are restored at the nanoscale."
https://openalex.org/W2081460107,"Herpes simplex virus, a DNA virus of high complexity, consists of a nucleocapsid surrounded by the tegument—a protein compartment—and the envelope. The latter components, essential for infectivity, are pleiomorphic. Visualized in cryo–electron tomograms of isolated virions, the tegument was seen to form an asymmetric cap: On one side, the capsid closely approached the envelope; on the other side, they were separated by ∼35 nanometers of tegument. The tegument substructure was particulate, with some short actin-like filaments. The envelope contained 600 to 750 glycoprotein spikes that varied in length, spacing, and in the angles at which they emerge from the membrane. Their distribution was nonrandom, suggesting functional clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2091601313,"The Arabidopsis FWA gene was initially identified from late-flowering epigenetic mutants that show ectopic FWA expression associated with heritable hypomethylation of repeats around transcription starting sites. Here, we show that wild-type FWA displays imprinted (maternal origin-specific) expression in endosperm. The FWA imprint depends on the maintenance DNA methyltransferase MET1, as is the case in mammals. Unlike mammals, however, the FWA imprint is not established by allele-specific de novo methylation. It is established by maternal gametophyte-specific gene activation, which depends on a DNA glycosylase gene, DEMETER. Because endosperm does not contribute to the next generation, the activated FWA gene need not be silenced again. Double fertilization enables plants to use such ""one-way"" control of imprinting and DNA methylation in endosperm."

Extrapolation of present trends implies expansion of bottom fisheries into deeper waters, serious impact on biodiversity, and declining global catches, the last possibly aggravated by fuel cost increases. Examination of four scenarios, covering various societal development choices, suggests that the negative trends now besetting fisheries can be turned around, and their supporting ecosystems rebuilt, at least partly."
https://openalex.org/W2170656610,"Estimates of forest net primary production (NPP) demand accurate estimates of root production and turnover. We assessed root turnover with the use of an isotope tracer in two forest free-air carbon dioxide enrichment experiments. Growth at elevated carbon dioxide did not accelerate root turnover in either the pine or the hardwood forest. Turnover of fine root carbon varied from 1.2 to 9 years, depending on root diameter and dominant tree species. These long turnover times suggest that root production and turnover in forests have been overestimated and that sequestration of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon in forest soils may be lower than currently estimated."
https://openalex.org/W2110993458,"Calcium ion (Ca2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is important for the regulation of vascular tone. Activation of L-type Ca2+ channels initiates muscle contraction; however, the role of T-type Ca2+ channels (T-channels) is not clear. We show that mice deficient in the alpha1H T-type Ca2+ channel (alpha(1)3.2-null) have constitutively constricted coronary arterioles and focal myocardial fibrosis. Coronary arteries isolated from alpha(1)3.2-null arteries showed normal contractile responses, but reduced relaxation in response to acetylcholine and nitroprusside. Furthermore, acute blockade of T-channels with Ni2+ prevented relaxation of wild-type coronary arteries. Thus, Ca2+ influx through alpha1H T-type Ca2+ channels is essential for normal relaxation of coronary arteries."

https://openalex.org/W2086048722,"Three distinct classes of drugs: dopaminergic agonists (such as D-amphetamine), serotonergic agonists (such as LSD), and glutamatergic antagonists (such as PCP) all induce psychotomimetic states in experimental animals that closely resemble schizophrenia symptoms in humans. Here we implicate a common signaling pathway in mediating these effects. In this pathway, dopamine- and an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated phospho-protein of 32 kilodaltons (DARPP-32) is phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at three sites, in a pattern predicted to cause a synergistic inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 and concomitant regulation of its downstream effector proteins glycogen synthesis kinase-3 (GSK-3), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and c-Fos. In mice with a genetic deletion of DARPP-32 or with point mutations in phosphorylation sites of DARPP-32, the effects of D-amphetamine, LSD, and PCP on two behavioral parameters-sensorimotor gating and repetitive movements-were strongly attenuated."
https://openalex.org/W2055977185,"Early transfer RNA (tRNA) processing events in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are coordinated in the nucleolus, the site normally associated with ribosome biosynthesis. To test whether spatial organization of the tRNA pathway begins with nucleolar clustering of the genes, we have probed the subnuclear location of five different tRNA gene families. The results show that tRNA genes, though dispersed in the linear genome, colocalize with 5 S ribosomal DNA and U14 small nucleolar RNA at the nucleolus. Nucleolar localization requires tRNA gene transcription-complex formation, because inactivation of the promoter at a single locus removes its nucleolar association. This organization of tRNA genes must profoundly affect the spatial packaging of the genome and raises the question of whether gene types might be coordinated in three dimensions to regulate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2045626430,"Vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1), a capsaicin receptor, is known to play a major role in mediating inflammatory thermal nociception. Although the physiological role and biophysical properties of VR1 are known, the mechanism of its activation by ligands is poorly understood. Here we show that VR1 must be phosphorylated by Ca2+-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) before its activation by capsaicin. In contrast, the dephosphorylation of VR1 by calcineurin leads to a desensitization of the receptor. Moreover, point mutations in VR1 at two putative consensus sites for CaMKII failed to elicit capsaicin-sensitive currents and caused a concomitant reduction in VR1 phosphorylation in vivo. Such mutants also lost their high affinity binding with [3H]resiniferatoxin, a potent capsaicin receptor agonist. We conclude that the dynamic balance between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the VR1 channel by CaMKII and calcineurin, respectively, controls the activation/desensitization states by regulating VR1 binding. Furthermore, because sensitization by protein kinase A and C converge at these sites, phosphorylation stress in the cell appears to control a wide range of excitabilities in response to various adverse stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2167411243,"The CHOP gene is transcriptionally induced by amino acid starvation. We have previously identified a genomic cis-acting element (amino acid response element (AARE)) involved in the transcriptional activation of the human CHOP gene by leucine starvation and shown that it binds the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). The present study was designed to identify other transcription factors capable of binding to the CHOP AARE and to establish their role with regard to induction of the gene by amino acid deprivation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transient transfection experiments show that several transcription factors that belong to the C/EBP or ATF families bind the AARE sequence and activate transcription. Among all these transcription factors, only ATF4 and ATF2 are involved in the amino acid control of CHOP expression. We show that inhibition of ATF2 or ATF4 expression impairs the transcriptional activation of CHOP by amino acid starvation. The transacting capacity of ATF4 depends on its expression level and that of ATF2 on its phosphorylation state. In response to leucine starvation, ATF4 expression and ATF2 phosphorylation are increased. However, induction of ATF4 expression by the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway does not fully activate the AARE-dependent transcription. Taken together our results demonstrate that at least two pathways, one leading to ATF4 induction and one leading to ATF2 phosphorylation, are necessary to induce CHOP expression by amino acid starvation. This work was extended to the regulation of other amino acid regulated genes and suggests that ATF4 and ATF2 are key components of the amino acid control of gene expression.

All cells regulate gene expression in response to changes in the external environment such as nutrients availability. In mammals, plasma concentrations of nutrients are markedly affected by dietary or pathological conditions. The concentration of amino acids in the plasma is particularly sensitive to the nutritional state, with levels falling severalfold in cases of malnutrition. This may occur in response to a global limitation in protein intake or in response to specific limitations in essential amino acids (1Young V.R. El-Khoury A.E. Melchor S. Castillo L.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and overexpression of dominant negative mutants show that activation of the AS gene by amino acid limitation involves ATF-4 and C/EBPβ binding to the NSRE-1 site (11Siu F.

The CHOP gene encodes a nuclear protein related to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors (13Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Members of the C/EBP family have been implicated in the regulation of processes relevant to energy metabolism, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and expression of cell-type-specific genes (14McKnight S.L.

CHOP is induced by a wide variety of stresses and agents (16Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5-10PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sylvester S.L. ap Rhys C.M. Luethy-Martindale J.D.

Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The regulation of CHOP mRNA expression by amino acid concentration has both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components (19Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). An amino acid response element (AARE) was discovered between nucleotides –313 and –295 in the CHOP promoter. This element is sufficient to confer amino acid responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. The minimum core sequence (5′-ATTGCATCA-3′) is related to C/EBP and ATF/CRE binding sites and was described to bind in vitro the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in starved and non-starved conditions. Using ATF2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the expression of ATF2 was shown to be essential for the transcriptional activation of CHOP by leucine starvation (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both CHOP and AS are also induced to high level during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, itself presumably mediated by the accumulation of malfolded proteins (18Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The CHOP promoter contains an ER stress response element (ERSE; nt –93 to –75), distinct from the AARE site, that mediates the activation by ER stress (21Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), whereas NSRE1 and NSRE2 of the AS gene are involved in the response to both amino acid starvation and ER stress (10Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

To understand the individual steps required in the cellular response to amino acid limitation, our objective is to progress backwards up the signal transduction pathway from the amino acid response elements. The first step to achieve this goal is to identify transcription factors capable of binding to the AARE of the CHOP promoter and to establish their role with regard to induction of the gene by amino acid deprivation. Evidence is given here that several transcription factors that belong to the C/EBP or ATF families can bind the AARE sequence and activate the AARE-dependent transcription. However, only ATF4 and ATF2 are directly involved in the amino acid regulation of CHOP expression. Our results demonstrate that at least two pathways, one leading to ATF4 induction and one leading to ATF2 phosphorylation, are necessary to induce CHOP expression by amino acid starvation. This work was extended to the regulation of other amino acid-regulated genes and suggests that ATF4 and ATF2 are key components of the amino acid control of gene expression. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When indicated, DMEM/F-12 lacking leucine was used. In all experiments involving amino acid starvation, dialyzed calf serum was used. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in ATF2 were kindly given by Dr. A. Reimold (University of Texas, Dallas). DNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (19Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of luciferase plasmid was transfected into the cells along with 0.1 μg of pCMV-βGal, a plasmid carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene fused to the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region, as an internal control. In the experiments using cDNA expression plasmid, a mixture containing 1 μg of luciferase plasmid, 1 μg of cDNA expression plasmid, and 0.05 μg of pCMV-βGal was transfected. In the control assay, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 2 μg by addition of the plasmid lacking the cDNA to be expressed. Cells were then exposed to the precipitate for 16 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with DMEM/F-12 containing 10% calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were leucine-starved for 16 h then harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min. 20 μl of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity (PRODEMAT, Anduze, France). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (22Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was given as the ratio of relative luciferase unit/relative β-galactosidase unit. All values are the means calculated from the results of at least three independent experiments. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were from MWG-BIOTECH (Ebersberg, Germany). When double-stranded oligonucleotides were required, equal numbers of moles of complementary strands were heated to 90 °C for 1 min and annealed by slow cooling to room temperature. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis, 2 μg of specific antibody was added to the incubation mixture at room temperature 1 h prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Each mobility shift experiment was repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of the results. The sequences of the probes were: CHOP-AARE (5′-aacattgcatcatccccgc-3′), ATF binding site (5′-atccggtgacgtcacggggg-3′) (23Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1132-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and C/EBP binding site (5′-tgcagattgcgcaatctgca-3′) (24Shuman J.D. Cheong J. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12793-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—TATATK-LUC containing the minimum herpes simplex virus promoter for thymidine kinase (–40 to +50) was generated as previously described (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 1X CHOPAARE-TK-LUC plasmid was constructed by inserting SstI-XhoI double strand oligonucleotides containing one copy of the CHOP AARE sequence into TK-LUC plasmid. Mutation series in the CHOP AARE sequence were made by inserting SstI-XhoI double strand mutated sequences into the TATATK-LUC plasmid. pCHOP-LUC (–954 to +91) was generated as previously described (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All the luciferase plasmid constructs were sequenced before utilization using the ABI PRISM Bigdye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit and the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression plasmids for ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, ATF7, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and C/EBPγ were generously provided by Drs. S. Ishii (Riken, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Japan), T. Hai (Ohio State University), B. Chatton (UM7100, ESBS, Illkirch, France), U. Schibler (Université de Genève, Swisserland), I. Lassot (Institut Cochin, Paris, France), and M. Li-weber (Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). For each expression plasmid, a control plasmid was constructed by removing the cDNA. Analysis of Gene Expression Using Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using a RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I, Amp Grade (Invitrogen) prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA integrity was electrophoretically verified by ethidium bromide staining. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with 100 units of Superscript II plus RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 100 μm random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for human sequences (used in HeLa cell): CHOP (forward primer, 5′-cagaaccagcagaggtcaca-3′; reverse primer, 5′-agctgtgccactttcctttc-3′), AS (forward primer, 5′-atcactgtcgggatgtaccc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cttcaacagagtggcagcaa-3′), ATF2 (forward primer, 5′-accatggtgcctagtgttcc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gtggctggctgttgtaatga-3′), ATF3 (forward primer, 5′-gccattggagagctgtcttc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gggccatctggaacataaga-3′), ATF7 (forward primer, 5′-ggatgagaaaaaggctgctg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gacgtacaatggtgggtgtg-3′), C/EBPβ (forward primer, 5′-ctcgcaggtcaagagcaag-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gacagctgctccaccttctt-3′), C/EBP8 (forward primer, 5′-ccgacctctttcaacagcaa-3′; reverse primer, 5′-caagctcaccacggtctgt-3′), SLC1A5 (forward primer, 5′-aagatcgtggagatggaggat-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gaactggaagaggtcccaaag-3′), SARS (forward primer, 5′-gaggacctgcccatcaagta-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tagaactcctctgcggtggt-3′), YARS (forward primer, 5′-gatcggaaggaggatgtgaa-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ttttccaggtccacgtaagc-3′), 4EBP1 (forward primer, 5′-tatgaccggaaattcctgatg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ccatctcaaactgtgactcttca-3′), and 4F2 (forward primer, 5′-tcttgattgcggggactaac-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gccttgcctgagacaaactc-3′). Primers for mouse sequences (used in ATF2–/– and ATF2+/+ cells): CHOP (forward primer, 5′-cctagcttggctgacagagg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ctgctccttctccttcatgc-3′), AS (forward primer, 5′-tacaaccacaaggcgctaca-3′; reverse primer, 5′-aagggcctgactccataggt-3′), ATF3 (forward primer, 5′-cgccatccagaataaacacc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gcaggcactctgtcttctcc-3′), SLC1A5 (forward primer, 5′-tgctttcgggacctcttct-3′; reverse primer, 5′-cccgtttagttgtgcgatg-3′), SARS (forward primer, 5′-tcgatgacctcactgcagac-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ctttgttgtctgcgtcctca-3′), YARS (forward primer, 5′-ctgggttaactgggagcaaa-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tccaccccacttctcatctc-3′), 4EBP1 (forward primer, 5′-aactcacctgtggccaaaac-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ccatctcaaactgtgactcttca-3′), and 4F2 (forward primer, 5′-ttttggacctcactcccaac-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ctgccactcagccaagtaca-3′) were used and yielded PCR products 200 bp in size. To normalize for mRNA content, β-actin mRNA was also amplified: primers for the human β-actin sequence (forward primer, 5′-tccctggagaagagctacga-3′; reverse primer, 5′-agcactgtgttggcgtacag-3′) and primers for mouse β-actin sequence (forward primer, 5′-tacagcttcaccaccacagc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-aaggaaggctggaaaagagc-3′). Quantification involved the use of standard curves that had been prepared with plasmids containing specific sequences of each gene. We cloned the PCR products of the studied genes and β actin into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the construction of standard curves pGEM-T easy plasmids containing the amplified sequence were prepared as 10-fold serial dilution in water, from 4 ng to 0.4 pg. PCR was carried out using a LightCycler™ System (Roche Applied Science), which allows amplification and detection (by fluorescence) in the same tube, using a kinetic approach. For LightCycler PCR reactions, a mastermix of the following reaction components was prepared to the indicated end concentration: 10.4 μl of water, 1.6 μl of MgCl2 (3 mm), 1 μl of forward primer (0.5 μm), 1 μl of reverse primer (0.5 μm), and 2 μl of LightCycler-Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). LightCycler mastermix (16 μl) was filled in the LightCycler glass capillaries, and 4 μl of cDNA (2 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA) was added as PCR template. Capillaries were closed, centrifuged, and placed into the LightCycler rotor. The following LightCycler experimental run protocol was used: denaturation program (95 °C for 10 min), amplification and quantification program repeated 45 times (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 8 s with a single fluorescence measurement), melting curve program (69–95 °C with a heating rate of 0.1 °C per second and a continuous fluorescence measurement), and finally a cooling step to 40 °C. A negative control without cDNA template was run with every assay to assess the overall specificity. Light-Cycler quantification software (version 3.5) was used to compare amplification in experimental samples during the log-linear phase to the standard curve from the dilution series of control plasmids. Relative results were displayed in nanograms of CHOP or AS per 100 ng of β-actin. Each experiment was repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of the results. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—siRNA corresponding to ATF4 (5′-gcguaguucgcuaaggugadTdT-3′ and 5′-ucaccuuagcgaacuacgcdTdT-3′) and ATF3 (5′-gcaccucugccaccggaugdTdT-3′ and 5′-cauccgguggcagaggugcdTdT-3′) mRNA were designed as recommended (25Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 26Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). An siRNA corresponding to ATF4 siRNA but mutated on three nucleotides (5′-gcguaguuagcuaaggugadTdT-3′ and 5′-ucaccuuagcgaacuacgcdTdT-3′) was used as a negative control. Each pair has a 3′ overhang of 2 nucleotides on each side. Designed RNA oligonucleotides were blasted against the GenBank™/EMBL data base to ensure gene specificity. They were obtained from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Annealing was performed as described by Elbashir (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar): the complementary two strands (each 20 μm) in 200 μl of annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate; 30 mm HEPES/KOH, pH7.4; 2 mm magnesium acetate) were heated for 1 min at 90 °C and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. One day before transfection with siRNA, HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates at 25% confluency. Then, 2 μg of siRNA was introduced into the cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation as described above. The next day, cells were trypsinized and plated in 12-well plates. Transfection with reporter vectors was carried out 2 days after the siRNA transfection using calcium phosphate precipitation. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 nm acid okadaic, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma), then proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a solution of 5% nonfat milk powder in TN (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The blots were then incubated with antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were washed four times in TN containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) Cell-Signaling Technology (7074#) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes, the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Antibody 9221#S against Phospho-ATF2 Thr-71 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (respectively, 243X, 6233X, 188X, 200X, 61X, 7962X, and 151X). Anti-ATF7 and C/EBPγ antibodies were kindly given by Drs. B. Chatton (UM7100, ESBS, Illkirch, France), K. Calame (Columbia University, New York, NY), and P. Johnson (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). Transcription Factors That Belong to the C/EBP and ATF Families Bind the CHOP AARE Sequence in Vitro—We previously identified a cis-acting element (AARE) involved in the transcriptional activation of the human CHOP gene by leucine starvation and showed that it binds the activating transcription factor2 (ATF2). Computer analysis showed that other transcription factors that belong to the ATF family (ATF1, ATF3, ATF4, and ATF7) can potentially bind the AARE sequence together with members of the C/EBP family (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, and C/EBPδ). To determine whether these transcription factors exhibit affinity for the CHOP AARE sequence, we performed EMSA in the presence of specific antibodies recognizing the ATF and C/EBP proteins (Fig. 1). A radiolabeled AARE oligonucleotide from –313 to –295 of the human CHOP proximal promoter was used as a probe. Experiments were performed using nuclear extracts from non-starved and 8-h-starved cells. As previously described (20Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A.M. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a major specific DNA-protein complex is detected after incubation of starved and non-starved HeLa nuclear extracts with 32P-labeled CHOP AARE probe in the absence of specific antibody (arrow in Fig. 1). Fig. 1 (A and B) shows that antibodies against ATF2, ATF7, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPγ supershifted the CHOP AARE-bound complex with both starved and non-starved nuclear extracts, whereas antibodies against ATF3 and C/EBPδ supershifted the probe-protein complex only with the starved nuclear extracts. Because a faint supershifted complex was obtained with the anti-ATF4 antibody in leucine-starved condition, the experiment was repeated using, as a control, nuclear extracts from cells treated 5 h with a high dose of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml), which induces the ER stress response and leads to a high level of ATF4 expression (28Harding H.P. Novoa I.I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). As shown Fig. 2C, an ATF4 supershift complex was obtained using nuclear extracts from both starved and tunicamycin-treated cells. Antibodies against ATF1 and C/EBPα did not supershift the AARE-protein complex (Fig. 1, A and B) while they produced a supershift under known control conditions (Fig. 1D).Fig. 2Effect of leucine starvation on the C/EBP and ATF transcription factors expression.A, cells were incubated either in DMEM/F-12 or in DMEM/F-12 lacking leucine for 4 or 8 h. Total RNA were extracted, and real time RT-PCR was performed to quantify mRNAs as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, immunoblot analysis of ATF2, ATF4, C/EBPβ, and ATF3 of extracts prepared from cells incubated in a leucine-deficient DMEM/F-12 media for the indicated period of time. Western blot analysis was performed either from whole cell lysate or from nuclear extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Leucine Starvation on C/EBP and ATF Transcription Factors Expression—The marked discrepancy in the binding of transcription factors to the AARE sequence between nuclear extracts coming from starved and non-starved cells suggests that the cell content of these transcription factors is affected by leucine starvation. A kinetic analysis showed that the CHOP mRNA content increases and reaches a plateau after 8 h leucine starvation (Fig. 2A and Ref. 19Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J.

Therefore, we measured the expression of the C/EBP and ATF transcription factors tested above in response to 4- and 8-h leucine starvation. Fig. 2A shows tha"

This study focuses on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, grown in aerobic, carbon-limited chemostat cultures. Genome-wide transcript levels and in vivo fluxes were compared for growth on two sugars, glucose and maltose, and for two C2-compounds, ethanol and acetate. In contrast to previous reports on batch cultures, few genes (180 genes) responded to changes of the carbon source by a changed transcript level. Very few transcript levels were changed when glucose as the growth-limiting nutrient was compared with maltose (33 transcripts), or when acetate was compared with ethanol (16 transcripts). Although metabolic flux analysis using a stoichiometric model revealed major changes in the central carbon metabolism, only 117 genes exhibited a significantly different transcript level when sugars and C2-compounds were provided as the growth-limiting nutrient. Despite the extensive knowledge on carbon source regulation in yeast, many of the carbon source-responsive genes encoded proteins with unknown or incompletely characterized biological functions. In silico promoter analysis of carbon source-responsive genes confirmed the involvement of several known transcriptional regulators and suggested the involvement of additional regulators. Transcripts involved in the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis showed a good correlation with in vivo fluxes. This correlation was, however, not observed for other important pathways, including the pentose-phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and, in particular, glycolysis. These results indicate that in vivo fluxes in the central carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae grown in steadystate, carbon-limited chemostat cultures are controlled to a large extent via post-transcriptional mechanisms.

These results indicate that in vivo fluxes in the central carbon metabolism of S. cerevisiae grown in steadystate, carbon-limited chemostat cultures are controlled to a large extent via post-transcriptional mechanisms. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a model organism to study carbon source-dependent metabolic regulation in eukaryotes. Wild-type S. cerevisiae strains have a narrow set of carbon sources that can support fast growth in synthetic media (1Barnett J.A. Payne R.W. Yarrow D. Yeasts: Characteristics and Identification.1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1983Google Scholar). The most widely studied of these are the hexoses glucose, fructose, galactose, and mannose, the disaccharides maltose and sucrose, and the C2-compounds ethanol and acetate. The metabolic networks employed for the metabolism of the hexoses and disaccharides are very similar and differ only in the initial steps of metabolism (Fig. 1). For example, glucose and maltose metabolism differ only with respect to two reactions. The first reaction is the sugar transport through the plasma membrane; maltose uptake is catalyzed by an energy-dependent maltose-proton symport mechanism (Fig. 1, step 30) (2Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas glucose uptake is catalyzed exclusively by a facilitated diffusion mechanism (step 33) (3Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second reaction is the intracellular breakdown of maltose into glucose, which involves a specific α-glucosidase (“maltase,” step 29) (4Barnett J.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1976; 32: 125-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Similarly, the metabolism of the C2-compounds ethanol and acetate only differ by the initial substrate-uptake step (steps 31 and 32) (5Jones R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 239-258PubMed Google Scholar, 6Casal M. Cardoso H. Leao C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Krämer R. André B. Casal M. Leão C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and by two sequential NAD(P)+-dependent oxidation reactions that convert ethanol into acetate (steps 22 and 23). Drastic changes are observed in central metabolism when the metabolism of sugars is compared with that of the C2-compounds. During growth on sugars, all metabolic building blocks can be derived from glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway. During growth on C2-compounds, gluconeogenesis and glyoxylate cycle are essential for the provision of some of these precursors. Furthermore, the higher ATP requirement for biosynthesis during growth on the C2-compounds (and in particular acetate (Ref. 8Verduyn C. Stouthamer A.H. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1991; 59: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)) implies that, at a fixed specific growth rate, dissimilatory fluxes have to be higher with the C2-compounds than with a sugar as the sole carbon source. So far, most studies on regulation of central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae have been performed in batch mode in shake-flask or reactors. This cultivation method, however, has several drawbacks for quantitative analysis. First of all, the concentrations of substrates and products change throughout cultivation, which makes it difficult to accurately measure fluxes through specific pathways or to assess the influence of carbon sources on cellular regulation. Furthermore, batch cultivation by definition requires the use of excess concentrations of the carbon source. When different carbon sources are compared, this will lead to different specific growth rates, which, in itself, may already lead to changes in the make-up and activity of the metabolic network. Finally, the relatively high substrate concentrations in batch cultures lead to catabolite repression and inactivation phenomena (9Carlson M. Curr. Opinion Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 10Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultivation of microorganisms in chemostats offers numerous advantages for studying the structure and regulation of metabolic networks (11Harder W. Kuenen J.G. Matin A. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1977; 43: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In chemostat cultures, individual culture parameters can be changed, while keeping other relevant physical and chemical culture parameters (composition of synthetic medium, pH, temperature, aeration, etc.) constant. An especially important parameter in this respect is the specific growth rate, which, in a chemostat, is equal to the dilution rate, which can be accurately controlled. This allows the experimenter to investigate the effects of environmental changes or genetic interventions at a fixed specific growth rate, even if these changes result in different specific growth rates in batch cultures. In a chemostat, growth can be limited by a single, selected nutrient. The very low residual concentrations of this growth-limiting nutrient in chemostat cultures alleviate effects of catabolite repression and inactivation. Furthermore, these low residual substrate concentrations prevent substrate toxicity, which, for example, occurs when S. cerevisiae is grown on ethanol or acetate as the carbon source in batch cultures (12Alexandre H. Ansanay-Galeote V. Dequin S. Blondin B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Narendranath N.V. Thomas K.C. Ingledew W.M. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 26: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The central goal of the present study is to assess to what extent carbon source-dependent regulation of fluxes through central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae is regulated at the level of transcription. To this end, we compare the transcriptome of carbon-limited, aerobic chemostat cultures grown on four different carbon sources: glucose, maltose, ethanol, and acetate. Data from the transcriptome analysis are compared with flux distribution profiles calculated with a stoichiometric metabolic network model. Questions that will be addressed are as follows: (i) does glucose-limited aerobic cultivation lead to a complete alleviation of glucose-catabolite repression; (ii) how (in)complete is our understanding of the genes involved in the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to four of the most common carbon sources for this yeast; and (iii) to what extent do transcriptome analyses with microarrays provide a reliable indication of flux distribution in metabolic networks?

Cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium that limited growth by glucose, ethanol, acetate, or maltose with all other growth requirements in excess. The dilution rate was set at 0.10 h-1. The pH was measured on-line and kept constant at 5.0 by the automatic addition of 2 m KOH with the use of an Applikon ADI 1030 biocontroller. Stirrer speed was 800 rpm, and the airflow was 0.5 liters·min-1. Dissolved oxygen tension was measured online with an Ingold model 34-100-3002 probe, and was between 60 and 75% of air saturation. The off-gas was cooled by a condenser connected to a cryostat set at 2 °C and analyzed as previously described (16van Maris A.J.A. Luttik M.A.H. Winkler A.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Steady-state samples were taken after ∼10–14 volume changes to avoid strain adaptation caused by long term cultivation (17Ferea T.L. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Rosenzweig R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9721-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Dry weight, metabolite, dissolved oxygen, and off-gas profiles had to be constant over at least five volume changes prior to sampling for RNA extraction. Media—The defined mineral medium composition was based on that described by Verduyn et al. (18Verduyn C. Postma E. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1992; 8: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The carbon source was 256 ± 19 mmol of carbon/liter. Analytical Methods—Culture supernatants were obtained after centrifugation of samples from the chemostats. For the purpose of glucose, ethanol, acetate, and maltose determination and carbon recovery, culture supernatants and media were analyzed by HPLC, 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; STRE, stress response element; CSRE, carbon source-responsive element. fitted with an Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange column using 5 mm H2SO4 as the mobile phase. Culture dry weights were determined via filtration as described by Postma et al. (19Postma E. Verduyn C. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 468-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic Flux Distribution—Intracellular metabolic fluxes were calculated through metabolic flux balancing using a compartmented stoichiometric model derived from the model developed by Lange (20Lange H.C. Quantitative Physiology of S. cerevisiae Using Metabolic Network Analysis. TU Delft, The Netherlands2002Google Scholar). Because the intracellular localization of certain enzymes as well as the trafficking of certain metabolites in S. cerevisiae are still a matter of debate, assumptions had to be made on these aspects. The main assumptions concern acetyl-coenzyme A metabolism. It has been shown that transport of acetyl-CoA through the mitochondrial membrane cannot be performed in S. cerevisiae by the carnitine shuttle in the absence of exogenous carnitine (21Swiegers J.H. Dippenaar N. Pretorius I.S. Bauer F.F. Yeast. 2001; 18: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22van Roermund C.W. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5843-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is, however, possible to conceive growth on sugar and gluconeogenic carbon sources without acetyl-CoA transport. During growth on sugar, mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is synthesized directly in this compartment via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, whereas the small amounts of necessary cytosolic acetyl-CoA are synthesized in the cytosol by the acetyl-CoA synthase (encoded by ACS1 and ACS2 (Refs. 15van den Berg M.A. de Jong-Gubbels P.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar)). The gluconeogenic carbon sources acetate and ethanol can be converted by acetyl-CoA synthase into acetyl-CoA in the cytosol, acetyl-CoA being further converted in the cytosol to citrate by citrate synthase (CIT2 (Ref. 23Kumar A. Agarwal S. Heyman J.A. Matson S. Heidtman M. Piccirillo S. Umansky L. Drawid A. Jansen R. Liu Y. Cheung K.H. Miller P. Gerstein M. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar)). Citrate can then be transported trough the mitochondrial membrane by the well described citrate transporter (CTP1 (Ref. 24Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). The set-up of the stoichiometric models for growth of S. cerevisiae on glucose, maltose, ethanol, and acetate, as well as the flux balancing, was performed using dedicated software (SPAD it, Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

For each carbon source the specific rates of growth, substrate consumption, carbon dioxide production, and oxygen consumption during steady-state chemostat cultivation were calculated from the measured concentrations and flow rates from three independent experiments. The calculated specific conversion rates and their variances were used as input for the metabolic flux balancing procedure. In all cases the ATP balance was omitted as constraint in the flux balancing. This is a prerequisite for proper balancing in case the ATP stoichiometry of some reactions is insufficiently known (e.g. maintenance energy requirements, P/O ratio, etc.). However, without the ATP balance, the number of measurements was sufficient to result in an overdetermined system, thus making data reconciliation possible. In all cases the degree of redundancy was equal to 2. The complete list of reactions and components used to build the model can be found at www.bt.tudelft.nl/carbon-source. Microarray Analysis—Sampling of cells from chemostats, probe preparation, and hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip® microarrays were performed as described previously (30Piper M.D.W.

The results for each growth condition were derived from three independently cultured replicates. Data Acquisition and Analysis—Acquisition and quantification of array images and data filtering were performed using the Affymetrix software packages Microarray Suite version 5.0, MicroDB version 3.0, and Data Mining Tool version 3.0. Before comparison, all arrays were globally scaled to a target value of 150 using the average signal from all gene features using Microarray Suite version 5.0. From the 9,335 transcript features on the YG-S98 arrays, a filter was applied to extract 6,383 yeast open reading frames, of which there were 6,084 different genes. This discrepancy was the result of several genes being represented more than once when suboptimal probe sets were used in the array design. To represent the variation in triplicate measurements, the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) was calculated as previously described by Boer et al. (31Boer V.M. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. Piper M.D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3265-3274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For further statistical analyses, Microsoft Excel running the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 1.12) add-in was used (32Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar) for all possible pairwise comparisons of the four data sets. Genes were considered as being changed in expression if they were called significantly changed using SAM (expected median false discovery rate of 1%) by at least 2-fold from each other’s conditions. Hierarchical clustering of the obtained set of significantly changed expression levels was subsequently performed by GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics). Promoter analysis was performed using web-based softwares Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools 2URL is rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/. (RSA Tools (Ref. 33van Helden J. Andre B. Collado-Vides J.

When motifs shared largely overlapping sequences, they were aligned to form longer conserved elements. All the individual promoter sequences contributing to these elements were then aligned, and redundant elements were determined by counting the base representation at each position. The relative abundance of these redundant elements was then determined from a new enquiry of the co-regulated gene promoters and the entire set of yeast promoters in the genome using RSA Tools. The cluster coverage (Table V) is then expressed as the number of genes in the cluster containing the motif at least once, divided by the total number of genes in the cluster. Similarly, the genome coverage is expressed as the genome-wide number of genes containing the motif at least once, divided by the total number of genes used by RSA Tools (6,451 open reading frames).Table VOver-represented sequences retrieved from the promoters of co-regulated genesRegulatory clusterPromoter elementaRedundant nucleotides are indicated as follows: r = A or G; y = C or T; s = G or C; w = A or T; k = G or T; m = A or C; b = C, G, or T; d = A, G, or T; H = A, C, or T; n = A,C,G, or TPutative binding proteinCluster coverageGenome coverageRef.%%Cluster 1: low expression on acetateNSbNS, no significant patterns retrievedCluster 2: low expression on ethanol and acetateGsGkrrGGGGMsn2p/Msn4p?16161Martinez-Pastor M.T.

At a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1, the concentration of all four carbon sources in the reservoir medium was ∼250 mmol of carbon/liter (Table I), whereas their residual concentrations in steady-state cultures were below their respective detection limits (i.e. less than 0.5 mm). For the glucose- and maltose-grown cultures, the respiratory quotient (ratio of the specific rate of carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption) was close to 1.0, indicating a fully respiratory metabolism of these sugars. In all cultures over 95% of the substrate carbon was recovered as either biomass or carbon dioxide (Table I), and HPLC analysis of culture supernatants did not reveal the production of any low molecular weight metabolites.Table ICarbon source concentrations and physiological parameters of cultures used in this study Data represent the average and S.D. of three separate chemostat cultivations grown to steady states at D = 0.1 h-1.

This was expected, as maltose metabolism is initiated by the uptake and hydrolysis of the disaccharide to two glucose molecules (Fig. 1). In contrast to glucose uptake, however, the uptake of maltose occurs via an energy-dependent proton-symport mechanism (2Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which is likely to be responsible for the slightly lower (8%) biomass yield on maltose as compared with glucose (Table I). Consistent with earlier studies, biomass yields on ethanol and, in particular, acetate were lower than that on glucose (8Verduyn C. Stouthamer A.H. Scheffers W.A. van Dijken J.P. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1991; 59: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 35de Jong-Gubbels P. Vanrolleghem P.A. Heijnen S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. Yeast. 1995; 11: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These lower biomass yields and correspondingly higher respiration rates can be explained from the lower ATP yield from respiratory dissimilation of these substrates (which is largely the result of the investment of 2 ATP equivalents in the acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase reaction) and from the necessity to synthesize biosynthetic precursors via the glyoxylate cycle and gluconeogenesis. The difference in biomass yield between ethanol and acetate can be attributed to two factors: (i) energy-dependent uptake of acetate via a proton symport mechanism (6Casal M. Cardoso H. Leao C. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Krämer R. André B. Casal M. Leão C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and (ii) the higher degree of reduction of ethanol, for which the ethanol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (Fig. 1, reactions 22 and 23, respectively) can yield NAD(P)H that can either be used for biosynthesis or yield ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. Flux Distribution in Central Carbon Metabolism—In vivo fluxes through central pathways in carbon metabolism were estimated by metabolic flux analysis, using a stoichiometric model of the S. cerevisiae metabolic network. As S. cerevisiae is a eukaryote, this model took into account metabolic compartmentation by discriminating between reactions that occur in the yeast cytosol and in the mitochondrial matrix (36Nissen T.L. Schulze U. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Förster J. Famili I. Fu P. Palsson B.Ø. Nielsen J. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). To calculate intracellular fluxes, the model was fed with quantitative data on the biomass composition of S. cerevisiae (38Stückrath I. Lange H.C. Kötter P. van Gulik W.M. Entian K.D. Heijnen J.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 77: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and with the substrate consumption and product formation rates observed in the carbon-limited chemostat cultures.

Interventions to reverse declining trends in food security must recognize the variable resilience and sensitivity of major tropical soil types. In most agro-ecosystems, declining crop yield is exponentially related to loss of soil quality. For the majority smallholder (subsistence) farmers, investments to reverse degradation are primarily driven by private benefit, socially or financially. “Tragedy of the commons” scenarios can be averted by pragmatic local solutions that help farmers to help themselves."

Because several genes in which expression is altered by flavopiridol are regulated by NF-κB, we propose that this flavone must affect the activation of NF-κB. For this report, we investigated the effect of flavopiridol on NF-κB activation by various carcinogens and inflammatory agents. Flavopiridol suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-activation of NF-κB in a dose- and time-dependent manner in several cell types, with optimum inhibition occurring upon treatment of cells with 100 nm flavopiridol for 6 h. This effect was mediated through inhibition of IκBα kinase, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα (an inhibitor of NF-κB), and suppression of phosphorylation, acylation, and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Besides TNF, flavopiridol also suppressed NF-κB activated by a carcinogen (cigarette smoke condensate), tumor promoters (phorbol myristate acetate and okadaic acid), and an inflammatory agent (H2O2). TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was also suppressed by this flavone. NF-κB reporter activity induced by TNF receptor 1, TNF receptor-associated death domain, TNF receptor-associated factor-2, NF-κB-inducing kinase, and IκBα kinase, were all blocked by flavopiridol but not that activated by p65. Furthermore, flavopiridol suppressed TNF-induced activation of Akt. Flavopiridol also inhibited the expression of the TNF-induced NF-κB-regulated gene products cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Overall, our results indicated that flavopiridol inhibits activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-regulated gene expression, which may explain the ability of flavopiridol to suppress inflammation, modulate the immune response, and regulate cell growth.

Stinson S.F. Siford T.J. Alvord W.G. Klabansky R.L. Sausville E.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 2482-2490PubMed Google Scholar), and again, NF-κB has been shown to control the expression of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory molecules (34Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicated that flavopiridol may regulate the activity of NF-κB. Thus in the present report we investigated the effect of flavopiridol on NF-κB activation induced by various carcinogens, inflammatory agents, and immune modulators. We also investigated the mechanism by which flavopiridol suppress NF-κB activation, and we found this inhibition was mediated through the suppression of Akt-induced IκBα kinase activation. Flavopiridol also suppressed the induced NF-κB-regulated gene products such as COX-2, cyclin D1, and MMP-9. Reagents—Flavopiridol was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). A 1 mm solution of flavopiridol was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and then diluted in the cell culture medium. Bacteria-derived human recombinant TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), okadaic acid, and H2O2 were obtained from Sigma. Cigarette smoke condensate was kindly provided by Dr. C. Gary Gariola (Toxicology Research Institute of the University of Kentucky, Lexington). The antibodies anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-IκBα, anti-cyclin D1, anti-poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP), and anti-Akt antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific anti-IκBα (Ser-32), phosphospecific anti-Akt, and anti-acetyllysine antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-IKK-α and anti-IKK-β antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). The antibody that recognizes the serine 529-phosphorylated form of p65 was obtained from Rockland Laboratories (Gilbertsville, PA). Cell Lines—We used Jurkat (human T-cell cell line), A293 (human kidney cell line), and HL60 (human myeloid leukemia) cells, and all cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Jurkat and HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium; A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—To measure NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA as described (35Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (2 × 106/ml) were incubated with 32P end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (10 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB binding sites), for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of the binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either the p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C before the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized, and the radioactive bands were quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using Imagequant software. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in cytoplasm or nuclear extracts, we prepared each extract (36Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23390-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) from TNF-treated cells and fractionated it by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected by ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The density of the bands was measured using NIH Image. IκBα Kinase Assay—The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (37Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4927-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex from whole-cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α, followed by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2 h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (1Naik R.G.

After the immunocomplex was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, it was boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and -β in each sample, the IKK immunoprecipitate was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibodies. Nuclear Localization of p65 NF-κB by Immunocytochemistry—The nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB was examined by an immunocytochemical method as described previously (38Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a cytospin 4 (Thermoshendon, Pittsburg, PA), air dried, fixed with cold acetone, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After being washed in phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human p65 or IκBα antibodies at 1:100 dilutions. After overnight incubation at 4 °C the slides were washed, incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 594 (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) at 1:100 dilutions for 1 h, and counter-stained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (50 ng/ml) for 5 min. Stained slides were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pictures were captured using Photometrics Coolsnap CF color camera (Nikon, Lewisville, TX) and MetaMorph version 4.6.5 software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). Secretory Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) Assay—The effect of flavopiridol on TNF-, TNFR 1-, TRADD-, TRAF 2-, NIK-, IKK- and p65-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was analyzed by SEAP assay as described previously (37Manna S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4927-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, A293 cells (0.5 million cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg) and the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA (2 μg). After 24 h, cells were washed and then treated with 100 nm flavopiridol for 8 h. Cells were then exposed to 1 nm TNF for 24 h, harvested from the cell culture medium, and analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Labsystems, Chicago, IL) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. To examine TNFR 1-, TRADD-, TRAF 2-, NIK-, IKK- and p65-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription, cells (0.5 million cells/well) were plated in six-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg), the inducer plasmid (1 μg), and the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 (1 μg) DNA. After 24 h, cells were washed and then treated with 100 nm flavopiridol. After 32 h, the cell culture medium was harvested and analyzed for SEAP activity as described above. In the present study, we investigated the effect of flavopiridol on NF-κB activation induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli including PMA, okadaic acid, H2O2, cigarette smoke condensate, and TNF. The effect of flavopiridol on the TNF-induced NF-κB activation was studied in detail, because the pathway has been well characterized. The structure of flavopiridol, (-)-cis-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(2-chlorphenyl)-8-[4-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl)piperidinyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-on, is shown in Fig. 1. The concentration of flavone, the NF-κB activators used, and the time of exposure had minimal effect on the viability of these cells (data not shown). Flavopiridol Inhibits TNF-dependent NF-κB Activation—To determine the effect of flavopiridol on NF-κB activation, Jurkat, A293, and HL60 cells were incubated for 8 h with different concentrations of flavopiridol followed by 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. Then nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 2, Flavopiridol by itself did not induce NF-κB activation but rather inhibited TNF-mediated NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines. Treatment with 150 nm flavopiridol suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation by almost 100% in all cell lines. During all subsequent experiments, we used HL60 cells and employed 150 nm flavopiridol. We next tested the length of incubation required for flavopiridol to suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Cells were incubated with the flavone for different times before treatment with TNF for 30 min. TNF-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by flavopiridol in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). When we incubated cells with flavopiridol for 6 h, NF-κB activation by TNF was completely inhibited. P"

Accordingly, the thiol/disulfide redox status of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is defined by the status of glutathione, and it has been assumed that reduced and oxidized glutathione form the principal redox buffer. We have determined the distribution of glutathione between different chemical states in rat liver microsomes by labeling with the thiol-specific label monobromobimane and subsequent separation by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. More than half of the microsomal glutathione was found to be present in mixed disulfides with protein, the remainder being distributed between the reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione in the ratio of 3:1. The high proportion of the total population of glutathione that was found to be in mixed disulfides with protein has significant implications for the redox state and buffering capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum and, hence, for the formation of disulfide bonds in vivo.

The luminal environment favors the maturation of secretory proteins by providing chaperones; for example, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein, folding catalysts such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and an oxidizing environment suitable for native disulfide bond formation. There are numerous studies on different aspects of the molecular chaperones and disulfide isomerases (for examples, see Ref. 1Rothblatt J. Novick P. Stevens T.H. Guidebook to the Secretory Pathway.

This is because of the difficulties of developing suitable methods for characterizing organelle microenvironments. One landmark study (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) using a probe thiol peptide confirmed that glutathione is the principal redox buffer in the ER lumen and reported that the ratio of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the secretory pathway is between 1:1 and 3:1. This is considerably more oxidizing than the cytosolic ratio of 30:1–100:1 (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F.

Biol. 1995; 5: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence for the involvement of glutathione in protein disulfide bond formation in vivo (15Hayano T. Inaka K. Otsu M. Taniyama Y. Miki K. Matsushima M. Kikuchi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but some basic questions still require an answer. First, how are net oxidizing equivalents delivered to the ER lumen to maintain the observed oxidizing environment? The study of Hwang et al. (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) proposed that oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is preferentially transported from the cytosol into the ER lumen. However, a recent direct study of glutathione transport into mammalian liver microsomal vesicles (16Bánhegyi G. Lusini L. Puskás F. Rossi R. Fulceri R. Braun L. Mile V. di Simplicio P. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12213-12216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) indicates that only reduced glutathione (GSH) can be taken up into the ER lumen. This is consistent with the results of Cuozzo and Kaiser (17Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), who have shown that in yeast the product of the ERO1 gene is a major source responsible for providing oxidizing equivalents to protein thiols and glutathione in the secretory pathway; other evidence suggests that GSSG can be generated in the ER through the action of a flavin-containing monooxygenase (18Suh J.-K.

A. 2000; 97: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The pathway for delivery of oxidizing equivalents to nascent polypeptide chains in the ER lumen has become an area of vigorous study and is discussed further below. An even more basic question concerns the various chemical forms of glutathione in the ER and their absolute concentrations. The initial work (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) did not determine absolute concentrations, only the GSH:GSSG ratio, assuming equilibration with the probe. It had the further limitation that this ratio was determined for the entire secretory pathway rather than for the ER lumen itself, the only compartment where folding of nascent proteins occurs; it is not clear whether the secretory pathway maintains a uniform oxidizing environment throughout. Here we describe an assay developed to allow direct investigation of the different forms of glutathione in rat liver microsomes, a well characterized model system for the ER compartment (20DePierre J.W. Dallner G. Biochemical Analysis of Membranes. Chapman & Hall, London1976: 79-131Google Scholar). For analysis of glutathione in a complex mixture such as a microsomal vesicle suspension, the specific reaction of monobromobimane (mBBr) with thiols was exploited. mBBr is a membrane-permeant member of the bromobimane family of compounds, which have been widely used to investigate thiols in biological systems (for reviews, see Refs. 21Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 148-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S.

The weakly fluorescent mBBr reacts specifically with thiol groups, producing a highly fluorescent thioether. Various pretreatments were employed to convert glutathione in its various forms to the free thiol form GSH. GSH derivatized with mBBr (GS-mB) was then separated from other reaction mixture components by an amended version of one of the rpHPLC separation protocols described elsewhere (24Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and detected and quantitated by a fluorescence detector. An estimate of the lumenal volume of the microsomes was made and used to suggest a possible range for the concentration of glutathione-containing species in the ER lumen Reaction of GSH with mBBr—Conditions for reacting GSH with mBBr and analyses of the resulting mixtures were optimized with GSH stock solutions. The protocol used for the reaction of different samples with mBBr combined elements of the methods reported elsewhere (23Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thiol-containing samples were mixed with at least a 1 mm stoichiometric excess of mBBr in 20 mm Trizma (Tris base)-methanesulfonic acid (MSA) (pH 8) buffer. The reaction between the thiol and mBBr was allowed to proceed for a certain period of time (usually 10 min) at 25 °C, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of acid, either MSA (24Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) or trichloroacetic acid (23Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1986; 13: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Samples were then diluted with 10 mm MSA for rpHPLC analysis, routinely by 40–100-fold. Samples were prepared and analyzed in triplicate. Samples which were not analyzed immediately after preparation were stored in the dark at –20 °C. Numerous controls were performed to validate the methodology, the most important of which were the “reagent-only” (where the thiol-containing species was excluded from the reaction mixture) and “unknown” controls (where the thiols in the reaction mixture were alkylated by reaction with an excess amount of N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min before the addition of mBBr). Such controls allowed identification of peaks in the rpHPLC traces that were not due to the product of the reaction of GSH with mBBr (GS-mB). These controls are more extensively discussed in previous publications (21Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 148-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. J. Biochem. Biophys.

Separation of GS-mB by rpHPLC—rpHPLC was performed using a Waters 600 Controller and a Waters 712 WISP autosampler run by Millennium Chromatography Manager (Millipore UK Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK). A Vydac C-18 column with 5-μm beads and dimensions of 4.6 × 250 mm preceded by a guard column containing Waters Guard-Pak, C-18 precolumn inserts (300 Å) was employed (Hi-Chrom, Reading, UK). A 40-min separation protocol adapted from those reported elsewhere (21Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 148-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Kosower E.M. Kosower N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used employing the following linear gradients of 0.25% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid, NaOH, pH 3.5 (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) to produce clear peaks due to GS-mB: 0 min at 15% (v/v) solvent B; 5 min at 15% (v/v) solvent B; 15 min at 23% (v/v) solvent B; 20 min at 23% (v/v) solvent B; 25 min at 100% (v/v) solvent B; 30 min at 15% (v/v) solvent B; 40 min at 15% (v/v) solvent B. Fluorescence Detection—GS-mB was found to exhibit maximum emission at a wavelength of 477 nm and maximum excitation at 394 nm, which is consistent with previously reported work (24Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). These parameters were used for the detection of GS-mB by a Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector with a bandwidth of 18 nm and the detector set to maximum gain and minimum attenuation to ensure sensitive detection. Preparation of Rat Liver Microsomes—Rat liver microsomes were prepared according to a previously reported method (25Tangen O. Jonsson J. Orrenius S. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and either used immediately or divided into aliquots and stored at –20 °C unless otherwise stated. Aliquots of rat liver microsomes thawed for use were washed in double-distilled H2O to remove extra-microsomal material and any lumenal contents released by freeze-thawing. This was performed by resuspending the microsomes in an excess of double-distilled H2O, centrifuging at maximum speed in a benchtop microcentrifuge (12,500 × g) for 5 min, and adding enough of the required buffer to the resulting pellet to restore the original sample volume. This approach was adopted as an alternative to the more common high salt washing (20DePierre J.W. Dallner G. Biochemical Analysis of Membranes. Chapman & Hall, London1976: 79-131Google Scholar) because a comparison of the two methods found that there was no difference significant to this work. Production of GS-mB Representing the Different Forms of Glutathione in Microsome Samples—To produce samples containing GS-mB that would be representative of free GSH in the microsomes, samples were directly reacted with mBBr. Between 1 and 10 μl of rat liver microsome suspension was mixed with 1 mm mBBr in 20 mm Trizma-MSA (pH 8) in a total reaction mixture of 100 μl. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in the dark, with subsequent acidification by 0.1 volumes of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and collection of the supernatant. To generate samples in which the GS-mB represented total glutathione in the microsomes, reaction of microsomes with mBBr was preceded by incubation for 1 h at 25 °C in a final concentration of 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). To prepare samples containing GS-mB that would be due to a combination of free GSH and GSSG in the microsomal lumen, samples containing microsomes were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove any protein (and, thus, any glutathione bound to protein i.e. GSS-protein) before further processing. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated microsomes were prepared by the addition of 0.07 volumes of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to a microsome suspension; this was shown to be the minimum amount of acid required to reproducibly and completely precipitate the proteins in a suspension of microsomes. The sample was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was combined with 4 volumes of 100 mm Trizma (pH 10.5), thus raising the pH of the sample to 8. Between 5 and 50 μl of the resulting sample were incubated with DTT for 1 h and subsequently with mBBr for 10 min as above. To test whether the glutathione content of stored microsomes could be influenced by externally added glutathione, 4.8 mm GSH and 0.1 mm GSSG were chosen as an approximation of cytosolic levels of glutathione (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Washed, freeze-thawed rat liver microsomes were mixed with 4.8 mm GSH and 0.1 mm GSSG in transport buffer (125 mm sucrose, 80 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm Hepespotassium hydroxide, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, with agitation for 1 or 23 h. Subsequently the samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Trizma-MSA (pH 8) to restore the initial volume of the microsome suspension before the standard mBBr derivatization was performed as described above. Estimation of Microsomal Lumenal Volume—For experiments on rat liver microsome suspensions the proportion of the total volume due to lumenal volume is required for quantitative expression of microsomal glutathione in units of concentration. An assay was developed exploiting the free permeability of 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose ([3H]DG) across the ER membrane. 5–30-μl aliquots of rat liver microsomes were incubated with 10 μl of [3H]DG ([3H]DG = 31–125 nm, specific activity = 185–740 GBq/mmol, amount of radioactivity present = 0.37 kBq/μl) in a total reaction volume per sample of 100 μl, in transport buffer. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (which was shown to be sufficient for the [3H]DG to reach equilibrium across the ER membrane) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatants and pellets (which were readily separable from the bulk solution) were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Development of the Analytical Method for Glutathione—The reaction of GSH with mBBr was optimized with stock solutions. The optimum reaction time for the reaction was found to be 10 min in a reaction mixture containing a stoichiometric ratio of GSH:mBBr of at least 1:2. This is in accordance with suggestions made in previous work (24Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 20 mm Trizma-MSA (pH 8) buffer used in previous studies was found to produce less background than other formulations tested. It was shown that the addition of mBBr to a reaction mixture of GSSG and DTT produced the amount of GS-mB predicted from the complete reduction of GSSG by DTT both in the presence and absence of added GSH. Optimized rpHPLC separation of GS-mB is shown in Fig. 1, in conjunction with controls indicating the specificity of the reaction. In Fig. 1 the GS-mB peak can clearly be seen, but there are other minor peaks or base-line fluctuations observed. Because these are also present in the reagent-only and “unknown” controls, they are due to fluorescence of species that are not a product of the reaction of GSH with mBBr and can be ignored in the quantitative analysis of GSH. Control experiments suggest that these small peaks are most likely due to limited hydrolysis of excess mBBr. The GS-mB standard curve (Fig. 2) is linear from 10 to 175 pmol and shows excellent reproducibility.Fig. 2Standard curve for GS-mB. GSH was derivatized with mBBr using a 1 mm stoichiometric excess of mBBr and a 10-min reaction time. The stock solution was diluted with 10 mm MSA so that 150 μl of each sample was analyzed. S.D. are plotted as error bars from triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the Different Forms of Glutathione in Microsomes—Water-washed, freeze-thawed microsomes were used for initial studies on glutathione in microsomes to establish methodology. Control experiments ensured that the reaction between GSH and mBBr was both rapid and complete under the conditions used. It was shown that the reaction was not adversely affected by the presence of protein or of other components of a microsome suspension. It was also demonstrated that lowering and subsequent raising of the pH of the reaction mixture did not affect the reaction of GSH with mBBr (data not shown). Glutathione was then quantitated in freshly prepared rat liver microsomes. We assumed that glutathione would be present as the free thiol (GSH), as oxidized forms, and in combination with proteins; the sample pretreatments described above were designed accordingly. An example rpHPLC trace is shown in Fig. 3, and titrations of the area of the GS-mB peak with increasing volume of microsome suspension are shown in Fig. 4. The three data sets refer to microsome samples subjected to different pretreatments. The amount of GS-mB representing total microsomal glutathione (top line, samples pretreated with DTT) is greater than that resulting from derivatization of glutathione not present in a complex with protein (middle line, samples precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to remove protein, before reduction with DTT), which is in turn greater than that representing free GSH (bottom line, no DTT treatment). The results indicate that glutathione is present in microsomal vesicles as free GSH, in the oxidized state presumably as the disulfide GSSG, and in a form where it is bound to protein in a DTT-reducible state; we take this to be mixed disulfides (protein-SSG).Fig. 4Investigation of the different forms of glutathione in rat liver microsomes. The areas of the peaks due to GS-mB in different samples were determined by integration. To allow all of the results to be directly comparable the peak areas were standardized to allow for variations in the lumenal volumes of the different batches of microsomes and dilution of samples for loading onto the rpHPLC column to be accounted for. Rat liver microsomes were directly derivatized with mBBr (○) or were pretreated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by DTT reduction before derivatization with mBBr (▴) or were simply reduced with DTT before the addition of mBBr (□). In all samples pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide before the addition of mBBr there were no GSH-mB peaks. S.D. are plotted as error bars from triplicate samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The roughly linear increase in peak area with sample volume (Fig. 4) allows the ratios between the different forms of glutathione in rat liver microsomes to be determined.

An estimate of the lumenal volume of microsome suspensions is required to express the data as concentration within the lumenal compartment. This was determined by examining the proportion of [3H]DG associated with microsomal pellets relative to the bulk solution after incubation to equilibrium. That [3H]DG is freely permeable across microsomal membranes was demonstrated experimentally by numerous controls which indicated that [3H]DG was able to rapidly cross the microsomal membranes and establish an equilibrium. Indeed, the influx of [3H]DG was too rapid to be monitored by this system because 5 min was required to process each sample, but efflux of [3H]DG from microsomes could be demonstrated (data not shown). Because of its high water solubility, no [3H]DG should be associated with the hydrophobic membrane phase, so pellet radioactivity should predominantly represent [3H]DG within the lumenal volume. Hence, the ratio of pellet:supernatant radioactivity should correspond to the ratio of lumenal:medium volume. However, it is possible that there was radioactivity in the pellet present in external medium physically entrapped between the microsomal vesicles or forming a surface layer of liquid associated with the pellet. The most suitable way found to estimate the amount of [3H]DG present in the extra-microsomal volume involves extrapolation of the graph presented in Fig. 5. Because virtually no radioactivity is present in pellet fractions in the absence of microsomes, the line of this graph should theoretically cross the origin. However, the line of the graph extrapolates to a positive value for pellet radioactivity at zero added microsomes. This can be taken as representing radioactivity associated with the pellet but not within the luminal phase, allowing a correction for this factor in the calculation of lumenal volume. When the correction was applied the estimations of the lumenal volumes of the microsome suspensions were found to range between 7.0 and 19.3% of the total suspension volume. The variation in the lumenal volumes is not surprising; as a final step in microsome preparation, the final pellet of microsome vesicles was resuspended in a minimum volume of buffer, giving considerable batch-to-batch variation. Using these values for luminal volume the concentration of total glutathione in freshly prepared microsomes was estimated as 9.4 mm (±33%, n = 3). The total concentration of glutathione in washed, freeze-thawed microsomes was ∼10% that found in the freshly prepared microsomes. This was to be expected because of the potential for leakage during storage, freeze-thawing, and subsequent washing. However, the concentrations of total glutathione in washed, freeze-thawed microsomes that were subsequently incubated in cytosolic levels of glutathione for 1 or 23 h before mBBr derivatization were comparable with the levels found in freshly prepared microsomes. The value determined for lumenal total glutathione after this incubation (7–9 mm) was higher than the total glutathione concentration of the incubation medium (5 mm), suggesting some active concentration of glutathione within the vesicles. Microsomes as a Model System—Microsomal suspensions have been used for many years as experimental models of the endoplasmic reticulum. They retain the selective permeability of the ER and the transverse asymmetry of this membrane system (i.e. they are predominantly “right way out”). However they are clearly the product of a process of disruption and resealing so that their content of soluble small molecules cannot be taken as representing that of the intact ER. Furthermore, there is the possibility of thiol:disulfide interchange and overall oxidation during sample preparation. Various approaches can be taken to limit these dynamic changes, but we omitted them since “application of strategies to prevent oxidation can be expected to have the risk of allowing artifactual reduction and vice versa” (26Jones D.P. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this clear limitation, several of our findings reported here suggest that the microsomes represent a useful system broadly representative of the situation in vivo. These findings include the total concentration of glutathione detected in freshly prepared microsomes, the ratio of GSH to GSSG determined both for fresh microsomes and for extensively washed, stored microsomes, and the ability of washed microsomes to accumulate glutathione selectively on incubation in the presence of glutathione concentrations mimicking cytosolic conditions. The Concentration and Chemical State of Glutathione in Isolated Microsomes—The molar ratio of GSH:GSSG for fresh and freeze-thawed microsomes were 3:1 and 4:1 respectively, similar to that reported previously for the secretory pathway of intact cells based on a quite different, indirect approach (11Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). This ratio is similar to that shown to be at an optimum for folding of disulfide bond-containing proteins in vitro (12Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Bioch"
https://openalex.org/W2035823366,Continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism is hypothesized to have played a causative role in global climate change and mass extinctions. Uncertainties associated with radiometric dating preclude a clear chronological assessment of the environmental consequences of CFB volcanism. Our results document a 25% decline in the marine 187 Os/ 188 Os record that predates the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB) and coincides with late Maastrichtian warming. We argue that this decline provides a chemostratigraphic marker of Deccan volcanism and thus constitutes compelling evidence that the main environmental consequence of Deccan volcanism was a transient global warming event of 3° to 5°C that is fully resolved from the KTB mass extinction.

Degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) in mammalian cells is dependent upon the enzymatic activity of HPSE-1, an endo-β-d-glucuronidase, which cleaves HS using a specific endoglycosidic hydrolysis rather than an eliminase type of action. Elevated HPSE-1 levels are associated with metastatic cancers, directly implicating HPSE-1 in tumor progression. The mechanism of HPSE-1 action to promote tumor progression may involve multiple substrates because HS is present on both cell-surface and ECM proteoglycans. However, the specific targets of HPSE-1 action are not known. Of particular interest is the relationship between HPSE-1 and HSPG, known for their involvement in tumor progression. Syndecan-1, an HSPG, is ubiquitously expressed at the cell surface, and its role in cancer progression may depend upon its degradation. Conversely, another HSPG, perlecan, is an important component of basement membranes and ECM, which can promote invasive behavior. Down-regulation of perlecan expression suppresses the invasive behavior of neoplastic cells in vitro and inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. In this work we demonstrate the following. 1) HPSE-1 cleaves HS present on the cell surface of metastatic melanoma cells. 2) HPSE-1 specifically degrades HS chains of purified syndecan-1 or perlecan HS. 3) Syndecan-1 does not directly inhibit HPSE-1 enzymatic activity. 4) The presence of exogenous syndecan-1 inhibits HPSE-1-mediated invasive behavior of melanoma cells by in vitro chemoinvasion assays. 5) Inhibition of HPSE-1-induced invasion requires syndecan-1 HS chains. These results demonstrate that cell-surface syndecan-1 and ECM perlecan are degradative targets of HPSE-1, and syndecan-1 regulates HPSE-1 biological activity. This suggest that expression of syndecan-1 on the melanoma cell surface and its degradation by HPSE-1 are important determinants in the control of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.

Realization that cell-surface HSPG mediate extracellular information has raised questions about their selective degradation at the HS chains level. Heparanase (HPSE-1), is an endo-β-d-glucuronidase that cleaves HS at specific intrachain sites, resulting in the formation of fragments of appreciable size (10–20 sugar units; see Refs. 13Nakajima M.

Of note, HPSE-1 is distinguishable from other HS-degradative enzymes, such as heparitinases and heparinases from Flavobacterium heparinum, or endoglucosaminidases, which are eliminases that cleave HS into di- or tetrasaccharide units (16Ernst S.

Investig. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Tumor cells transfected with HPSE-1 cDNA become more invasive and acquire a highly metastatic phenotype (24Toyoshima M. Nakajima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24153-24160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that astrocytes produce HPSE-1 and could contribute to the brain metastatic specificity of melanoma cells (25Marchetti D. Li J. Shen R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4767-4770PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, release of HS-bound paracrine growth factors affects the metastatic phenotype (26Eccles S.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 3: 735-736Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, HPSE-1 releases ECM-resident angiogenic factors in vitro, and its overexpression induces an angiogenic response in vivo (14Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1, a transmembrane HSPG that binds both growth factors and ECM components, acts as a co-receptor for multiple growth factor receptors (2Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 4Rapraeger A.C. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 645-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Sanderson R.D. Semin.

Syndecan-1 expressed at the cell surface is typically down-regulated in metastatic phenotypes. However, soluble syndecan-1 expressed in tumors has been directly associated with increased invasion and cancer progression (28Dhodapkar M.V. Kelly T. Theus A. Athota A.B. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 99: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 29Seidel C. Borset M. Hjertner O. Cao D. Abildgaard N. Hjorth-Hansen H. Sanderson R.D. Waage A.

Perlecan, the most abundant ECM HSPG of epithelial and endothelial basement membranes, has been shown to promote invasive behavior (31Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grassel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of perlecan expression inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo (32Sharma B. Handler M. Eichstetter I. Whitelock J.M. Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and suppresses the invasive behavior of melanoma cells in vitro (33Adatia R. Albini A. Carlone S. Giunciuglio D. Benelli R. Santi L. Noonan D.M. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1257-1261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A recent study (27Liu D. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. El Shabrawi Y. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 568-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that HS degradation uncovers cryptic HS fragments that participate in controlling tumor cell growth and metastasis. Enzymatic degradation of HSPG HS chains by HPSE-1 is therefore likely to be involved in fundamental biological processes ranging from normal development to cancer metastasis. Although the precise mechanisms by which they promote invasion are unknown, perlecan and other cell-surface/ECM HSPG may enhance metastasis by binding chemokines and growth factors which can then be released by enzymatic degradation of HS.

In the present study we have: 1) investigated HPSE-1 degradation of cell-surface HS in metastatic melanoma cells; 2) determined whether purified syndecan-1 and perlecan HS are degradative targets of HPSE-1; 3) evaluated the relationship between syndecan-1 and the enzymatic activity of HPSE-1; and 4) assessed the modulation of HPSE-1-induced invasion by syndecan-1 including the requirement for syndecan-1 HS chains. Materials—Heparin, HS, and trypsin-EDTA were acquired from Sigma. [35S]Sulfate (43 Ci/mg) was purchased from ICN (Irvine, CA). DMEM, Ham's F-12 nutrient medium were purchased from Invitrogen, and FBS was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). WiDr cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); guanidine hydrochloride was from Invitrogen, and CHAPS was from Roche Applied Science. Heparitinase (F. heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8), chondroitinases AC (Arthrobacter aurescens; EC 4.2.2.5), and ABC (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4) were from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Ijamsville, MD).

Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (WiDr) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air (v/v) atmosphere and passaged using EDTA (2 mm in PBS) or trypsin-EDTA (70W, WiDr) before reaching confluence. WiDr cells were chosen as a source for perlecan because it is the predominant cell-associated, high Mr proteoglycan they produce (40Knox S. Melrose J. Whitelock J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells were plated at 10% density on glass coverslips in DMEM/F-12, 5% (v/v) FBS, allowed to attach, and grown for 24 h. Cells were then switched to DMEM/F-12, 5% FBS (v/v) containing Hepes (10 mm, pH 6.3). Subsequently, recombinant HPSE-1 (200 ng/ml) was added to the appropriate wells, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell-surface HS was detected with an antiheparan sulfate mAb 10E4 (1:50 dilution; Seikagaku America, Falmouth, MA) followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (BioGenex Laboratories, San Ramon, CA) and rhodamine red-x-streptavidin (1:400 dilution; Accurate Inc., Westbury, NY). Cells stained for cell-surface syndecan-1 were plated as above and immunostained with anti-syndecan-1 mAb 281.2 (1:100 dilution; see Ref. 30Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rat IgG (1:400 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rhodamine red-x-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Digital images were produced on an axioplan fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) with advanced spot imaging program (Bio-Rad) using identical conditions for all photographs and antibodies used. Preparation of 35S-Labeled HS and Column Chromatography—WiDr cells were used as a source of HS because the predominant HSPG produced by WiDr cells is perlecan (40Knox S. Melrose J. Whitelock J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). WiDr cells were incubated overnight (18 h) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air (v/v) atmosphere in RPMI media lacking sulfate and supplemented with 33 mm MgCl2,15mm Hepes, 1.2 gm/ml sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.3, containing penicillin G (5 units), and penicillin-streptomycin sulfate (5 μg). This resulted in a final concentration of 10 μm sulfate in the labeling media. The labeling media contained 400 μCi/ml H235SO4 for a final specific activity of 40 μCi/nmol. At the end of the labeling period, the media were collected and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid-phosphotungstic acid as described previously (42Tang J.P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The material in the pellet was subjected to incubation for 48 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m NaOH, 0.25 m sodium borohydride (β-elimination). At the end of the incubation, the solution was neutralized with 1 n acetic acid and desalted over a Sephadex G-50 column (0.5 × 10 cm) eluted in PBS. The material eluting in the void volume was pooled and defined as glycosaminoglycan. In both the secreted and extracellular matrix fractions, >95% was HS as determined by sensitivity to nitrous acid degradation (42Tang J.P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation also was sensitive to bacterial heparitinases (17Ernst S. Venkataraman G. Winkler S. Godavarti R. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) but was resistant to chondroitinases AC and ABC digestion (21Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was estimated to be ∼2.6 × 108 dpm/μg HS. [35S]HS from WiDr cell-derived perlecan (1 pg) was incubated in the presence or absence of HPSE-1 (200 ng) in 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, for 24 h at 37 °C. Digestion of perlecan WiDr HS was analyzed by liquid chromatography using a Sephacryl 300S HR column (1.0 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences) (21Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). The resin was eluted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min; and fractions (0.4 ml) were collected. Aliquots were then taken for determination of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Column void volume (Vo) and total volume (VT) were assessed by the elution positions of blue dextran and vitamin B12. Syndecan-1 Isolation and Removal of Core Protein or HS Chains— Syndecan-1 was isolated from the culture media conditioned by CAG myeloma cells transfected with a cDNA construct coding for the extracellular domain of the human syndecan-1 core protein. Similar studies using a cDNA coding for the extracellular domain of murine syndecan-1 have shown that it is secreted into the culture media as an intact molecule bearing HS chains (30Yang Y. Yaccoby S. Liu W. Langford J.K. Pumphrey C.Y. Theus A. Epstein J. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For syndecan-1 isolation, culture media were brought to a final concentration of 2 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and incubated with DEAE-Sepharose fast flow beads overnight (18 h) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed in PBS, and syndecan-1 was eluted in PBS containing 1 m NaCl. Where indicated, syndecan-1 was treated to digest either the core protein or HS before chemoinvasion assays. To digest HS, syndecan-1 (250 ng) was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with either HPSE-1 in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, or with heparitinase (1 mg/ml) in heparitinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 70 μl final volume), and then the enzymes were inactivated for 10 min at 50 °C (43Keiser N. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring free HS chains, syndecan-1 (250 ng) was treated as above for β-elimination (48 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m NaOH, 0.25 m sodium borohydride) to digest the core protein. Alternatively, syndecan-1 core protein was digested with Pronase (5 mg/ml; Sigma) for 16 h at 37 °C (44Marchetti D. Nicolson G.L. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 111-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Pronase was then inactivated for 15 min at 100 °C. Results shown are from multiple experiments. HPSE-1 Digestion of Syndecan-1 and Western Blotting—Purified syndecan-1 (250 ng) was digested with active recombinant HPSE-1 (0–200 ng) in sodium acetate (80 mm), NaCl (250 mm) buffer, pH 4.5, for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at 100 °C with Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and separated on a 4–20% Criterion gel (Tris-HCl, Bio-Rad). Syndecan-1 was transferred to a zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated in a blocking reagent (3% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS, pH 7.5) for 1 h, and then 0.3% (w/v) Tween 20 buffer was added for an additional 30 min. Syndecan-1 core protein was labeled using antisyndecan-1 mAb BB-4 (1:200 dilution; Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY) in blocking reagent, washed for 1 h with 6–8 changes of 0.5% Igepal (CA-630, Sigma) in Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated with horseradish peroxidase antimouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution; Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp). It then was washed and developed using the SuperSignal® West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Labeling was detected and quantified using a Versadoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). Chemoinvasion Assay—The invasive properties of melanoma cells were assayed by use of invasive chambers followed by fluorescence plate scanner analysis as described (21Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J.

Briefly, cell invasion was assayed by using Transwell cell culture chambers (8 μm pore size, 6.5 mm diameter or 12 μm pore size, 12 mm diameter) coated with Matrigel™ (diluted 1:30 with cold DMEM/F-12, 100–300 μl final coating volume) that was applied to the upper filter surface and allowed to dry before use. In assays where Matrigel™ was pretreated with HPSE-1, Matrigel™-coated filters were washed 3 times with DMEM/F-12 and then incubated with HPSE-1 (300 ng/ml, 100 μl final volume in 10 mm Hepes/DMEM/F-12, pH 6.8) for 16 h at 37 °C and then washed 10 times with DMEM/F-12, pH 7.4, before adding cells for the indicated treatments. For invasion assays, cells were added to the upper chambers (4.0 × 104 cells/6.5 mm diameter chambers or 1.2 × 104 cells/12 mm diameter chambers) with indicated amounts of purified HPSE-1 and/or isolated syndecan-1. In some experiments, syndecan-1 (50 ng/ml), digested to remove core protein/HS chains, or mock controls including incubated enzyme/reagents and buffer were added with cells (300 μl) to the upper compartment of the chemoinvasion chambers (12 μm pore) in the presence of HPSE-1 (300 ng/ml). The lower chambers contained N-formyl-l-methyl-l-leucine-l-phenylalanine (5 nm) in DMEM/F-12 with 10% (v/v) FBS as chemoattractant. Cells were incubated in invasive chambers for 24–48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air (v/v) atmosphere. Cells that invaded through the membrane were released from the lower side of the filter and the lower well by trypsin-EDTA (10 min treatment; Sigma) after washing with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. They were then centrifuged and resuspended in calcein-AM (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells with dye were incubated 40 min at 37 °C and read in a 96-well plate using a Cytofluor 4000 multiwell fluorescent plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

https://openalex.org/W1990433000,"Ceramide has been demonstrated as one of the upstream regulators of telomerase activity. However, the role for ceramide in the control of telomere length remains unknown. It is shown here that treatment of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells with C6-ceramide results in rapid shortening of telomere length. During the examination of ceramide-regulated telomere-binding proteins, nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was identified to associate with both single- and double-stranded telomeric DNA with high specificity in vitro. The association of nuclear GAPDH with telomeres in interphase nuclei was also demonstrated by co-fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Further data demonstrated that the nuclear localization of GAPDH is regulated by ceramide in a cell cycle-dependent manner parallel with the inhibition of its telomere binding activity in response to ceramide. In addition, the results revealed that nuclear GAPDH is distinct from its cytoplasmic isoform and that telomere binding function of nuclear GAPDH is strikingly higher than the cytoplasmic isoform. More importantly, the functional role for nuclear GAPDH in the maintenance and/or protection of telomeric DNA was identified by partial inhibition of the expression of GAPDH using small interfering RNA, which resulted in rapid shortening of telomeres. In contrast, overexpression of nuclear GAPDH resulted in the protection of telomeric DNA in response to exogenous ceramide as well as in response to anticancer drugs, which have been shown to induce endogenous ceramide levels. Therefore, these results demonstrate a novel function for nuclear GAPDH in the maintenance and/or protection of telomeres and also show that mechanisms of the rapid degradation of telomeres in response to ceramide involve the inhibition of the telomere binding activity of nuclear GAPDH.

Telomeres, which are the DNA-protein complexes found at the end of chromosomes, play important roles in the protection of chromosome termini against degradation and fusion with other chromosome ends (for a review, see Ref. 1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Telomeres also function for the complete replication of chromosome ends, which can be extended by a specific reverse transcriptase, telomerase (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 3Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The telomeric ends of chromosomes comprise short tandem repeats of nucleotide sequences. Human telomeres have 5′-d(TTAGGG)-3′ repeats in the 5′-3′ orientation at the chromosome terminus, known as the G-strand, and this sequence is conserved in all vertebrates as well as in Trypanosoma, filamentous fungi, and slime molds. It has been demonstrated that the 3′-end of the G-strand is terminated with an unpaired overhang (4Klobutcher L.A. Swanton M.T. Donini P. Prescott D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 5Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that progressive shortening of telomere length in somatic cells leads to cellular senescence, whereas maintenance of telomeres at a critical length is associated with immortality in germ line and cancer cells (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that there are control mechanisms that monitor and regulate telomere length in these cells. It is well documented that telomeres are extended and maintained mainly by the activity of telomerase in the germ line and immortalized cells. However, telomerase activity is not present in various somatic and dividing primary cells, demonstrating that telomerase is not the sole determinant of telomere length. Numerous proteins that are associated with telomeric DNA have been identified to play roles in the regulation of telomere length in mammalian cells (6Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D.

TRF-1 and TRF-2 proteins have been localized to the ends of chromosomes (6Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T.

Recently Pot1, which has been identified as a single-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has been demonstrated to play a critical role in the protection of telomeric ends of chromosomes (13Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The human homologue of Pot1 has recently been shown to interact with telomere-binding proteins TRF-2 and hRap1 in the interphase nuclei of human cells (14Baumann P. Podell E. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and also shown to elongate telomeres by telomerase (15Colgin L.M. Baran K. Baumann P. Cech T.R. Reddel R.R. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 942-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The sphingolipid ceramide has been demonstrated to be a bioeffector molecule that plays roles in the signaling of biological stress responses such as apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence in various human cells (16Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Recent findings from our laboratory have revealed that ceramide is an upstream regulator of telomerase activity in human lung cancer cells (17Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that inactivation of telomerase involves rapid proteolysis of c-Myc transcription factor, which is shown to up-regulate hTERT promoter activity, via increased ubiquitination in response to ceramide (18Ogretmen B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. However, the role of ceramide in the regulation of telomere length was not determined previously. In this study, during the investigation of ceramide-regulated single-stranded (ss)-telomere-binding proteins, nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was identified to associate with telomeric DNA both in vitro and in situ. Further analysis showed that the nuclear localization of GAPDH is regulated by cell cycle-dependent mechanisms and that ceramide controls the telomere binding activity of GAPDH by inhibiting its nuclear localization. In addition, we report here that the nuclear isoform of GAPDH, which is responsible for telomere binding, is distinct from its cytoplasmic isoform. More importantly, the data presented here show the functional involvement of nuclear GAPDH in the maintenance and protection of telomeres against ceramide and chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, these results demonstrate that one of the mechanisms of ceramide-mediated rapid shortening of telomeres involves the inhibition of the unexpected and newly identified telomere binding activity of nuclear GAPDH. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The A549 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. Alice Boylan (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Cells were maintained in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 ng/ml penicillin, and 100 ng/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell-permeable and biologically active short chain ceramide (C6-ceramide) and its newly developed water-soluble analog LCL-124 were obtained from the Synthetic Lipid Core at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina. Doxorubicin was purchased from Sigma, and gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly. Telomere Length Assay—The measurements of telomere lengths were performed using a telomere restriction fragment length measurement kit (Roche Applied Science) by Southern blotting as described by the manufacturer. Determination of Telomerase Activity—Telomerase activity in cell extracts was measured by the PCR-based telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) using the TRAPeze kit (Intergen, Gaithersburg, MD), which includes a 36-bp internal control to allow quantification of activity as described previously (17Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Gel Shift Assays and Affinity Column Chromatography—The gel shift assays were performed as described previously (18Ogretmen B. Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Usta J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32506-32514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ss-telomere-binding proteins were partially purified from nuclear extracts (19Flamigni F. Faenza I. Marmiroli S. Stanic I. Giaccari A. Muscari C. Stefanelli C. Rossoni C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) by affinity chromatography using cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated Sepharose beads coupled with ss-(TTAGGG)3 oligonucleotide as described previously (20Ogretment B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The UV cross-linking studies were performed as we described elsewhere (20Ogretment B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Co-fluorescence in Situ Hybridization Analysis—Co-localization of nuclear GAPDH with telomeric DNA in interphase nuclei of A549 cells was performed by SeeDNA Biotech Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Nuclei and chromosome preparations were prepared as described previously (21Earnshaw W.C. Ratrie III, H. Stetten S. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). After hypotonic treatment, the nuclear/chromosomal suspension was fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and dropped onto the slides. Following rehydration in azide solution (10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3) for 15 min, slides were incubated in TEEN buffer (1 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 0.2 mm NaEDTA, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.05 Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min. Nuclear GAPDH was then visualized after incubation with the primary antibody (1:200) at 25 °C for 4 h, secondary antibody for 2 h, and extensive washes with the antibody detection buffer (10% goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100). Slides were then counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenolindole. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detection was performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peptide nucleic acid-telomere probe (Applied Biosystems) as described by the manufacturer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Analysis—The association of endogenous GAPDH with telomeric DNA in A549 cells was confirmed using a CHIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) as described by the manufacturer. Cells (about 107 cells) were treated with formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) for 60 min at 25 °C. Then cross-linked proteins (GAPDH, TRF-1, and TRF-2) were immunoprecipitated using anti-GAPDH (Chemicon) and -TRF-1 and -TRF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. After they were pulled down with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads, cross-links were reversed, and the proteins were separated from the DNA by chloroform extraction. The remaining DNA samples were loaded onto membranes by slot-blotting, and telomeric DNA was detected using digoxigenin-labeled telomeric probe by Southern blotting using a telomere restriction fragment length measurement kit (Roche Applied Science), and the signals were visualized using anti-digoxigenin antibody as described by the manufacturer. Normal IgGs were used as a negative control. Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% paraformaldehyde at 25 °C for 10 min, and protein localizations were visualized by immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy using mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Chemicon, MAB 374) or anti-His antibodies at 1:200 and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). The cell cycle profiles were determined using flow cytometry as described previously (17Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—The different isoforms of GAPDH in nucleus versus cytoplasm were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis utilizing the Protean isoelectric focusing system (Bio-Rad) with the first dimension isoelectric ready gel strips (Bio-Rad) containing a pH gradient from pH 3.0 to 10.0 over 8 cm as described by the manufacturer. Then proteins on the strips were separated in 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide second dimension gels, and different isoforms of GAPDH were detected by Western blotting. Plasmids, Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and Transfections—The complete cDNA for human GAPDH was kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Lemon (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The GAPDH cDNA was then cloned into pcDNA3(+) with 3′-His6 tag, which was then used for transfections of A549 cells as described previously (17Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M.

The siRNAs against GAPDH and hexokinase II were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Qiagen Biotechnology, and transfections of cells with siRNA molecules were performed using the Oligofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Rapid Shortening of Telomere Length and the Inhibition of Telomere Binding Activity of C1 Complex in Response to Ceramide—To determine whether ceramide is involved in the regulation of telomere length, A549 cells were treated with C6-ceramide, and then the length of telomere restriction fragments was measured by Southern blotting. Treatment with 20 μm C6-ceramide for 24 (Fig. 1A) and 96 h resulted in shortening of telomere restriction fragment length by around 300 ± 50 and 650 ± 80 bp, respectively, compared with that of untreated controls (Fig. 1, A and B). Since it has been previously demonstrated that ss-telomere-binding proteins, such as Pot1 in S. Pombe and Cdc13 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are involved in the protection of telomeres and that their deletion results in rapid loss of telomeres (13Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 23Pennock E. Buckley K. Lundblad V. Cell. 2001; 104: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of ceramide on ss-telomere-binding protein(s) in human A549 cells. Nuclear extracts were isolated from A549 cells grown in the absence or presence of 20 μm C6-ceramide for 24-96 h, and then gel shift assays were performed using the end-labeled G-rich strand of telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)3 as a probe. Interestingly one major telomere-protein complex (C1) was detected whose binding activity was inhibited about 75-80% in response to ceramide at 24-96 h in A549 cells when compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1C). UV Cross-linking following gel shift assay revealed that the molecular mass of the C1 protein is around 36-40 kDa (Fig. 1D). Telomere Binding Characteristics and Identification of Nuclear GAPDH in the C1 Complex—To determine the binding characteristics of the C1 protein to the ss-telomere probe (TTAGGG)3, gel shift assays were performed in the absence or presence of 250-fold unlabeled 18-mer competitors that contained either single-stranded TTAGGG, GGGATT, AATCCC, and CCCTAA or double-stranded TTAGGG and AATCCC (used as a nonspecific control) DNA sequences (Fig. 2A). The results showed that C1 binds to both ss-TTAGGG and ss-CCCTAA oligomers and also interacts with the ds-TTAGGG oligomer (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 5, and 7, respectively), whereas non-telomeric oligomers did not compete with the binding of C1 to the ss-TTAGGG probe (lanes 3, 4, and 6). Dose-response studies showed that C1 binds to both ss-TTAGGG and ss-CCCTAA oligomers with high affinity; concentrations of oligomers that inhibited binding by 50% were around 2 and <1 ng/μl, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-5 and 6-10, respectively). The ds-TTAGGG oligomer showed an IC50 of about 7.5 ng/μl (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the C1 complex interacts with both the G- and C-strand and also with the ds-telomeric DNA sequences but not with the non-telomeric oligomers, revealing that the C1 complex shows more specificity for binding to telomeric DNA sequences. To identify the C1 protein, the C1 complex was partially purified from A549 nuclear extracts (about 100 μg) by affinity chromatography using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B columns conjugated with the (TTAGGG)3 oligomer. The bound proteins were eluted in the presence of 0.2-0.8 m NaCl and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-5). The results showed that a single protein at 36-40 kDa was eluted with 0.8 m NaCl (Fig. 2C, lane 5). Other ss-telomere-binding proteins were also detected when higher amounts of nuclear extracts (>1-10 mg) were used in similar experiments (data not shown); however, since the C1 appeared to be the most abundant complex, we focused our attention on this complex. Then fractions from 0.6 and 0.8 m NaCl were used in UV cross-linking studies, and the results showed that the protein eluted with 0.8 m NaCl bound the ss-telomere probe in vitro (Fig. 2C, lane 7). After that, the affinity-purified C1 protein was subjected to amino-terminal peptide sequencing by Edman degradation. Four trypsin-digested C1 peptides were identical to GAPDH (Fig. 2D). These results were also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/nanospray mass spectrometry of the trypsin-digested peptides, which showed that the purified C1 complex was identical to GAPDH (data not shown). After identification of GAPDH as a candidate telomere-binding protein, its presence in the C1 complex was further confirmed by excising the gel fragment containing this complex and subjecting it to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Anti-GAPDH antibody detected a protein at 36-40 kDa, whereas no signal was detectable when the same membrane was blotted using normal mouse IgG (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that the C1 protein band contains predominantly GAPDH. Although the presence of other minor telomere-binding proteins in C1 complex might also be possible, there were no such proteins, other than GAPDH, detectable in this complex in our experiments. To determine whether authentic GAPDH can bind telomeric sequences, purified GAPDH from human erythrocytes was used in UV cross-linking studies directly in vitro. The results showed that purified GAPDH also binds ss-telomeric DNA probe; however, the amount of purified protein (0.75-1.0 μg) needed for telomere binding was relatively high (the possible reason for this is shown and discussed in Fig. 6). Nevertheless binding characteristics of the purified GAPDH were similar to the C1 complex, which interacted with the oligomer containing human ss-telomeric sequence (TTAGGG)3 but not with oligomers containing ss-telomeric sequences from Tetrahymena (TTGGGG)3 or Dictyostelium (GGGGAGGGAGGAGAGGGGAGGGAGGA) (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-4 and 6-8, respectively), which were used as unlabeled competitors in UV cross-linking studies. In addition, the presence of increasing concentrations of NAD+ (2-4 mm) inhibited the telomere binding activity of purified GAPDH and the C1-GAPDH complex in nuclear extracts (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-4 and 6-8, respectively), demonstrating the involvement of NAD+-binding site of GAPDH in telomere binding. Moreover, to determine whether the association of GAPDH with telomeric DNA requires tri-, di-, or mono-TTAGGG repeats, equal amounts of 32P-labeled ss-oligonucleotides containing (TTAGGG)3, (TTAGGG)2, and (TTAGGG)1 were used as a probe, and their association with purified GAPDH was assessed using UV cross-linking studies (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-3). The results showed that the binding of GAPDH to telomeric DNA is optimal when three telomeric repeats are present, its binding is significantly reduced to oligomer containing two telomeric repeats, and no binding was detected when only one telomeric repeat is present (Fig. 3C, lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Similar results were also observed with endogenous nuclear GAPDH when nuclear extracts were used in the above experiments (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that association of GAPDH possibly involves its NAD binding domain and requires at least three telomeric repeats (TTAGGG) for binding.Fig. 3The binding characterizations of GAPDH with telomeric DNA in vitro.A, binding of purified GAPDH from human erythrocytes (750 ng in CHAPS buffer) or nuclear extracts obtained from A549 cells (1 μg) to labeled ss-(TTAGGG)3 probe in the presence or absence of unlabeled oligomers containing human (TTAGGG)3, Tetrahymena (TTGGGG)3, and Dictyostelium (GGGGAGGGAGGAGAGGGGAGGGAGGA) telomere sequences (lanes 2-4 and 6-8, respectively) at 250-fold excess was examined by UV cross-linking studies. Lanes 1 and 5 contain binding with the probe in the absence of unlabeled oligomers. B, the involvement of NAD+-binding site with the association of purified GAPDH or in the C1 complex of nuclear extracts from A549 cells was determined using 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm NAD+ (lanes 1-4) or 0, 1, 2, and 4 mm NAD+ (lanes 5-8), respectively, as competitors in UV cross-linking studies. C, the requirements of a single, double, or triple TTAGGG repeat for the association of purified GAPDH was determined using oligomers (at 250-fold excess) containing (TTAGGG)3, (TTAGGG)2, or (TTAGGG)1 (lanes 1-3, respectively) in UV cross-linking studies as described in A. D, the association of purified hexokinase II (lane 2) with telomeres was examined as in A and compared with that of purified GAPDH (lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Purified GAPDH from chicken and rabbit muscle, which are >95% homologous to the human GAPDH, also showed binding to telomeric DNA sequences in vitro (data not shown), demonstrating that the binding of GAPDH to telomeric DNA may be conserved among vertebrates in which the TTAGGG telomeric sequence is also highly conserved. Other purified enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as hexokinase II (Fig. 3D, lane 2), lactate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase (data not shown), did not exhibit any detectable binding activity to the telomeric DNA sequences. The Association of Nuclear GAPDH with Telomeres in Situ—Although GAPDH is primarily known for its glycolytic function, several studies over the past decade have demonstrated several non-glycolytic functions, including membrane fusion, microtubule bundling, phosphotransferase activity, nuclear tRNA transport, and DNA replication and repair (for a review, see Ref. 24Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). It is also known that GAPDH may be detected in the nucleus in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence using a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes GAPDH (25Singh R. Green M.R.

https://openalex.org/W1983602710,"Abstract The membrane potential (Δψ) of the mature asexual form of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, isolated from its host erythrocyte using a saponin permeabilization technique, was investigated using both the radiolabeled Δψ indicator tetraphenylphosphonium ([3H]TPP+) and the fluorescent Δψ indicator DiBAC4(3) (bis-oxonol). For isolated parasites suspended in a high Na+, low K+ solution, Δψ was estimated from the measured distribution of [3H]TPP+ to be –95 ± 2 mV. Δψ was reduced by the specific V-type H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1, by the H+ ionophore CCCP, and by glucose deprivation. Acidification of the parasite cytosol (induced by the addition of lactate) resulted in a transient hyperpolarization, whereas a cytosolic alkalinization (induced by the addition of ) resulted in a transient depolarization. A decrease in the extracellular pH resulted in a membrane depolarization, whereas an increase in the extracellular pH resulted in a membrane hyperpolarization. The parasite plasma membrane depolarized in response to an increase in the extracellular K+ concentration and hyperpolarized in response to a decrease in the extracellular K+ concentration and to the addition of the K+ channel blockers Ba2+ or Cs+ to the suspending medium. The data are consistent with Δψ of the intraerythrocytic P. falciparum trophozoite being due to the electrogenic extrusion of H+ via the V-type H+ pump at the parasite surface. The current associated with the efflux of H+ is countered, in part, by the influx of K+ via Ba2+- and Cs+-sensitive K+ channels in the parasite plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1996694491,"In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, erythrocyte invasion by circulating merozoites may occur via two distinct pathways involving either a sialic acid-dependent or -independent mechanism. Earlier, we identified two nonglycosylated exofacial regions of erythrocyte band 3 termed 5ABC and 6A as an important host receptor in the sialic acid-independent invasion pathway. 5ABC, a major segment of this receptor, interacts with the 42-kDa processing product of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP142) through its 19-kDa C-terminal domain. Here, we show that two regions of merozoite surface protein 9 (MSP9), also known as acidic basic repeat antigen, interact directly with 5ABC during erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. Native MSP9 as well as recombinant polypeptides derived from two regions of MSP9 (MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2) interacted with both 5ABC and intact erythrocytes. Soluble 5ABC added to the assay mixture drastically diminished the binding of MSP9 to erythrocytes. Recombinant MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 present in the culture medium blocked P. falciparum reinvasion into erythrocytes in vitro. Native MSP9 and MSP142, the two ligands binding to the 5ABC receptor, existed as a stable complex. Our results establish a novel concept wherein the merozoite exploits a specific complex of co-ligands on its surface to target a single erythrocyte receptor during invasion.

This new paradigm poses a new challenge in the development of a vaccine for blood stage malaria. Erythrocyte invasion by circulating malaria merozoites occurs through a multi-step process requiring specific host-parasite interactions at the molecular level. In human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, erythrocyte invasion is thought to proceed via two distinctive pathways involving either a sialic acid-dependent or -independent mechanism (1Mitchell G.H.

In the sialic acid-dependent invasion pathway, the sialic acid moiety on erythrocyte glycophorin A was identified as a major invasion receptor binding the merozoite ligand, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) 1The abbreviations used are: EBAerythrocyte-binding antigenADGal4 activation domainBDGal4 DNA-binding domainMSPmerozoite surface proteinRAPrhoptry-associated proteinTrxthioredoxinY2Hyeast two-hybridGSTglutathione S-transferasepAbpolyclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineHRPhorseradish peroxidaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaymAbmonoclonal antibody.

The C terminus (F2 domain) of the N-terminal cysteine-rich region (region II) of EBA-175 was shown as the glycophorin A-binding site (5Sim B.K. Chitnis C.E. Wasniowska K. Hadley T.J. Miller L.H. Science. 1994; 264: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Another sialic acid-dependent invasion mechanism utilizing erythrocyte glycophorin C and P. falciparum BABEL (also known as EBP-2 and EBA-140) has also been reported (6Maier A.G. Duraisingh M.T.

Lustigman S. Blood. 2003; 101: 4628-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the region II/F2 domain of BABEL inhibited P. falciparum invasion into erythrocytes (6Maier A.G. Duraisingh M.T. Reeder J.C. Patel S.S. Kazura J.W. Zimmerman P.A. Cowman A.F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), implicating a common erythrocyte receptor-binding feature in sialic acid-dependent invasion mechanisms. Recently, it has been suggested that P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue protein 1 (PfRh1, also known as PfNBP-1) binds to erythrocytes via a distinct sialic acid-dependent trypsin-resistant host receptor (9Rayner J.C. Vargas-Serrato E. Huber C.S. Galinski M.R. Barnwell J.W. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1571-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). P. falciparum JESEBL (also known as EBA-181) is an invasion ligand binding to an unidentified erythrocyte sialoglycoprotein resistant to trypsin and sensitive to chymotrypsin (10Gilberger T.W.

Mounting evidence nonetheless suggests that the sialic acid-dependent invasion pathway is dispensable in P. falciparum malaria. When the Dd2 line favoring a sialic acid-dependent invasion mechanism was propagated in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes where sialic acid residues were removed from the erythrocyte surface, the parasite switched to a sialic acid-independent invasion phenotype (Dd2/Nm) (2Dolan S.A. Miller L.H. Wellems T.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Disrupting the C-terminal region of EBA-175 in the Dd2/Nm clone by gene targeting had no effect on erythrocyte invasion (11Kaneko O. Fidock D.A. Schwartz O.M. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A similar truncation of EBA-175 switched the sialic acid-dependent W2-mef strain to a sialic acid-independent line (12Reed M.B. Caruana S.R. Batchelor A.H. Thompson J.K. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7509-7514Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lacking the expression of either EBA-175 (13Duraisingh M.T. Maier A.G. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4796-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or BABEL (6Maier A.G. Duraisingh M.T. Reeder J.C. Patel S.S. Kazura J.W. Zimmerman P.A. Cowman A.F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) had little effect on erythrocyte invasion in both W2-mef (sialic acid-dependent) and 3D7 (sialic acid-independent) strains. Interestingly, disrupting JESEBL expression by gene targeting did not affect the erythrocyte invasion of the W2-mef strain but appeared to be deleterious in the 3D7 strain (10Gilberger T.W.

In fact, P. falciparum field isolates commonly use the sialic acid-independent invasion pathway (14Okoyeh J.N. Pillai C.R. Chitnis C.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5784-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its importance in malaria pathogenesis, the latter invasion pathway remains unclear at the molecular level. For example, a chymotrypsin-sensitive, trypsin-resistant, sialic acid-independent erythrocyte invasion receptor binding the P. falciparum PfRh2b ligand is yet to be identified (15Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Ralph S.A. Rayner J.C. Barnwell J.W. McFadden G.I. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified two exofacial regions of human band 3 termed 5ABC and 6A that function as a crucial erythrocyte receptor in the P. falciparum sialic acid-independent invasion pathway (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 5ABC, a major segment of this receptor, interacted with MSP142 through its conserved 19-kDa C-terminal domain (MSP119) and blocked the binding of MSP142 to intact erythrocytes (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We also reported that the band 3 receptor interacts directly with a number of unidentified merozoite proteins (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An earlier study has suggested that band 3 could interact with the N-terminal cysteine-rich region of P. falciparum MSP9, also known as acidic basic repeat antigen and p101 (17Kushwaha A. Perween A. Mukund S. Majumdar S. Bhardwaj D. Chowdhury N.R. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide compelling evidence that two regions encoded by amino acids 77–183 and 364–528 of MSP9 interact directly with the 5ABC segment of band 3 during P. falciparum invasion into erythrocytes and that native MSP9 and MSP142 form a co-ligand complex that binds to the invasion receptor 5ABC on the erythrocyte surface. Based on these findings, we propose a model illustrating a novel concept in host-parasite interaction during erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The P. falciparum (3D7 strain) cDNA library was constructed using HybriZap kit (Stratagene) as described (18Daly T.M. Long C.A. Bergman L.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) from a pool of asynchronous parasite culture. Yeast PJ69–2a (Clontech) was transformed with the phagemid cDNA library resulting 9.8 × 106 independent transformants (calculated library titer, 7.1 × 107 colony-forming unit/ml). The average size of cDNA inserts was ∼1.2 kilo-base pairs. The bait construct pGBKT7-5ABC (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) transformed into yeast Y187 (Clontech) lacked autonomous transcriptional activation of the reporter gene. The library screening was performed using MATCH-MAKER two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech) based on yeast mating. Agar plates prepared with the minimal synthetic dropout medium lacking Trp and Leu (SD/-T-L); Trp, Leu, and His (SD/-T-L-H); Trp, Leu, and Ade (SD/-T-L-A); and Trp, Leu, His, and Ade (SD/-T-L-H-A) were used. Constructs Used in Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—MSP9/Δ3, MSP9/Δ4, and MSP9/Δ5 genes were amplified by PCR from P. falciparum (3D7) genomic DNA and cloned into pAD-GAL4-2.1 (Stratagene). The 3AB gene was cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech) by PCR as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were: 5′-GCCGGATCCAATCAAAAAGCTACCTACTC (MSP9/Δ3, 700–719, sense, BamHI); 5′-GGCCTCGAGCATATTTAATTCATCTAAA (MSP9/Δ3, 1221–1239, antisense, XhoI); 5′-GCCGGATCCAATAAAAACGACAAGAACC (MSP9/Δ4, 220–238, sense, BamHI); 5′-GGCCTCGAGTTCTTTGCATTCTTCTTTTA (MSP9/Δ4, 365–384, antisense, XhoI); 5′-GCCGGATCCAATGAAACTGTATCTGGTATG (MSP9/Δ5, 1735–1755, sense, BamHI); 5′-GCCGAATTCTTTTGATTCTTCAGTTGTCAA (MSP9/Δ5, 2359–2379, antisense, XhoI); 5′-GCCGAATTCTCCAAGCTGATCAAGATCT (3AB, sense, 1726–1744, EcoRI); and 5′-ATAGGATCCTTATGTGTTGGGCAGGGGGCC (3AB, anti-sense, 1807–1824, BamHI). The expression of Y2H constructs as soluble fusion proteins in yeast AH109 and/or YJN192 (protease-deficient strain) was confirmed using Western blot. Protein Expression in Bacteria—The MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 genes were subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences) from their respective pAD-GAL4-2.1 plasmids using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. GST-5ABC was expressed using pGEX-2TK/5ABC (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene) and affinity-purified using GSH beads. For mass spectrometry, purified GST-MSP9/Δ1 sample was concentrated in water using Amicon Ultra-4/10K (Millipore). The 5ABC gene was subcloned into pET32a (Novagen) from pGBKT7/5ABC using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. Trx-5ABC was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and affinity-purified using a His6 tag encoded between the two fusion domains. Polyclonal Antibody—The rabbits were injected subcutaneously with ∼150 μg of GST-MSP9/Δ2 in complete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce). Five booster injections were given every 4 weeks with the same amount of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The collected sera were adsorbed with the whole cell acetone powder made from E. coli DH5α induced to overexpress recombinant GST. The resulting sera contained pAb reactive to the MSP9/Δ2 but not GST domain in Western blot (data not shown) and were termed anti-MSP9/Δ2 pAb. Recombinant MSP9-5ABC Binding—GST-MSP9/Δ1 and GSTMSP9/Δ2 were biotinylated as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the GST domain was removed using PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). GST-5ABC (20 μm) conjugated to GSH beads was incubated (4 °C overnight; final volume, 350 μl) with biotinylated MSP9/Δ1 (8 μm) or MSP9/Δ2 (8 μm) in binding buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The beads were sedimented by low speed centrifugation and washed three times with PBS. GST (20 μm) conjugated to GSH beads were used as control. Biotinylated proteins associated with the beads were detected by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated Neutravidin (Pierce). ELISA—Affinity-purified GST-MSP9/Δ1a, GST-MSP9/Δ2, and GST (each 0.6 μm, 100 μl) eluted from GSH beads were coated onto a 96-well ELISA plate (4 °C overnight). The wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Trx-5ABC bearing His6 tag between the two fusion domains was added to the resulting wells in varying concentrations (0–12 μm) and incubated in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% bovine serum albumin (25 °C, 3 h). The wells were washed with PBS-T, and each sample was incubated with HRP-conjugated and affinity-purified anti-His6 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for2hat room temperature. The wells were washed with PBS-T extensively and treated with a solution of TMB substrate (Pierce). The reaction was stopped after 15 min by adding 2 m H2SO4 (100 μl), and the color was measured at 450 nm. Relatively low background binding (A450, 0.06–0.15) originating from the GST domain (GST control sample) was subtracted for each Trx-5ABC sample. The binding data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (Ligand macro for one-site saturation binding) assuming 1:1 binding between Trx-5ABC and the affinity-purified anti-His6 pAb. Background binding of Trx (containing His6 tag) control samples to GST-MSP9/Δ1a, GST-MSP9/Δ2, and GST was negligible (not shown) and was not subtracted. The dissociation constants (means ± S.E.) were determined from duplicate experiments. Recombinant MSP9 Binding to Erythrocytes—In the binding assay, biotinylated GST-MSP9/Δ1 (20 μm) or GST-MSP9/Δ2 (20 μm) eluted from GSH beads was incubated with human erythrocytes (50 μl, 50% hematocrit) in binding buffer B (binding buffer A without Triton X-100) for 2 h at room temperature (final volume, 350 μl). The erythrocytes were sedimented (14,000 rpm, 30 s), washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 5.0 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The resulting erythrocyte ghosts were washed twice in PBS and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using HRP-conjugated Neutravidin. Biotinylated GST (20 μm) was used as control. In the binding inhibition assay, Trx-5ABC (30 μm) was incubated with biotinylated GST-MSP9/Δ1 (20 μm) or GST-MSP9/Δ2 (20 μm) in binding buffer B (2 h at room temperature; final volume, 300 μl). Human erythrocytes (50 μl, 50% hematocrit) were then added to this mixture and further incubated (2 h, room temperature). The erythrocytes were sedimented and analyzed as above by Western blot. Trx (30 μm) was used as control. Native MSP9 and MSP1 Binding Assays—The P. falciparum (3D7) culture supernatant (350 μl) prepared as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was incubated with GST-5ABC (20 μm), GST-MSP9/Δ1 (20 μm), or GST-MSP9/Δ2 (20 μm) conjugated to GSH beads (50 μl, 50% slurry) at 4 °C overnight. After low speed centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, and the proteins associated with the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-MSP9/Δ2 pAb (for GST-5ABC sample) or mAb 5.2 reactive against P. falciparum MSP119 (for GST-MSP9/Δ1 and Δ2 samples). GST (20 μm) beads were used as control. Human erythrocytes (packed volume, 25 μl) were incubated with the P. falciparum culture supernatant (2 h at room temperature; 300 μl). As described above in the recombinant MSP9 binding assay, the erythrocytes were sedimented and analyzed by Western blot using anti-MSP9/Δ2 pAb. Human erythrocytes incubated in only the culture medium were used as control. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—The P. falciparum (3D7) culture supernatant and merozoite protein extract, prepared as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), were precleared with protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 24 h. The precleared supernatant (400 μl) or protein extract (350 μl) was incubated with anti-MSP9/Δ2 pAb (20 μl) at 4 °C overnight, followed by protein G beads (40 μl, 50% slurry) at 4 °C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the beads (pellet) were washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Immune complex polypeptides associated with the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using mAb 5.2 and mAb 7H8/50 obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center. The rabbit preimmune serum was used as control. P. falciparum cDNA Library Screening—To identify malaria merozoite proteins interacting directly with the erythrocyte invasion receptor band 3, we carried out a Y2H screening of a P. falciparum (3D7 strain) cDNA library using the 5ABC segment (amino acids 720–761) of human band 3 as bait (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cDNA library containing ∼9.8 × 106 independent transformants was subjected to multiple rounds of selection with increasing stringency to yield 20 Ade+/His+/α-Gal+/β-Gal+ colonies. Selection was based on the expression of the ADE2, HIS3, MEL1, and/or LacZ reporter genes using the yeast mating method. Plasmids from positive colonies were isolated from yeast cells and transformed into E. coli DH5α. Transformants containing the recombinant library plasmid pAD-GAL4-2.1 were selected on LB/ampicillin plates. The P. falciparum cDNA inserts contained in the library plasmids were sequenced to identify the positive clones. Blast analysis using the data base at NCBI and PlasmoDB revealed 10 false positive library plasmids encoding incorrect reading frames. Two overlapping segments (MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2; Fig. 1) of the P. falciparum MSP9 (or acidic basic repeat antigen) gene (19Weber J.L. Lyon J.A. Wolff R.H. Hall T. Lowell G.H. Chulay J.D. J. Biol.

Mapping MSP9-5ABC Interaction by Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Based on the cDNA library screening results, we attempted to map the 5ABC-binding sites in the entire MSP9 polypeptide using the Y2H system. Three truncated MSP9 gene segments, namely MSP9/Δ3, MSP9/Δ4, and MSP9/Δ5 (Fig. 1), were cloned into pAD-GAL4-2.1 as a fusion to the Gal4 activation domain (AD). Recombinant pAD-GAL4-2.1 plasmids containing each of the three MSP9 truncations as well as MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 obtained from the library screen were transformed into yeast AH109 (Clontech). Recombinant pGBKT7 plasmids containing segments of human band 3 gene corresponding to the 5ABC, 6AB (amino acids 807–842), and 3AB (amino acids 538–570) domains were prepared as a fusion to Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BD) and transformed into AH109 as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The expression of MSP9 and band 3 constructs was confirmed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against the AD and BD (Fig. 2A). All of the fusion constructs except MSP9/Δ1 were stably expressed in yeast cells as soluble protein. Expression of AD-MSP9/Δ1 (calculated mass, 66.6 kDa) was observed as two lower molecular mass bands with sizable truncations predicted at the C terminus of the fusion protein (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Using recombinant pAD-GAL4-2.1 and pGBKT7 plasmids, we performed Y2H assays by a co-transformation method in AH109 as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). AD-MSP9/Δ3, AD-MSP9/Δ4, and AD-MSP9/Δ5 did not interact with BD-3AB, BD-5ABC, and BD-6AB (Table I). On the other hand, both MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 interacted strongly with 5ABC but not with 6AB and 3AB under varying stringency conditions. These Y2H assay results confirm our cDNA library screening data obtained by the yeast mating method and suggest that there are two distinct 5ABC-binding domains located separately in MSP9/Δ2 and the N terminus of MSP9/Δ1.Table IMSP9-band 3 interactions in yeast two-hybrid systemConstructsAssay stringencyAD-MSP9BD-band 3SD/-T-LSD/-T-L-HSD/-T-L-H-AΔ13AB---Δ15ABC++++++Δ16AB---Δ23AB---Δ25ABC++++++Δ26AB---Δ33AB---Δ35ABC---Δ36AB---Δ43AB---Δ45ABC---Δ46AB---Δ53AB---Δ55ABC---Δ56AB--- Open table in a new tab Characterization of MSP9-Band 3 Interaction in Solution—To characterize the interaction of 5ABC with MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 identified in the Y2H system, we took an approach using solution binding methods. MSP9/Δ1 and MSP9/Δ2 were expressed in bacteria and purified as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2B). Similar to expression in yeast, MSP9/Δ1 was expressed as two lower mass proteins (lanes 3 and 8) designated GST-MSP9/Δ1a (arrow; apparent mass, 45 kDa) and GST-MSP9/Δ1b (arrowhead; apparent mass, 29 kDa). These two GST fusion proteins had truncations at the C terminus as shown by the Coomassie gel and anti-GST Western blotting analysis. Proteolytic cleavage of the GST domain from the mixture of GST-MSP9/Δ1a and GST-MSP9/Δ1b beads provided MSP9/Δ1a (apparent mass, 17 kDa) in the supernatant (lane 4). MSP9/Δ1b could not be detected by SDS-PAGE, presumably because of its low molecular mass (<3 kDa). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analysis of GST-MSP9/Δ1a showed the exact mass of 46,420.3 Da (Fig. 2C). The N-terminal sequencing of this polypeptide showed that the entire GST domain (27.8 kDa) is intact (data not shown), indicating that the N and C termini of MSP9/Δ1a are Lys-77 and Glu-235, respectively (Fig. 1). Similarly, the mass spectrometric analysis of GST-MSP9/Δ1b showed a mass of 29,827.7, indicating that the C terminus of MSP9/Δ1b is Met-93. Expression and purification of GSTMSP9/Δ2 (apparent mass, 50 kDa; Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 7) followed by a proteolytic cleavage of GST afforded soluble MSP9/Δ2 (apparent mass, 26 kDa; lane 2). Our attempt to express full-length MSP9 (lacking signaling peptide) as a GST fusion protein in bacteria was not successful as similarly noted by others (21Kushwaha A. Rao P.P. Duttu V.S. Malhotra P. Chauhan V.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To carry out a solution binding assay, we labeled GSTMSP9/Δ1 (as a mixture of GST-MSP9/Δ1a and GST-MSP9/Δ1b) and GST-MSP9/Δ2 with biotin and removed the GST domain by proteolysis. Biotinylated MSP9/Δ1a and MSP9/Δ2 bound to GST-5ABC beads but not to control GST beads in the solution binding assay, demonstrating the direct and specific interaction of 5ABC with MSP9/Δ1a and MSP9/Δ2 (Fig. 3A). Although same binding conditions were employed for both MSP9 constructs, different levels of biotin labeling between GSTMSP9/Δ1 and GST-MSP9/Δ2 (not shown) precluded a further interpretation of the binding assay data. To analyze these interactions quantitatively, we carried out an ELISA using varying concentrations of soluble 5ABC expressed as a Trx fusion protein (Fig. 2D) and unlabeled GST-MSP9/Δ1a (as a mixture with GST-MSP9/Δ1b) and GST-MSP9/Δ2 immobilized on the ELISA plate. Dissociation constants determined for the interaction of Trx-5ABC with MSP9/Δ1a (possibly as a mixture with MSP9/Δ1b) and MSP9/Δ2 were 286 ± 53 nm and 945 ± 152 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). 5ABC-mediated Binding of MSP9 to Erythrocytes—Biotinylated GST-MSP9/Δ1 (as a mixture of GST-MSP9/Δ1a and GSTMSP9/Δ1b) or biotinylated GST-MSP9/Δ2 was incubated with fresh human erythrocytes in suspension. GST-MSP9/Δ1a (Fig. 3C, lane 2, arrow) and GST-MSP9/Δ2 (lane 3, arrowhead) bound specifically to erythrocytes but not GST-MSP9/Δ1b (lane 2). Biotinylated GST (control) in an equivalent concentration did not interact with erythrocytes (lane 1), indicating that the interactions were specific to the MSP9/Δ1a and MSP9/Δ2 domains. When soluble Trx-5ABC was added to the binding assay mixture, the erythrocyte interaction with both MSP9/Δ1a (Fig. 3C, lane 4) and MSP9/Δ2 (lane 6) was drastically diminished. The Trx domain alone added to the assay mixture did not affect the binding (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 7). These results suggest that the binding of MSP9/Δ1a and MSP9/Δ2 to erythrocytes is mediated by the 5ABC receptor. To obtain conclusive evidence supporting this implication, we produced a pAb against the MSP9/Δ2 domain in rabbit. The MSP9/Δ2 pAb reacted to native MSP9 (apparent mass, 101 kDa) present in the P. falciparum culture supernatant in Western blot (Fig. 3D, lane 1). Indeed, native MSP9 in the culture supernatant bound specifically to the 5ABC domain (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4) as well as intact human erythrocytes (lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MSP9 interacts directly with erythrocytes through its Δ1a and Δ2 domains utilizing the 5ABC region of band 3 as the receptor, presumably during P. falciparum merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. Blocking of P. falciparum Reinvasion Using Recombinant MSP9 —To investigate the biological significance of MSP9/Δ1a and MSP9/Δ2 domains binding to the host band 3 peptide 5ABC during erythrocyte invasion, we carried out an erythrocyte reinvasion inhibition assay in P. falciparum (3D7) culture as described (16Goel V.K. Li X. Chen H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Oh S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5164-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) using soluble GST-MSP9/Δ1a (12 μm) and GST-MSP9/Δ2 (12 μm) as inhibitors. As compared with the GST (12 μm) control sample, both GST-MSP9/Δ1a and GSTMSP9/Δ2 samples showed drastically reduced reinvasion rates in cultures having relatively low (1.8%) as well as high (6.5%) parasitemia (Fig. 4). Relative reinvasion rates observed for each MSP9 construct were quite similar at both parasitemia levels; GST-MSP9/Δ1a samples showed 27% (p = 0.0002; 1.8% parasitemia) and 31% (p = 0.00006; 6.5% parasitemia) reinvasion rates, when the rate for the respective GST sample was taken as 100%.

https://openalex.org/W1997074783,"RGS proteins act as negative regulators of G protein signaling by serving as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) for α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα), thereby accelerating G protein inactivation. RGS proteins can also block Gα-mediated signal production by competing with downstream effectors for Gα binding. Little is known about the relative contribution of GAP and effector antagonism to the inhibitory effect of RGS proteins on G protein-mediated signaling. By comparing the inhibitory effect of RGS2, RGS3, RGS5, and RGS16 on Gαq-mediated phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) activation under conditions where GTPase activation is possible versus nonexistent, we demonstrate that members of the R4 RGS subfamily differ significantly in their dependence on GTPase acceleration. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either muscarinic M3 receptors, which couple to endogenous Gq protein and mediate a stimulatory effect of carbachol on PLCβ, or constitutively active Gαq*, which is inert to GTP hydrolysis and activates PLCβ independent of receptor activation. In M3-expressing cells, all of the RGS proteins significantly blunted the efficacy and potency of carbachol. In contrast, Gαq* -induced PLCβ activation was inhibited by RGS2 and RGS3 but not RGS5 and RGS16. The observed differential effects were not due to changes in M3, Gαq/Gαq*, PLCβ, or RGS expression, as shown by receptor binding assays and Western blots. We conclude that closely related R4 RGS family members differ in their mechanism of action. RGS5 and RGS16 appear to depend on G protein inactivation, whereas GAP-independent mechanisms (such as effector antagonism) are sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effect of RGS2 and RGS3.

RGS5 and RGS16 appear to depend on G protein inactivation, whereas GAP-independent mechanisms (such as effector antagonism) are sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effect of RGS2 and RGS3. Many extracellular stimuli elicit intracellular responses by activating seven-transmembrane receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins comprising α and βγ subunits (1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The duration of the response of a cell to external signals is largely determined by the activation/inactivation cycle of G proteins. Activated receptors trigger GTP-for-GDP exchange on Gα subunits, thus dissociating Gα from Gβ γ and subsequent activation of downstream effectors (such as enzymes and ion channels). The duration of G protein activation is limited by GTPase activity intrinsic to Gα subunits that catalyzes the conversion of active GTP-bound Gα into inactive GDP-bound Gα, which in turn can reassociate with Gβγ and receptors. RGS proteins belong to a family of more than 20 proteins with a conserved RGS core domain of ∼120 amino acids that is necessary and sufficient for binding to Gα subunits (3Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). They are divided into several subfamilies based on their structural similarities, gene organization, and function. RGS proteins act as regulators of G protein signaling by limiting the signals generated by G protein-coupled receptors. They markedly increase the rate at which Gα subunits hydrolyze GTP to GDP, a property that defines them as GTPase-activating proteins (or GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinPLCphospholipase CHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinPLCphospholipase CHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). (4Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Hastening of Gα inactivation facilitates the reassociation of Gα with Gβγ subunits. As a result, RGS proteins inhibit both Gα- and Gβγ-mediated downstream effects. GAP effects have been described for virtually all proteins featuring an RGS core domain (5Wieland T. Mittmann C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 95-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Some RGS proteins can also diminish Gα-mediated signal generation by functionally inhibiting Gα-effector coupling (so-called effector antagonism) (6Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The absolute requirement and relative significance of the GAP effect and GAP-independent mechanisms for negative regulation of G protein-mediated signaling pathways by RGS proteins in mammalian cells are still poorly understood.

GTPase-activating protein phospholipase C hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). In the present study, we compared the effect of RGS proteins in a setting where they can exert GAP function with one where GAP function cannot be elicited to test the following hypotheses: (i) that RGS proteins do not necessarily depend on their GAP function to modulate mammalian cell signaling and (ii) that the relative contribution of their GAP and effector antagonistic effects differs among different RGS proteins. We examined several members of the R4 RGS protein subfamily (RGS2, RGS3, RGS5, and RGS16), because they are primarily composed of the RGS core domain and have the shortest N- and C-terminal flanking regions among the entire RGS family. Other RGS subfamilies contain longer N- and C-terminal sequences with various additional structural and functional domains that serve as binding sites for other proteins and impart subfamily specific activities, subcellular localization, or regulation (4Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Because RGS3 has a much longer N terminus than all of the other R4 subfamily members (8Kehrl J.H. Srikumar D. Harrison K. Wilson G.L. Shi C.S. Genomics. 2002; 79: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we included RGS3s, an RGS3 isoform with a N-terminal flanking region comparable in size to other R4 RGS proteins, in this study (9Reif K. Cyster J.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4720-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All R4 RGS family members interact with Gq and Gi/o proteins in vitro and accelerate their inactivation (4Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar); for many, inhibition of Gq- and Gi/o-mediated signaling has been demonstrated in mammalian cells (10De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We selected Gq-mediated PLCβ activation as read-out for the present study, because effector antagonism has been described as a potential mechanism of action for modulation of Gq signaling by RGS proteins (6Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol.

M3 receptors were expected to couple to endogenously expressed Gq, which is subject to the activation/inactivation cycle characteristic for heterotrimeric G proteins. In contrast, Gαq* is inert to GTP hydrolysis and therefore does not depend on receptor activation to stimulate PLCβ (12Qian N.X. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4077-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Comparing the inhibitory effect of each RGS protein in both settings provided direct insight about the functional importance of GTPase activation for the inhibitory effect of RGS proteins on Gq-mediated signaling in vivo. We demonstrate that R4 RGS proteins differ greatly in their dependence on GAP activation as a mechanism of action. RGS5 and RGS16 did not exert any inhibitory effect when they were unable to act as a GAP, whereas RGS2 and RGS3 markedly blunted Gq-mediated signaling even in the absence of GAP, suggesting that other mechanisms, such as effector antagonism, are sufficient to mediate their inhibitory effect. Generation of cDNA Constructs—The cDNA for mouse HA epitope-tagged, constitutively active G protein α Q209L subunit (Gαq*) (13Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pcDNA3. RGS proteins were tagged at their N or C terminus with a FLAG epitope by PCR. RGS2 (11Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), RGS3s (9Reif K. Cyster J.G. J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were used as templates. The PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with convenient restriction sites. All of the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs encoding muscarinic M3 receptor and Gαq as well as PLCβ1 were kind gifts from the late Drs. E. Peralta and E. J. Neer, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were maintained in complete growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). They were transiently transfected for 48 h with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and DNA at an 8:1 ratio (w/w). The amount of plasmid transfected in each experiment varied (see figure legends for details). Empty pcDNA3 vector was used to keep the amount of total DNA transfected per well constant. 35S Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were labeled metabolically, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated as previously described (16Zhang W. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2503-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, the cells on 6-well plates were starved for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-deficient medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by metabolic labeling in the same medium containing 35S-Express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 150 μCi/ml) for 4 h. The cells were rinsed in PBS and then lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 plus proteinase inhibitors. The lysates were precleared with protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with a FLAG antibody (M2, 4 μg/ml; Sigma) overnight at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 50 μl of protein G-agarose (50% slurry in PBS) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The resins were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and once with PBS. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 3× Laemmli sample buffer and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled protein bands were examined by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in buffer containing 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C. Total cell lysates were size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Ponceau S staining was used to confirm equal loading and transfer. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with antibodies against HA (12CA5, 1:1000; BabCo), FLAG (M2, 1:3000; Sigma), Gαq (SC-392, 1:1000; Santa Cruz), PLCβ1 (SC-205, 1:500; Santa Cruz), and PLCβ3 (SC-403, 1:500; Santa-Cruz). After three washes in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, the proteins of interest were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Measurement of [3H]Inositol Phosphate Formation—PLC activity was assessed by measuring total inositol phosphate formation in 12-well plates (13Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h after transient transfection, the cells were labeled in inositol-free medium supplemented with myo[3H]inositol (2 μCi/well; Amersham Biosciences) overnight. The next day, LiCl (final concentration, 10 mm) was added before the addition of carbachol (10–7–10–3m). After 30 min at 37 °C, the inositol phosphates were extracted in 20 mm formic acid, neutralized, separated by anion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG1-X8), and quantitated in a scintillation counter. Cell density and protein amount were monitored for each of the different transfection conditions. The data are expressed as cpm/well. Normalization to the protein amount in each well yielded similar results (data not shown). Pertussis Toxin Treatment and Back ADP Ribosylation—Thirty-six hours after transfection, the COS-7 cells were treated with 100 ng/well pertussis toxin or vehicle for 12 h. Measurement of [3H]inositol phosphate formation was then carried out as described above. To confirm the efficiency of the ADP-ribosylation in vivo, in vitro “back ADP-ribosylation” was performed. Pertussis toxin- and vehicle-treated cells were harvested, and their membrane and cytosolic fractions were obtained by 100,000 × g ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg of protein/tube) were added to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 μm NAD (with 0.5 μCi of [32P]NAD), 3mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 12.5 mm isoniazid, 10 mm thymidine, and 10 ng of pertussis toxin that had been preactivated in 20 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 30 °C. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of the dried gels. Muscarinic Receptor Binding Assay—COS-7 cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with 7.5–4000 pmN-methyl-[3H]scopalamine (84 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of atropine (1 μm) to determine nonspecific binding. The binding reaction was stopped by removing the labeling medium and washing the wells twice with ice-cold PBS, followed by cell lysis in 0.2 m NaOH and 0.1% SDS. For each lysate, the amount of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting and normalized to the amount of protein present (DC protein assay; Bio-Rad). Saturation binding assays were fitted by nonlinear regression (one-site binding model) using GraphPad Prism 4 to determine the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) and radioligand binding affinity (Kd). Statistical Analysis—The data represent the means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Where appropriate, the statistical differences were assessed by Student's unpaired t test. GraphPad Prism 4 was used to fit dose-response curves by nonlinear regression and to probe for statistical differences (maximal effect and logEC50) in the presence or absence of exogenous RGS. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study was designed to compare the inhibitory effect of R4 RGS proteins on Gαq-mediated PLCβ activation under conditions where GTPase activation is possible versus nonexistent. This was achieved by transiently transfecting COS-7 cells with either muscarinic M3 receptors or constitutively active Gαq* in the presence or absence of RGS2, RGS3, RGS5, or RGS16. Fig. 1A illustrates the two different transfection systems and our rationale for using them in the present study. (i) In M3-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A, right side), PLCβ activation in response to receptor activation with carbachol was expected to be mediated by endogenous Gq/11 proteins. COS-7 cells were chosen to limit the contribution of Gβγ released upon receptor/G protein activation. COS-7 cells express PLCβ1 and PLCβ3, which are sensitive to Gαq stimulation but relatively insensitive to Gβγ stimulation (17Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). PLCβ2, an isoform that is very sensitive to Gβγ, is not expressed (19Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Receptor-coupled endogenous Gq proteins exchange GDP for GTP upon activation, whereas inactivation occurs when GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. RGS proteins could therefore exert an inhibitory effect on receptor-induced Gq signaling by acting as GAPs, effector antagonists, or both. (ii) In contrast, in Gαq* -transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1A, left side), PLCβ was expected to be directly stimulated by constitutively active Gαq*. We used HA-tagged Gαq* to distinguish it from endogenous Gαq. The internal HA epitope (substitution of amino acids 125–130) does not interfere with Gαq* function, including PLCβ activation (20Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Importantly, Gαq* is inert to GTP hydrolysis (12Qian N.X. Winitz S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4077-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and therefore not susceptible to GTPase acceleration by RGS proteins (21Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Titration experiments were performed in each setting to alter the ratios between Gαq and RGS proteins over a broad range. Different amounts of cDNAs were transfected for Gαq* and RGS proteins, and the amount of endogenous Gαq available for PLCβ activation was varied by establishing concentration response curves for the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol. To compare their relative expression level, all of the RGS proteins were FLAG-tagged at their N terminus. The in vitro function of several R4 RGS proteins appears to be uncompromised by the addition of an N-terminal tag (e.g. (21Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 22Chen C. Zheng B. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8679-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). However, because the N terminus of some R4 RGS proteins has structural features important for subcellular targeting (5Wieland T. Mittmann C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 95-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we included select C-terminally tagged RGS proteins (RGS2 and RGS3) as controls. Immunoprecipitation of lysates from 35S-labeled COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B) and Western blotting (see Fig. 5B) yielded bands of the expected molecular weights and demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in RGS protein expression with increasing amounts of RGS cDNA transfected. The overall expression level varied among the different RGS proteins. Importantly, expression of each RGS protein was comparable between cells that were transfected with the M3 receptor and those transfected with Gαq* (see below), so that any potential functional differences between M3- and Gαq* -expressing cells cannot be attributed to a difference in their amount of cellular RGS protein. Comparing the inhibitory effects of RGS protein in these two experimental settings should therefore provide in-sight into the functional importance of GTPase activation and effector antagonism for the inhibitory effect of R4 RGS proteins on Gαq signaling in mammalian cells. Experimental System—To examine the effect of RGS proteins in a mammalian cell, where they can act as both GAPs and effector antagonists, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with muscarinic M3 receptors, and total inositol phosphate production was measured in response to carbachol stimulation. Fig. 2A illustrates that exogenous M3 receptor was required for carbachol-induced PLC activation. The lack of endogenous Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors (such as M1, M3, and M5 receptors) in COS-7 cells was confirmed by negligible N-methyl-[3H]scopalamine-binding sites in vector-transfected cells (data not shown; see below). The amount of endogenous Gq and PLCβ was sufficient to couple transfected M3 receptors to downstream signaling components, because the stimulatory effect of carbachol on PLCβ in M3-expressing cells was not further enhanced by co-transfection of Gαq and/or PLCβ1 (Fig. 2A). Selective coupling of transfected M3 receptors with Gq was confirmed by insensitivity of carbachol-induced PLCβ activation to 12 h of preincubation of COS-7 cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Fig. 2B). Pertussis toxin irreversibly inactivates some members of the G protein family (such as Gi/o), but not Gq, by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation at the very C-terminal cysteine in Gα. To demonstrate that under the conditions chosen pertussis toxin completely inactivated pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in vivo, in vitro back ADP-ribosylation was performed (Fig. 2B, inset). No ADP-ribosylated Gα subunits were detectable in COS-7 cells that had been pretreated with pertussis toxin. Potential contributions of Gi/o proteins to carbachol-induced PLCβ activation, which would be mediated via their βγ subunits (18Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), was further excluded by a lack of effect of co-transfection of a C-terminal region of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARKCT; data not shown), a protein fragment widely used as a Gβγ scavenger (23Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, transient transfection of the M3 receptor was sufficient to achieve carbachol-induced PLCβ activation in COS-7 that was mediated by endogenous Gq protein (via its α subunit) and was, as such, subject to the regular G protein activation/inactivation cycle. Effect of RGS Proteins—Carbachol dose-dependently increased the activity of PLC in the absence of exogenously expressed RGS proteins (Fig. 3, left panels, open circles). The maximal effect was observed at 100 μm carbachol and amounted to a 12–15-fold rise over basal PLC activity. The EC50 of carbachol was 0.9 ± 0.1 μm (n = 10 assays). We then compared carbachol-induced PLCβ activation in the absence or presence of different RGS proteins (Fig. 3, filled circles). Expression of RGS2, RGS3 (both isoforms), RGS5, and RGS16 caused a significant blunting of the maximal effect of carbachol (left panels) as well as a modest right shift of the dose-response curve for carbachol (right panels). The maximal activation of PLCβ by carbachol was reduced to 64.2 ± 2.0% of vector-transfected cells (n = 10, RGS2), 58.8 ± 2.3% (n = 3, RGS3s), 36.6 ± 2.1% (n = 11, RGS3), 76.7 ± 4. 6% (n = 7, RGS5), and 68.8 ± 4.5% (n = 8, RGS16). Compared with vector-transfected control, the EC50 for carbachol was increased by a factor of 3.4 ± 0.4 (n = 4, RGS2), 7.8 ± 0.9 (n = 3, RGS3s), 4.3 ± 0.9 (n = 3, RGS3), 2.2 ± 0.4 (n = 4, RGS5), and 2.9 ± 0.6 (n = 3, RGS16; all p < 0.05 versus vector transfected COS-7 cells). The inhibitory effect of each RGS protein was concentration-dependent over a wide range of stimulatory input via the M3 receptor, as shown by titration experiments with increasing amounts of RGS cDNA that were performed at three different carbachol concentrations for each RGS protein (Fig. 4). Fig. 1B illustrates that RGS protein expression rose linearly upon transfection of increasing RGS cDNA amounts. RGS proteins containing the FLAG tag at the N or C terminus yielded comparable results (data not shown), indicating that the epitope tag did not alter RGS protein function.Fig. 4Concentration-dependent effect of RGS proteins on carbachol-induced, Gαq-mediated PLCβ activity. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with M3 receptors (250 ng of cDNA/well in a 12-well plate) in the absence (open bars) or presence (shaded bars) of increasing amounts of RGS cDNA (125, 250, and 750 ng/well). Please note that RGS5 was transfected only at two different concentrations. Total inositol phosphate production was measured at three different doses of carbachol (0.1, 10, and 1000 μm). The data are expressed in cpm × 1000/well. The error bars indicate the range of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether or not changes in the expression level of any of the components in the M3/Gq/PLCβ signaling pathway contribute to the observed effects, receptor binding assays and Western blots were performed. N-Methyl-[3H]scopalamine binding was saturable over the concentration range examined, and the experimental data were well fitted by a one-site binding model, as shown for M3-transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A). The maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) amounted to 2871 ± 358 fmol/mg protein with a ligand affinity (Kd) of 308 ± 63 pmol/l (n = 3). Bmax was not significantly changed upon expression of RGS2 (91.5 ± 25.2% of control, n = 3), RGS3 (92.9 ± 19.6%, n = 3), RGS5 (91.7 ± 15.7%, n = 2), and RGS16 (91.6 ± 21.3%, n = 2) and only modestly reduced in RGS3s-expressing cells (82.7 ± 4.0% of control, n = 3, p < 0.05). There was no significant change in Kd upon co-expression of any of the RGS proteins tested (data not shown). Western blots in Fig. 5B illustrate that the cellular amount of the endogenous Gαq, PLCβ1, and PLCβ3 was also largely unchanged by the presence or absence of M3 receptors or RGS proteins. Of note, RGS4 is known to inhibit Gq-mediated PLC signaling in a variety of cell types and experimental settings (10De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and we originally intended to include this well characterized RGS protein in this study. However, in our hands the expression of RGS4 was rather weak and markedly reduced upon co-expression of the M3 receptor (Figs. 1B and 5B). At this expression level, no significant inhibitory effect of RGS4 on carbachol-induced PLC activation was observed (data not shown). In summary, RGS2, RGS3 (both isoforms), RGS5, and RGS16 dose-dependently inhibited carbachol-induced, M3/Gαq-mediated PLCβ activation, which could not be attributed to changes in the expression level of any of these signaling components. Experimental System—To examine the effect of the same RGS proteins under conditions where they cannot hasten Gαq inactivation, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with constitutively active GαqQ209L (Gαq*) in the presence or absence of the different RGS proteins. First, we determined whether transfection of Gαq* and RGS (alone or in combination) affected the expression of endogenous PLCβ and/or their respective expression levels. Fig. 6 shows representative immunoblots from COS-7 lysates that were transfected with decreasing amounts of Gαq* cDNA in the absence or presence of a fixed amount of RGS cDNA. Endogenous PLCβ1 and PLCβ3 levels were not changed upon e"

Most strains of H. pylori produce a cytotoxin, VacA, that induces cytoplasmic vacuolation in epithelial cells with structural and functional changes, leading to gastric injury. VacA is known to cause cell death by mitochondrial damage. We hypothesized that VacA might disrupt other signaling pathways; to that end, we examined the effects of VacA on MAPKs to elucidate their role in the abnormalities seen in VacA-treated cells. VacA stimulated phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2, but not JNK, in AZ-521 cells. Both phosphorylation and kinase activation of p38 were maximal 10-30 min after addition of VacA and declined thereafter. Treatment with anti-VacA antibody or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked p38 phosphorylation caused by VacA and inhibited VacA-induced phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), which is implicated in transcriptional control of stress-responsive genes. These data indicate that VacA stimulates a p38/ATF-2-mediated signal pathway. However, 10 μm SB203580, which is sufficient to decrease p38 phosphorylation, did not inhibit VacA-induced cellular vacuolation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, or cytochrome c release from mitochondria. These results suggest that VacA-induced activation of p38/ATF-2-mediated signal pathway is independent of cellular vacuolation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, or cytochrome c release from mitochondria caused by VacA. The cytotoxin may thus act independently on several cellular targets, leading to disruption of signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways.

Persistent Helicobacter pylori infection results in the development of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer.

Recent work on the gastric mucosal inflammatory response to persistent H. pylori infection suggested that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ATF-2, activating transcription factor 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. signal pathway plays a significant role (20Keates S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 804-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPK in response to environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines can result in apoptosis (22Kim J.S. Kim J.M. Jung H.C. Song I.S. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2001; 46: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, Takahashi et al. (23Takahashi S. Keto Y. Fujita T. Uchiyama T. Yamamoto A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 48-56PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a role for p38 in H. pylori-induced gastritis in Mongolian gerbils using the p38 inhibitor FR167653, which was discovered as an inhibitor of cytokine production, suggesting a crucial role of p38 in gastritis of both H. pylori-infected individuals and experimentally infected animals. However, it is not clear which virulence factor is responsible for activation of p38 as well as other MAPKs. Nishioka et al. (24Nishioka H. Baesso I. Semenzato G. Trentin L. Rappuoli R. Del Giudice G. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 840-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) recently reported that neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori activated MAPK in human neutrophils. Neutrophil-activating protein is a 15-kDa chemotactic protein for neutrophils, monocytes, and mast cells (25Del Giudice G. Covacci A. Telford J.L. Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 523-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). VacA administrated to the mice resulted in epithelial vacuolization and marked infiltrations of mast cells and monocytes into the mucosal epithelium (9Supajatura V. Ushio H. Wada A. Yahiro K. Okumura K. Ogawa H. Hirayama T. Ra C. J. Immunol. 2002; 22: 2603-2606Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, VacA showed a chemotactic activity for mast cells and caused mast cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, suggesting the contribution of inflammation to H. pylori-induced gastritis. To elucidate the role of VacA in H. pylori infection, we examined the effect of VacA on phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. Here we report that VacA stimulates phosphorylation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) in the gastric cell line AZ-521. p38 phosphorylation was followed by stimulation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that VacA affects the transcriptional pathway through the p38/ATF-2-mediated signal transduction. VacA-induced activation of the p38/ATF-2-mediated signal pathway is, however, independent of cellular vacuolation, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, or cytochrome c release from mitochondria caused by VacA.

Cell Culture—The human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AZ-521 (Culture Collection of Health Science Resource Bank, Japan Health Science Fundamental) was grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To evaluate the effect of VacA on MAPK phosphorylation, AZ-521 cells were grown overnight in medium without fetal calf serum. VacA Preparation—The toxin-producing H. pylori strain ATCC49503 was used as the source of VacA for purification according to a modification of our published procedure (26Yahiro K. Niidome T.

In brief, after growth of H. pylori in Brucella broth containing 0.1% β-cyclodextrin at 37 °C for 4 days with vigorous shaking in a controlled microaerophilic atmosphere of 10% O2 and 10% CO2, VacA was precipitated from culture supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and purified by VacA affinity column, which was coupled with anti-VacA-specific IgG antibody and equilibrated with RX buffer (10 mm KCl, 0.3 mm NaCl, 0.35 mm MgCl2, and 0.125 mm EGTA in 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.3). After washing the column with RX buffer, VacA was eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1, and then neutralized with 1 m Tris. After gel filtration by Superose 6HR 10/30 column with TBS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl), purified VacA was concentrated and stored (200 μg/ml). VacA concentration was determined by a bead enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (28Nagata H. Wada A. Kurazono H. Yahiro K. Shirasaka D. Ikemura T. Aoyama N. Ping W.A. Makiyama K. Kohno S.

Detection of MAPK Phosphorylation in AZ-521 Cells Exposed to VacA—AZ-521 cells were treated with 0, 1, 5, 10, or 50 μm SB203580 for 30 min followed by incubation with 120 nm VacA for 0, 30, or 60 min. Cells were solubilized by incubation for 10 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g), samples (20 μg of protein) of supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibodies. Assay for p38 Kinase Activity—p38 kinase activity was measured by using the p38 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, AZ-521 cells treated with or without VacA were harvested in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-p38 MAP antibody (Thr-180/Tyr-182). The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with ATF-2 in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer, and phospho-ATF-2 was quantified by Western blotting using a phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) antibody. VacA-induced ATF-2 Phosphorylation in AZ-521 Cells—AZ-521 cells were incubated with 120 nm VacA for 0, 30, 60, or 120 min. Cells were solubilized by incubation for 10 min on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After centrifugation (15 min, at 15,000 × g), samples (20 μg of protein) of supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody. For immunofluorescent staining, AZ-521 cells (0.6 × 105 cells/well) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, treated with Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and incubated with Block Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan), anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody (primary antibody), and Cy-3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (secondary antibody). Samples were inspected using a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured and digitized using a Spot charged coupled device camera (Zeiss, AxioCam HRc) and edited using Adobe Photoshop Elements Version 2.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.). Effect of SB203580 on VacA Vacuolating Activity—AZ-521 cells, grown as monolayers, were incubated with 10 μm SB203580 for 30 min before further incubation with 120 nm VacA for 0, 2, 4, or 8 h. The neutral red assay was used to evaluate the effect of SB203580 on vacuolating activity (26Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Padilla P.I. Wada A. Hirayama T. Biochem.

Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Induced by VacA—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured as reported by Vayssiere et al. (30Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Risler Y. Mignotte B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11752-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). AZ-521 cells were incubated without or with 120 nm VacA for 6 h, washed twice with PBS, and harvested with 0.25% trypsin. After centrifugation (200 × g for 3 min), the cell pellet was washed with PBS and suspended in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1 μm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide followed by incubation for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, washing three times with PBS, and dispersion in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum. Cells treated with an uncoupling agent, 5 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, served as a control. Samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. Cytochrome c Release—AZ-521 cells were incubated with 10 μm SB203580 for 30 min followed by incubation with 120 nm VacA for 24 h. Cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS before subsequent procedures at 4 °C. Cells were dispersed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and broken by 40 passages through a 25-gauge × 5/8-inch needle followed by centrifugation (750 × g for 10 min) at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were centrifuged (22,000 × g for 15 min) to obtain the mitochondrial fraction (pellet) and then further centrifuged (100,000 × g for 1 h) to prepare the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). Samples (30 μg) of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% gels and immunoblotting analysis using anti-cytochrome c antibody. VacA Activates MAP Kinases in AZ-521 Gastric Epithelial Cells—Three main groups of MAP kinases have been characterized to date: the p38 MAP kinases, the JNKs, and the ERKs. To determine whether VacA activates MAP kinases in AZ-521 gastric epithelial cells, the AZ-521 cells were incubated with 120 nm VacA. Control cells showed low or undetectable levels of activated MAP kinases (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2 was clearly evident within a 30-min incubation of VacA; phospho-p38 declined thereafter, whereas Erk1/2 was maximal at 30 min and declined markedly only after 60 min. JNK was not activated within 120 min. VacA Induces p38 Phosphorylation and Activation of Its Kinase Activity—Quantification of effects of VacA indicated a concentration-dependent increase in p38 phosphorylation after 30-min incubation (Fig. 2A). The difference between VacA-treated and untreated cells in p38 phosphorylation was not due to a difference in amounts of p38 protein, which were not significantly different in these two populations of cells, as assessed by Western blot analysis. p38 MAPK phosphorylation in AZ-521 cells treated with 120 nm VacA for 60 min was completely inhibited by addition of 10 μg of anti-VacA IgG (Fig. 2B). p38 kinase activity, assayed in vitro with ATF-2 as substrate after immunoprecipitation from cells incubated with 240 nm VacA for the same times (Fig. 3), paralleled the amounts of phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 3) (31Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).Fig. 3VacA activates the kinase activity of p38 MAPK in AZ-521 cells. AZ-521 cells were grown overnight in medium without fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated without (bottom) or with 240 nm VacA (top) for 0, 10, 30, or 60 min. VacA-stimulated cells were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-phospho-p38 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-ATF-2 antibody. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of p38 induced by VacA was blocked by a specific inhibitor of p38 kinase activity, SB203580, in a concentration-dependent manner (10 and 50 μm) (Fig. 4). Among the p38 subfamily of MAPKs, p38α and p38β can be specifically inhibited by SB203580 through its binding in the ATP pocket (32Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z. Bower M.J. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Livi G.P. Goldsmith E.J. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15605-15610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas p38γ and p38δ are not sensitive to this compound (33Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that VacA induced the phosphorylation of p38α and/or p38β in AZ-521 cells. Since it is known that 10 μm SB203580 inhibits activity of p38 but not that of JNK or ERK (34Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), we used 10 μm SB203580 to inhibit p38 phosphorylation induced by VacA. Vacuolization, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Change, and Cytochrome c Release Caused by VacA Are Not Associated with p38 Phosphorylation—It has been reported that VacA causes vacuolization of target cells through a mechanisms involving the vacuolar ATPase proton pump (35Cover T.L. Reddy L.Y. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that the change in mitochondrial membrane potential by VacA is independent of vacuolization using bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump (2Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). First, to determine whether the stimulation of p38 phosphorylation by VacA led to vacuolization, AZ-521 cells were treated with 10 μm SB203580 for 30 min before incubation with 120 nm VacA for 0-8 h (Fig. 5). Incubation of AZ-521 cells with VacA without prior exposure to 10 μm SB203580 resulted in vacuolization in a time-dependent manner. The increase in vacuolization was similar in cells treated with 10 μm SB203580 before incubation with VacA. As VacA induced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (2Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we incubated AZ-521 cells with VacA for 1 h after treatment with 10 μm SB203580 for 30 min (Table I). Either 120 nm VacA or an uncoupling agent (5 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone) diminished the mitochondrial potential to a similar extent as previously reported (2Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SB203580 did not significantly inhibit the decrease in mitochondrial potential caused by VacA. A recent report showed that VacA or its 34-kDa fragment induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and cleavage of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (3Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We examined, therefore, whether cytochrome c release from mitochondria in gastric epithelial cells exposed to VacA is related to p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 6). As reported by Galmiche et al. (3Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), treatment with VacA induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria of AZ-521 cells. This effect was achieved in cells pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 followed by treatment with 120 nm VacA for 24 h. Thus, other signal mechanisms that did not involve p38 might contribute to the cytochrome c release by VacA.Table IEffect of SB203580 on the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by VacASampleMean ± S.D.PBS32.7 ± 0.5CCCP15.1 ± 1.8VacA (120 nm, 1 h)18.9 ± 1.0SB203580 (10 μm, 30 min) + VacA19.7 ± 0.1SB203580 (10 μm, 30 min) + PBS33.8 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab VacA Activates ATF-2 through Activation of the p38 Pathway—Having shown an increase in ATF-2 phosphorylation in vitro by immunoprecipitated, activated p38 from VacA-treated cells (Fig. 3), we examined the effect of VacA on ATF-2 in intact cells. Phosphorylation of p38 and ATF-2 were clearly evident within 10-30 min of VacA induction with a similar time course by Western blotting (Fig. 7A). Immunostaining analysis of phospho-ATF-2 in intact cells showed that the level of phosphorylated ATF-2 increased after exposure of AZ-521 cells to VacA for 10-30 min and declined thereafter (Fig. 7B). VacA-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation was significantly blocked by prior incubation of cells with SB203580 (data not shown). Taken together, findings from Figs. 3 and 7 suggest that VacA activates ATF-2 through activation of the p38 pathway. VacA is known to cause a number of metabolic, regulatory, and morphologic changes in susceptible cells. Although the mechanism by which VacA exerts its cytotoxic effects is not known, it is believed to involve disruption of normal membrane trafficking at or near the level of late endosomes (36Papini E. de Bernard M.

Cover T.L. Shao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). VacA also induced mitochondrial damage and inhibition of energy metabolism in AZ-521 cells (2Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a 34-kDa fragment of VacA in HeLa cells induced cytochrome c release and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, known to be a specific substrate for caspase 3, leading to apoptotic cell death (3Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). VacA applied externally to cells induced release of cytochrome c into the cytosol without induction of a significant cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (3Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Studies of a VacA-null mutant (Tox-) strain suggested that VacA as well as the Cag pathogenicity island of H. pylori contributed to apoptosis of AGS cells (42Peek Jr., R.M. Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6124-6131PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore a recombinant VacA lacking vacuolating activity induced the apoptotic response of AGS cells (4Kuck D. Kolmerer B. Iking-Konert C. Krammer P.H. Stremmel W. Rudi J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5080-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and acid-activated VacA also induced AGS cell apoptosis in the presence of supplemental ammonium chloride (43Cover T.L. Krishna U.S. Israel D.A. Peek Jr., R.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 951-957PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that VacA-induced vacuolation and apoptosis may proceed by different pathways. Cell loss caused by H. pylori-induced apoptosis could potentially accelerate the development of gastric atrophy or intestinal metaplasia (44Correa P. Miller M.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1989; 54: 151-162Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) The signaling pathways involved in apoptotic events have been intensively studied, including the role of key regulatory proteins such as caspases, Bcl-2 family of proteins, and MAP kinases including JNK and p38 in stress conditions-induced apoptotic signaling.

As shown in Fig. 1, VacA induced increased phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2 but not JNK. Since p38 inhibition did not prevent cytochrome c release and depression of mitochondrial membrane potential by VacA, those aspects of VacA toxicity appear to be independent of p38 activation in AZ-521 cells. By and large, Erk1/2 activation has been linked to cell survival, whereas activation of p38 and JNK is linked to induction of apoptosis (48Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). ATF-2 is activated both by JNK/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 kinases and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a number of oncogenes and cell cycle genes (49van Dam H. Duyndam M.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that ATF-2 contributed to the resistance of human melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by UV irradiation or chemical treatment by altering the balance between tumor necrosis factor and Fas death signaling cascades and cooperated with v-Jun in promoting proliferation and tumor formation (53Huguier S. Baguet J. Perez S. van Dam H. Castellazzi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7020-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p38 has been implicated in the up-regulation of several genes involved in promoting cell proliferation and tumor progression, including COX-2 and cyclin D1, through the activation of transcriptional factors such as AP-1, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and ATF-2 (54Lee R.J.

The roles of the MAP kinase cascade in cell death or survival are highly dependent on cell type and state (57Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4398) Google Scholar). Another potential signaling pathway for VacA-induced apoptosis is from Erk1/2 through the Bcl-2 family of proteins (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS, and Bok), which can promote cell death (58Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). Caputo et al. (59Caputo R. Tuccillo C. Manzo B.A. Zarrilli R. Tortora G. Blanco Cdel V. Ricci V. Ciardiello F. Romano M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2015-2021PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that a Tox+ H. pylori strain, but not a Tox- strain, stimulated Erk2 phosphorylation in MKN 28 cells. H. pylori-stimulated host inflammatory immune responses lead to release of large amounts of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, markedly potentiating apoptosis (60Xia H.H. Talley N.J. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 96: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Numerous molecules produced by H. pylori including VacA, lipopolysaccharide, monochloramine, and nitric oxide may directly induce apoptosis (60Xia H.H. Talley N.J. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 96: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A crucial role for p38 in the inflammation associated with H. pylori-induced gastritis was proven in experimentally infected animals (23Takahashi S. Keto Y. Fujita T. Uchiyama T. Yamamoto A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 48-56PubMed Google Scholar). One of the elements involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori, neutrophil-activating protein, activated neutrophils through activation of p38 and Erk but not JNK (25Del Giudice G. Covacci A. Telford J.L. Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 523-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, p38 activation by VacA may be involved in the inflammatory response during H. pylori infection. It appears, however, that p38 MAPK phosphorylation by VacA is independent of vacuolization, mitochondrial membrane potential change, and cytochrome c release. Thus, VacA may be responsible for the activation of several independent signaling pathways. We thank I.

Neuronal activity induces a moderate increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]iintracellular calcium concentrationCaMcalmodulinPIphosphatidylinositolGDNFglial cell line-derived neurotrophic factorMTNspinal cord motoneuronsPKBSer/Thr protein kinase BERKextracellular regulated kinaseMAPmitogen-activated kinaseTrktropomyosin receptor kinaseGFLGDNF-family ligandsGFRGDNF family receptorsEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinBAPTA-AM1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethylene N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetomethyl esterAFUarbitrary fluorescence unitsP-TyrantiphosphotyrosinePBSphosphate-buffered salineMEXmuscle extractNEabsence of MEXEembryonic dayTFPtrifluoperazine dimaleateTGthapsigarginAFUarbitrary fluorescence units. which exerts a trophic effect on different neuronal populations (1Franklin J.L. Johnson E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This biological effect is mediated by several intracellular pathways, such as Ras, that are activated by Ca2+, and this activation is mainly mediated by the protein calmodulin (CaM) (2Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 233-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Ca2+ and CaM also regulate the activation of Ser/Thr protein kinase B (PKB) and the promotion of cell survival, which is triggered by the stimulation of Trk, the tyrosine kinase receptors for neurotrophins (3Egea J.

Together these observations indicate a significant role of Ca2+ and CaM in the regulation and activation of intracellular pathways related to neuronal survival.

Ledda F. Ibáñez C. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Ret is activated when GFL first binds to a specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked co-receptor named GDNF family receptor-α (GFRα). Ret activation by the GFL·GFRα complex requires Ca2+ binding to a cadherin-like sequence in its extracellular domain (13Anders J. Kjar S. Ibañez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35808-35817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Nozaki C. Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Iwata Y. Horibe K. Klein R.D. Rosenthal A. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Once activated, Ret is autophosphorylated in tyrosine residues, which behave as docking sites for various intracellular signaling proteins. This then activates several pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (10Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J.

After PI 3-kinase activation, PKB translocates to the plasma membrane where it is activated by phosphorylation on two residues, Ser-473 and Thr-308 (17Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P.

To investigate the role of Ca2+ and CaM on GDNF-induced PI 3-kinase/PKB activation and MTN survival, we studied the ability of GDNF to induce changes in the [Ca2+]i. The effect of Ca2+ chelators and CaM inhibitors on PI 3-kinase/PKB activation and GDNF-induced MTN survival was also studied. Here we report that GDNF stimulation induces an increase in [Ca2+]i from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. This increase regulates the activation of both PI 3-kinase and PKB, and therefore regulates MTN survival through a mechanism that involves CaM. Finally, we present evidence that CaM associates with the endogenous PI 3-kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. MTN Isolation, Survival Evaluation, and Cell Death Characterization—Spinal cord MTNs were purified from embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5) chick embryos according to Comella et al. (21Comella J.X. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Aldea M. Esquerda J.E. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Survival evaluation was performed as described by Soler et al. (22Soler R.M. Egea J. Mintenig G.M. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Iglesias M. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presented values are the means ± S.E. of eight wells from a representative experiment that was repeated at least three times. Cell death characterization was evaluated by estimating the percentage of apoptotic cells with respect to the total number of cells counted in each condition using the Hoechst 33258 dye (Sigma, Madrid, Spain) as described in Soler et al. (10Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9160-9169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the caspase-3 activation in dying MTNs, immunocytochemistry using an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175; Cell Signaling, Servicios Hospitalarios, Barcelona, Spain) was performed. After 18 h of treatment with the indicated culture medium, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% fetal calf serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:50 in blocking solution for 24 h at 4 °C. RRX-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Servicios Hospitalarios). Hoechst 33258 dye was used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml and applied together with the secondary antibody. Cell Transfection—MTNs were transfected 30 min after plating using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Barcelona) following the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, MTNs were co-transfected with pEGFP (Clontech, BD Bioscience, Madrid) and either pCMV5-HA-PKBT308D/S473D or the empty vector, using a one to three molar ratio. For survival experiments, only EGFP-positive cells were counted as described previously by Biswas and Greene (23Biswas S.C. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49511-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), with modifications. MTNs were co-transfected after plating and washed 48 h later, and the different experimental conditions were established. Cell survival was expressed as the percentage of fluorescent cells remaining in the culture well after 24 h of treatment, with respect to the fluorescent cells present at the beginning of treatment. Neurotrophic factors were obtained from Alomone (Jerusalem, Israel); LY294002, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7), and N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W5) from Calbiochem (Merck, Barcelona); EGTA, N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W13), N-(4-aminobutyl)-2-naphthalenesulfonamide (W12), trifluoperazine dimaleate (TFP), ionomycin, dantrolene, and thapsigargin from Sigma; and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethene N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetomethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) from Molecular Probes (Labnet Biotécnica, Madrid). Intracellular Ca2+ Determination—Isolated MTNs, plated on laminin-coated coverslips, were washed with Krebs solution with the following millimolar composition: NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; Hepes, 10; glucose 11; pH 7.5 and incubated in this medium with Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (5 μm, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted on the stage of a Nikon TE-200 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon 40×, 1.3 numerical aperture, epifluorescence oil immersion objective. Samples were stimulated with a laser line at 488 nm (Melles Griot, Carlsbad, CA), and the resultant fluorescence was recorded at 535 nm. Calcium concentration was calculated as described in Kao et al. (24Kao J.P.Y. Harootuian A.T. Tsien Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using Kd for Fluo-4 of 400 nm. Fmax values were obtained in the presence of 50 μm ionomycin, and Fmin was determined after addition of 15 mm EGTA. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Dantrolene (40 μm), thapsigargin (1 μm), and Cd2+ (250 μm) were added 10 min before and maintained throughout the experiment. For confocal studies, images were taken at each 1-μm planar interval from the top of the cell using an Ultraview confocal module (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Barcelona). Images were recorded every 4 s using a charge-coupled device camera and analyzed using commercial software (Life Sciences Ltd., England). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot Analysis, and Kinase Assays—For detection of the phosphorylated forms of PKB in total cell lysates, 30 μg of total protein was resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane filters (Millipore, Hucoa-Erlöss, Barcelona) using an Amersham Biosciences semidry Trans-Blot (Barcelona) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were blotted with anti-phospho-PKB-specific antibodies: anti-phospho-Ser-473 or anti-phospho-Thr-308 (New England Biolabs, Servicios Hospitalarios, Barcelona) following the instructions of the provider. To control the content of the specific protein per lane, membranes were re-probed with a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) or anti-PKB antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Quimigranel, Barcelona) as described by the providers. Blots were developed using the Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Cultek, Barcelona). PI 3-kinase activity was measured as previously described by Dolcet et al. (25Dolcet X. Egea J. Soler R.M. Martin-Zanca D. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Reactiva, Barcelona). Immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose preconjugated with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma), washed, and incubated with a mixture of l-α-phosphatidylinositol (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at room temperature. Phosphorylated lipids were then extracted and resolved by TLC Silica-60 (Merck, VWR International, Barcelona) using N-propanol/water/acetic acid (66:33:2, v/v) as the mobile phase. Radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography, by exposing the TLC plate to Fuji Medical x-ray film (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at -70 °C overnight. The phosphorylation signal was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Roche Diagnostics, Barcelona). PKB activity was performed as described by Soler et al. (10Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9160-9169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-PKB antibody (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with protein G (Sigma), washed, and incubated with 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and histone H2B (Sigma) as substrates. The reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive spots were detected by autoradiography and quantified in the PhosphorImager. For co-immunoprecipitation assays MTNs were lysed in a Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 10% glycerol; 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 25 mm NaF; 40 mm β-glycerophosphate; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 20 μg/ml leupeptin; 2 mm benzamidine). Total protein samples (600 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with an anti-p85 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Samples were incubated then with protein G for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing CaCl2 or EGTA, suspended with sample buffer, boiled, resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane filters. Blots were probed with an anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with the anti-p85 antibody to check for equal immunoprecipitation efficiency. CaM-Sepharose Pull-down Experiments—CaM-Sepharose pull-down was performed as described in Ref. 26Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Peiro S. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1931-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Cells were lysed in a Nonidet P-40 buffer, and 600 μg of protein extract was supplemented with a final concentration of either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Then 20 μl of CaM-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) or Sepharose alone, pre-blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, was added to the corresponding lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing CaCl2 or EGTA. Precipitation with uncoated Sepharose beads in the presence of CaCl2 was performed as a negative control. Complexes were analyzed by Western blot as described above with the anti-p85 antibody. GDNF Increases Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration—It has previously been reported that the stimulation of receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, such as TrkA, induces intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (5Pandiella-Alonso A. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 6De Bernardi M.A. Rabin S.J. Colangelo A.M. Brooker G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6092-6098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To analyze whether GDNF treatment and the consequent Ret activation are able to induce changes in [Ca2+]i, MTNs were loaded with Fluo-4, and the resultant changes in intracellular Ca2+ or fluorescence levels were measured in individual cell bodies. When cells were treated with 100 ng/ml GDNF intracellular Ca2+ increased (620 ± 101 nm) with respect to the basal level (142 ± 14 nm; mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 1A). This indicated that [Ca2+]i increases after GDNF treatment. This Ca2+ response to GDNF is a rapid phenomenon, reaching maximum levels within the first minute of GDNF application. Thereafter [Ca2+]i, remains elevated (340 nm) above the basal levels (140 nm) for the next minutes of measurement (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether the GDNF-evoked [Ca2+]i increase was of intracellular or extracellular origin, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml GDNF in the presence, or absence, of the non-selective voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+. Increases in Ca2+ were expressed as changes in fluorescence intensity above basal levels (FG - F). When the cells were pre-treated with 250 μm Cd2+ for 15 min and then exposed to GDNF in the presence of Cd2+, the peak of intracellular fluorescence was minimally affected (from an average of FG - F = 67.3 ± 6.8 AFU in the absence of Cd2+ to FG - F = 76.3 ± 11.2 AFU in the presence of Cd2+, Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the GDNF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise primarily involved the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, rather than Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. To further analyze this hypothesis, we used two different pharmacological approaches: depletion of Ca2+ from internal stores using the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (27Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) or blockade of Ca2+ release from the stores with dantrolene, a muscle relaxant used as an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (28Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pre-treated for 30 min with 1 μm TG, then stimulated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) with an identical dose of TG, changes in intracellular fluorescence were then measured. In the presence of TG only a slight increase in intracellular fluorescence (FG - F = 19.7 ± 5.1 AFU) was observed when compared with only GDNF-stimulated MTNs (FG - F = 67.3 ± 6.8 AFU) (Fig. 1B) indicating that post TG treatment, the [Ca2+]i increase was 3.4-fold smaller than GDNF-treated cells. On the other hand, when MTNs were pre-treated for 30 min with 40 μm dantrolene and then stimulated with GDNF (100 ng/ml) plus dantrolene, no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed (150 nm and FG - F = 4.9 ± 1.2 AFU, in Fig. 1A and 1B, respectively). Together, these results provide strong evidence that GDNF increases [Ca2+]i by mobilizing the cation from the intracellular stores, rather than promoting Ca2+ influx from the extracellular compartment. Moreover, confocal images of intracellular fluorescence distribution after GDNF stimulation clearly indicated a moderate increase in the fluorescence intensity distributed in compartments along the MTN soma and neurites (Fig. 1C). This is in clear contrast with the diffuse fluorescence pattern observed after MTN depolarization using high K+ medium (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that GDNF stimulation of cultured MTNs induces an increase of [Ca2+]i and that the intracellular Ca2+ stores are the main source for the peak response to this neurotrophic factor. Ca2+ and CaM Are Involved in GDNF-induced PKB Activation—GDNF and its GFLs relatives induce in vitro neuronal survival through a mechanism involving PI 3-kinase and PKB activation (10Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Encinas M. Egea J. Bayascas J.R. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9160-9169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PKB is a well known downstream PI 3-kinase effector, and its activation is mainly induced by the phosphorylation of residues Ser-473 or Thr-308 (17Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Because of the role of PKB in neuronal survival, and the involvement of Ca2+ and CaM in the activation of PKB induced by the neurotrophins (3Egea J. Espinet C. Soler R.M. Dolcet X. Yuste V.J. Encinas M. Iglesias M. Rocamora N. Comella J.X. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we wanted to analyze the involvement of Ca2+ and CaM in GDNF-induced PKB activation and neuronal survival. To this end, cells were treated with different calcium chelators (EGTA and BAPTA-AM) and CaM antagonists (W13, W7, and trifluoperazine dimaleate, TFP), and after GDNF stimulation the PKB phosphorylation was analyzed. MTNs were cultured for 48 h in the presence of muscle extract (MEX), and these cells were then serum- and MEX-deprived for 12 h and preincubated for 0, 15, or 30 min with 2.5 mm EGTA or 30 min with 25 μm BAPTA-AM to chelate either extracellular or intracellular Ca2+, respectively. Cells were then washed and stimulated for 7 min with 100 ng/ml GDNF in the presence of identical doses of EGTA or BAPTA-AM. MTNs were lysed, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Ser-473 (α-P-Ser-473) or anti-phospho-Thr-308 (α-P-Thr-308) antibodies. An increase in Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation in GDNF-stimulated cells were observed when directly compared with non-stimulated cells. However, when cultures were pre-treated and stimulated in the presence of Ca2+ chelators, the level of PKB phosphorylation was similar to the non-stimulated cultures (Fig. 2A). Thus intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ were both required for PKB phosphorylation after GDNF treatment. To exclude the possibility that extracellular Ca2+ was entering the cell through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, nifedipine or amiloride (L-type and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel antagonists, respectively) were used and the PKB phosphorylation subsequently analyzed. The presence of these antagonists did not affect Ser-473 (Fig. 2B) or Thr-308 phosphorylation (data not shown) after GDNF stimulation. However, similar doses of nifedipine, but not amiloride, did block the ERK MAP kinase phosphorylation after membrane depolarization using a high K+ medium as expected due to previous results published by our laboratory (22Soler R.M. Egea J. Mintenig G.M. Sanz-Rodriguez C. Iglesias M. Comella J.X. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The Ca2+ measurements described above also reinforce the hypothesis that Ret activation does not require Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space through Ca2+ channels. Thus the requirement of the extracellular Ca2+ for PKB phosphorylation is probably due to the presence of a cadherin-like motif in the Ret extracellular domain as reported previously (13Anders J. Kjar S. Ibañez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35808-35817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Nozaki C. Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Iwata Y. Horibe K. Klein R.D. Rosenthal A. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). To determine whether CaM was mediating the Ca2+ effect on PKB phosphorylation, cells were treated with different CaM antagonists. MTNs were cultured under similar conditions as described above, except that they were pre-treated with 7 μm W13, or an identical dose of W12, its less active structural analogue (W13 IC50 = 68 μmversus W12 IC50 = 260 μm) as a control of the nonspecific effects of W13 (30Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After this, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml GDNF for 7 min in the presence of the same doses of W13 or W12 and PKB phosphorylation was then analyzed. GDNF induced an increase in Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation with respect to the non-stimulated cultures; however, W13, but not W12, prevented PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This suggests that CaM is required for this effect. We also analyzed other CaM antagonists such as W7 and its less active structural analogue W5 (W7 IC50 = 28 μmversus W5 IC50 = 240 μm) (30Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and a CaM antagonist structurally unrelated to W13 and W7, called TFP. Fig. 3 shows that the presence of 10 μm W7, or 5 μm TFP, inhibited Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation induced by GDNF. However, 10 μm W5 did not significantly inhibit this phosphorylation, which indicates the specific effect of W7. Thus these results, obtained using different CaM antagonists that exert their effects through different molecular mechanisms (30Hidaka H. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that CaM is required for PKB phosphorylation after GDNF stimulation of cultured spinal cord MTNs. To further analyze the effect of Ca2+ and CaM on GDNF-induced PKB activation, kinase activity assays were performed in PKB immunoprecipitates from MTNs treated with Ca2+ chelators or CaM antagonists. In accordance with the results described above, GDNF-induced PKB kinase activity was prevented by the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA-AM or EGTA, as well as by CaM antagonist W13 or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY 294002 (50 μm) (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that GDNF promotes PKB phosphorylation and activation in cultured MTNs through a mech"

Here we show that, although cytoplasmic at steady state, Axin shuttles in fact in and out of the nucleus; Axin accumulates in the nucleus of cells treated with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway and is efficiently exported from Xenopus oocyte nuclei in a RanGTP- and CRM1-dependent manner. We have characterized the sequence requirement for export and identified two export domains, which do not contain classical nuclear export consensus sequences, and we show that Axin binds directly to the export factor CRM1 in the presence of RanGTP.

Wnts constitute a large family of growth factors, conserved from invertebrates to humans, which are involved in many developmental processes, including early patterning events such as dorsoventral polarity of vertebrate embryos or segmentation of the Drosophila embryo (1Cadigan K. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 2De Robertis E.M. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. Wessely O. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Tight regulation of this pathway is also crucial in adult tissues, as its uncontrolled activation appears to be a major cause of cancer (3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The downstream effector of the pathway is β-catenin, which can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, interact with transcription factors of the TCF/Lef-1 family and activate a range of specific target genes, such as the oncogenes c-myc and cyclin D (3Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 5Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). β-Catenin has also a distinct function at the plasma membrane, where it stably interacts with the cadherin cell-cell adhesion molecules and links them to the actin cytoskeleton. In non-stimulated cells, the levels of free cytosolic β-catenin active in signaling are maintained very low by a mechanism that involves serine/threonine phosphorylation of β-catenin, followed by ubiquitination and rapid degradation (4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 5Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Stimulation by Wnts inhibits phosphorylation of β-catenin, which can then accumulate in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. An essential player in this pathway is the negative regulator Axin (4Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 5Peifer M. Polakis P.

By bringing together the enzymes (GSK3 and casein kinase Iϵ) and the substrate (β-catenin), Axin increases the efficiency and the specificity of β-catenin phosphorylation (14Ikeda S. Kishida M.

Adenomatous polyposis coli nuclear export sequence leptomycin B amino acid(s) glutathione S-transferase. Recent data have suggested nucleo-cytoplasmic transport to be an important parameter in regulation of the pathway. Both β-catenin and APC have been shown to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 24Bienz M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and 25Henderson B. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The presence of β-catenin in the nucleus is quite obviously related to its function as transcriptional coactivator. Its re-export might be crucial to terminate its signaling activity (26Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The role of nuclear APC in β-catenin regulation is still controversially discussed (25Henderson B. Fagotto F.

Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), has been proposed to mediate re-export of β-catenin by a piggy-back mechanism (24Bienz M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

However, APC is not required for export of β-catenin, which can freely translocate through the nucleopores on its own (26Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The current models of the Wnt pathway have relied on the assumption that Axin is cytoplasmic. Ectopically expressed Axin displays a typical punctate pattern in the cytoplasm and at or near the cell membrane, both in culture cell lines and in early Xenopus embryos (12Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and manual isolation of nuclei from Xenopus oocytes has confirmed that, at least in this cell type, endogenous Axin is absent from the nucleus, consistent with β-catenin degradation occuring primarily in the cytoplasm (26Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, however, we show that Axin in fact also shuttles in and out of the nucleus. Plasmids and Protein Expression—Myc-tagged Axin constructs in pCS2+MT used for transfection have been described previously (12Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), except Ax(mutNES1+2), where double point mutations were introduced in each of the potential nuclear export sequence (NES) sequences to substitute valine 544, methionine 546, leucine 649, and leucine 651 with alanine residues (Fig. 2C). pT7-GST-Axin fusion constructs for in vitro translation were obtained by ligating the PCR products into the KpnI and HindIII (blunted with Klenow fragment) sites of pT7-GST (26Wiechens N.

Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells at ∼70% density seeded on coverslips were transfected with DNA in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM I, Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). After 8–9 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum with or without 5 nm leptomycin B (LMB), kindly provided by M. Yoshida), and the cells were grown for further 0.5, 4, or 13 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by blocking in 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and incubation for 2 h with mouse anti-Myc antibody (9E10) or affinity purified rabbit anti-Axin (raised against the N terminus, aa 96–353) in 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Secondary antibodies were Alexa488 (Molecular Probes). The cells were observed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. The distribution of endogenous Axin in control and LMB-treated cells was quantified as follows. Cells were divided in three categories: cytoplasmic but no significant nuclear staining (C), cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of roughly equal intensity (CN), and nuclear staining stronger than cytoplasmic (N). For each condition, >100 cells were counted in each experiment. The data represent the average of three independent experiments. Nuclear Transport Assay in Xenopus Oocytes—The assay was performed as described previously in detail (26Wiechens N. Fagotto F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35S-labeled in vitro translated proteins were injected directly in the oocyte nucleus. At various time points, the cytoplasm and the nucleus were separated by dissection. The red color due to the hemoglobin of the injected reticulocyte lysate was used to control the accuracy of nuclear injections and the integrity of the nuclei during dissection. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For each sample, six oocytes were pooled. In Vitro Binding Assays—Recombinant Axin fragments were incubated with zzCRM1, with or without RanQ69L, and zzCRM1 was pulled down using IgG-agarose beads as described previously (30Englmeier L. Fornerod M. Bischoff F.R. Petosa C. Mattaj I.W. Kutay U. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 926-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Axin Shuttles in and out of the Nucleus—Exogenous, epitopetagged full-length Axin (aa 12–956) shows a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery, both in mammalian cell lines and in Xenopus embryos (Ref. 12Fagotto F. Jho E. Zeng L. Kurth T. Joos T. Kaufmann C. Costantini F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, A and C). When determining the subcellular distribution of various deletion mutants transfected in HEK293 cells, we observed that some of them had a nuclear localization (Fig. 1E). This observation suggested that Axin might be capable of shuttling in and out of the nucleus and that the deletion variants showing nuclear localization were missing the export signal. Nuclear export is generally mediated by a leucine-rich NES, which binds in a Ran-GTP-dependent manner to the export receptor CRM1 (exportin 1/Xpo 1; Ref. 33Goerlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The interaction NES-CRM1 can be blocked specifically by an antibiotic, LMB. We tested whether LMB influenced the distribution of Axin. We expressed Myc-tagged full-length Axin in HEK293 cells and analyzed its distribution by immunofluorescence. We found that LMB treatment caused indeed a significant amount of Axin to accumulate in the nucleus of most cells (Fig. 1, B and D). We conclude that Axin indeed shuttles through the nuclear pore and that its export is CRM1-dependent. Nuclear enrichment after LMB treatment is good evidence, but not proof, that the protein under investigation can be re-exported from the nucleus, as other explanations cannot be excluded (Axin could for example become more stable in the nucleus). To obtain direct evidence for Axin nuclear export, we used the Xenopus laevis oocyte assay (32Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Goerlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar); in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Axin variants were microinjected in the oocyte nucleus, and their final localization was determined by manual dissection of the oocytes into nuclei and cytoplasm (examples shown in Fig. 3 and data summarized in Fig. 2B). As full-length Axin was not well translated, we used our longest C-terminal deleted construct Ax-(12–810) to confirm that Axin is indeed exported (Fig. 3B). Note that some variable degradation of the Axin fragment was observed, in agreement with the known instability of Axin (34Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10681-10684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Note also that the kinetics of export of Ax-(12–810) varied between experiments (compare Fig. 3, B and C), which is likely to be due to variations in amounts of Axin-interacting proteins between oocyte batches, which may affect not only stability, but also for instance nuclear retention. Export of proteins containing a classical NES is mediated by an interaction with CRM1 that requires cooperation of the small GTPase Ran in its GTP form (33Goerlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, export of Ax-(12–810) is inhibited by incubation with LMB or by coinjection of a recombinant RanGAP (Rnap1; Ref. 36Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which rapidly depletes RanGTP from the nucleus (32Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Goerlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that Axin is export via the “canonical” CRM1- and RanGTP-dependent pathway. We also wanted to determine whether endogenous Axin shuttles in and out of the nucleus. For this purpose, we needed first to establish the localization of endogenous Axin in untreated HEK293 cells. We used an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against the N terminus of Axin. This antibody recognizes a single band around 90kD in HEK293 cell extracts, which corresponds to the predicted size of Axin (Fig. 4F). Staining of HEK293 cells showed a punctate pattern along the cell periphery (Fig. 4A). Specificity was shown by preincubating the antibody in the presence of the corresponding recombinant antigen, which eliminated this signal (Fig. 4D). We did not detect significant Axin in nuclei of HEK293 cells (<5% of the cells showed some nuclear staining with this antibody, Fig. 4G). We have confirmed this observation using a second antibody raised against another region of Axin (data not shown). Axin was also found to be cytoplasmic, and not nuclear, in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in mouse L-cells (not shown). A previous report by Anderson et al. (37Anderson C.B. Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8683-8688Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) has mentioned that a significant amount of Axin co-sedimented with nuclei in cell fractionation experiments using HEK293 cells. We have also observed a very dense Axin pool, 2F. Schwaak and F. Fagotto, unpublished results. but we think that it corresponds to large complexes/organelles, possibly associated with cytoskeletal elements, rather then to a genuine nuclear localization. In cells treated with LMB, however, Axin disappeared from the pericytoplasmic spots and accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 4, B and C). The nuclear signal was abolished by preincubation of the antibody with the corresponding antigen (Fig. 4E). Note that in these controls a strong cytoplasmic staining was observed. This is most likely due to binding of the recombinant Axin fragment to cellular structures. 3K. Heinle and F. Fagotto, unpublished results. Apparently, sequestration of endogenous Axin in the nucleus upon LMB treatment creates free Axin binding sites in the cytoplasm. A shift from cytoplasmic to nuclear could be already detected in some cells after 30 min of LMB treatment (Fig. 4G). After 4 h, Axin was found in most nuclei and further accumulated during overnight treatment (Fig. 4G). Thus, Axin accumulated in LMB-treated cells with kinetics comparable with what has been observed for APC (27Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) but much slower than expected for a freely shuttling protein. This is consistent with the fact that most Axin is associated with large protein complexes. 4F. Schwaak and F. Fagotto, unpublished results. The extent of shuttling may be then dictated by the rates of association/dissociation of these complexes. Axin Nuclear Import—The sequence requirements for nuclear import appear to be complex and will need further characterization. All fragments examined could localize to the nucleus, either constitutively or upon LMB treatment, indicating the presence of multiple NLSs (the large size of the fragments examined (>50 kDa) precludes simple diffusion through the nucleopores). The primary sequence shows two potential classical NLSs. The first sequence is positioned at aa 59, and the second bipartite NLS consensus is at aa 849 (6Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Constantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, a fragment lacking both of these sequences (aa 194–672) was still very efficiently retained in the nucleus upon LMB treatment. Axin might be piggy-backed into the nucleus by one of its interacting partners. Characterization of the Axin Nuclear Export Domains—Axin has no obvious classical consensus export sequence (LxxxLxxLxL, Ref. 38Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Lührmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). To determine the sequence requirements for Axin export, we first examined the localization of a series of Axin variants, in the presence or absence of LMB (examples in Fig. 1, E–H, see summary in Fig. 2A). The patterns observed for each variant were very reproducible, with virtually all cells showing a similar distribution. Mutants with C-terminal deletions up to aa 600 were exclusively cytoplasmic in untreated cells and redistributed to the nucleus in the presence of LMB. Further deletion to aa 531, however, led to constitutive localization to the nucleus. The same deletion also blocked export in the oocyte assay (Fig. 3A). Thus, the region responsible for export appears to be located between aa 531 and 600. On the other hand, N-terminal deletions and internal deletions showed that fragments lacking the first 600 aa were still shuttling in a LMB-sensitive manner, while further deletion to aa 631 caused constitutive nuclear localization, indicating the presence of a second export sequence between aa 600 and 631. We have used the oocyte assay to further dissect the regions responsible for export. For this purpose, we have tested small fragments fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), which does not diffuse on its own through the nuclear pore (Fig. 3L). The results are summarized in Fig. 2B, and examples are shown in Fig. 3, D–K. Consistent with the results from cell transfections, we could thus identify two small fragments mediating export, aa 532–560 (Fig. 3, E and H) and aa 641–667 (Fig. 3G). The presence of a short sequence between these two regions, aa 601–640 (Fig. 3, F and K), appeared to decrease the efficiency of export via the first fragment (Fig. 3I). Possible explanations for this inhibition could be steric hindrance by an interacting partner or inappropriate conformation in the context of these small fragments. Full export was restored by addition of the second fragment (aa 532–667, Fig. 3J). As mentioned above, the Axin sequence does not reveal any classical leucine-rich NES. However, the two identified fragments mediating Axin export have sequences remotely resembling a classical NES (LxxxLxxVxM and VxxLxLxL, respectively, Fig. 2C). To assess the role of these residues we introduced double point mutations in both of these sequences (Ax(mutNES1+2) in Fig. 2A). These mutations did not prevent Axin shuttling in HEK293 cells, confirming that Axin export does not rely on a classical NES. It is known that CRM1-mediated export can also be mediated by atypical NESs (39Otero G.C. Harris M.E. Donello J.E. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7593-7597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hoshino H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and in the case of the U snRNP receptor snuportin1, a much larger domain appears to bind to CRM1 (41Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartman E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to determine the essential residues within the two Axin export domains. Direct Binding of Axin to CRM1—We next wanted to examine whether, despite the absence of a typical NES, Axin could bind directly to CRM1. To address this issue, we tested binding of Axin to CRM1 in vitro, using recombinant proteins (Fig. 5). As the specific interaction of a transport substrate with CRM1 must be RanGTP dependent, binding was assayed in the presence or absence of RanQ69L, a Ran mutant unable to hydrolyze GTP. We tested three His-tagged Axin fragments, Ax-(419–600) and aAx-(419–672), which encompass the region of the NESs, and a control fragment Ax-(96–353), which corresponds to a more N-terminal region without export capacities. We found that Ax-(419–600) and Ax-(419–672), but not Ax-(96–353), could bind CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We conclude that Axin can interact directly with CRM1, although via non-classical NES sequences. Axin Shuttling and the Wnt Pathway—Models about regulation of the Wnt pathway have so far assumed that β-catenin and APC could dynamically shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, while the Axin complex was stably anchored in the cytoplasm. The fact that Axin can also shuttle in and out of the nucleus prompts to a re-evaluation of our current view of the pathway. One of the models, in particular, has proposed that APC plays the role of a shuttle mediating export of β-catenin (24Bienz M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based mainly on two observations: 1) LMB treatment can cause accumulation of β-catenin in the nuclei of some cell lines (27Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), a phenotype that has been interpreted as the direct consequence of inhibition of CRM1-mediated export of APC. 2) Expression of APC mutants that failed to be re-exported from the nucleus caused accumulation of nuclear β-catenin (27Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 29Rosin-Abersfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 42Neufeld K.L. Zhang F. Cullen B.R. White R.L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present data show that LMB also affects shuttling of a second β-catenin binding protein, Axin, which, in principle, could then also contribute to β-catenin export. However, there are other possible interpretations of these data. For instance, sequestration of β-catenin-binding proteins in the nucleus, either by LMB treatment or mutation of the export sequences, can certainly cause passive retention of β-catenin in this compartment. In the case of Axin, β-catenin faithfully colocalizes with various overexpressed Axin variants, whether in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. 5F. Fagotto, unpublished results. In fact, the consequences of LMB treatment may be complex and cell type-dependent. At least in HEK293 cells, we could not observe any obvious effect of LMB treatment on β-catenin; β-catenin levels were not increased, and there was no detectable β-catenin in the nuclei. 6K. Heinle and F. Fagotto, unpublished results. Axin may also have yet unknown functions in the nucleus or may even simply enter the nucleus fortuitously, e.g. carried along by one of its many interacting partners, and would then need to be retrieved to the cytoplasm to preserve on the long term the proper organization of the complex. While we found Axin to be largely cytoplasmic in various cell lines, a diffuse nuclear staining has been observed in epithelial cells of normal human colon tissue (37Anderson C.B. Neufeld K.L. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8683-8688Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that nuclear localization of Axin may be regulated under physiological conditions. We have not been able to test the role of Axin export by mutating the export domain, because modifying the sequence in this region will affect the overlapping binding sites for β-catenin and PP2A (see Fig. 2C). We thus need to find other approaches to unravel this challenging issue, which is a prerequisite for understanding how the Wnt pathway really works."

Therefore, localization and activity of SNAREs have to be tightly controlled. Regulatory proteins bind to N-terminal domains of some SNAREs. vti1b is a mammalian SNARE that functions in late endosomal fusion. To investigate the role of the N terminus of vti1b we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. The N terminus of vti1b interacted specifically with the epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain of enthoprotin/CLINT/epsinR. The interaction was confirmed using in vitro binding assays. This complex formation between a SNARE and an ENTH domain was conserved between mammals and yeast. Yeast Vti1p interacted with the ENTH domain of Ent3p. ENTH proteins are involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. Both epsinR and Ent3p bind adaptor proteins at the trans-Golgi network. Vti1p is required for multiple transport steps in the endosomal system. Genetic interactions between VTI1 and ENT3 were investigated. Synthetic defects suggested that Vti1p and Ent3p cooperate in transport from the trans-Golgi network to the prevacuolar endosome.

Lang T. Sudhof T. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). SNAREs can be subdivided into four different groups (R-, Qa-, Qb-, and Qc-SNAREs, with R and Q being the single-letter abbreviations of arginine and glutamine, respectively) according to similarities in their amino acid sequences. All well characterized SNARE complexes are composed of four different SNARE helices, one from each group. The conserved SNARE motif is located next to a C-terminal transmembrane anchor in most SNAREs. Many SNAREs contain N-terminal domains that fold independently and are highly divergent in their amino acid sequences. The N-terminal domains of SNAREs belonging to syntaxins or to Qa-SNAREs can bind proteins that regulate SNARE complex formation. Other binding partners recruit Qa- or R-SNAREs into budding vesicles. The N-terminal domains of the R-SNAREs Sec22p (2Gonzalez L.J. Weis W. Scheller R. J. Biol.

We set out to identify interaction partners for Qb-SNAREs, which function in endosomal traffic. The yeast Qb-SNARE Vti1p is required for the following: (i) transport from the TGN to the prevacuolar endosome; (ii) traffic to the vacuole (equivalent to the mammalian lysosome); (iii) retrograde traffic to the cis-Golgi; and (iv) homotypic TGN fusion as part of four different SNARE complexes (4Fischer von Mollard G.

Mammalian cells contain two homologs of yeast Vti1p. vti1a and vti1b share 30% of their amino acid residues with each other as well as with Vti1p. vti1a and vti1b have distinct subcellular localization, distinct SNARE partners, and more specialized roles than their yeast counterpart. The mammalian SNAREs vti1a, syntaxin 6, syntaxin 16, and VAMP-4 form a complex required for retrograde transport from the endosome to the TGN and for early endosome fusion (7Antonin W. Holroyd C.

A complex consisting of vti1b, syntaxin 8, syntaxin 7, and endobrevin/VAMP-8 is involved in fusion of late endosomes (7Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 7, probably as part of the same SNARE complex, is also required for transport from the late endosome to the lysosome (10Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Ward D. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of vti1b, syntaxin 7, and syntaxin 8 have high α-helical contents. This domain consists of a three-helix bundle in the Qa-SNARE syntaxin 7 as well as in the Qb-SNARE vti1b. However, the N-terminal domain seems to have a different function in syntaxin 7 than in the other two proteins. The N terminus of syntaxin 7 interacts with its own SNARE domain, resulting in inhibition of SNARE complex formation. By contrast, vti1b and syntaxin 8 do not adopt this closed conformation (12Antonin W. Dulubova I. Arac D. Pabst S. Plitzner J. Rizo J. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36449-36456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of syntaxin 8 most likely also forms a threehelix bundle, because this structure is formed in the related Qc-SNARE syntaxin 6 (13Misura K. Bock J. Gonzalez L.J. Scheller R. Weis W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9184-9189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Vti1a and vti1b are related but functionally distinct proteins. Here, we have used the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify a specific binding partner for the N-terminal domain of vti1b.

Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Positive cells were selected on plates with minimal medium lacking uracil, lysine, tryptophan, leucine, and histidine complemented with 2.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Yeast cells containing pairs of LexA DNA-binding domain and VP16 activation domain fusions were streaked out on selective plates to study specific two-hybrid interactions. In Vitro Binding Assays—ENTH domains of epsinR and Ent3p with a C-terminal Strep-tag were expressed in E. coli using the plasmid pASK-IBA3 and purified using Strep-Tactin affinity columns according to the manufacturer's instruction (IBA). The cytosolic domains of vti1a, vti1b, and Vti1p were expressed with an N-terminal His6 tag in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The purified recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Purity was estimated to be >90%. To study in vitro binding of bacterially expressed purified proteins, 4.4 μg of epsinR-Strep and 6 μg of His6-vti1b or His6-vti1a were mixed in 100, 200, 500, or 1000 μl of PBS and 1% Triton X-100, resulting in final concentrations of 2, 1, 0.2, or 0.1 μm, respectively, for each protein. The following protein amounts were used in Fig. 2: 20 μg of Ent3p-Strep (9 μm) with 30 μg of Vti1p (12 μm) in 100 μl of PBS and 1% Triton X-100; 9 μg of Ent3p-Strep (4 μm) with 15 μg of Vti1p (6 μm) in 100 μl of PBS and 1% Triton X-100; 3.6 μg of Ent3p-Strep (1.7 μm) with 6 μg of Vti1p (2.4 μm) in 100 μl of PBS and 1% Triton X-100; and 3.6 μg of Ent3p-Strep (0.8 μm) with 6 μg of Vti1p (1.2 μm) in 200 μl of PBS and 1% Triton X-100. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, Ni-NTA beads were added, and the incubation was continued for another 30 min. After quick washes, the pellets were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and Strep-tagged proteins were detected by Strep-Tactin-horseradish peroxidase (IBA) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Liposomes were generated, and liposome binding was performed as described (17Rohde G. Wenzel D. Haucke V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 100 μg of liposomes (70% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 10% variable lipids) were incubated with 4 μg of the Strep-tagged ENTH domain of Ent3p in 150 μl of 25 mm Hepes, pH 8, and 50 mm NaCl at 4 °C for 15 min. Liposomes were pelleted at 27,000 × gmax for 20 min. After a rinse with buffer, liposome pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Transport Assays—Yeast cells were grown in log phase at 24 °C and 0.5 OD and preincubated at the indicated temperature for 15 min. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/0.5 OD) for 10 min, chased for 30 min unless indicated otherwise, and carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) was immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts and medium, or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts as described (5Fischer von Mollard G.

CPY and ALP antisera were kindly provided by T.H. Stevens. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A BAS1000 (Fuji) was used for quantification. To identify proteins that bind to the N terminus of vti1b, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. The bait protein consisted of the DNA-binding domain of LexA and amino acid residues 1–128 of vti1b. This sequence was chosen because it is highly divergent between different SNAREs. The SNARE motif starts at amino acid residue 146, and the third helix of the N-terminal helix bundle ends at amino acid residue 98 (12Antonin W. Dulubova I. Arac D. Pabst S. Plitzner J. Rizo J.

An interacting plasmid was isolated multiple times from a library encoding fusions of the VP16 activation domain with rat embryonic brain cDNAs (Fig. 1a). This plasmid encoded a full-length ENTH domain protein that was recently described as enthoprotin, CLINT, and epsinR (20Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). epsinR has a N-terminal ENTH domain with an affinity for several phosphoinositides, especially for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and binding sites for clathrin as well as for the TGN adaptor proteins AP1 and GGA2 in the rest of the molecule. Both domains were tested separately for two-hybrid interaction with vti1b. vti1b interacted with the ENTH domain of epsinR but not with the C terminus. This interaction was specific, as vti1b did not exhibit a two-hybrid interaction with ENTH domains of epsin1 or the related ANTH domains of AP180 or Hip1-R (24Duncan M. Payne G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 211-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The N terminus of vti1a did not interact with the ENTH domains tested, further emphasizing the specificity. To confirm the two-hybrid interaction, a bacterially expressed ENTH domain of epsinR with a C-terminal Strep-tag was incubated with the cytosolic domains of vti1b or vti1a as His6 fusion proteins (Fig. 1b). The ENTH domain of epsinR bound to His6-vti1b but not to His6-vti1a. Next, we investigated whether this interaction between a SNARE and an ENTH domain was conserved between mammals and yeast. The yeast genome encodes eight ENTH and ANTH domain proteins, four of which form pairs of closely related proteins (Ent1p with Ent2p and yAP1801 with yAP1802). The N-terminal domain of yeast Vti1p was expressed as a fusion protein with the LexA DNA binding domain. Different ENTH domains were fused to the VP16 activation domain. The N-terminal domain of Vti1p interacted specifically with the ENTH domain of Ent3p but not with Ent1p, Ent4p, Ent5p, Sla2p, or yAP1801 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2a). Additionally, Vti1p did not interact with epsinR, nor did vti1b interact with Ent3p in the two-hybrid assay (data not shown). In a pull-down assay, the ENTH domain of Ent3p with a Strep-tag-bound His6-Vti1p at high protein concentrations (Fig. 2b), confirming the significance of the two-hybrid data. Ent3p binds the clathrin adaptor Gga2p and has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle formation at the Golgi or endosome (25Duncan M. Costaguta G. Payne G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Different phosphoinositides are regulators of trafficking in these organelles in yeast (26Simonsen A. Wurmser A. Emr S. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is implicated in secretory traffic from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is implicated in traffic to the endosome and autophagocytosis. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate is required for sorting into the internal vesicles in prevacuolar endosomes to form multivesicular bodies. We tested whether the Strep-tagged ENTH domain of Ent3p pelleted with liposomes containing these phosphoinositides. Ent3p bound specifically to liposomes with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate (Fig. 3). Several deletion strains were generated to investigate the function of ENT genes in membrane traffic. The newly synthesized endoplasmic reticulum-modified form of the vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (p1CPY) is modified to p2CPY in the Golgi. p2CPY is transported from the TGN to the prevacuolar endosome and, in a second step, to the vacuole where it is cleaved to mature CPY (27Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). p2CPY is secreted from the cells if transport from the TGN to the vacuole is defective. CPY transport was analyzed by pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation. No defects in CPY maturation were observed in ent4Δ and ent5Δ cells (Fig. 4). Slightly elevated levels of p2CPY were secreted into the medium (shown as E on Fig. 4) by ent3Δ and ent3Δent4Δ cells, even though most CPYs reached the vacuole (mature CPY in the intracellular fraction). ent3Δ ent5Δ cells secreted even more p2CPY. This slight transport defect indicates that Ent3p and Ent5p have a partially redundant function in CPY transport, but other proteins can almost compensate for their loss. We used different vti1 mutant strains to investigate whether Ent3p or Ent5p have a functional connection with Vti1p and in which trafficking steps. vti1-1 cells are only defective in transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole (4Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The absence of Ent3p reduced mature CPY levels in vti1-1 cells from 64.3% (S.D. 12) to 11.9% (S.D. 5.8; n = 3) at a semipermissive temperature (Fig. 5a). Lack of Ent5p did not lead to a synthetic defect. vti1-2 cells are defective in transport from the Golgi to the prevacuole as well as in transport to the vacuole (5Fischer von Mollard G. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1719-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Vacuolar maturation of the pro form of ALP was used as an assay for fusion with the vacuole, because the pALP travels from the Golgi to the vacuole without passage through the prevacuole (27Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A deletion of ENT3 did not result in reduced appearance of vacuolar mature ALP in vti1-2 cells at a semipermissive temperature (Fig. 5b). Slightly less mature ALP was found in the absence of Ent5p in vti1-2 cells after both a 5- and a 30-min chase period (percentage of mature ALP after 30 min: vti1-2, 75.5%, S.D. 1.5; vti1-2ent3Δ, 73.9%, S.D. 0.1; vti1-2ent5Δ, 60%, S.D. 1.0, n = 2). These data implicate Ent3p in traffic from the Golgi to the prevacuole. vti1-2 cells grow very slowly at 37 °C. Both vti1-2ent3Δ and vti1-2ent5Δ cells were unable to grow at 37 °C. The synthetic growth defect in vti1-2ent3Δ cells is probably due to reduced trafficking through the prevacuole, which was detected as synthetic defect in CPY maturation (data not shown). The small synthetic defects in ALP maturation may be the reason for the synthetic growth defect in vti1-2ent5Δ cells. Alternatively, the growth defect may be due to the action of Ent5p in an unidentified transport step.Fig. 5Genetic interactions between VTI1 and ENT3 or ENT5. a, absence of Ent3p resulted in strong defects of CPY transport to the vacuole in vti1-1 cells.

Epsin1 is a cytosolic protein required for endocytosis. An additional pool of epsin1 is present in the nucleus in a complex with the transcription factor PLZF (28Hyman J. Chen H. Di Fiore P. De Camilli P. Brunger A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Tubulin interacts with all ENTH and ANTH domains tested (epsin1, epsinR, AP180, HIP1, and Hip1R) (29Hussain N. Yamabhai M. Bhakar A. Metzler M. Ferguson S. Hayden M. McPherson P. Kay B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28823-28830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we described the specific interaction of the N terminus of the mammalian SNARE vti1b with the ENTH domain of epsinR and of yeast Vti1p with Ent3p. These data as well as the following lines of evidence indicate that Ent3p may be the yeast equivalent of epsinR, even though both proteins bind different phosphoinositides (see below). The ENTH domain of epsinR is most related to that of Ent3p in BLAST searches of yeast protein sequences. In addition, only Ent3p shares sequence homologies with epsinR that extend beyond the ENTH domain. Both proteins bind TGN adaptor proteins of the GGA family and AP-1 and colocalize with clathrin-coated vesicles in the Golgi area, and they have therefore been implicated in clathrin coatedvesicle formation at the TGN or endosomes (20Wasiak S. Legendre-Guillemin V. Puertollano R. Blondeau F. Girard M. de Heuvel E. Boismenu D. Bell A. Bonifacino J. McPherson P. J.

Synthetic defects in TGN-to-prevacuole traffic in vti1-1 cells indicate that VTI1 and ENT3 function together in this trafficking step. These data are in agreement with the interactions between Gga2p and Ent3p and the requirement for GGA proteins in traffic from the TGN to the prevacuole (30Black M. Pelham H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 31Costaguta G. Stefan C. Bensen E. Emr S. Payne G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1885-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). vti1-2ent5Δ cells displayed a synthetic growth defect at 37 °C. Temperature-sensitive growth defects have been observed in the absence of proteins involved in different post Golgi transport steps. Growth at 37 °C, for example, requires Pep12p, a syntaxin involved in fusion with the prevacuole (32Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Vps33p, a sec1-related protein required for fusion with the vacuole (33Banta L.M. Vida T.A. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4638-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the GARP or VFT complex, tether proteins in retrograde traffic from the prevacuole to the TGN (34Conibear E. Stevens T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The synthetic growth defect in vti1-2ent5Δ cells was not due to a synthetic defect in transport from the TGN to the prevacuolar endosome, because CPY transport did not show a synthetic defect. The growth defect may be due to a small synthetic defect in ALP transport to the vacuole. However, ALP transport to the vacuole does not require GGA proteins (31Costaguta G. Stefan C. Bensen E. Emr S. Payne G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1885-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and is only marginally delayed in ent3Δent5Δ cells (25Duncan M. Costaguta G. Payne G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ent3Δent5Δ cells secrete α-factor precursor (25Duncan M. Costaguta G. Payne G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This processing of α-factor precursor requires Kex2p in the TGN, pointing toward a loss of Kex2p from the TGN in ent3Δent5Δ cells. As Kex2p cycles between TGN and endosomes, retrograde traffic to the TGN may be defective in ent3Δent5Δ cells. Therefore it is possible that Ent5p is important for retrograde transport to the TGN, and this may be the reason for the synthetic growth defect in vti1-2ent5Δ cells. Different synthetic transport defects in vti1 mutant backgrounds indicate that Ent3p and Ent5p have slightly different functions. A role of Ent3p in traffic between TGN and the prevacuole is also supported by the observed binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate, which are implicated in TGN-to-endosome traffic and in the formation of multivesicular bodies, respectively (26Simonsen A. Wurmser A. Emr S. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). By contrast, epsinR interacted most strongly with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (21Kalthoff C. Groos S. Kohl R. Mahrhold S. Ungewickell E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4060-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Hirst J. Motley A. Harasaki K. Peak Chew S. Robinson M. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This different specificity in phosphoinositide binding has been predicted by modeling the tertiary structure of the ENTH domains of epsinR and Ent3p (24Duncan M. Payne G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 211-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As both phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate are present in the Golgi complex (35De Matteis M. Godi A. Corda D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), either phosphoinositide may help to recruit epsinR or Ent3p to the same organelle. GGAs function in TGN-to-endosome traffic in mammalian cells (36Hinners I. Tooze S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is unclear which mammalian SNAREs are involved in this pathway. The binding to epsinR indicates that vti1b may be required for traffic from the TGN to endosomes. To date, vti1b has been implicated only in late endosome fusion (7Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). What are the functional implications of an interaction between ENTH proteins and SNAREs? One possibility is that Ent3p and epsinR function in the sorting and recruitment of Vti1p and vti1b, respectively, into budding vesicles. Interactions between adaptor proteins and cargo are often of low affinity and have to be very dynamic because the complexes have to dissociate after vesicle formation. Therefore, binding between adaptor protein complexes and tails of membrane receptors are rarely detectable by co-immunoprecipitations and have been studied almost exclusively using in vitro binding and yeast two-hybrid assays (37Nonet M. Holgado A. Brewer F. Serpe C. Norbeck B. Holleran J. Wei L. Hartwieg E. Jorgensen E. Alfonso A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In line with these observations, we have not been able to co-immunoprecipitate Ent3p with Vti1p or epsinR with vti1b (data not shown). A similar adaptorcargo interaction may explain why the loss of UNC-11, a homolog of the ANTH protein AP180, results in mislocalization of the R-SNARE synaptobrevin but not of other synaptic vesicle proteins to the plasma membrane in Caenorhabditis elegans (38Bonifacino J. Dell'Angelica E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). UNC-11 may directly recruit synaptobrevin into clathrincoated vesicles during endocytosis. It has been shown that SNAREs bind other components of the budding machinery like COPII coat proteins in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (39Springer S. Schekman R. Science. 1998; 281: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and adaptor complexes that couple cargo selection to clathrin recruitment. The mammalian R-SNARE VAMP-4 interacts with AP-1 at the TGN (40Peden A. Park G. Scheller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49183-49187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In yeast, the vacuolar syntaxin Vam3p binds AP-3 in transport from the TGN to the vacuole (41Darsow T. Burd C. Emr S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A complex of mammalian AP-3 and synaptobrevin mediates formation of synaptic vesicles from endosomes (42Salem N. Faundez V. Horng J. Kelly R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 7: 551-556Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), indicating that incorporation of a SNARE can regulate vesicle budding. In ENTH proteins, only the ubiquitin interaction motif has been implicated in cargo binding (43Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 44Shih S. Katzmann D. Schnell J. Sutanto M. Emr S. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This UIM motif is located outside of the ENTH domain and is absent from epsinR and Ent3p.

Superparamagnetic antibodies specific for cell surface markers allowed imaging of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and Mac1+ cells in the CNS of mice infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Superparamagnetic antibodies have excellent T2, T2*, and good T1 relaxation properties, which makes them ideal MRI contrast materials. Immunohistochemistry of corresponding sections confirmed the specificity of the technique to detect immune cell types in the CNS.

Our hypothesis predicts that lipid antioxidants capable of blocking PS oxidation will inhibit PS externalization and/or recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes. An important feature of such a lipid antioxidant, however, is that it should block phospholipid oxidation without affecting other redox-sensitive mechanisms. Our previous work has established that a phenolic antitumor drug, etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor), acts as a powerful lipid antioxidant but does not protect thiols against oxidation because of a relatively high reactivity of etoposide phenoxyl radicals toward SH-groups (11Kagan V.E. Kuzmenko A.I. Tyurina Y.Y. Shvedova A.A. Matsura T. Yalowich J.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7777-7784PubMed Google Scholar). Etoposide has been reported to cause DNA damage and induce apoptosis accompanied by ROS generation (12Gorman A. McGowan A. Cotter T.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13Pham N.A. Hedley D.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the fastidious lipid antioxidant traits of etoposide may dissociate PS-dependent signaling pathways of apoptosis from the final common pathway for apoptosis by inhibiting PS oxidation. However, etoposide effects on phospholipid peroxidation, as they relate to PS-dependent signaling pathways of apoptosis, have not been documented to date. In the present study, we used etoposide as a tool to dissect the mechanism of PS signaling during apoptosis. We found that etoposide fails to trigger PS oxidation and externalization in HL-60 cells. Moreover, etoposide was able to block oxidation of all major phospholipids, including PS, during oxidant (H2O2)-induced apoptosis in these cells. The blockade of phospholipid oxidation correlated with the etoposide-dependent inhibition of PS externalization and phagocytosis of apoptotic HL-60 cells by J774A.1 macrophages. The etoposide-mediated dissociation of PS signaling during apoptosis could be overcome by the integration into HL-60 cells of exogenous PS, and even more so upon integration of PS-OX, thus emphasizing the essential role of PS oxidation in the clearance of apoptotic cells. These results demonstrate that etoposide can modulate PS-dependent externalization and recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages by means of regulation of PS oxidation. Chemicals—cis-Parinaric acid (cis-PnA) and 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride (MCLA) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HPLC grade solvents, fluorescamine, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), fetal bovine serum, glutathione, Hoechst 33342, human serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and superoxide dismutase were purchased from Sigma. RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamycin were purchased from Invitrogen. ThioGlo™ 1 was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). NBD-phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine], NBD-phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC), 1-palmitoyl-2 arachidonoyl-sn-glysero-3-phosphocholine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Cell Culture—HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air) at 37 °C. Cells from passages 25-40 were used for the experiments. The density of cells at collection time was 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. HL-60 cells were incubated in the presence of etoposide (10 μm or 50 μm) and/or H2O2 in fetal bovine serum-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red for 2 h at 37 °C. H2O2 (25 μm) was added four times (every 30 min of incubation). In the case of combination of etoposide with H2O2, etoposide was added 15 min before the addition of H2O2. Macrophages J774A.1 (from the American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air) at 37 °C. Apoptotic Nuclear Morphology—HL-60 cells were incubated in the presence of etoposide and/or H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed and re-suspended in PBS. Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml) was added, and cells were examined under fluorescent microscopy. Results are expressed as the percentage of the cells showing characteristic nuclear morphological features of apoptosis (nuclear condensation and fragmentation) relative to the total number of counted cells (>200 cells). Caspase-3 Activity—The activity of caspase-3 was determined by using a commercially available kit (Molecular Probes). At specified time intervals, aliquots of etoposide- and/or H2O2-stimulated HL-60 cell suspensions were taken, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer (Molecular Probes). The suspensions were centrifuged at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected as lysates. For measurement of caspase activity, 50 μl of lysates were combined with 50 μl of reaction buffer, containing 20 mm PIPES, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% CHAPS, 0.2 mm Asp-Glu-Val-Asp 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC, a fluorogenic peptide substrate), pH 7.4, and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. After incubation, fluorescence was measured in a Packard Fusion™ Multifunctional plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation at 365 ± 50 nm and emission at 465 ± 35 nm. The protein concentration in cell lysates was measured using the Bio-Rad assay. MCLA-enhanced Chemiluminescence—HL-60 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were pre-warmed in PBS containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm glucose for 5 min at 37 °C. After that, etoposide (50 μm) was added, and cells were monitored for 30 min at 37 °C using Luminescence Analyzer 633 (Coral Biomedical Inc., San Diego, CA) set at continuous mixing in the presence of 4 μm MCLA. Assays were performed in the absence and in the presence of superoxide dismutase (50 units/ml) added 5 min prior to the addition of etoposide. The total amount of O2 produced was estimated as the area under the curve (mV × s) upon etoposide stimulation and after subtracting values obtained in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Data were collected and analyzed with the Multiuse PC software version 2.0.2 for Luminoskan 1251 Carousel (Labsystems). Assay of GSH—GSH content in the cells was determined fluorometrically using ThioGlo™ 1 as previously described (14Shvedova A.A. Kommineni C. Jeffries B.A. Castranova V Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Serbinova E.A. Fabisiak J.P. Kagan V.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 354-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with etoposide and/or H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C were collected by centrifugation, washed, and re-suspended in PBS. GSH was measured in cell lysates prepared by freezing and thawing cells. Immediately after the addition of ThioGlo™ 1 to the cell lysates, fluorescence was measured in a Packard Fusion™ Multifunctional plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using excitation of 390 ± 15 nm and emission of 515 ± 30 nm. Annexin V Staining of Externalized PS—PS exposure was determined by flow cytometric detection of annexin V staining using a protocol outlined in the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, HL-60 cells (0.5 × 106) exposed to etoposide and/or H2O2, washed once with PBS and re-suspended in binding buffer were stained with annexin V (0.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (0.6 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. After staining, cells were immediately analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with simultaneous monitoring of green fluorescence (530 nm, 30 nm band-pass filter) for annexin V-FITC and red fluorescence (long-pass emission filter that transmits light >650 nm) associated with propidium iodide. 10,000 events were collected and analyzed using the LYSIS™ II software (BD Biosciences). Derivatization of Externalized PS with Fluorescamine—Labeling of externalized PS with fluorescamine (a probe that reacts with lipids containing primary amino groups) was performed as described previously (8Kagan V.E. Gleiss B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Elenstrom-Magnusson C. Liu S.X. Serinkan F.B. Arroyo A. Chandra J. Orrenius S. Fadeel B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells (3 × 107) exposed to etoposide and/or H2O2 were suspended in labeling buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0). Cells were gently agitated in the presence of fluorescamine (200 μm) for 30 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lipids were extracted by the Folch procedure (15Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were analyzed by two-dimensional HPTLC using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:28% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:5, v/v/v) in the first direction and chloroform:acetone:methanol:glacial acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v/v/v/v) in the second. Fluorescamine-modified PS was localized by exposure of HPTLC plates to UV light by using a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Unmodified phospholipids were visualized under visible light in a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad) after exposure of HPTLC plates to iodine vapor. The phosphorus content of phospholipids was determined according to Bottcher et al. (16Bottcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar) after scraping representative spots from the plate. The amount of modified PS is expressed as percentages of total PS (unmodified plus modified) recovered from the plate on the basis of phosphorus content assay. Assay of Phospholipid Peroxidation—cis-PnA was incorporated into HL-60 cells as described previously (17Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI medium 1640 without phenol red in the presence of cis-PnA (1 μg cis-PnA/106 cells) for 2 h at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were washed with PBS containing human serum albumin (fatty acid-free, 0.5 mg/ml) to remove an excess of unbound cis-PnA. cis-PnA-labeled cells were treated with etoposide (10 or 50 μm) in the presence or in the absence of H2O2 for 2-6 h at 37 °C in 25 mm HEPES buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. H2O2 (25 μm) was added every 30 min during the initial 2 h of incubation. At the end of the incubation, lipids were extracted by the Folch procedure (15Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were separated by normal-phase HPLC using a 5-μm microsorb MV column (4.6 × 250 mm; Rainin Instrument Co. Inc.) as described previously (17Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). The separations were performed by using a Shimadzu LC-600 high-performance liquid chromatography system with an in-line configuration of RF 10 AXL fluorescence detector. Fluorescence of cis-PnA was measured at 420 nm emission after excitation at 324 nm. Data were processed and stored in digital form with Shimadzu EZChrom software. Lipid phosphorus was determined by a micro-method (18Chalvardjian A. Rudnicki E. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Assay of Aminophospholipid Translocase Activity—Aminophospholipid translocase (APT) activity was measured using modifications of the methods of McIntyre and Sleight (19McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and Williamson and et al. (20Williamson P. Bevers E.M. Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Schlegel R.A. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10448-10455Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells (4 × 106) treated with etoposide (50 μm, 2 h at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of H2O2 were centrifuged (400 × g, 10 min) and washed once in incubation buffer (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Cell pellets were re-suspended in incubation buffer (5 × 106 cells/ml) containing 500 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, transferred to a microfuge tube, and placed in ice-water for 10 min. NBD-labeled PS (ethanol solution) was added to cells (final concentration, 10 μm) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Labeled cells were centrifuged and re-suspended at the same density in incubation buffer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell suspensions were placed in a 28 °C water bath to initiate internalization, and 75-μl aliquots of cell suspension were removed at various time intervals (1-20 min) and placed into 2.5 ml of incubation buffer including the reducing agent and 10 mm sodium dithionite. Fluorescence (excitation = 470 nm, emission = 540 nm) was then recorded (within 30-60 s). Samples from the last time point were also placed in incubation buffer without dithionite to obtain total fluorescence intensity (FLtotal). Internalized fluorescence at various times (FLt) was normalized as a percent of the total fluorescence by the following equation: % internalized = (FLt - FL0)/(FLtotal - FL0) × 100. To inhibit APT activity, HL-60 cells were incubated in the presence of NEM (10 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, and APT activity was determined as described above. Phagocytosis of HL-60 Cells by J774A.1 Macrophages—J774A.1 macrophages were seeded into an eight-well chamber slide (5 × 104 cells/well) and cultured overnight in DMEM medium. Before adding target (control or etoposide and/or H2O2-treated HL-60) cells, stimulated cells were washed with serum-free RPMI medium 1640 without phenol red and fluorescently labeled with Cell Tracker™ Orange (5 μg/ml, 10 min at 37 °C) and subsequently washed again (three times) with PBS. Fluorescently labeled cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were co-cultured with macrophages for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, unbound target cells were washed three times with RPMI medium 1640 and three times with PBS; well contents were fixed with a solution of 2% formaldehyde in PBS containing Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were examined under a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 200 fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital Hamamatsu charge-coupled device camera (C4742-95-12NBR) and analyzed using the MetaImaging Series™ software version 4.6 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Macrophages that had a side-by-side connection with target cells (binding) and/or internalized target cells (engulfment) were considered phagocytosis-positive. A minimum of 300 macrophages were analyzed per experimental condition. Results are expressed as the percentage of the phagocytosis-positive macrophages. Preparation of PS- and PS-OX-containing Liposomes—PS was oxidized by incubation with a water-soluble azo-initiator of peroxy radicals, 2,2′-azo-bis-(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride. PS in chloroform was dried under nitrogen and PBS was added to achieve the final concentration of 5 mm. The lipid was incubated with 2,2′-azo-bis-(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (50 mm) at 37 °C for 4 h and then extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Oxidation was assessed by measuring the absorbance of PS hydroperoxides with conjugated dienes at 234 nm. Approximately 30% of PS molecules were estimated to be oxidized after a 4-h incubation, whereas 70% remained non-oxidized; this mixture of PS species is hereafter referred to as oxidized PS (PS-OX). Small unilamellar liposomes containing 50% phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 50% PS (nonoxidized PS or PS-OX) were produced as described by Fadok et al. (21Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). Individual phospholipids, stored in chloroform, were dried under nitrogen. PBS was added to obtain a phospholipid concentration of 1 mm, and the lipid mixture was vortexed and sonicated for 3 min on ice. All liposomes were used immediately after preparation. Treatment of HL-60 Cells with Liposomes—Naïve or etoposide-treated (50 μm for 2 h at 37 °C) apoptotic HL-60 cells were incubated with NEM (10 μm, 10 min at 37 °C) to inhibit APT. At the end of the incubation, cells were centrifuged and NEM was washed out. NEM-treated cells were incubated in the presence of PC+PS or PC+PS+PS-OX liposomes (2.5-150 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. After that, cells were washed with PBS labeled with Cell Tracker™ Orange, and phagocytosis assays were performed as described above. Statistics—The results are presented as mean ± S.E. values from at least three experiments, and statistical analyses were performed by either paired or unpaired Student's t test or one-way ANOVA. The statistical significance of differences was set at p < 0.05. Oxidant- and Non-oxidant-induced Apoptosis in HL-60 Cells—To determine the conditions resulting in triggering of apoptosis in HL-60 cells by etoposide, H2O2, or a combination of etoposide plus H2O2, we studied the appearance of typical nuclear fragmentation as well as caspase-3 activation. Microscopic examination of nuclear morphology showed that, at 50 μm (2 h at 37 °C), etoposide triggered apoptosis in 25.8 ± 6.3% of cells (Fig. 1A). No significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells at this time point was observed when 10 μm of etoposide were employed (data not shown). Under the conditions used, H2O2 (25 μm added every 30 min during incubation for 2 h at 37 °C) effectively induced apoptosis in 30.6 ± 3.5% cells. Notably, a combination of etoposide and H2O2 yielded further enhancement of apoptosis (46.2 ± 9.9% of apoptotic cells after exposure to 50 μm etoposide plus H2O2 (25 μm, four additions over 2 h). As can be seen from the time course of caspase-3 activation, both etoposide and H2O2 induced pronounced responses (Fig. 1B). Even at a low concentration of 10 μm, etoposide caused a significant activation of caspase-3 at 2 h after the exposure (data not shown). At 50 μm, the effect was detectable as early as 1.5 h after exposure and further increased by 2 h. Similarly, H2O2 caused a marked activation of caspase-3 at both 1.5 and 2 h. The effects of the combination of etoposide plus H2O2 were additive at 1.5 h and saturated at 2 h. Caspase-3 was completely inhibited when a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk (50 μm), was present in the incubation system during the exposure to etoposide, H2O2, or a combination of etoposide plus H2O2 (data not shown). Etoposide Treatment of HL-60 Cells Prevents H2O2-induced Oxidation of PS—Execution of the apoptotic program triggered by both oxidant and non-oxidant stimuli may be associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ensuing oxidative stress (22Raha S. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Med. Gen. 2001; 106: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined ROS production and oxidative stress in our model. To determine whether apoptosis was accompanied by the production of superoxide, we used a superoxide-specific enhancer of chemiluminescence, MCLA. The results in Fig. 2A show that superoxide production was significantly increased in HL-60 cells exposed to etoposide (50 μm for 2 h at 37 °C) as compared with untreated cells. To assess the degree of oxidative stress, we measured the level of intracellular GSH in HL-60 cells. We found that after etoposide (50 μm) stimulation for 2 h at 37 °C, the GSH content significantly decreased to 63.6 ± 2.0% of its initial level (Fig. 2B). Similarly, H2O2 (25 μm × 4, 2 h) caused a pronounced depletion of GSH. Finally, when HL-60 cells were exposed to a combination of etoposide and H2O2, an even stronger depletion of GSH was evident. This suggests that etoposide is not likely to interfere with thiol-dependent redox signaling pathways of apoptosis. To establish the extent to which oxidation of phospholipids was associated with the execution of the apoptotic program induced by etoposide, H2O2, and a combination of etoposide plus H2O2, we used a cis-PnA-based technique for quantitative assessment of oxidation of different classes of phospholipids in live cells (17Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Shvedova A.A. Fabisiak J.P. Kagan V.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To this end, cellular phospholipids were metabolically labeled with cis-PnA, an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent fatty acid containing four conjugated double bonds (17Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of cis-PnA-loaded cells with etoposide and/or H2O2, total lipid extracts were prepared and separated by fluorescence HPLC. Typical chromatograms are presented in Fig. 3A. Four peaks corresponding to the major classes of cis-PnA-labeled phospholipids were identified in control HL-60 cells as phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PS, and PC, respectively (Fig. 3A, a). Treatment of cells with H2O2 (25 μm × 4, 2 h) resulted in a marked oxidation of all major phospholipid classes, including PS, as evidenced by decreased intensities of fluorescence responses (Fig. 3A, b). Etoposide alone at both 10 μm (data not shown) and 50 μm did not cause any s"
https://openalex.org/W2123392242,"Trichomonas is an amitochondriate parasitic protozoon specialized for an anaerobic lifestyle. Nevertheless, it is exposed to oxygen and is able to cope with the resultant oxidative stress. In the absence of glutathione, cysteine has been thought to be the major antioxidant. We now report that the parasite contains thioredoxin reductase, which functions together with thioredoxin and thioredoxin peroxidase to detoxify potentially damaging oxidants. Thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin also reduce cystine and so may play a role in maintaining the cellular cysteine levels. The importance of the thioredoxin system as one of the major antioxidant defense mechanisms in Trichomonas was confirmed by showing that the parasite responds to environmental changes resulting in increased oxidative stress by up-regulating thioredoxin and thioredoxin peroxidases levels. Sequence data indicate that the thioredoxin reductase of Trichomonas differs fundamentally in structure from that of its human host and thus may represent a useful drug target. The protein is generally similar to thioredoxin reductases present in other lower eukaryotes, all of which probably originated through horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote. The phylogenetic signal in thioredoxin peroxidase is weak, but evidence from trees suggests that this gene has been subject to repeated horizontal gene transfers from different prokaryotes to different eukaryotes. The data are thus consistent with the complexity hypothesis that predicts that the evolution of simple pathways such as the thioredoxin cascade are likely to be affected by horizontal gene transfer between species.

Trichomonas vaginalis is the protozoan parasite responsible for trichomoniasis in humans (1Petrin D. Delgaty K. Bhatt R. Garber G. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 300-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection, with an estimated >170 million cases occurring each year (2World Health Organization Global Prevalence and Incidence of Selected Curable Sexually Transmitted Diseases: Overview and Estimates. 2001; (WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/2001.10)Google Scholar), and has been implicated as a major risk factor in predisposition to human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS (3Sorvillo F. Smith L. Kerndt P. Ash L Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed it has been suggested that successful treatment of trichomoniasis may be the most cost-effective means by which to reduce human immunodeficiency virus incidence (3Sorvillo F. Smith L. Kerndt P. Ash L Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2001; 7: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Current chemotherapy relies upon a single group of drugs, the 5-nitroimidazoles, and there are worrying signs that drug resistance may be emerging as a significant problem (4Upcroft P. Upcroft J.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus there is a need for new chemotherapeutic tools. The parasite itself is an unusual eukaryote and has been considered to be one of the earliest branching organisms (5Sogin M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Trichomonads are fundamentally fermentative organisms, with oxygen apparently not making a significant contribution to energy metabolism (11Martin W. Muller M. Nature. 1998; 392: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the cells are exposed to oxygen in the natural environment. This was most elegantly demonstrated by the finding that T. vaginalis isolated from patients unresponsive to the standard chemotherapy treatment with metronidazole is drug-resistant in in vitro tests, but only if oxygen is present (4Upcroft P. Upcroft J.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 12Rasoloson D. Tomkova E. Cammack R. Kulda J. Tachezy J.

The implications for T. vaginalis of exposure to oxygen have been pondered over many years. Despite a report of the beneficial effect of low oxygen concentrations (growth being significantly enhanced (15Paget T.A. Lloyd D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 41: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)), it is generally considered that oxygen provides problems rather than benefits. Some of the parasite's enzymes are inactivated by oxygen itself, notably key proteins of the hydrogenosomes, and various metabolites likely to arise from the metabolism of oxygen (such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl free radical) are generally harmful to cells and so need to be countered. Most eukaryotes have glutathione as a key redox buffer and antioxidant, but trichomonads lack this and similar thiols (16Ellis J.E. Yarlett N. Cole D. Humphreys M.J. Lloyd D. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2489-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus cysteine has been considered the major cellular reducing agent and antioxidant, although T. vaginalis is able to generate thiols (propanethiol, methanethiol, and hydrogen sulfide, from the action of the unusual bacterial-like enzyme methionine-γ-lyase (17McKie A.E. Edlind T. Walker J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5549-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), which have been postulated to have antioxidant roles (16Ellis J.E. Yarlett N. Cole D. Humphreys M.J. Lloyd D. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2489-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was believed that the organism relies heavily upon cytosolic NADH oxidase (reducing oxygen to water) and NADPH oxidase (reducing oxygen to hydrogen peroxide) to prevent permeation of oxygen to the hydrogenosomes (18Linstead D.J. Bradley S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the generation of hydrogen peroxide by NADPH oxidase, and superoxide dismutase, poses the question as to how this and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesTRXRgene encoding thioredoxin reductaseTrxRprotein encoded by TRXRrTrxRrecombinant TrxR (equivalent nomenclature is used for thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TrxP) TrxP is also known as peroxiredoxin)DTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)E-64N-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucine-4-guanidinobutylamideHGThorizontal gene transferESTexpressed sequence tagRACErapid amplification of cDNA endMLmaximum likelihood. are removed as T. vaginalis lacks catalase and glutathione-dependent peroxidase activities.

A family of peroxidases has been discovered in recent years that do not use glutathione as the reductant but instead are dependent on reduction by a small protein known as thioredoxin (Trx), which is itself reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (20Chae H.Z.

These Trx-dependent peroxidases, now commonly known as peroxiredoxins (designated TrxP), are seemingly ubiquitous in eukaryotes with there being a number of isoforms localized in different cellular compartments (22Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Netto L.E. Seo M.S. Stadtman E.R. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G.

It has been shown that peroxiredoxins reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides and therefore constitute a major cellular protection system against the devastating consequences of oxidative damage (20Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hoffmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxin-linked detoxification may occur in all eukaryotes but has been perceived to be of special relevance to some parasites, including helminths, trypanosomatids, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, as a crucial means of detoxifying peroxides in the apparent absence of enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidases (26Hoffmann B.

Such metabolism may be of particular importance to amitochondriate eukaryotes, such as the protozoa Entamoeba and Giardia as well as Trichomonas, because they all lack glutathione (30Müller S.

Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Entamoeba histolytica possesses a peroxiredoxin-linked detoxification system that is functionally similar to the bacterial AhpF/AhpC system in that it does not involve thioredoxin as an intermediate electron acceptor (32Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Bruchhaus I. Richter S. Tannich E. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1217-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Giardia lamblia has also been reported to contain TrxR (34Brown D.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 72: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but the way in which the enzyme functions has not yet been addressed. This study was undertaken both to elucidate whether a peroxiredoxin cascade involving TrxR and Trx is a fundamental antioxidant mechanism of T. vaginalis and to investigate whether the biochemical characteristics of the components of the cascade provide optimism that it may be a drug target. Because the complexity hypothesis (35Jain R. Rivera M.C. Lake J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3801-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) predicts that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between species should particularly affect simple systems like peroxiredoxin cascades, we also investigated the evolutionary origins of the Trichomonas genes. Growth and Harvesting of Parasites—A clonal cell line (G3) of T. vaginalis was routinely grown axenically in modified Diamond's medium and harvested as previously described (17McKie A.E. Edlind T. Walker J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5549-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Parasites were either stored as cell pellets at –70 °C for the Western blot analyses and genomic DNA isolation or suspended in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for the RNA preparations and analyses. Cloning of TRXR, TRX, and TRXP of T. vaginalis—Genes apparently corresponding to TRXR, TRX, and TRXP were identified in an EST data base of T. vaginalis G3. 2R. P. Hirt and T. M. Embley, unpublished data. Total RNA was prepared from T. vaginalis G3 using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). The 5′ RACE system (Invitrogen) was used to clone the 5′-ends of the TRX, TRXR, and TRXP mRNAs. Nested gene-specific primers were designed based on EST sequences. Those used for first strand cDNA synthesis and amplification of cDNA, respectively, were NT3 and NT4 (for TRXR), NT5 and NT6 (for TRX), and NT7 and NT15 (for TRXP) as detailed in Table I. PCR was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min; then 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were cloned into vector pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced. The sequence of the 5′-end of each mRNA, including the translation initiation codon, was determined by analyzing the sequence of at least two PCR products from each of two independent 5′ RACE experiments.Table IOligonucleotides usedNT1CGTCAGCATATGTCTGCTCAAGCATTCGNT2TATAGCGGCCGCGTCACTGAGATATCTNT3GGCTGTAGCACCTGTAGCGNT4GCCCATATCGGTCTCGAGGCGNT5GCGAGAAACATCAGCACCNT6CAGCACCAACAAACTGATCTAATGTCNT7GTGGCGGATGATGCCCTCTNT10CAGTGACATATGTCCGATCCAATTGTTCACTTCAATGGCACTCACGAAGCTNT11GACACTCGAGTTTGAACTTTTCAATATCAGCTTTGATGCNT12CAGTGACATATGCTTGTTGGCAAACCAGCTCCAGCATTCAAGGNT15CCGAGATCGCCGATAAGTGGGTANT28GACACTCGAGGTTGTTAGCCTTTCCGAAG Open table in a new tab The full-length TRX coding region was amplified from EST 144 using primers NT10 and NT11 and the PCR conditions detailed above for the 5′ RACE. The primers contain restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the PCR product into the expression vector pET21a+. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated to NdeI- and XhoI-digested pET21a+ to generate pBP1. In the same way and using the same PCR conditions, the full-length TRXP coding region was amplified from EST450 using primers NT12 and NT28 and cloned into pET21a+ to give pBP24. The TRXR coding region was amplified from total RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(d(T)15) as a primer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The TRXR was amplified using primers NT1 and NT2 and the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) (94 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 7 min) and cloned into pGEM-T. The 0.92-kb NdeI and NotI fragment containing the full-length TRXR sequence was ligated into pET21a+ previously digested with the same enzymes to give pBP3. The sequence of each construct was confirmed on both strands by the University of Glasgow MBSU Sequencing Facility. Sequence analysis was carried out using Vector NTI software (Informax). Plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21/DE3 for protein expression. Recombinant proteins have a C-terminal 6× histidine tag to facilitate purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Phylogenetic Analyses of TrxR, Trx, and TrxP—The T. vaginalis Trx (112 residues)-, TrxR (304 residues)-, and TrxP (196 residues)-translated proteins were aligned to reference proteins extracted from the NCBI databases, using ClustalW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Protein alignments were edited manually using GDE2.2 (37Maidak B.L. Olsen G.J. Larsen N. Overbeek R. McCaughey M.J. Woese C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Ambiguously aligned positions and sites where more than 25% of sequences contained an insertion/deletion (indels) were removed using the mask function prior to phylogenetic analyses. When ambiguous sites and indels were removed for the broadest taxonomic sampling for TrxR (74 taxa), a dataset of 268 sites was left for analysis. A second alignment of 284 selected sites was also used for a reduced taxa set (38 taxa). Phylogenetic analyses of these two datasets recovered essentially identical topologies for the shared taxa. The programs TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 (38Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar) and MRBAYES (39Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19396) Google Scholar) were used to perform protein maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses. To assess support for relationships we used bootstrapping of protein maximum likelihood distances using the script PUZZLEBOOT (available from the author Andrew Roger at hades.biochem.dal.ca/Rogerlab/) in combination with SEQBOOT and NEIGHBOUR. 3J. Felsenstein (1993) PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) version 3.5c. Distributed by the author (Seattle, Dept. of Genetics, University of Washington). These analyses used the JTT substitution matrix with site-rate heterogeneity expressed by a gamma correction, including a fraction of potentially invariable sites. The parameters for the gamma correction were estimated using TREE-PUZZLE 5.0. The same analytical approaches were used to analyze the TrxP dataset comprising 47 taxa and 175 aligned positions. To investigate the support for alternative phylogenetic positions for the T. vaginalis TrxR and TrxP sequences, for example for their monophyly with the diplomonad parasites G. lamblia and Spironucleus barkhanus sequences, we performed constrained parsimony analyses in PAUP4.0b8. The MP trees for each hypothesis were then evaluated for their maximum likelihood values using the Shimodara Hasegawa test (41Shimodaira H. Hasegawa M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1114-1116Crossref Scopus (3480) Google Scholar) implemented in the p4 software (Peter Foster, The Natural History Museum, London). Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA from 2 × 107T. vaginalis was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% (w/v) agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). [α-32P]dATP-labeled DNA probes were prepared from agarose gel-purified restriction endonuclease fragments using Prime-IT II random primer kit (Stratagene) and purified on Microspin S-200 HR columns (Amersham Biosciences). The probes used were: TRXR, a 0.8-kb XhoI fragment of EST 610; TRXP, a 0.5-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment of EST 450; TRX, a 0.8-kb PruII fragment of EST 144; α-actin, a 1.2-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment of EST 197. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C overnight in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and twice for 30 min at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Storage phosphor screens were exposed to the labeled filters and scanned using a Typhoon 8600 Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Levels of mRNA were quantified using ImageQuaNT image analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were stripped with boiling 0.1% SDS, rinsed with 2× SSC, and reprobed. The T. vaginalis α-actin mRNA levels were used to normalize TRX, TRXR, and TRXP mRNA levels. Normalized mRNA levels in the treated cultures were expressed relative to the control culture, which was given an arbitrary value of 1.0 unit. Production of Recombinant TrxR, Trx, and TrxP—Single colonies of BL21/DE3 harboring pBP1, pBP3, and pBP24, respectively, were grown in Luria Bertani medium, the expression of the recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside, and recombinant proteins purified using Ni2+-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations using a BioCad fast protein liquid chromatography system. The eluted proteins (rTrxR, rTrx, and rTrxP) were stored at 4 °C with 0.02% azide. They remained highly active, as assessed by the enzymatic analysis, for more than 2 months. rTrxR concentration was assessed by using the molar extinction coefficient of 11,300 m–1 cm–1 at 453 nm (42Williams Jr., C.H. Zanetti G. Arscott L.D. McAllister J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rTrx concentration was determined by using the molar extinction coefficient of 13,700 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm (43Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). rTrxP concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay microtitre plate method (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Western Blot Analyses—Polyclonal antisera were raised in rabbits against purified rTrx, rTrxR, and rTrxP by the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (Carluke, UK) using standard immunization protocols. T. vaginalis lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μmN-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucine-4-guanidinobutylamide (E-64), 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 4 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to the equivalent of 108 cells/ml and lysed by repeated aspiration via a 1-ml micropipette. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and soluble protein in the supernatant was quantified using a BCA protein assay microtitre plate method (Pierce). Soluble proteins were fractionated on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% (w/v) milk and 0.2% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific polyclonal antisera diluted 1:10,000 in TBS containing 1% (w/v) milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution in 10× TBS containing 1% (w/v) milk powder) and ECL reagents (Pierce). Enzyme Assays—TrxR activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm in a reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 200 μg/ml insulin (bovine pancreas, 28.1 USP units/mg, Sigma), 12.5 μm rTrx, and 44 pmol of rTrxR. The reaction was initiated by addition of the rTrx (44Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The Km value for rTrx was estimated by varying the rTrx concentrations from 0.07 to 22 μm. rTrxP activity was measured by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm in a reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 12.5 μm rTrx, 74 pmol of rTrxR, 3 nmol of rTrxP, and 20 μm peroxide (hydrogen peroxide, tert-butylhydroperoxide or cumene hydroperoxide). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the peroxide. NADPH oxidase activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm in reaction mixtures comprising 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 or 9.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 148 pmol of rTrxR. 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reductase activity was measured by monitoring the production of thionitrobenzoate at 412 nm in a reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 5 mm DTNB, and 44 pmol of rTrxR. Specific activity for the reaction was calculated according to Holmgren (46Holmgren A J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the molar extinction coefficient at 412 nm as 2 × 13,600 m–1 cm–1 as 1 mol of NADPH yields 2 mol of thionitrobenzoate. Cystine reductase activity of the TrxR/Trx couple was measured by monitoring the oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm in a reaction mixture comprising 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 12.5 μm rTrx, 44 pmol of rTrxR and varying concentrations of l-cystine (5–50 μm). All assays were performed at 37 °C. Kinetic calculations were performed using the computer program Grafit (Erithacus Software). The Effects of Growth Conditions upon the Expression of TrxR, Trx, and TrxP in T. vaginalis—Parasites were grown in 25 ml of medium in tightly capped universal tubes with little gas phase, except for the “aerobic” cultures, which were grown in 500-ml tissue culture vessels with loose caps in a normally aspirated incubator. Under these aerobic conditions, growth over 18 h was reduced by 62% compared with control anaerobic cultures. The standard modified Diamond's medium was varied by removal of ascorbate (normally present at 5.7 mm) or addition of l-cysteine, l-serine, or l-methionine to 10 mm. None of these significantly affected growth over 18 h. Cultures were initiated at 105 parasites/ml, and incubation was for l8 h at 37 °C, whereupon the parasites were harvested, washed, and stored as pellets at –70 °C until analysis (17McKie A.E. Edlind T. Walker J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5549-5556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Isolation and Characterization of TRXR of T. vaginalis—The identification of an EST from T. vaginalis with strong sequence similarity to TRXR simplified the isolation of the full-length cDNA. The initiation methionine was confirmed by using 5′ RACE on mRNA. TRXR of T. vaginalis (accession number AJ507831) is predicted to encode a protein (TrxR) of 304 amino acids, with a subunit molecular mass of 32.4 kDa. Thus the enzyme is similar in size to low molecular weight TrxRs (designated L-TrxR) characteristic of bacteria, plants, and many lower eukaryotes. These proteins differ fundamentally from the high molecular weight TrxRs (designated H-TrxR) of humans and some other eukaryotes, including P. falciparum (29Hirt R.P. Müller S. Embley T.M. Coombs G.H. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 302-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 47Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the T. vaginalis TrxR confirmed that it indeed belongs to the L-TrxR group and is distinct from both the H-TrxR group and the AhpFs of bacteria. An alignment of the TrxR of T. vaginalis with other L-TrxRs shows that it possesses the key active site cysteine residues (boxed in Fig. 1). The level of identity with other L-TrxRs (G. lamblia, accession number AJ507833; E. histolytica, CAA56112; Saccharomy"

One of its dominant antigenic epitopes is segment Pro85 to Pro96 (human sequence numbering, corresponding to Pro82 to Pro93 in the mouse). There have been several, contradictory predictions of secondary structure in this region; either β-sheet, α-helix, random coil, or combinations thereof have all been proposed. In this paper, molecular dynamics and site-directed spin labeling in aqueous solution indicate that this segment forms a transient α-helix, which is stabilized in 30% trifluoroethanol. When bound to a myelin-like membrane surface, this antigenic segment exhibits a depth profile that is characteristic of an amphipathic α-helix, penetrating up to 12 Å into the bilayer. The α-helix is tilted ∼9°, and the central lysine is in an ideal snorkeling position for side-chain interaction with the negatively charged phospholipid head groups. Myelin basic protein is a candidate autoantigen in multiple sclerosis.

There have been several, contradictory predictions of secondary structure in this region; either β-sheet, α-helix, random coil, or combinations thereof have all been proposed. In this paper, molecular dynamics and site-directed spin labeling in aqueous solution indicate that this segment forms a transient α-helix, which is stabilized in 30% trifluoroethanol. When bound to a myelin-like membrane surface, this antigenic segment exhibits a depth profile that is characteristic of an amphipathic α-helix, penetrating up to 12 Å into the bilayer. The α-helix is tilted ∼9°, and the central lysine is in an ideal snorkeling position for side-chain interaction with the negatively charged phospholipid head groups.

There is significant evidence that myelin basic protein (MBP) is a candidate antigen for T-cells and autoantibodies in MS (1Wucherpfennig K.W. Catz I. Hausmann S. Strominger J.L. Steinman L. Warren K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1114-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP maintains the compaction of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system by anchoring the cytoplasmic face of the two apposing bilayers (2Smith R. J.

The level of anti-MBP antibodies is increased in the cerebro-spinal fluid of patients with active MS (4Warren K.G. Catz I. Ann. Neurol. 1987; 21: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), as well as in 96% of patients with relapsing and chronic MS (5Warren K.G. Catz I. Johnson E. Mielke B. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 35: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An MBP region between Pro85 and Pro96 (human sequence numbering) was identified to be a minimal B cell epitope and a T cell epitope for HLA DR2b (DRB1*1501)-restricted T cells that recognize the protein (1Wucherpfennig K.W.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11061-11065Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This epitope overlaps with the DR2a-restricted epitope for T-cells reactive to MBP residues 87-106 (7Martin R. Howell M.D. Jaraquemada D. Flerlage M. Richert J. Brostoff S. Long E.O. McFarlin D.E. McFarland H.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Experimental treatments for MS based on peptide mimetics of MBP have focused on this region of the protein (8Matsoukas J. Apostolopoulos V. Mavromoustakos T. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In solution, MBP is “intrinsically unstructured” (or “natively unfolded”) (9Hill C.M. Bates I.R. White G.F. Hallett F.R. Harauz G. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon binding to detergents or lipids, the levels of β-sheet and especially α-helical structure increase dramatically (10Keniry M.A. Smith R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Presently the tertiary structure of MBP is unknown, with the most detailed predictions coming from Martenson (12Martenson R.E. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1612-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Stoner (13Stoner G.L. J. Neurochem. 1984; 43: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in the mid-1980s. In these models, as well as in a newer model based upon further research on an electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction, residues 86-92 are found in a β-sheet (14Beniac D.R. Luckevich M.D. Czarnota G.J. Tompkins T.A. Ridsdale R.A. Ottensmeyer F.P. Moscarello M.A. Harauz G. J. Biol.

Using [1H]NMR and circular dichroic spectropolarimetry of various MBP peptides with detergent micelles, Mendz et al. (16Mendz G.L. Brown L.R. Martenson R.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2304-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested that there were discrete interaction sites in the protein, one of which could be a helix between residues 87 and 97. Based on the arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, Warren et al. (6Warren K.G. Catz I. Steinman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11061-11065Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) predicted that this epitope of MBP was an amphipathic α-helix located at the interface between the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm and the membrane. In a solution circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study, MBP peptides from this region were found to have both α-helix and β-sheet structures in methanol, with the latter increasing in amount in progressively shorter peptides (17Whitaker J.N. Moscarello M.A. Herman P.K. Epand R.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of peptides 85-99 and 86-105 bound to class II MHC proteins have been found to be extended (18Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Gauthier L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Exp.

Commun. 1976; 71: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously used site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (20Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 21Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) to compare the membrane interactions of normal murine MBP (mMBP) with that of a less cationic form that predominates in MS (22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In that study, H85R1 was found to be motionally restricted, yet situated more than 3 Å above the lipid phosphate groups. Hydrophobicity calculations and helical wheel analysis indicated that the segment surrounding this site could potentially form a surface-seeking amphipathic α-helix. The purpose of this current study was to define more precisely the secondary structure found at this immunodominant epitope when bound to a myelin-like lipid membrane. The previously characterized recombinant murine MBP was used, which has 100% sequence identity with human MBP in this region. The human segment P85-V86-V87-H88-F89-F90-K91-N92-I93-V94-T95-P96 corresponds to murine segment P82-V83-V84-H85-F86-F87-K88-N89-I90-V91-T92-P93 (we shall henceforth refer primarily to the murine sequence numbering). The results obtained here using SDSL/EPR, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations and CD spectroscopy, identify the segment mMBP (83-92) as a semi-stable amphipathic α-helix in solution, which is then stabilized when the protein binds to a membrane, with side chains penetrating up to 12 Å into the bilayer. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification— The preparation of the Cys-containing mutants was done as described previously (22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange® protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant murine MBP expression and purification were carried out as described (11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Spin labeling was done while the protein was bound to the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column by first loading the protein in wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), cleaning the column with wash buffer lacking dithiothreitol, and then incubating the resin with 20 times molar excess of spin label overnight. The MTS-SL specifically modifies the introduced cysteinyl residues by disulfide exchange, giving rise to the nitroxide side chain designated R1 (Fig. 1). The protein was then eluted and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10 mm NaCl. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—Aliquots of the chloroform solutions of various lipids were combined in the following molar ratios to form large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with a lipid composition similar to that estimated for the cytoplasmic face of the myelin membrane (Cyt-LUVs): 44 mol % cholesterol, 27 mol % PE, 13 mol % phosphatidylserine, 11 mol % PC, 3 mol % sphingomyelin, and 2 mol % PI (22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight, and then hydrated in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10 mm NaCl. The lipid suspension was then passed through a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane 17 times using a syringe extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). EPR Spectroscopy—For signal-averaged EPR spectroscopy, spin-labeled MBP solutions were measured in the presence of 26% sucrose, or 26% sucrose containing 30% trifluoroethanol (TFE), or added to LUVs at a molar protein:lipid ratio of 1:600. This value is slightly less than the MBP:lipid ratio in myelin. For samples in solution, borosilicate glass 50-μl capillary tubes (Fisher) were used to hold the samples. The samples were positioned in the center of the EPR cavity of a Bruker ECS 106 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Milton, ON, Canada), and spectra were recorded at room temperature at a microwave power of 10.0 mW and a modulation amplitude of 1.0 Gauss. An empirical motion parameter τo was determined from the first derivatives of the absorption spectra using the following equationτo=K·ΔH[(h0h-1)1/2-1](Eq. 1) where K = 6.5 × 10-10 s, ΔH is the width of the center-line, and h0 and h-1 are the heights of the center and high-field lines, respectively (Fig. 1c; Ref. 22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When MBP was added to LUVs, aggregation of the vesicles occurred immediately, and after 10 min, the preparations were spun at 1000 × g to loosely pellet the MBP-LUV aggregates. The supernatant was removed, and 5 μl of the pellet was loaded into a gas-permeable methylpentene polymer (TPX) capillary. Changes in the mobility of the probe were quantified using the width of the center-line (ΔH); a greater ΔH value represented a decreased mobility of the spin label (23Rauch M.E. Ferguson C.G.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Accessibility of the spin-labeled side chains to NiEDDA and O2 was determined by continuous wave-power saturation as described previously (22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using a Varian E102 Century Series spectrometer (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI). The P1/2 values were determined from saturation curves (21Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The ΔP1/2 values were obtained in the presence of either 20 mm NiEDDA or air (20% O2), and the depth parameter (Φ) was determined from the natural logarithm of the ΔP1/2 ratio of O2 to NiEDDA (21Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The normalized accessibility parameter, Φ, was calculated from ΔP1/2 as described previously (20Farahbakhsh Z.T. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 56: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The dependence of Φ on distances from the membrane surface was determined using head-group-labeled 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(TEMPO)choline and various PCs with doxyl nitroxides along the acyl chain at positions 5, 7, 10, and 12. The following hyperbolic tangent function of Frazier et al. (25Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used to generate the standard curve for calculating the MBP spin-label depthsϕ=Atanh[B(x-C)]+D(Eq. 2) where x is the distance from the nitrogen of the nitroxide label to the lipid phosphate, A and D define the bulk values of Φ in water and hydrocarbon, and B and C describe the slope of the curve and the inflection point, respectively. This equation was then used to solve for the distance (x) using the experimentally derived values of Φ. Molecular Dynamics—The molecular dynamics simulation of the segment VVHFFK+NIVT was performed using AMBER version 6.0 and the all-atom force field (26Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2689) Google Scholar) in a pre-equilibrated water cube with 1300 water molecules and one Cl- counterion. The system was equilibrated as described previously (27Bates I.R. Harauz G. J. Mol. Model. 2003; 9: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and a production run of 50 ns was done using a 2-fs time-step. The simulations were run on two SGI Origin 2000 servers (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA) with a total of four processors using the MPI implementation of the SANDER module in AMBER. Circular Dichroism—CD was performed on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (11Bates I.R. Matharu P. Ishiyama N. Rochon D. Wood D.D. Polverini E. Moscarello M.A. Viner N.J. Harauz G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein concentration used was ∼0.1 mg/ml in a sample volume of 0.3 ml, in a quartz cuvette with a path-length of 0.1 cm. The measurements were done in the presence of 26% sucrose, or 26% sucrose and 30% TFE to emulate the conditions used for EPR. Measurements were taken over the wavelength range of 260-200 nm. Going further into the far-UV region was not possible, because of the interference of sucrose between 190-200 nm. mMBP (83-92) Is an Amphipathic α-Helix—Ten consecutive spin-labeled mMBP mutants (V83C, V84C, H85C, F86C, F87C, K88C, N89C, I90C, V91C, T92C) were generated (Fig. 1, a and b). Solution EPR spectra resulted in sharp hyperfine lines, indicating that this region was largely unstructured in aqueous solution (Fig. 1c). When the spin-labeled MBPs were incubated with Cyt-LUVs, which was used to mimic the lipid composition of the myelin sheath, there was almost immediate aggregation of the vesicles, and the spectra became broader and more asymmetric, indicating more restricted anisotropic motion of the spin label (compare Fig. 1, c and d). The aggregation state induced by MBP is a good paradigm for the in vivo situation, because the addition of MBP to lipid vesicles can reform the lipid into stable multilamellar structures similar to the myelin sheath (3Boggs J.M. Moscarello M. Papahadjopoulos D. Jost P. Griffith O. Lipid-Protein Interactions. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 1-51Google Scholar, 28Riccio P. Fasano A. Borenshtein N. Bleve-Zacheo T. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon incubation with Cyt-LUVs (Fig. 2a), the increase of the central line width (ΔH) can be used as a measure of the tumbling rate of the nitroxide. The plot of 1/ΔH as a function of residue number reveals a periodic variation in motion (Fig. 2b). Continuous wave-power saturation EPR spectroscopy was used to determine the accessibility of these 10 residues when bound to the vesicles. The water-soluble paramagnetic reagent nickel-ethylenediaminediacetic acid (NiEDDA) was used to probe the solvent accessibility (ΦNiEDDA), and nonpolar molecular oxygen was used to determine the insertion of the nitroxide into the hydrophobic environment of the bilayer (ΦO2) (Table I).Table ICollision and depth parameters for putative amphipathic α-helix MBP(83-92)Spin-labeled sampleΠ (air)aThe average standard error associated with Π was estimated from replicate experimentsΠ (NiEDDA)aThe average standard error associated with Π was estimated from replicate experimentsΠDistancebThe distances were determined using the fit to Equation 2 using the spin label standards (Fig. 3a)ÅV83R10.22 ± 0.020.41 ± 0.05-0.60 ± 0.117.74 ± 0.69V84R10.25 ± 0.020.42 ± 0.05-0.51 ± 0.108.03 ± 0.59H85R10.17 ± 0.021.19 ± 0.05-1.92 ± 0.09-2.19 ± 1.70F86R10.24 ± 0.021.23 ± 0.05-1.65 ± 0.082.28 ± 1.50F87R10.29 ± 0.020.23 ± 0.040.23 ± 0.1510.0 ± 0.72K88R10.19 ± 0.020.61 ± 0.04-1.17 ± 0.095.52 ± 0.91N89R10.17 ± 0.020.70 ± 0.05-1.42 ± 0.094.12 ± 1.20I90R10.22 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.05-0.89 ± 0.086.72 ± 0.60V91R10.31 ± 0.020.20 ± 0.040.44 ± 0.1610.5 ± 0.73T92R10.17 ± 0.020.84 ± 0.05-1.57 ± 0.093.02 ± 1.50a The average standard error associated with Π was estimated from replicate experimentsb The distances were determined using the fit to Equation 2 using the spin label standards (Fig. 3a) Open table in a new tab The plot of ΦNiEDDA and ΦO2 as a function of residue number indicated that as the accessibility to NiEDDA increased, the accessibility to O2 decreased, and vice versa (Fig. 2c). Moreover, this pattern occurred in a periodic manner indicative of regular secondary structure. The accessibility parameter, Φ, was determined from the natural logarithm of the ratio of ΦO2 to ΦNiEDDA. A standard curve of known immersion depths was generated using various spin-labeled lipids. The calibration of the Φ value with the depth of penetration was especially important for the Cyt-LUVs, because they consisted of six different lipid components, including 40% cholesterol. The effect of the cholesterol was to increase the penetration of NiEDDA up to the fifth carbon of the acyl group of the phospholipid, as reported previously (22Bates I.R. Boggs J.M. Feix J.B. Harauz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29041-29047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The hyperbolic tangent function (Eq. 2) of Frazier et al. (25Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used to fit the data and calculate the depth of penetration of the residues into the membrane (Fig. 3, a and b). The immersion depths for the segment mMBP (83-92) showed a periodic oscillation indicative of an α-helix. The data were fitted to a sine function with a periodicity of 3.6 residues, representing the geometry of a model α-helix. Because the residues penetrated deeper into the membrane toward the C terminus, indicating that the helix was tilted, an extra variable was added to the sine function to take into account the angle of the tilt (29Macosko J.C. Kim C.H. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9264-9268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The experimentally determined depths fit well to the modified sine function (Fig. 3b). The putative helix had an amplitude (diameter) of 12-13 Å, which is consistent with the diameter of an α-helix bearing a nitroxide arm (29Macosko J.C. Kim C.H. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and it was tilted in the bilayer at an angle of ∼9° with respect to the membrane plane. Molecular Dynamics of Val83-Thr92—Using the structure of the human MBP peptide that was co-crystallized with the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen HLA-DR2 as a starting conformation (Protein Data Bank ID code 1bx2), a molecular dynamics simulation was done in water with an added chlorine counterion to neutralize the single lysyl residue. The simulation employed an empirical force field to describe the energy of the system as a sophisticated sum of bond, angle, torsion, van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies. The classical Newtonian equations of motion were integrated at specific time steps to give the time evolution of the system, which, in this study, went to 50 ns. The original peptide was in an extended conformation; however, a series of snap-shots of the structure at 10-ns intervals showed the variability of the structure and its tendency to form an α-helix (Fig. 4a). At 30 ns, the entire peptide formed a conventional α-helix, but 10 ns later, the amount of random coil had increased, and at 50 ns, the entire regular structure had dissipated. After only the first few ps of the simulation, there was an immediate increase in the root mean square difference from the initial structure (Fig. 4b). After reaching 4 Å, the root mean square difference varied between 3 and 6 Å for the rest of the simulation. The radius of gyration (Rg) also fluctuated steadily between 8 and 6 Å, representing more extended and more compacted states, respectively (Fig. 4b). In summary, these simulations indicate that the segment mMBP (83-92) has a propensity to form an α-helix in aqueous solution but that this structure is transient in the absence of any stabilizing factors. Comparison with Crystal Structure of this MBP Epitope Complexed with HLA-DR2—The crystal structures for soluble DRB1*1501-hMBP (85-99) (18Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Gauthier L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and DRB5*0101-hMBP (86-105) (31Li Y. Li H. Martin R. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) complexes have been reported. Both peptides are extended, linear fragments, with little evidence of ordered secondary structure. To see whether it might be possible for the extended structure from the DRB1*1501-hMBP (85-99) complex to fit the accessibility data obtained for this region of MBP bound to lipid, the extended structure was compared with the helical peptide structure obtained after 30 ns of molecular dynamics (Fig. 3, c and d). Both peptides were tilted at an angle of 9° to determine which one fit the depth measurements from SDSL-EPR. The modeling was done so that the most accessible residue (His85) was exposed to the aqueous phase, whereas the most deeply penetrating residues (Val91 and Phe87) faced the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. This geometry fell readily into place for the α-helical peptide, because of the natural arrangement of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues on opposite sides. However, for the extended structure, His85 and Phe87 pointed in almost the same direction, making an orientation that accurately fit the data very difficult to determine. The closest match possible is shown in Fig. 3, c and d. The predicted accessibilities from the α-helix determined from molecular dynamics fit the experimental data almost perfectly, whereas the majority of the crystal fragment residues did not fit (Fig. 3b, blue circles). This result was not unexpected, because the MHC II molecule imposes on its targets a conformation dependent upon the structure of the MHC itself. Circular Dichroism and EPR of mMBP (83-92) with TFE— To evaluate experimentally the question of whether the putative α-helix was stable in solution, EPR was done in the presence of 26% sucrose to slow down the tumbling motion of MBPs and to aid in distinguishing the local mobility of the spin label from that of the peptide backbone (32Mchaourab H.S. Oh K.J. Fang C.J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The spectra of the spin-labeled mutants were significantly more asymmetric with sucrose present, and the asymmetry increased further in the presence of TFE (Fig. 5a). The empirical motion parameter (τo) indicated that mMBP (83-92) was more restricted in the presence of TFE, and thus that there was more ordered structure in this region (Fig. 5b). The periodicity of variations in the motion fit a sine function with a periodicity of 3.6 residues, which is consistent with an α-helical structure. Mchaourab et al. (24Mchaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7692-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) observed a similar periodic oscillation for an α-helical segment of lysozyme. They showed that the motion of R1 on a helix surface was restricted relative to that on accessible loops, because of hindrance of rotational motion of the spin label moiety about the disulfide bond and the Cα-Cβ bond of cysteine. This effect was due to interaction of the cysteine β carbon with the backbone of the preceding turn and by interaction of the disulfide moiety with the protein backbone. They also showed that the motion of the spin label reflected the protein backbone motion, not steric interference by other helix residue side chains. Here, the motions of all spin-labeled residues of the mMBP (83-92) segment in sucrose and TFE/sucrose were significantly greater than those for lysozyme (of comparable molecular mass) in sucrose. This comparison indicates a greater backbone motion for MBP because of its lack of tertiary structure in solution, in contrast to lysozyme with a globular tertiary structure, which significantly reduces thermal fluctuations of the backbone in most regions. The overall effect of TFE on MBP structure was also investigated using CD. All 10 spin-labeled proteins used in this study were observed to behave the same, despite the amino acid substitutions. The samples in sucrose alone all had a spectrum characteristic of an unstructured protein (Fig. 5c). In the presence of TFE, the proportion of α-helical structure increased dramatically, as evidenced by the troughs in the spectra at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 5d) (33Liebes L.F. Zand R. Phillips W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 405: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In summary, the explanation for both the EPR and CD observations is that TFE provides a low dielectric environment that favors the formation of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds, thus stabilizing the α-helix formed by mMBP (83-92) (34Roccatano D. Colombo G. Fioroni M. Mark A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12179-12184Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Hemi-fusion Paradigm for Membrane Adhesion—The EPR, molecular dynamics, and CD results all complement one another and show that the conformation of segment mMBP (83-92) is highly dependent upon its environment. The absence of stable structure in aqueous solution was simulated computationally and borne out experimentally by EPR and CD spectroscopy. In comparison, SDSL analysis showed that when MBP was bound to the lipid bilayer, the helical structure in this region was stabilized. How MBP brings together multiple vesicles in vitro (and in vivo in the myelin sheath) is an important biological question. The epitope helix found here is undoubtedly one of many of MBP that are involved in the adhesion of lipid bilayers in myelin. Previous studies have shown that MBP causes the hemi-fusion of membranes and does not allow mixing of the vesicle compartments (35Cajal Y. Boggs J.M. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2566-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, the α-helical epitope from mMBP (83-92) is tilted with respect to the membrane plane, similar to that seen for other fusion proteins (36Brasseur R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16120-16127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tilt is a result of the larger hydrophobic potential profile around the C-terminal end of the helix. In this case, the tilt is only 9°, as compared with the hemagglutinin fusion peptide, which is tilted 25° (29Macosko J.C. Kim C.H. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus the degree of tilt for MBP is sufficient for deep penetration and firm membrane adhesion, but is not large enough to destabilize the bilayer. We have shown that deletion mutants of both the N and C termini of MBP still had the ability to aggregate vesicles, although at lower efficiency (37Hill C.M. Haines J.D. Antler C.E. Bates I.R. Libich D.S. Harauz G. Micron. 2003; 34: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both deletion mutants contained the 83-92 segment studied here, indicating that it may be an essential component in the MBP-mediated adhesion of bilayers. The observation that K88R1 is the deepest penetrating polar residue in this study (5.5 Å into the bilayer) suggests that it could be involved in snorkeling, whereby the long side chain would be bent to place the charged amino group in the more polar interface region, while keeping the hydrocarbon part of the side chain inside the hydrophobic part of the membrane (38Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7185-7191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The orientation of K88R1 as shown in Fig. 3e indicates that the positive side chain could be positioned for electrostatic interaction with the phosphate group of the phospholipid, which could contribute to tighter binding of the protein to the membrane. In summary, the structure of MBP is still unknown despite numerous attempts using a variety of techniques and methodologies (9Hill C.M. Bates I.R. White G.F. Hallett F.R. Harauz G. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 139: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here, the SDSL-EPR technique was used to resolve the structure of an immunodominant epitope of MBP (murine segment 83-92 corresponding to the human segment 86-95) in a natural environment, showing it to be an amphipathic α-helix with a tilted arrangement similar to that of a fusion peptide. The topology of MBP bound to the membrane shows that key contact points for antibody recognition, F86-F87-K88 (F89-F90-K91 in the human), are buried in the lipid bilayer and thus would be relatively sequestered from other proteins. Antibody binding to membrane-bound MBP would occur only if this region transiently dissociates from the membrane. We are grateful to Godha Rangaraj for assistance with the EPR measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2093210578,"Communication between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)- and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling systems has received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we report that activation of G protein-coupled bradykinin B2 receptor induces an up-regulation of cellular responses mediated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and provide essential mechanistic characteristics of this sensitization process. EGF, which failed to evoke detectable amount of calcium increase and neurotransmitter release when administrated alone in primary cultures of rat adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells, became capable of inducing these responses specifically after bradykinin pretreatment. Both EGFR and non-receptor tyrosine kinase p60Src, whose kinase activities were required in the sensitization, were found to be enriched in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Bradykinin caused activation of p60Src and Src-dependent phosphorylation of the EGFR on Tyr-845 in lipid rafts, as well as recruitment of phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 to the rafts. Depletion of cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin disrupted the raft localization of EGFR and Src, as well as bradykinin-induced translocation of PLCγ1. Furthermore, sensitization, which was impaired by cholesterol depletion, was restored by repletion of cholesterol. Therefore, we suggest that lipid rafts are essential participants in the regulation of receptor-mediated signal transduction and cross-talk via organizing signaling complexes in membrane microdomains.

Calcium plays an important role in regulating a great variety of neuronal processes, including excitability, associativity, gene transcription, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter release (1Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Differences in spatial, temporal, as well as quantitative aspects of calcium signals allow selective targeting of the Ca2+ signal from specific stimuli to appropriate responses. Growing evidence suggests that specificity and sensitivity of the Ca2+ signal is determined by organizing signaling molecules into microdomains in which Ca2+ signaling functions are carried out, providing a new concept in neuronal calcium signaling (2Delmas P. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 36: 787-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Johenning F.W. Ehrlich B.E.

Localized environments are, therefore, richly endowed with the versatility needed to allow Ca2+ increase to effectively couple specific receptors to effector molecules (5Taylor C.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 767-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).The plasma membrane contains lipid rafts, which are structurally and biochemically isolated cellular compartments implicated in the organization of specialized proteins into a series of discrete microdomains (6Galbiati F.

G proteins, and effector enzymes have been reported to present in or recruit to lipid rafts following activation. The functional significance of this localization has not been unequivocally demonstrated, but it seems to facilitate the association of appropriate signaling proteins (7Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 8Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5106) Google Scholar). In neuronal cells, compelling evidence is emerging implicating that lipid rafts act as platforms for localized signal transduction and that rafts are important for neural development and function, which include axon guidance and vesicular trafficking (9Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Encinas M. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 412-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).Epidermal growth factor (EGF) itself has been found unable to induce detectable amount of increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in various cell types (10Olsen R. Santone K. Melder D. Oakes S.G. Abraham R. Powis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18030-18035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Pandiella A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3122-3130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGF becomes capable of inducing a substantial amount of increase in [Ca2+]i after bradykinin (BK) pretreatment in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (10Olsen R. Santone K. Melder D. Oakes S.G. Abraham R. Powis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18030-18035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells, and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells (11Pandiella A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3122-3130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, the mechanism underlying this “sensitization” of the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase has remained undetermined. In the present study, we report that EGF-induced neurotransmitter release as well as calcium mobilization is greatly sensitized specifically by BK in neuroendocrine cells. We postulate that the assemblage of signaling components into discrete microdomains may permit specific receptor cross-talk and render precise modulation of the downstream signaling events. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the possible role of lipid rafts in the communication between the G protein-coupled BK receptor- and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling pathways. To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration of providing evidence that BK induces Src-dependent phosphorylation of the EGFR as well as activation of p60Src in lipid rafts, and recruitment of phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 to the rafts. We suggest that BK-induced sensitization of the EGF pathway requires the integrity of lipid raft structures, thereby providing a novel insight into how signal transduction pathways that employ distinct receptors and effectors influence each other.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).

Calcium imaging experiments were performed with a monochromator-based spectrophotofluorimetric system (DeltaScan Illumination System, PTI, South Brunswick, NJ). Cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were loaded with 4 μm fura-2/AM in serum-free growth medium (37 °C, 30 min).

Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via Student's t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant.RESULTSSensitization of EGF-induced Intracellular Calcium Increase ([Ca2+]i) by BK—EGF itself failed to cause any changes in the resting [Ca2+]i when administrated alone, but a substantial amount of [Ca2+]i increase was evoked by EGF after bradykinin pretreatment in both primary cultures of rat adrenal chromaffin cells and PC12 cells (Fig. 1). This “sensitization” of the EGF-induced calcium rise was highly specific to BK pretreatment, which could not be mimicked by UTP, an agonist of G protein-coupled P2Y2 purinoceptors, or other calcium-elevating agents such as high K+ and ionomycin (Fig. 2A). Sensitization of the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase occurred in a BK concentration-dependent manner (EC50, 4.9 ± 0.6 nm) and was completely blocked by HOE140, an antagonist of bradykinin B2 receptor (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the sensitization was specific to the activation of B2 receptor. The magnitude of the EGF-induced Ca2+ rise depended on EGF concentration with an EC50 value of 80.3 ± 17.1 pm (Fig. 2B). EGF concentration also affected the kinetics of the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i rise (Fig. 2D). Cells treated with higher concentrations of EGF required shorter time to reach the peak height compared with those treated with lower concentrations. BK induced a long lasting sensitization, which showed its maximal effect after 10 min of BK pretreatment and lasted up to 1 h (Fig. 2E).Fig. 2Sensitization of the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Fura-2/AM-loaded PC12 cells (1 × 106) were stimulated as indicated.

Shown are representative traces from four independent experiments. B, sensitization depends on EGF concentration. Various concentrations of EGF were treated either alone (▴) or after BK treatment (1 μm, 5 min) (•). C, sensitization is dependent on B2 receptor activation. 20 nm EGF was treated after treatment with various concentrations of BK (•). Cells were exposed to HOE140 (3 μm) 3 min prior to BK stimulation (▴). D, EGF concentration affects kinetics of EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Various concentrations of EGF were applied after BK (1 μm, 5 min) treatment. Time to reach the peak value of EGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise was measured. E, time course of the sensitization. 1 μm BK was applied for the indicated time periods, followed by 20 nm EGF. B, C, and E, peak heights of the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase were measured, and net increases in [Ca2+]i were calculated. Data presented in B-E are means ± S.E. values from at least three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EGF-evoked elevation of [Ca2+]i after BK treatment could be the result of either Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores or Ca2+ influx from extracellular space. EGF-induced [Ca2+]i rise was completely blocked when cells were exposed to thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases, but was not significantly affected when extracellular Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i rise sensitized by BK is mainly Ca2+ release.Fig. 3PLC-dependent Ca2+release is induced by EGF after BK treatment. Fura-2/AM-loaded PC12 cells (1 × 106) were stimulated as indicated. A, [Ca2+]i rise evoked by EGF is from intracellular stores. 1 μm BK was treated followed by treatment with vehicle (a) or 1 mm EGTA (b and c) where indicated (▵), and then finally 20 nm EGF (a and b) or 70 mm KCl (c) was applied. [Ca2+]i was not elevated by KCl, confirming that extracellular Ca2+ was chelated under these conditions. Typical Ca2+ traces from four separate experiments are presented. B, using a similar experimental paradigm as A, cells were exposed to 1 mm EGTA, 1 μm thapsigargin, or vehicle after 1 μm BK treatment, and then stimulated with 20 nm EGF. C, sensitization is dependent on PLC. 3 μm U73343 (a) or U73122 (b) was applied where indicated (▵) after 1 μm BK treatment, then finally 20 nm EGF was treated. D, quantification of results from C. Quantification of data for B and D was achieved by expressing net [Ca2+]i increase in the peak value of the EGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise as a percentage of control. Data presented are means ± S.E. values from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined the involvement of PLC in the sensitization. As shown in Fig. 3 (C and D), sensitization was completely blocked by U73122, a selective inhibitor of PLC, whereas its inactive analog U73343 had no effect. Therefore, EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase sensitized by BK was interpreted to reflect PLC-dependent Ca2+ release.Involvement of EGFR in the Sensitization—To investigate the involvement of EGFR, we firstly tested the effect of tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR kinase, on the sensitization. EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase sensitized by BK was completely abolished by AG1478 (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the sensitization required EGFR kinase activity. We next monitored the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. As shown in Fig. 4B, BK caused transactivation of the EGFR as previously reported (26Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When EGF was treated 10 min after BK pretreatment, the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was synergistically enhanced compared with that stimulated with either BK or EGF alone (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation and activation of the EGFR was critically involved in the sensitization.Fig. 4Involvement of EGFR in the sensitization.A, tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR is required. Fura-2/AM-loaded PC12 cells (1 × 106) were treated with 1 μm BK, followed by vehicle (a) or 500 nm AG1478 (b), where indicated (▵), and finally stimulated with 20 nm EGF (▴). Typical Ca2+ traces from three separate experiments are presented. B, EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation is potentiated by BK. PC12 cells were treated as indicated. NT, untreated; BK 2′, 1 μm, 2 min; BK 10′, 1 μm, 10 min; BK/EGF, 1 μm BK (10 min) followed by 200 pm EGF (2 min); EGF, 200 pm, 2 min. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR Ab. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFRs were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (PTYR). The amounts of the precipitated EGFRs were monitored by reprobing the same blot with anti-EGFR Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Src Kinase in the BK-induced Sensitization of EGF Responses—Src family kinases have been proposed to participate in the communication between GPCRs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as important mediators (27Luttrell L.M.

Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In addition, p60Src has been shown to be activated by BK (29Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). We thus, examined the effect of PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src kinase, on the sensitization. As shown in Fig. 5A, PP2 completely abolished the sensitization of EGF-induced [Ca2+]i rise. In addition, the sensitization of EGF-induced Ca2+ rise was inhibited by transient transfection of PC12 cells with the kinase-defective mutant of p60Src (SrcKM) (Supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that p60Src is critically involved. We also confirmed the requirement of Src kinase activation in the sensitization of EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase in primary cultures of rat adrenal chromaffin cells (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5Involvement of Src kinase in the sensitization.A, PP2 abolishes the sensitization. Fura-2/AM-loaded PC12 cells (1 × 106) were treated with vehicle (a) or 10 μm PP2 (b) where indicated (▵) followed by 1 μm BK, and finally stimulated with 20 nm EGF. Typical Ca2+ traces from five separate experiments are presented.

Anti-microbial peptides are widely distributed among organisms and exert their activity by permeabilizing the cell membranes of harmful invaders, such as bacteria. Insect defensins are categorized into a family of anti-microbial peptides, which play an essential role in the insect defense system. The insect defensins are composed of 36-51 amino acid residues. The sequence similarities among the insect defensins range from 58 to 95% (1Bulet P. Hetru C. Dimarcq J.L. Hoffmann D. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). All of the insect defensins have six conserved cysteine residues involved in three disulfide bridges. When the six cysteine residues are labeled as I-VI, in order from the N to C terminus, the insect defensins share the disulfide connectives of I- IV, II-V, and III-VI. As for the antibacterial selectivity, the insect defensins kill a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, but few Gram-negative bacteria and fungi are sensitive to the peptides (2Lambert J. Keppi E. Dimarcq J.L. Wicker C. Reichhart J.M. Dunbar B. Lepage P. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J. Fothergill J. Hoffmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11333-11337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A patch clamp experiment applied to the Phormia terranovae defensin A suggested that it forms oligomeric channels in the bacterial membrane (6Cociancich S. Ghazi A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19239-19245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K+ leakage from the forming channel supposedly leads to ATP depletion and respiration inhibition for the bacteria. However, little is known about the structural mechanism of the membrane permeabilization by the defensins. Sapecin is an insect defensin purified from the culture medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) (7Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17112-17116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sapecin consists of 40 amino acid residues, including three disulfide bonds, which are essential for the antibacterial activity (8Kuzuhara T. Nakajima Y. Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The solution structure of sapecin was solved in methanol by NMR techniques (PDB code 1L4V) (9Hanzawa H. Shimada I. Kuzuhara T. Komano H. Kohda D. Inagaki F. Natori S. Arata Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The structure revealed that the peptide consists of an N-terminal loop (residues 4-12), an α helix (residues 15-23), and a two-stranded β sheet (residues 24-31 and 34-40), with three disulfide bridges connecting these structural elements. Sapecin can inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) at micromolar concentrations (3Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, shows high affinity for an acidic phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL) 1The abbreviations used are: CLcardiolipinTCStransferred cross-saturationH-D exchangehydrogen-deuterium exchangeSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherencePCphosphatidylcholineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMLVmultilamellar vesicle.

Thus, CL is considered as the main target molecule of the peptide on the bacterial membrane. cardiolipin transferred cross-saturation hydrogen-deuterium exchange surface plasmon resonance heteronuclear single quantum coherence phosphatidylcholine high performance liquid chromatography multilamellar vesicle. In the present paper, we investigated the interaction between the membrane and sapecin and permeabilization modes of sapecin. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses revealed the interaction properties of sapecin to the membrane. The dose dependence of the membrane permeabilization suggested that sapecin assumes an oligomeric form in the membrane, leading to the membrane permeabilization. The surface buried in the membrane and oligomerization surface on sapecin was successfully identified by solution NMR techniques along with site-specific amino acid substitutions. Based upon these results, we propose a channel-forming mechanism of sapecin for membrane permeabilization. Expression and Purification of Sapecin—Sapecin was expressed in Escherichia coli by using a ubiquitin fusion protein system as described elsewhere (10Kohno T. Kusunoki H. Sato K. Wakamatsu K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this system sapecin is fused with the C terminus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubiquitin, containing a decahistidine tag at its N terminus. The gene encoding sapecin as the ubiquitin fusion protein was subcloned into pET24d using the NcoI and SalI restriction sites. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transduced with the expression construct and grown in either LB media or M9 minimal media enriched with the desired stable isotopes for later NMR experiments. The expressed ubiquitin-sapecin fusion protein was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography, cleaved by recombinant yeast ubiquitin hydrolase), and separated by reverse phase HPLC. The amino acid sequence of sapecin (H2N-ATCDLLSGTGINHSACAAHCLLRGNRGGYCNGKAVCVCRN-COOH) was confirmed by an amino acid analysis and a time-of-flight mass spectroscopy measurement. Because all of the Cys residues in sapecin were fully reduced after the purification, the sapecin was oxidized into the native folding in 50 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.8, for 24 h at room temperature (11Kim J.I. Iwai H. Kurata S. Takahashi M. Masuda K. Shimada I. Natori S. Arata Y. Sato K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The refolded native sapecin was re-purified by the reverse phase HPLC to remove the incorrectly folded products. The proper folding of sapecin was confirmed by the anti-bacterial activity with S. aureus and the comparison of the 1H chemical shifts between the recombinant sapecin and sapecin derived from flesh fly (9Hanzawa H. Shimada I. Kuzuhara T. Komano H. Kohda D. Inagaki F. Natori S. Arata Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were designed and introduced by PCR with the corresponding synthetic primers. Preparation of Vesicles—Phospholipids were dried from a CHCl3 solution under a N2 stream, and the residual solvent was completely removed under high vacuum for several hours. The dried lipid film was re-hydrated in a buffer suitable for each experiment by vortexing. The resultant vesicles were multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). To prepare small unilamellar vesicles, the MLV solution was tip-sonicated on ice. Analysis of Interaction Using SPR—The interaction of sapecin with the phospholipid membrane was analyzed by SPR using a BIACORE 1000 equipped with an HPA sensor tip. The running buffer for the determination of the affinity contained 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl except for the experiments to analyze the salt concentration dependence on the affinity. In those experiments the NaCl concentration was varied. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Immediately after the sensor tips were washed with 40 mm octyl glucoside in water for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, the small unilamellar vesicle at a concentration of 2 mm with respect to the phospholipids in the running buffer was injected for 40 min at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. At this stage the HPA surface carries multiple phospholipid layers and/or fused liposomes. To remove these lipid products, a short 15-s pulse of 10 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min was applied several times until a stable base line was obtained. A solution of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in running buffer was used to assess the extent of the surface coverage by phospholipids. Only the sensor tips with less than 100 resonance units of bovine serum albumin were used for further experiments. Sapecin solubilized in running buffer was passed over the phospholipid-immobilized cell for 150 s at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The running buffer was then replaced with sapecin solution to measure the dissociation rate constant of sapecin to the phospholipid layers. After each experiment 10 mm HCl and 10 mm NaOH were sequentially injected for 60 s, each at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, to regenerate the surface. The obtained data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation 2.1 software. For the slow dissociation rate interactions, the association and dissociation rate constants (ka and kdis) and the equilibrium association constants (KA) were determined by fitting them to the resonance curves for each set of concentrations, assuming a 1:1 (Langmuir) interaction. For the fast dissociation rate interaction (kdis > 0.1 s) only the KA were determined by using the sapecin concentration dependence of the equilibrium resonance units. Glucose Leakage Experiments—Glucose-entrapping MLVs were prepared by the previously described method (3Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Dried CL (2 μmol) lipid was dispersed by adding 0.1 ml of a 0.3 m glucose solution to obtain the MLVs containing glucose, and then 1 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 130 mm NaCl (buffer A) was added. The resultant MLVs were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The vesicles were washed twice with the same buffer to remove the untrapped glucose and, finally, were resuspended in 200 μl of the buffer. To test the membrane permeabilization activity of sapecin various concentrations of sapecin dissolved in 10 μl of buffer A were added to 10 μl of the glucose-entrapping MLVs. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and then the amount of glucose released from the liposomes was measured by the glucose oxidase method using a Glucose B-test kit (Wako Chemical). The amount of glucose corresponding to 100% release was determined by adding 10% Triton X-100 instead of sapecin. To assess the existence of cooperativity we assumed the following simplest scheme.nr1↔rn(pore)→leakage(Eq. 1) rn=Knr1n(Eq. 2) Here, r1 and rn are the densities of the monomeric peptides and n-meric peptides (pores), respectively. Kn denotes the oligomerization coefficient. The glucose leakage rate is thought to be proportional to the density of n-meric peptide, rn, and to the concentration of glucose in the liposome. Therefore, we can derive a differential equation for the glucose leakage as Equation 3.-dG(t)/dt=αG(t)rn(Eq. 3) Here, G(t) is the amount of glucose in the liposome at time t, and α is the leakage rate constant. The total amount of leaked glucose (L) after a fixed time (T) becomesL=G(0)(1-exp(αrnT))(Eq. 4) From Equations 1 and 4 we can obtain the normalized leakage L (%).L(&percnt;)=100×(1-exp(αTKnr1n))(Eq. 5) r1=rn-radd(Eq. 6) L (%) is linear through the origin when n = 1 and becomes sigmoidal when n > 1.The sapecin concentration dependence of the glucose leakage was fitted by these equations in Figs. 1C and 6A.Fig. 6Membrane permeabilization mechanism of sapecin.A, amount of glucose leakage from CL vesicles in the presence of the wild type sapecin (red closed circles) and the D4A and R23A doubly mutated sapecin (blue open squares) at 25 °C. The curves are least square fits by Equation 5. For the wild type sapecin the curve calculated with the condition of n = 2 (red solid line) is shown as a representative for the curves n > 1. For the doubly mutated sapecin, the curve calculated with the condition of n = 1 (blue dotted line) is shown. B, putative models of sapecin oligomer.

Biol. 2002; 318: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at pH 5.5 on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer. A 0.3 mm concentration of 2H,15N-labeled L5A/V35A mutant of sapecin and the MLVs at a concentration of 20 mm with respect to phosphatidylcholine (PC) were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 20% H2O, 80% D2O. Under these conditions the intensities of the signals from the free sapecin are reduced to about 70%, as compared with those without the vesicles. Therefore, about 30% of the sapecin molecules interacted with the vesicles. The salt concentration of the sample was set to 130 mm NaCl. The pulse scheme and the decoupling pulse used for the experiment were the same as described (12Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We selectively saturated the vesicles by irradiating resonances from the phospholipid alkyl chains, using the WURST-2 broadband decoupling scheme. The saturation frequency was set at 0.9 ppm, and the saturation times were set to 1.6 s. Because the saturation scheme was highly selective for the aliphatic proton region, the irradiation of the phospholipid vesicle-sapecin complex affects neither the intensities of the sapecin amide protons nor the water resonance. All spectra were processed with the program nmrPipe. Hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) Exchange Experiments—The lyophilized 15N-labeled sapecin was dissolved in 450 μl of small unilamellar vesicles containing 1 mm CL and 2 mm PC with respect to phospholipids and was dispersed in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 3.4, 99.8% D2O). The final concentration of sapecin was 0.13 mm. Under these conditions all of the sapecin molecules are complexed with the vesicles, because we could not detect any sapecin resonances in the NMR spectra. After an incubation at 20 °C for 0 (immediately after being dissolved within small unilamellar vesicles), 13, or 30 min, each sample was frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized to stop the H-D exchange. During the lyophilization the sample was kept at a temperature of -10 °C to eliminate further exchanges (15Dempsey C.E. Butler G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Halsall A. Dempsey C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The sample was then re-solubilized in 450 μl of ice-cold C2H3OH, with added HCl to reduce the pH value, to disrupt the lipid bilayer. The re-solubilized sample was immediately inserted into a pre-shimmed NMR probe, and a heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum was collected at 278 K. Control experiments were run in which the lyophilized 0.13 mm15N-labeled sapecin was dissolved in 450 μl of 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 3.4, containing 99.8% D2O. After an incubation at 20 °C for 0, 5, or 10 min, the H-D exchange was stopped by the same procedure, and the NMR experiment was carried out. All experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer. Membrane Interaction Properties of Sapecin—Sapecin is a basic molecule with a net cationic charge of +3 under physiological conditions. Therefore, like other basic antibacterial peptides, the electrostatic interactions between the acidic phospholipids and basic residues of the peptides are expected to be the driving force of membrane interaction followed by membrane permeabilization. To clarify the participation of the electrostatic interaction, we carried out kinetic analyses of the salt concentration dependence on the interaction between sapecin and the membrane formed with an acidic phospholipid, CL. Fig. 1A shows the effect of ionic strength on the affinity of sapecin to the CL membrane, as revealed by SPR experiments. As the ionic strength was increased from 88 to 323 mm by adding NaCl (65-300 mm), the affinity was significantly decreased from 3.0 ± 1.3 × 107 to 3.4 ± 0.6 × 105m-1. The lower association constant under the high ionic strength conditions was mainly caused by the reduction of the association rate; that is, a 28-fold decrease in the association rate and a 3.0-fold increase in the dissociation rate (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that the electrostatic interaction between the basic residues of sapecin and the phosphate groups of acidic phospholipids serves as the dominant factor in sapecin interaction to the acidic membrane. Channel-forming Membrane Permeabilization by Sapecin Oligomer—The membrane permeabilization activities of sapecin were analyzed by glucose leakage experiments, which use the outward leakage of glucose from glucose-entrapping liposomes as an indicator of membrane permeabilization (3Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We precisely analyzed the dose dependence of the glucose leakage caused by sapecin to identify the cooperativity of its membrane permeabilization. The amount of released glucose, which reflects the membrane permeabilization, increased in a sigmoidal manner (Fig. 1C). If the membrane permeabilization by sapecin were not a cooperative process, then the leakage curve would resemble the blue dotted line in Fig. 1C. The observed upper curvature of the glucose leakage at the sapecin concentration around 0.1 mm is strong evidence for the cooperative membrane permeabilization. The cooperativity in membrane permeabilization has also been described for other anti-bacterial peptides. These peptides are considered to form oligomeric pores in the membrane (17Schwarz G. Arbuzova A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokuda H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K.

Schwarz G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2336-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the oligomerization of sapecin is an essential step in its membrane permeabilization process. Determination of the Site Buried in the Membrane on Sapecin—To identify the site buried in the membrane (membrane-buried site), we performed TCS experiments (12Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 13Nishida N. Sumikawa H. Sakakura M. Shimba N. Takahashi H. Terasawa H. Suzuki E.I. Shimada I. Nat.

Biol. 2002; 318: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The TCS experiments were carried out under conditions with an excess amount of uniformly 2H- and 15N-labeled sapecin relative to the unlabeled phospholipid vesicle. In the TCS measurements the irradiation of the complex with a frequency corresponding to the proton resonances of the phospholipid alkyl chains exclusively affects the vesicle, since no aliphatic protons exist in the deuterated sapecin. The irradiation causes the effective saturation of all of the resonance from the phospholipid, due to spin diffusion. The saturation in the phospholipids is not limited within the vesicle but is transferred to the residues at the interface of sapecin through the cross-saturation phenomena. If the reversible exchange of the sapecin and phospholipid vesicle complex exhibits a dissociation rate approximately greater than 0.1 s-1, then the effect of the cross-saturation is sufficiently observed in the free state of sapecin (21Jayalakshmi V. Krishna N.R. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 155: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the wild type sapecin slowly dissociates from the membrane. The dissociation rate of sapecin from a membrane that is composed of neutral phospholipid, PC, was 1.6 × 10-3 s-1. Therefore, we could not successfully observe the transferred cross-saturation phenomena from the PC vesicles to the wild type sapecin. To achieve the fast dissociation in the interaction of sapecin with membrane we prepared sapecin mutants. Among the mutants, the replacements of Leu-5 and Val-35 with Ala in sapecin satisfactorily accelerated its dissociation rate from the PC membrane (kdiss > 0.1 s-1). Therefore, we utilized the double mutant of sapecin, L5A/V35A, for the subsequent TCS experiments. The membrane-buried residues on sapecin were identified by a comparison of the peak intensities of the amide groups of free sapecin on 1H,15N HSQC spectra with and without irradiation. Fig. 2A shows a 1H,15N HSQC spectrum observed for the L5A/V35A mutant of sapecin in the presence of the PC vesicles with the spectral assignments. The chemical shifts observed in the spectrum were completely identical to those from the free molecule, indicating that, under the present measurement conditions only the resonances from the free sapecin were observed in the HSQC spectra of the mixture of sapecin and PC vesicles. The irradiation applied to the NMR sample resulted in selective intensity losses for the free sapecin resonances (Fig. 2B). Based on the spectra with and without the irradiation we calculated the reduction ratios of the peak intensities, which are summarized in Fig. 3A. The residues in the helix region were obviously affected by the irradiation. These affected residues formed a contiguous surface on the sapecin structure (Fig. 3B, left). Therefore, we conclude that the membrane-buried site of sapecin to the phospholipid vesicle is composed of the following residues: Leu-5, Gly-8, Gly-10, Ile-11, Asn-12, and His-13 in the amino-terminal loop, Ala-15, Cys-16, Ala-17, Ala-18, Gly-20, Leu-21, and Leu-22 in the α helix, and Gly-27, Gly-28, and Tyr-29 in the first strand of the β sheet. Fig. 3C shows the distributions of the basic, acidic, and solvent-exposed-hydrophobic residues on the sapecin surface. Three of the four basic residues, none of the acidic residues, and most of the solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues are on the membrane-buried site of sapecin. Therefore, the surface determined by the TCS experiments is suitable to interact with the acidic phospholipid membrane. Introducing Mutations around the Membrane-buried Site of Sapecin—To confirm the results of the TCS experiments, point mutations were introduced around the membrane-buried site, and then the affinities of the mutants for the CL membrane were measured by SPR. The proton chemical shifts recorded for the sapecin mutants exhibited no drastic change, as compared with that for the wild type. Therefore, all of the mutants prepared in the present study assume a similar fold to that of the wild type. Table I shows the effects of the substitutions on the membrane-interaction activity, as measured by SPR. Mutations within the surface identified by the TCS experiments decreased the affinities to the membrane (L5A, I11A, H13A, L21A, R26A, Y29W, V35A, and R39A), whereas a mutation on the opposite side of the membrane-buried surface (H19A) did not affect on affinity. These results demonstrate that the interface determined by the TCS experiments energetically contributes to the interaction with membrane.Table IEquilibrium and kinetic binding constants and relative membrane permeabilization activities of sapecin and the mutants for CL membranekaaEquilibrium and kinetic binding constants of sapecin and the mutants for the CL membrane.kdisaEquilibrium and kinetic binding constants of sapecin and the mutants for the CL membrane.KAaEquilibrium and kinetic binding constants of sapecin and the mutants for the CL membrane.RKAbRelative affinity of each mutant to the CL membrane.

Open table in a new tab Determination of the Oligomerization Site on Sapecin—We also measured the H-D exchange rates for the backbone amide groups of sapecin embedded in bilayer vesicles composed of CL:PC (1:2), with an excess amount of vesicles relative to the peptide. The H-D exchange experiments were performed in D2O at 20 °C using uniformly 15N-labeled sapecin and non-labeled vesicles. As a reference we performed the H-D exchange experiment in the same way but without vesicles. After the H-D exchange procedure, the samples were frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized to stop the H-D exchange. The samples were then re-solubilized in ice-cold methanol to disrupt the lipid bilayer and immediately inserted into pre-shimmed NMR probes. Furthermore, the H-D exchange rates for the backbone amide groups in methanol were also measured at 4 °C. Based upon the peak intensities of a series of 1H,15N HSQC spectra, we determined the H-D exchange rates for the individual residues of sapecin. Fig. 4A shows one-dimensional strips of the HSQC spectra of sapecin, measured as described above. First order H-D exchange rates were calculated from the time dependence of the amide signal reduction in these spectra (Figs. 4, B and C). Considering the fact that the H-D exchange rates in methanol are quite slow, the H-D exchange during the NMR measurement time was almost negligible in the H-D exchange rates obtained from the experiments with and without the vesicles (Fig. 4C). Then the data were converted to the protection factor, which is the ratio of the exchange rate in the free state to that in the vesicle-bound state, for each residue (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Determination of the oligomerization surface on sapecin by H-D exchange experiments.A, protection factors at pH 3.4 and 20 °C as a function of the residue number.

The view direction is same as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the H-D exchange experiments the amide exchange rates for the residues that are located in both the membrane-buried and oligomerization sites are expected to decrease. Therefore, a comparison between the results from the TCS and H-D experiments would reveal the sapecin oligomerization site. Fig. 5B shows the distribution of residues with protection factors larger than 5. The residues with protection factors larger than 10 are clustered on the membrane-buried surface, which was determined by the TCS experiment. On the other hand, the residues with protection factors between 5 and 10 are mainly distributed on the opposite side of the membrane-buried surface. Therefore, we conclude that the residues on the opposite side of the membrane-buried surface are responsible for the oligomerization of sapecin in the membrane. It should be noted that Asp-4 and Arg-23 are separately located at the both ends of the oligomerization surface (Fig. 3C). Mutations of the Sapecin Oligomerization Site—We introduced mutations of the residues on the oligomerization surface and measured the affinity and permeabilization activities. As shown in Table I, the mutation D4A increases the affinity for membrane but decreases the membrane permeabilization activity. The mutation R23A reduced the affinity to the same level as the mutation Y29W, a mutation within the membrane-buried surface. Interestingly, the membrane permeabilization activity of the R23A mutant was lower than that of Y29W mutant. When Asp-4 and Arg-23 were simultaneously mutated, the membrane permeabilization activity drastically decreased, whereas the affinity to the membrane remained almost the same as that of the wild type. Furthermore, the strong tendency of the cooperative membrane permeabilization, which was observed for the wild type sapecin, significantly declined in the double mutant (Fig. 6A). Therefore, it is likely that Asp-4 and Arg-23 of sapecin are involved in the oligomer formation, leading to the membrane permeabilization. Putative Model of Membrane Permeabilization Caused by Sapecin—The residues Asp-4 and Arg-23 are at opposite ends of the oligomerization site on the sapecin molecule. If putative models of sapecin oligomers are made as shown in Fig. 6B, Asp-4 of one sapecin faces Arg-23 of another sapecin, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction might exist between Asp-4 and Arg-23. This putative model can partially explain the results of the mutation introduced in the oligomerization surface that the double mutant of D4A/R23A exhibits the significant reduction of the membrane permeabilization. However, this dose not necessarily mean that the electrostatic interaction is the primary interaction in forming the sapecin oligomers, since the single mutants D4A and R23A still exhibit the membrane permeabilization to a certain extent. Therefore, we conclude that Asp-4 and Arg-23 play a not determinate but key role in the oligomerization, which causes the membrane permeabilization. In the oligomer larger than a trimer the pore size of the oligomer is large enough for glucose to permeate. On the basis of these results we propose a two-step mechanism for the membrane permeabilization by sapecin. In the first step sapecin interacts with the membrane by using the surface composed of the basic and solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, and then it oligomerizes with other sapecin molecules as shown in Fig. 6B, leading to increased membrane permeabilization. Comparison of the amino acid sequence among insect defensins including sapecin shows the conservation of the amino acids corresponding to Asp-4 and Arg-23 of sapecin. Fig. 6C shows an alignment of the amino acid sequence of sapecin with those of other insect defensins. Asp-4 in sapecin is conserved as an acidic residue within the insect defensin family, except for the Aeschna defensin. The conservation of an acidic residue is disadvantageous for the insect defensins to interact with membranes composed of acidic phospholipids. It should be noted that the D4A mutant of sapecin increases the affinity for the CL membrane. However, its conservation seems to be reasonable, since the residue is responsible for sapecin oligomerization and is also essential for the membrane permeabilization activity. As for the Aeschna defensin, the time course of its antibacterial activity is known to be slower than those of other insect defensins (22Bulet P. Cociancich S. Reuland M. Sauber F. Bischoff R. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Considering the lack of the conservation of the acid residue, it is likely that the Aeschna defensin utilizes a different bactericide mechanism from those of the others. The corresponding position of Arg-23 is also highly conserved (59%) within the insect defensins. All of the insect defensins that lack a basic residue at position 23 instead have a basic residue at position 25. Position 25 is close to that of 23 within the sapecin structure (9Hanzawa H. Shimada I. Kuzuhara T. Komano H. Kohda D. Inagaki F. Natori S. Arata Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the basic residues at position 25 could complement the absence of the basic residue at position 23. The oligomerization of insect defensins in the membrane was also described for P. terranovae defensin A by using monolayer techniques (23Maget-Dana R. Ptak M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2527-2533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, a patch clamp experiment revealed that P. terranovae defensin A forms membrane-permeabilizing channels in giant vesicles (6Cociancich S. Ghazi A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19239-19245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering these results and the high sequence homology within the insect defensins family, the oligomerization on the membrane followed by the permeabilizing channel formation would probably be a common process in the membrane permeabilization by these peptides."

Protrusion is generated by the polymerization and bundling of filaments, but the mechanism of retraction is less clear. We have reconstituted retraction in vitro by adding Yersinia tyrosine phosphatase to the major sperm protein-based motility apparatus assembled from Ascaris sperm extracts. Retraction in vitro parallels that observed in vivo and is generated primarily by disassembly and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton.

Srinivasan N. Thorpe C.J. Overington J.P. Kalsheker N.A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 869-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Der p 1 cleaves several proteins such as occludin (25Wan H. Winton H.L. Soeller C. Tovey E.R. Gruenert D.C. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Taylor G.W. Garrod D.R. Cannell M.B.

Although the precise role of the catalytic activity of Der p 1 in vivo has not been elucidated, the following results indicate that the catalytic activity of Der p 1 would be important for the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma, in addition to its antigenicity. 1) Der p 1 disrupts tight junctions by cleaving occludin, increasing the permeability of the bronchial epithelial barrier (25Wan H. Winton H.L. Soeller C. Tovey E.R. Gruenert D.C. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Taylor G.W. Garrod D.R. Cannell M.B. Robinson C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). 2) Der p 1 causes secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and RANTES in bronchial epithelial cells by activating PAR-2 (26Asokananthan N.

Med. 1998; 187: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or CD40 on dendritic cells (29Ghaemmaghami A.M. Gough L. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1468-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SCCA proteins induced by IL-4 and IL-13 target extrinsic proteinases derived from house mites in the lesions of bronchial asthma. To explore this possibility, we examined whether SCCA1 and SCCA2 inhibit the catalytic activities of group I mite allergens in this study. It turned out that SCCA2 inhibited the catalytic activities of both Der p 1 and Der f 1 and that SCCA2 performed its inhibitory activity by irreversibly impairing the catalytic activity of Der p 1 and by being resistant to the cleavage by Der p 1. These results suggest that SCCA2 acts as a cross-class serpin targeting extrinsic cysteine proteinases, Der p 1 and Der f 1, and that SCCA2 may have a protective role against mite-caused biological reactions. Materials—Papain, E-64, cathepsin G, cathepsin L, and human mast cell chymase were purchased from Sigma, Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), Calbiochem, Athens Research & Technology (Athens, GA), and Cortex Biochem (San Leandro, CA), respectively. Generation of Plasmids and Recombinant Proteins—SERPINB3 and SERPINB4 cDNA incorporated into pGEX(-KG)-4T (Amersham Biosciences) were prepared as reported before (32Masumoto K. Sakata Y. Arima K. Nakao I. Izuhara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45296-45304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SCCA2 mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using two complemented primers with mutations. Standard PCR amplification was performed using the SCCA2 cDNA as a template and a mixture of primers. DNA fragments with mutations were ligated into pGEX-KG-SCCA2 plasmid. The RSL-replaced mutants of SCCA1 and SCCA2 were similarly generated by digestion and ligation into the StuI/XbaI site of them. GST-fused SCCA1 and SCCA2 proteins were expressed in an Escherichia coli strain, BL21, and isolated by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Purity of the generated proteins was greater than 95%, as estimated by Coomasie staining of an SDS-PAGE gel. Concentrations of the proteins were determined by Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Generation of the Der p 1 and Der f 1 Protein—Recombinant Der p 1 and Der f 1 proteins were generated as described before (33Yasuhara T. Takai T. Yuuki T. Okudaira H. Okumura Y. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Takai T. Mineki R. Nakazawa T. Takaoka M. Yasueda H. Murayama K. Okumura K. Ogawa H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, proforms of four recombinant house dust mite group 1 allergens, Der p 1-N52Q, Der p 1-WT, Der f 1-N53Q, and Der f 1-WT, were secreted into the culture supernatant of transfectant cells of Pichia pastoris and converted to the mature forms with prosequences removed by dialysis against an acidic buffer. The mature forms were purified with anion exchange column chromatography. The purity was more than 95%, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by Protein Assay. Der p 1-N52Q and Der f 1-N53Q were used for most experiments. Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays of Der p 1 and Der f 1 were performed as described before (33Yasuhara T. Takai T. Yuuki T. Okudaira H. Okumura Y. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2001; 31: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Schulz O. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 222-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The substrate used for enzyme assays was butyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Arg-methylcoumarin (Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA), purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. The indicated concentrations of Der p 1 or Der f 1 preactivated with 2 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min at 25 °C were incubated with the indicated concentrations of GST-fused SCCA proteins for 30 min at 25 °C in activity-measuring buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.001% BSA). Upon addition of 100 μm substrate to the reaction mixture, the residual enzyme activity was measured by continuous monitoring, using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Cleavage Assay of CD25—Procedures of cleavage assay of CD25 were performed as described before (28Schulz O. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A human acute T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat T cells, was stimulated with 100 nm PMA (Sigma) and 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for 30 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum followed by suspension with serum-free AIM V medium (Invitrogen). Two μm Der p 1 preactivated with 2 mm dithiothreitol was incubated with 1 μm SCCA proteins for 30 min at 25 °C. Then, CD25 cleavage was performed by incubating Jurkat cells with the mixture of Der p 1 and SCCA proteins with the final concentrations of Der p 1 and SCCA proteins 0.6 and 0.3 μm, respectively, for 2 h at 37 °C. Expression of CD25 on cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-CD25 antibody (Beckman Coulter), and soluble CD25 in the supernatant was immunoassayed in the Mitsubishi Kagaku BCL laboratories by means of a commercial kit. Matrix-associated Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Five μm Der p 1 and 10 μm SCCA proteins were mixed in phosphate reaction buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the reactive samples were applied to Voyager RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Separation of the Incubated SCCA Proteins and Der p 1—After 2 μm Der p 1 and SCCA proteins were incubated in phosphate reaction buffer for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction mixture was applied to the high pressure liquid chromatography system equipped with ProteinPak 300SW (Waters, Milford, MA). Then, the subjected samples were eluted with phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0), and each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE or the enzyme assay. The gels were stained with silver using 2D-SILVER STAIN II “Daiichi” (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). The quantities of the proteins on the gels were determined by SYPRO Ruby staining (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) Chemical Modification of the Cysteine Residues of Der p 1—The fractionated Der p 1 was incubated with 0.4 mm EZ-Link PEO-maleimide activated biotin ((+)-biotinyl-3-maleimidopropiomamidyl-3, 6-dioxaoctanediamine; PEO-M-biotin, Pierce) for 2 h at 25 °C. The samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Synthesized Peptides—Synthesized peptides used for inhibition assays were Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Gly-Phe-Gly-Ser-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Thr (SCCA1–13 mer), Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Val-Val-Glu-Leu-Ser-Ser-Pro-Ser-Thr (SCCA2–13 mer), and Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Val-Val-Gly-Leu-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Thr (SCCA2 tm-13 mer), all purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. The peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Expression and Purification of Functional SCCA1 and SCCA2—To perform functional analyses of SCCA1 and SCCA2, we expressed and purified recombinant proteins of GST-fused SCCA1 and SCCA2. We confirmed that SCCA1 inhibited the cysteine protease activities of papain and cathepsin L but not the serine protease activities of cathepsin G and human mast cell chymase, whereas SCCA2 showed the opposite effects, as reported previously (32Masumoto K. Sakata Y. Arima K. Nakao I. Izuhara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45296-45304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that purified SCCA1 and SCCA2 proteins were functional. Inhibition of Catalytic Activities of Der p 1 and Der f 1 by SCCA2—We first analyzed whether SCCA1 or SCCA2 inhibited catalytic activities of Der p 1 and Der f 1. The kcat and Km values of Der p 1 used in the experiments were estimated as 0.444 ± 0.0173 s–1 and 248 ± 16.2 μm, respectively (Table I). An irreversible inhibitor for cysteine proteinase, E-64, displayed only 39% of inhibition at a 10:1 ratio at 10 nm Der p 1 or Der f 1 (Fig. 1A). Therefore, active site titration of Der p 1 or Der f 1 was impossible, so we analyzed dose-dependent effects of SCCA1 and SCCA2 on the catalytic activity of Der p 1 and Der f 1. When the concentration of Der p 1 or Der f 1 was fixed at 10 nm, SCCA2 inhibited catalytic activities of both Der p 1 and Der f 1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SCCA1 showed only 10% inhibition at 10:1 ratio (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory effects of SCCA2 were independent of glycosylation of Der p 1 and Der f 1 (data not shown). When the ratio of Der p 1 and SCCA1 or SCCA2 was fixed at 1:1, the inhibitory effect of SCCA2 increased dependent of the concentration, reaching almost 100% at 1 μm (Fig. 1B). SCCA1 showed a weaker inhibitory effect when compared with SCCA2. GST alone had no inhibitory effect. These results demonstrated that SCCA2, and to a lesser extent SCCA1, targeted Der p 1 and that SCCA2 is a cross-class serpin that can inhibit both serine and cysteine proteinases as well as CrmA, PI9, and SCCA1.Table IComparison of kcat and Km for BSA-treated and SCCA2-treated Der p 1kcatKmkcat/Kms-1μms-1/m-1BSA-treated (n = 3)0.444 ± 0.0173248 ± 16.21790 ± 46.3SCCA2-treated (n = 3)0.0155 ± 0.00260290 ± 71.054.2 ± 4.40aStatistically significant difference versus BSA-treated at p = 0.0000003.a Statistically significant difference versus BSA-treated at p = 0.0000003. Open table in a new tab Inhibitory Effects of SCCA Proteins on CD25 Cleavage by Der p 1—To examine whether SCCA2 shows its inhibitory effect on Der p 1, when Der p 1 targets not only the synthetic peptide, but also an intact protein as a substrate, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of SCCA proteins on CD25 cleavage by Der p 1. Incubation of Der p 1 with activated Jurkat cells caused the cleavage of CD25 (Fig. 2A, 31 ± 2.0%, n = 3). The presence of SCCA2 completely restored expression of CD25, and so did SCCA1 to some extent. Furthermore, existence of the soluble CD25 in the supernatant was observed in parallel with the cleavage of CD25 on Jurkat cells (Fig. 2B). These results meant that SCCA2 also exerts its inhibitory effects on the interaction of Der p 1 with CD25. Determination of the Cleavage Sites in SCCA1 and SCCA2 by Der p 1—We next identified the cleavage sites in RSLs of SCCA1 and SCCA2 by Der p 1, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis of Der p 1-cleaved peptides in SCCA1 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed the existence of four peaks corresponding to the peptides from Phe-352, Gly-353, Ser-354, and Ser-355 to the C terminus, whereas the analyses with SCCA2 displayed only one peak, corresponding to the peptide from Leu-354 to the C terminus (Fig. 3). These results indicated that Der p 1 would interact with SCCA2 firmly, generating a serpin-proteinase complex as other serpins do. In contrast, the interaction between Der p 1 and SCCA1 would not be tight, and Der p 1 would cleave non-specifically the RSL of SCCA1. Non-covalent Binding of SCCA2 with Der p 1—Although it is well known that a serpin and its target proteinase form an acyl-enzyme intermediate linked by an oxy-ester bond, stable for hydrolysis (36Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), we have recently demonstrated that SCCA1 inhibited the catalytic activity of papain without forming a covalent bond (32Masumoto K. Sakata Y. Arima K. Nakao I. Izuhara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45296-45304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the association manner of SCCA2 and Der p 1. To retain the native association between SCCA2 and Der p 1, we employed a gel-filtration system. We used a mixture of Der p 1 and SCCA2 in which the catalytic activity of Der p 1 was completely inhibited. Subsequently, SCCA2 and Der p 1 were eluted according to their molecular masses (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrated that SCCA2 interacted with Der p 1 by non-covalent binding as well as the interaction between SCCA1 and papain. Irreversible Inhibition of Der p 1 by SCCA2 Treatment—We next investigated how SCCA2 inhibited the catalytic activity of Der p 1 without forming a covalently bound complex. To study the effects of the interaction between SCCA2 and Der p 1, we analyzed the catalytic activity of the SCCA2-treated Der p 1 eluted by the gel-filtration column. Although the catalytic activity of Der p 1 was completely inhibited in the solution containing 2 μm Der p 1 and SCCA2, which was applied to the column, it turned out that the catalytic activity of fractionated Der p 1 decreased, but still existed, when compared with the solution before fractionation (36 ± 9.4%, n = 3, Fig. 4B). The kcat/Km value of SCCA2-treated Der p 1 was significantly less than that of BSA-treated Der p 1 (54.2 ± 4.40 versus 1790 ± 46.3 s–1m–1, p = 0.0000003, Table I), which confirmed the impairment of the catalytic activity. These results raised the possibility that SCCA2 treatment caused a conformational change of Der p 1, down-regulating its catalytic activity. To explore this possibility, we compared chemical modification of SCCA2-treated or BSA-treated Der p 1 by biotin-conjugated maleimide, a cysteine residue-modifying reagent. Modification of SCCA2-treated Der p 1 by biotin-conjugated maleimide was reduced when compared with the level of BSA-treated Der p 1 (56 ± 14%, n = 3, Fig. 4C). These results suggest that down-regulation of the catalytic activity of Der p 1 may be due to its conformational change, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the cysteine residue of the active center was unexpectedly modified by SCCA2. Resistance of SCCA2 against Cleavage by Der p 1—Although the irreversible conformational change of Der p 1 contributed to the inhibition mechanism of SCCA2, it could not fully explain it because fractionated Der p 1 still showed catalytic activity at the reducing level (Fig. 4B). As only intact serpin sustains its inhibitory activity in the suicide substrate-like mechanism, it would be possible that the difference of susceptibility to cleavage by the target proteinase could affect the inhibitory activity of serpin. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the digestion profile of SCCA2 in the presence of Derp1ina time-dependent manner. It turned out that SCCA2 was resistant to digestion by Der p 1 when compared with SCCA1 and that 53% of SCCA2 still existed, intact, after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 5). When SCCA1 was incubated with papain, intact SCCA1 immediately began to decrease and was completely lost within 15 min. These results demonstrated that resistance against the cleavage by the target proteinase was a unique property of SCCA2, and it could at least partially explain why SCCA2 exerted its potent inhibitory activity on Der p 1 when compared with SCCA1. Preference of Amino Acids in the RSL Sequences of SCCA2 and SCCA1 for Inhibitory Effect on Der p 1—The distinct properties of SCCA1 and SCCA2 regarding the inhibitory effects on Der p 1 are assumed to be due to the difference of their RSL sequences. Actually, swapping the RSL of SCCA1 for that of SCCA2, or vice versa, revealed that the inhibitory effect on Der p 1 was dependent on the RSL of SCCA2 (Table II, SCCA1 RSL2, SCCA2 RSL1). We then exchanged each amino acid specific for the RSL of SCCA2 with that corresponding to SCCA1 and analyzed its inhibitory effect on Der p 1 (Table II). When Val-351, Va"
https://openalex.org/W2040358766,"We have analyzed the expression and function of Cecpz-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans cathepsin Z-like cysteine protease gene, during development of the worm. The cpz-1 gene is expressed in various hypodermal cells of all developmental stages and is specifically expressed in the gonads and the pharynx of adult worms. Disruption of cpz-1 function by RNA interference or cpz-1(ok497) deletion mutant suggests that cpz-1 has a role in the molting pathways. The presence of the native CPZ-1 protein in the hypodermis/cuticle of larval and adult stages and along the length of the pharynx of adult worms, as well as the cyclic expression of the transcript during larval development, supports such function. We hypothesize that the CPZ-1 enzyme functions directly as a proteolytic enzyme degrading cuticular proteins before ecdysis and/or indirectly by processing other proteins such as proenzymes and/or other proteins that have an essential role during molting. Notably, an impressive level of the CPZ-1 native protein is present in both the new and the old cuticles during larval molting, in particular in the regions that are degraded prior to shedding and ecdysis. The similar localization of the related Onchocerca volvulus cathepsin Z protein suggests that the function of CPZ-1 during molting might be conserved in other nematodes. Based on the cpz-1 RNA interference and cpz-1 (ok497) deletion mutant phenotypes, it appears that cpz-1 have additional roles during morphogenesis. Deletion of cpz-1 coding sequence or inhibition of cpz-1 function by RNA interference also caused morphological defects in the head or tail region of larvae, improperly developed gonad in adult worms and embryonic lethality. The CPZ-1 native protein in these affected regions may have a role in the cuticular and the basement membrane extracellular matrix assembly process.

The present findings have defined a critical role for cathepsin Z in nematode biology. Based on the identification and characterization of a cysteine protease in human brain, a new subfamily of cysteine proteases of the papain family, the cathepsin Z-like enzyme, was recently classified (1Santamaria I. Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The human brain cathepsin Z was, however, found to be widely expressed in many tissues, suggesting that this enzyme is possibly involved in the normal intracellular protein degradation that takes place in all cell types. Notably, the enzyme was also found in many cancer cell lines and in primary tumors from different sources, which also suggested a role for this enzyme in tumor progression (1Santamaria I. Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The human cathepsin Z contains distinctive features that separate it from other human cysteine proteases (2Nagler D.K. Menard R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cathepsin Z is characterized by an unusual and unique 3-amino acid insertion (HIP) in the highly conserved region between the glutamine of the putative oxyanion hole and the active site cysteine, which might confer special properties to the enzyme (3Nagler D.K. Zhang R. Tam W. Sulea T. Purisima E.O. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12648-12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It functional diversity is generated by the addition of the HIP residues including His23 in the mature enzyme that provides an anchor for the C terminus of a substrate, thereby allowing favorable enzyme-substrate interaction independent of the P2-P1 sequence.

Moreover, the pro-region of the cathepsin Z is the shortest known to exist in the papain family, and it does not share any significant similarity with the other cathepsin family sequences (1Santamaria I.

Interestingly, cDNA sequences encoding cathepsin Z-like enzymes have been identified among both parasitic and free-living nematodes (5Falcone F.H. Tetteh K.K. Hunt P. Blaxter M.L. Loukas A.

The only two published nematode cathepsin Z-like enzymes were postulated to function during molting (6Lustigman S. McKerrow J.H. Shah K. Lui J. Huima T. Hough M. Brotman B. J. Biol.

The role of the Onchocerca volvulus CPZ during molting was evidenced by its distinct localization, as determined by using monospecific antibodies raised against the O. volvulus LOVCP enzyme (renamed Ov-CPZ) and thin sections of the parasitic nematode. The native enzyme was localized in the region where the separation between the cuticles of the third-stage larvae (L3) and the fourth-stage larvae (L4) during molting takes place (6Lustigman S. McKerrow J.H. Shah K. Lui J. Huima T. Hough M. Brotman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30181-30189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The homologous enzyme in Toxocara canis (Tc-CPZ), however, was also highly expressed in adult stages, which precluded its exclusive role during T. canis molting. Unfortunately, it is still difficult to elucidate gene functions directly in parasitic nematodes because of the lack of molecular genetic approaches to directly investigate the role of a desired gene in the biology/biochemistry of these organisms. To conclusively uncover the broad range of the cathepsin Z enzyme function in the parasitic nematodes, we took advantage of the presence of CPZ-encoding sequences in the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the availability of molecular tools that provide for high throughput characterization of genes in this powerful model system. The C. elegans has only two genes that encode cathepsin Z-like cysteine proteases, which we named Ce-cpz-1 (F32B5.8) and Ce-cpz-2 (M04G12.2); this makes it an ideal in vivo system for studying the putative functions of the homologous genes in the parasitic nematodes for which the most important biochemical interactions are likely to be conserved (7Hashmi S. Wilson T. Lustigman S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Burling R.T. Lobos E. Blaxter M.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The use of the C. elegans model system for the study of homologous genes found in many other organisms including humans has already revolutionized the progress toward the confirmation of genes that can become targets for new drug development (7Hashmi S. Wilson T. Lustigman S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Burling R.T. Lobos E. Blaxter M.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 395-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Ce-CPZ-1 is 82 and 73% identical to the O. volvulus and T. canis CPZ enzymes, whereas Ce-CPZ-2 shows only 57 and 53% identity, respectively. Because of the greater identity of Ce-CPZ-1 to the parasitic nematode sequences, we chose to study the functional role of Ce-CPZ-1 during C. elegans development as the model system for the parasitic CPZ enzymes, and consequently validate whether these enzymes in the parasitic nematodes could become potential targets for the development of therapeutic intervention. Cysteine proteases in many other parasite systems have been identified as potential targets for drug or vaccine development (9Tort J. Brindley P.J. Knox D. Wolfe K.H. Dalton J.P. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 48: 161-266Crossref Google Scholar, 10Dalton J.P. McGonigle S. Rolph T.P. Andrew S.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5066-5074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cathepsin Z-like Cysteine Proteases of C. elegans—A BLAST search (11Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) of ACeDB, the C. elegans data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/C_elegans/wormpep/1) using the O. volvulus Ov-CPZ amino acid sequence (U71150) identified two predicted C. elegans cathepsin Z-like genes (F32B5.8 and M04G12.2), which we named Ce-cpz-1 and Ce-cpz-2, respectively. Alignment of the CPZ protein sequences within the GenBank™ data base was made using ClusterW multiple sequence alignment. The Ce-CPZ-1 protein encoded by the F32B5.8 gene had the highest similarity with the Ov-CPZ protein (82%) in comparison to 57% identity of Ce-CPZ-2 with Ov-CPZ, and is therefore the focus of the studies outlined below. Few cDNA clones corresponding to the F32B5.8 gene were identified in the Expressed Sequence Tag Data Base, one of which contained the full-length Ce-cpz-1 cDNA sequence (clone yk94b1, accession no. D66235). The pBluescript phagemid of the λZAPII phage of clone yk94b1 (obtained from Yuji Kohara, C. elegans Consortium, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan) was excised and the DNA sequenced in both directions to confirm the predicted amino acid sequence of the F32B5.8 gene. Based on the cDNA sequence and trans-splicing patterns, there appear to be 5 exons in the F32B5.8 gene instead of 7 exons as predicted by Genefinder. In addition, we amplified the corresponding SL1 trans-spliced cDNA product from total RNA, and its sequence has confirmed the first ATG codon in the yk94b1 cDNA clone. The signal sequence and its putative cleavage site were identified using the SignalP Server (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP). Analysis of the putative promoter region of Ce-cpz-1 gene was performed using Genefinder provided by the BCM server (www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/searchlauncher). Stage-specific Profile of the Ce-cpz-1 mRNA Transcript Using Real-time PCR—A synchronous population of arrested first-stage larvae (L1) was prepared by treatment of gravid hermaphrodites with sodium hypochlorite and subsequent hatching from the embryos overnight in water (12Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood,. B. The Nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). The arrested L1 were then transferred onto NGM agarose plates seeded with bacteria, which allowed the collection of synchronous worms over a 40-h period during L1 to young adult C. elegans development at 2-h intervals (Fig. 2), as previously described (13Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Approximately 40,000 worms collected from each stage were washed several times with autoclaved distilled water and stored at -70 °C until needed. Total RNA was prepared from embryos and from all the other developmental stages using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and priming with random hexamers. The specific cDNA fragment of Ce-cpz-1 was then amplified using the forward 5′-GCTTCTTCGGCTTATGGC-3′ and the reverse 5′-AACTGACAGATAGGCTTGTGG-3′ primers and the copy number quantified by real-time PCR using QuantiTech™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Another set of primers, forward 5′-GCATTGTCTCACGCGTTCAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCTTCCTTCTCCGCTGCTC-3′, was used for the specific amplification of an internal control, the ama-1 transcript (13Johnstone I.L. Barry J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both sets of primers were designed to span an intron to distinguish cDNA from contaminating gDNA products. The following PCR conditions, which allowed reactants to remain in excess, were used: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. To determine the copy number of each transcript within the stage-specific cDNA preparations, standard curves for cpz-1 and ama-1 were drawn based on quantitative PCR using known amounts of template DNA in a range of 10-106 copies. The relative content of the transcript corresponding to cpz-1 is expressed in each developmental stage as the ratio between its copy numbers relative to that of ama-1. Construction of cpz-1 Transgenic C. elegans Strains—Two types of reporter fusion construct were generated. The transcriptional fusion construct designated pSL108A contained a 2.3-kb promoter region of the Ce-cpz-1 and was generated by PCR from C. elegans genomic DNA (Fig. 1C). It was cloned into the lacZ reporter vector pPD90.23, which contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif. The translational fusion gene constructs designated pSL103 and pSL107A contained a genomic fragment of Ce-cpz-1, which included a 1.4-kb promoter region and the first 4 exons (Fig. 1C). The gene fragment for these constructs was amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA and subsequently cloned into the PCR 2.1 cloning vector (TOPO cloning kit, Invitrogen) before excision and subcloning into two C. elegans expression vectors: 1) pPD95.75 (pSL103), which expressed the gene in frame with gfp; and 2) pPD90.23, which expressed the gene in frame with β-galactosidase (pSL107A) and in the nuclei of the worms. Sequencing of the final constructs was performed to confirm that the coding sequence of cpz-1 in both translational constructs was in frame with gfp or the lacZ sequences.Fig. 1A, sequence of the Ce-CPZ-1 promoter, cDNA, and the encoded protein.

E, reporter constructs used to generate transgenic lines. Translational fusion constructs were generated by fusing a 1.4-kb promoter region upstream of cpz-1 and its first four exons in frame with gfp (pSL103) or lacZ (pSL107A). The transcriptional fusion construct was created by fusing a 2.3-kb promoter region upstream of the cpz-1 cDNA to a lacZ reporter construct (pSL108A).

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2673-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). A plasmid DNA (pRF4) containing the dominant selectable marker gene rol-6 (su1006), which encodes a mutant collagen, was co-injected (∼80 ng/μl) with the Ce-cpz-1:lacZ or Ce-cpz-1:gfp fusion constructs. C. elegans expressing the rol-6 gene continuously roll over, thereby providing a visible phenotype for the selection of transgenic worms (16Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). F2 rollers were picked and transferred into individual Escherichia coli plates to establish a number of independent lines. Lines in which F3 and subsequent generations showed the roller phenotype were stained for β-galactosidase expression using DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, final concentration 0.1%) as a co-stain to aid in the identification of cell types (17Fire A. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1992; 9: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). cpz-1:gfp transgenes were visualized by mounting live transgenic worms on a 2% agarose pad in 0.01% sodium azide as described (18Hashmi S. Britton C. Liu J. Guiliano D.B. Oksov Y. Lustigman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3477-3486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Preparation and RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi procedure was carried out using dsRNA as described by Fire et al. (19Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11650) Google Scholar) and Tabara et al. (20Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The full-length Ce-cpz-1 cDNA clone (yk94b1) in pBluescript was used as the template for RNA synthesis. The cDNA was first amplified with commercially available T3 and T7 primers (Invitrogen) and then used with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase for the single-stranded sense or antisense RNA synthesis using the MEGAscript high yield transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). To obtain dsRNA, equal amounts of T3 and T7 reaction products were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 68 °C, followed by 37 °C for 30 min to yield a final concentration of dsRNA at ∼5 μg/μl. Soaking with dsRNA (20Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and feeding (21Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) with E. coli transformed with a plasmid DNA encoding cpz-1 were employed in the RNAi experiments. To determine the effect of cpz-1 gene disruption during post-embryonic development of C. elegans, RNAi was performed on synchronized L1, L2, L3, and L4 worms. The synchronized C. elegans population was prepared as described for stage-specific real-time PCR except that the L1, L2, L3, and L4 worms were collected at one point during their development: 8, 14, 21, and 28 h after transfer of hatched L1 worms to NGM plate, respectively. For RNAi using the soaking method, 40 C. elegans L1 and L2, 25 L3, and 20 L4 worms were incubated in 20 μl of 0.2 m sucrose in 0.1× PBS premixed with 1 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and containing cpz-1 dsRNA at a final concentration of 2 μg/μl. After 24 h, soaked larvae were transferred to individual E. coli plates and their development examined for 2-3 days. Stage-specific larvae soaked in 0.2 m sucrose, 0.1× PBS and Lipofectin but without dsRNA served as the control. For RNAi using the feeding method, stage-specific larvae were fed on HT115(DE3) bacteria expressing dsRNA of cpz-1. Briefly, full-length cpz-1 cDNA fragment (∼1 kb) was amplified from total RNA and was cloned into the L4440 feeding vector (21Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transformed into the HT115(DE3) RNase III-deficient E. coli strain. Single colonies of HT115 bacteria containing the cloned L4440 plasmid were selected on tetracycline plates and then were grown overnight in culture in Luria Broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and seeded directly onto NGM plates with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The induction of the Ce-cpz-1 dsRNA was carried out at room temperature overnight. Staged larvae obtained from synchronous culture were placed onto NGM plates containing seeded bacteria expressing cpz-1 dsRNA for 36 h using optimal induction and feeding conditions as described (22Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome Biol. 2000; 2: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar). Non-induced bacteria served as a control. The treated worms were observed under light microscope using Nomarski optics. To detect the early effect on embryonic development in F1 generation, RNAi was also performed by injecting adult hermaphrodite worms with dsRNA (concentration ∼1 μg/μl) as previously described (20Tabara H. Grishok A. Mello C.C. Science. 1998; 282: 430-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The development of the F1 was observed over 2 days after egg laying. Each of the RNAi experiments described above was repeated at least three times. Initial Characterization of cpz-1 Mutant Worms—We obtained a C. elegans cpz-1 mutant strain RB732 (allele ok497) from the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). The ok497 allele has a deletion that covers part of exon 1 and complete removal of exons 2, 3, and 4 within the F32B5.8 gene. This mutant was back-crossed four times using wild type N2 strain males at the beginning of the cross according to standard protocol and maintained as homozygous. The homozygous mutant was sequenced to confirm the deletion site, using inner right sequence primer ATCTTGAACCATCCGTGCTC corresponding to position 59-79 in relation to ATG start codon and inner left sequence CTTATGGCAAGGTTCGGAAG corresponding to position 2614-2633 in relation to ATG start codon. Individual homozygous cpz-1 (ok497) mutant hermaphrodites were grown on plates at 20 °C, and their self-progeny were used in several experiments. For temperature shift experiments, the cpz-1 mutants L3 or L4 were raised at 15, 20, or 25 °C to see the effects of different temperatures on the growth and development of the mutant worms. For morphological comparison between mutant and wild type strains, living animals were observed using Nomarski differential interference contrast microscopy. RT-PCR was performed on cpz-1 mutant strain to determine the effect of mutation on the production of the cpz-1 transcript. Production of Recombinant C. elegans CPZ-1 Fusion Polypeptide—A fragment of Ce-cpz-1 cDNA encoding the pro-region and the mature enzyme (amino acids 23-306, Fig. 1A) was amplified and cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant GST-CPZ-1 protein was expressed in E. coli strain HB101. As the recombinant protein was mostly expressed in the inclusion bodies, it was purified as follows: bacterial cells from a 500-ml culture were harvested and lysed by sonication in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The insoluble proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and re-sonicated in the same buffer one more time. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 20 ml of 6 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The soluble fraction was then subjected to preparative separation using the Prep Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Specific fractions containing the purified recombinant protein were identified by Western blot using antibodies against GST or antibodies against the homologous O. volvulus Ov-CPZ protein and pooled. The CPZ-1 protein was then cleaved from the GST fusion peptide by thrombin according to the recommendation from the manufacturer. A mouse anti-serum was raised against the purified CPZ-1 recombinant protein using the repetitive immunizations/multiple sites strategy (23Bynum J. Andrews J.L. Ellis B. Kull Jr., F.C. Austin E.A.

Enzyme activity is dependent on the calcium-stabilized structure of Dsg1. Here we further define the characteristics of this cleavage. Kinetic studies monitoring the cleavage of Dsg1 by ETA, ETB, and ETD demonstrated kcat/Km values of 2–6 × 104m–1 s–1, suggesting very efficient proteolysis.

Using truncated mutants of human Dsg1 and chimeric molecules between human Dsg1 and either human Dsg3 or canine Dsg1, we show that for cleavage, human-specific amino acids from Dsg1 are necessary in extracellular domain 3 upstream of the scissile bond. If these residues are canine rather than human, ETA binds, but does not cleave, canine Dsg1.

Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent bacterial pathogen in human disease. Skin infections are particularly prevalent, with impetigo caused by S. aureus one of the most common infectious diseases in children (1Darnstadt G.L. Behrman R.E. Kliegman R. Jenson H.B. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 2028-2030Google Scholar). Approximately 30% of impetigo patients develop bullous impetigo, which is caused by S. aureus strains that produce exfoliative toxins (ETs) 1The abbreviations used are: ETexfoliative toxinDsg1 and -3desmoglein 1 and 3, respectivelySSSSstaphylococcal scalded skin syndromeECextracellularTBSTris-buffered salineDFPdiiopropylfluorophosphateDCI3,4-dichloroisocoumarinGSTglutathione S-transferaseE tagE peptide taghDsg1 and -3human desmoglein 1 and 3, respectivelycDsg1canine Dsg1.

More extensive disease can occur in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), in which ETs produced by a nidus of infection circulate systemically, usually in infants and young children, to produce more generalized blistering. Although SSSS is much less common than bullous impetigo, outbreaks that occur in neonatal nurseries have important consequences for health care delivery (2Ladhani S. Joannou C.L. Lochrie D.P.

It remained unclear exactly how ETs cause this blister until it was discovered that they have structural and sequence homologies to serine proteases, at which time it was suggested that they act as proteolytic enzymes that were predicted to cleave after either a glutamic or aspartic acid (8Vath G.M. Earhart C.A. Rago J.V. Kim M.H. Bohach G.A. Schlievert P.M. Ohlendorf D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1559-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, they could not be shown to cleave model polypeptide substrates. Their normal pathophysiologic substrate, if any, remained a mystery until it was realized that the blisters in bullous impetigo and SSSS show clinical and histological similarity to those of pemphigus foliaceus, an autoimmune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies bind the desmosomal cell adhesion molecule, desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) (9Amagai M. Matsuyoshi N. Wang Z.H. Andl C. Stanley J.R. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1275-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This observation led to the hypothesis that the molecular target of ETs is Dsg1. This hypothesis was validated by showing that three different ET isotypes (ETA, ETB, and ETD) specifically cleave mouse and human Dsg1 (hDsg1) but not closely related molecules such as Dsg3 or E-cadherin (9Amagai M.

Mutation of the predicted active serine in these ETs caused loss of their proteolytic activity, confirming that they are serine proteases (12Hanakawa Y. Schechter N.M. Lin C. Garza L. Li H.

Dsg1 is in the desmosomal cadherin subfamily of the cadherin supergene family. Desmosomal cadherins, similar to classic cadherins, contain four amino-terminal homologous domains (called extracellular (EC) domains 1–4), of about 100 amino acid each, that are highly conserved among many cadherins (13Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 625-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fifth juxtamembrane domain (EC5) is not as well conserved within or among the cadherins. The structure of Dsg1, like other cadherins, is maintained by calcium binding that occurs between EC domains (14Kemler R. Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Curr. Opin.

This calcium-stabilized structure is thought to be critical in maintaining the adhesive function of classical and, presumably, desmosomal cadherins (18Nagafuchi A. Shirayoshi Y. Okazaki K. Yasuda K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 19Ozawa M. Engel J. Kemler R.

Recent studies show not only that ETs show a substrate specificity for Dsg1 but also that they hydrolyze only one peptide bond in human and mouse Dsg1 at exactly the same site, after glutamic acid 381 between EC3 and EC4 (12Hanakawa Y. Schechter N.M. Lin C. Garza L. Li H. Yamaguchi T. Fudaba Y. Nishifuji K. Sugai M. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cleavage of Dsg1 by ETs is dependent on the former's calcium-stabilized conformation (i.e. denatured or partially denatured Dsg1 cannot be hydrolyzed by ETs) (21Hanakawa Y. Selwood T. Woo D. Lin C. Schechter N.M. Stanley J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike more typical serine proteases whose specificities are defined by simple amino acid sequences and which can hydrolyze many proteins and model polypeptides, ETs show exquisite specificity for one peptide bond in one correctly folded substrate, Dsg1. In this study, we show that in addition to being exquisitely specific for a single peptide bond in Dsg1, ETs are efficient in hydrolyzing that peptide bond. We show that the catalytic site of ETA is protected from typical serine proteases inhibitors and that domains in Dsg1 amino-terminal, but not carboxyl-terminal, to the cleavage site are necessary for its cleavage by ETA. Finally, we show that although ETA binds to canine Dsg1 (cDsg1) it does not cleave it, but it will do so if 5 amino acids that are upstream of the cleavage site are mutated to hDsg1 residues. The results of these studies suggest that the exquisite specificity and efficiency of ETA in cleavage of Dsg1 depend on the enzyme's binding upstream of the cleavage site with the proper fit, like a key in a lock, to properly align, and perhaps activate, its catalytic site. Recombinant ETs—DNA encoding the ETD mature sequence was amplified by PCR using pQE-ETD-His (provided by Dr. Motoyuki Sugai, University of Hiroshima) as a template (11Yamaguchi T. Nishifuji K.

PCR was also used to add nucleotides encoding the ETA signal peptide to the 5′-end of the ETD sequence and to add nucleotides encoding the V5 and His tags to the 3′-end of the ETD sequence. ETD-V5His was subcloned into the shuttle vector, pCE104 (12Hanakawa Y. Schechter N.M. Lin C. Garza L. Li H. Yamaguchi T. Fudaba Y. Nishifuji K. Sugai M. Amagai M. Stanley J.R. J. Clin.

We also used recombinant wild-type ETA, ETB, and ETAS195A (enzymatically active serine, at position 195 as defined by classical chymotrypsin serine protease numbering, mutated to alanine) with V5 and His tags as previously described (12Hanakawa Y.

Recombinant ETs were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Protein concentrations of ETs were estimated with a Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) and on Simply Blue (a modified Coomassie G-250 solution; Invitrogen)-stained SDS-PAGE gels compared with standards and each other. Production and ET Cleavage of Human Desmoglein 1—The entire EC domain of human recombinant Dsg1 with a His and E tag (hDsg1E) on the carboxyl terminus was produced as a secreted protein by baculovirus as previously described (22Ishii K. Amagai M. Hall R.P. Hashimoto T. Takayanagi A. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2010-2017PubMed Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, hDsg1E was purified from insect cell culture supernatant on an anti-E tag column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using 0.1 mg/ml E tag peptide in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBS plus Ca2+). The eluant was dialyzed against TBS plus Ca2+. 1 μm purified hDsg1E (estimated with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad)) was incubated with varying concentrations of ETA, ETB, and ETD for various times in TBS plus Ca2+ at 25 °C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Simply Blue (Invitrogen). These gels were scanned for densitometric analysis by NIH Image software. The percentage of cleavage was calculated as a function of time, and resultant curves were analyzed by Igore Pro software (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) (23Schechter N.M. Plotnick M. Selwood T. Walter M. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24499-24507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 1 μm hDsg1E was chosen because of the previously estimated dissociation constant (Kd) of ∼10 μm, determined for the interaction of an inactive (active serine at position 195 mutated to alanine) ETA with hDsg1E (12Hanakawa Y.

This value suggests a lower limit for the Km, and at a substrate (hDsg1E) concentration ∼10-fold less than Km, the Michaelis-Menten equation predicts pseudo-first-order kinetics for any particular enzyme concentration, which was confirmed by the exponential decay of hDsg1E shown in Fig. 1. For protease inhibitor studies, 1 μm ETA or 1 μm staphylococcus V8 protease (Roche Applied Science) was preincubated with 20 mm diiopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) (Calbiochem) or 2 mm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) (Sigma) or 0.1 units/μl α2-macroglobulin (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 30 min in TBS plus Ca2+. Pretreated ETA or V8 was then incubated with 10 nm of hDsg1E in TBS plus Ca2+ at 25 °C for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting. Dsg1 Truncated Mutants and Chimeric Recombinants—PCR was used to construct cDNAs encoding various truncated hDsg1 molecules (Fig. 3A) with E tags or E tag-glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags on their carboxyl termini.

The entire EC domain of hDsg3 with a His and E tag (hDsg3E) on the carboxyl terminus was produced as previously described (22Ishii K. Amagai M. Hall R.P. Hashimoto T. Takayanagi A. Gamou S. Shimizu N. Nishikawa T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2010-2017PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of cDsg1 was performed with the Genetailor mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol to make mutants so that selected amino acids were mutated into hDsg1 equivalents (Fig. 7A). Recombinant baculovirus expression vectors were co-transfected with BaculoGold DNA (BD Biosciences) to Sf9 cells, and baculovirus in culture supernatants was used to infect High Five cells as previously described (22Ishii K.

Approximately, 10 nm recombinant secreted protein in the High Five culture supernatant was incubated with 1 μm ETA for cleavage analysis. Degradation of hDsg1E was assayed by Western blotting with anti-E tag antibodies, as previously described (12Hanakawa Y. Schechter N.M. Lin C. Garza L. Li H. Yamaguchi T. Fudaba Y. Nishifuji K.

Invest. 2002; 110: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), supernatants of High Five insect cells transduced with baculovirus encoding hDsg1E, cDsg1E, or hDsg3E were incubated with ETAS195A and then used directly for immunoprecipitation. E tagged proteins were precipitated with anti-E tag-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 10 times with 1% Triton X-100 TBS plus Ca2+ and then eluted with Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C. Western Blotting—Proteins in Laemmli sample buffer were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Transblot; Bio-Rad). The sheets were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer of 5% fat-free milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline. The E tag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-ETA sheep polyclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL), diluted in blocking buffer, was applied for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, the signals were detected with chemiluminescence (ECL or ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Kinetics of ET Cleavage of hDsg1—To investigate the efficiency of hydrolysis of Dsg1 by ETs, we measured hDsg1 cleavage by ETs as a function of time. Purified recombinant ETA, ETB, and ETD used in these experiments showed a single band by Simply Blue staining of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). 1 μm hDsg1E was incubated with 12.5, 25, and 50 nm ETA or 25 and 50 nm of ETB and ETD. Both hDsg1E disappearance and product appearance were quantified over time from bands resolved by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE of a representative cleavage time course with 25 nm ETA is shown in Fig. 1B. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS denaturing buffer and subsequent heating to 100 °C, resolved on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Simply Blue. The substrate (upper band, arrow) is cleaved with time to the products (two lower bands, arrowhead and open arrow). Stained bands were quantified by densitometry, and the data were plotted as a function of time for analysis (Fig. 1C). Substrate consumption and product formation were fit to exponential curves defined by Equations 1 and 2 to obtain kobs, the observed rate constant for substrate consumption or product formation as follows,[S]=[S]0e-kobst(Eq. 1) [P]=[S]0-[S]0e-kobst(Eq. 2) where [S] represents the substrate concentration (as determined by densitometry) and [P] represents concentration of the products. Observed rate constants obtained from disappearance and formation data were in good agreement, as expected. For a given ET concentration, curves defined by first order kinetics (i.e. Equations 1 and 2) fit the data points well. This is best shown by the linear fit in Fig. 1D, in which the natural log of [S] is plotted against time. Measurements were made at three (for ETA) (Fig. 1D) or two (for ETB and ETD) ET concentrations. Values of kobs were directly proportional to ET concentrations, also consistent with pseudo-first-order reactions. The values for kcat/Km, which is a measure of enzyme efficiency, were obtained from the slopes of plots of kobsversus ET concentrations, according to Equation 3,kcatKm=kobs[E](Eq. 3) Values of 62,000, 26,000, and 19,000 m–1 s–1 were obtained for ETA, ETB, and ETD, respectively. These values indicate efficient cleavage of a large protein substrate. The Broad Spectrum Serine Protease Inhibitors DFP, DCI, and α2-Macroglobulin Do Not Effectively Inhibit the Enzymatic Activity of ETA—We tested the ability of small (DFP and DCI) and large (α2-macroglobulin) broad spectrum serine protease inhibitors to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ETA. There was minimal, if any, inhibition at the concentration tested, whereas both protease inhibitors did efficiently inhibit V8 protease at concentrations equivalent to those of ETA (Fig. 2), although an ∼10-fold larger excess of DCI did show inhibition (data not shown). These data suggest that the catalytic site of ETA may be difficult to access in the proper alignment by some serine protease inhibitors or is relatively inactive in the absence of its proper substrate. hDsg1 EC Domains That Are Upstream, but Not Downstream, of the Cleavage Site Are Critical for Its Hydrolysis by ETA—Previously, we have shown that the ability of ETs to cleave Dsg1 is not simply dependent on the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site but is dependent on the calcium-stabilized conformation of Dsg1 (21Hanakawa Y. Selwood T. Woo D. Lin C. Schechter N.M. Stanley J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that domains distant from the site of hydrolysis might influence the enzymatic efficiency of ETA. Because desmogleins have five well defined EC domains whose relationship to each other is stabilized by calcium, we first determined whether all of these domains were necessary for cleavage by testing truncated molecules of hDsg1E for their susceptibility to hydrolysis by ETA (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicated that EC5 is not necessary for cleavage. Loss of EC1 decreases the efficiency of cleavage, yet the truncated molecule is still cleaved. Loss of EC1-EC2 prevents cleavage (Fig. 3B). After incubation with ETA, the EC1–EC3 domain can no longer be detected with anti-E tag by Western blotting (Fig. 3B), presumably because of cleavage of the E tag, which is too small to detect on these gels. To confirm the cleavage of EC1–EC3, a GST tag was added after the E tag on the carboxyl-terminal end. Incubation of this new substrate, EC1–3EGST, with ETA clearly showed cleavage with the product now detectable (Fig. 3C). In this construct, the combination E and GST tag was added to hDsg1 only 4 amino acids after the cleavage site. Further analysis indicates that if these 4 amino acids were truncated, the construct was no longer susceptible to cleavage. These data show that cleavage by ETA is not dependent on intact domains EC4 and EC5. Because truncations may result in a generally unstable overall structure, we used domain swapping between hDsg1E and hDsg3 to further test which domains in Dsg1 are critical (Fig. 4). These data suggest that sequences in hDsg1 between 213 and 450 are probably sufficient for cleavage. This conclusion was confirmed by insertion of just these sequences from Dsg1 into Dsg3 (Fig. 5). In fact, finer analysis indicated that only amino acids 214–398 from the EC2-EC3 domain of Dsg1, inserted into Dsg3, were sufficient for cleavage (data not shown). Although sufficient in the overall structure of Dsg3, these amino acids must be in the proper overall conformation of a desmoglein, because when inserted into E-cadherin, they could no longer be hydrolyzed by ETA (Fig. 5B). 5 Amino Acids 110 Residues Upstream of the Cleavage Site in Dsg1 Are Necessary for Cleavage—To further define which particular amino acids in the EC2-EC3 region of hDsg1 are critical for cleavage, we used cDsg1 because it is highly homologous to human and mouse Dsg1 and shares identical amino acids around the cleavage site (Fig. 6A) yet is not hydrolyzed by ETA (Fig. 6, C and D). Swapping sequences of hDsg1 into cDsg1 near the EC2-EC3 junction allowed its cleavage (Fig. 6, C and E). We then determined which amino acids in this junction of cDsg1 were different from those in hDsg1 and mouse Dsg1, which, like hDsg1, is cleaved by ETs (12Hanakawa Y. Schechter N.M. Lin C. Garza L.

Cysteine residues were introduced at 44 positions from the end of S5 (Glu515) to the beginning of S6 (Ala560). Covalent modification by positively charged MTSET applied from the external medium significantly inhibited whole cell currents at 15/44 positions. Strongest inhibition was observed in the S5-linker to pore region (L520C, G521C, and E522C) with either MTSET or MTSES suggesting that these residues were accessible from the external medium. In contrast, the pattern of covalent modification by MTSET for residues between Pro527 and Ile541 was compatible with the presence of a α-helix. The absence of modification by the negatively charged MTSES in that region suggests that the pore region has been optimized to favor the entrance of positively charged ions. Cysteine mutants at positions -1, 0, +1, +2 around Asp542 (high Ca2+ affinity site) were non-functional. Whole cell currents of cysteine mutants at +4 and +5 positions were however covalently inhibited by external MTSET and MTSES.

The TRP ion channels form a large class of cationic channels that are related to the product of the Drosophila TRP gene. TRP channels share a similar predicted topology of six transmembrane segments in which the amino acids that link the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains line the pore region (1Clapham D.E.

The TRPC and TRPV proteins have 2-4 N-terminal ankyrin domains suggesting that these proteins are coupled to the spectrin-based membrane cytoskeleton. TRP channels vary significantly in their biophysical properties and gating mechanisms. In contrast to other members of the TRP family, TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels show strong inward rectification, exhibit anomalous mole-fraction effect, are activated by low [Ca2+]i and inactivated by higher [Ca2+]i (6Hoenderop J.G.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C665-C672Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that is comparable to the Kd of ≈1 μm for voltage-dependent CaV channels (9Parent L. Gopalakrishnan M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1801-1813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A single residue in the S5-S6 linker (Asp542) was found to account for the high Ca2+ affinity of ECaC-TRPV5 (7Jean K. Bernatchez G. Klein H. Garneau L. Sauvé R. Parent L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C665-C672Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The absence of the aspartate residue at the equivalent position in the pore region of TRPV1-4 channels might explain, together with the presence of a lysine residue, the ≈20-fold lower Ca2+ selectivity of TRPV1-4 channels (10Voets T. Prenen J. Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33704-33710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels can also form homo- and heterotetramers suggesting that they are structurally and functionally related (11Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). There is currently very little structural data available on the pore architecture of Ca2+-selective TRP channels. It is possible that the four aspartate residues form an extracellular ion binding site as it has been shown for the Glu71/Asp80 residues in the KscA crystal structure (12Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that the four aspartate residues project in the pore lumen as it has been suggested with the four EEEE-residues locus that accounts for the channel high Ca2+-affinity (13Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) of Ca2+-selective CaV1.2 channels. In two landmark studies, cysteine mutation of each of the four EEEE residues locus of the CaV1.2 channel rendered the channel susceptible to irreversible inhibition by external sulfhydryl modifiers, indicating that the side chain was covalently modified by the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) 1The abbreviations used are: MTS, methanethiosulfonate; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate. 1The abbreviations used are: MTS, methanethiosulfonate; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl)-methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSET, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate. reagent (14Wu X.S.

Cysteine substitutions at positions immediately adjacent to the EEEE locus (±1 positions) were also generally susceptible to sulfhydryl modification. Sulfhydryl modifiers had lesser effects on channels substituted one position further from the EEEE locus (±2 positions). These results suggested that the carboxylate-bearing side chains of the high affinity EEEE locus and their immediate neighbors were accessible from the water-filled extracellular medium in CaV1.2 channels. To examine the topology of the pore region and the external vestibule in TRPV channels, we undertook a systematic analysis of pore residues accessibility using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (16Simoes M. Garneau L. Klein H. Banderali U. Hobeila F. Roux B. Parent L. Sauve R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their covalent modifications by externally applied membrane-impermeant methanethiosulfonate compounds of different charge and cross-section were measured. Based on the reactivity/accessibility to external sulfhydryl reagents, we report that some of the structural features of the bacterial KcsA channel, namely the coiled region in the S5-pore linker (turret) and the pore α-helix of 15 residues that follows the turret and precedes the selectivity filter, are conserved in TRPV5 channels. Furthermore, our results show that Thr528, Ser532, Glu535, and Thr539 in the pore helix region are selectively accessible to positive MTS reagents from the external medium suggesting that they constitute part of the external vestibule in ECaC-TRPV5. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Rabbit ECaC-TRPV5—The cDNAs coding for the wild-type ECaC-TRPV5 (GenBank™ AJ133128) (17Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A W Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F van O.C.

ECaC-TRPV5 and CaT2-TRPV5 were subcloned into the pT7TS vector (generously provided by Dr. Paul A. Krieg, University of Texas) using exonuclease III (19Kaluz S. Kolble K. Reid K.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4369-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for optimal expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Point mutations in ECaC-TRPV5 were performed with 39-mer synthetic oligos using the QuickChange™ XL-mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The C556S channel was used as a template for all cysteine mutations (see “Results”), and oligos were carefully designed to preserve that mutation. The nucleotide sequence of the S5-S6 linker including the background C556S mutation (over 600 bp) was bi-directionally analyzed using automatic sequencing by BioST (Lachine, Qué). DNA constructs were linearized at the 3′-end by BamHI digestion. Run-off transcripts were prepared using methylated cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G and T7 RNA polymerase with the mMessage mMachine® transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Expression of CaT2-TRPV5 Wild Type, ECaC-TRPV5 Wild Type, and Mutants in Xenopus Oocytes—Female Xenopus laevis clawed frog (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were anesthetized by immersion in 0.1% tricaine or MS-222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, Sigma) for 15 min before surgery as detailed before (7Jean K.

With only 0.46 ng of RNA, large whole cell inwardly rectifying currents (≈-50 μA) were routinely recorded with Li+ as the charge carrier (see below) for the wild-type channel less than 24 h after injection. ECaC-injected oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in a calcium-free and serum-free Barth's solution for 24-48 h before experiments. Whole Cell Recordings—Whole cell currents were measured at room temperature with a two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (OC-725, Warner Instruments) as described before (7Jean K. Bernatchez G. Klein H. Garneau L. Sauvé R. Parent L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C665-C672Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Voltage and current electrodes (0.1-0.2 MΩ tip resistance) were filled with 3 m KCl; 1 mm EGTA; 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Instantaneous current-voltage relationships were measured using voltage ramps from +80 to -150 mV at a rate of 0.575 mV/ms from a holding potential of -50 mV. Whole cell current-voltage curves (I-V) were measured under control conditions in the presence of the nominally calcium-free Li+ solution (in mm): 120 LiOH; 5 EGTA; 2 KOH; 20 HEPES titrated to pH 7.35 with methane sulfonic acid. Ca2+-free solutions were used since ECaC-TRPV5 undergoes a near-irreversible inactivation in response to a steady Ca2+ influx over a 5-10-min period (7Jean K. Bernatchez G. Klein H. Garneau L.

Taking into account the volume of the experimental bath and the dead volume in the perfusion line, the bath solution was completely exchanged within the first 30 s of perfusion. PClamp software Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for on-line data acquisition and analysis. Unless stated otherwise, data were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass filtered at 5 kHz using the amplifier built-in filter. The 44 cysteine mutants were systematically tested for inward rectification and high Ca2+ affinity to ensure that the introduction of cysteine residues did not distort the channel structure. Whole cell peak currents measured at -150 mV varied from -10 to -30 μA for most cysteine mutants (see Table I for data on the pore helix region). Out of the 44 mutants tested, only 14 cysteine mutations failed to express whole cell currents significantly larger than non-injected oocytes. Altogether, the non-functional mutants, E515C, N518C, N519C, F523C, F531C, F534C, L536C, I541C, D542C, G543C, P544C, L551C, P552C, and Y555C were tested in a minimum of 3 different series of oocyte injections over a 1-year period using RNA concentrations 10-times higher than for the wild-type channel for culture periods of 2-4 days. In addition, non-functional mutants were incubated for periods up to 3 h with 5 mm dithiothreitol prior to experiments to reduce eventual intradisulfide bonds.Table ICovalent modification of ECaC-TRPV5 wild-type and mutants in the pore helix region Biophysical properties and covalent modification of wild-type TRPV5 channels and mutants in the putative pore helix region. Most mutant channels displayed the strong inward rectification of wild-type TRPV5 channels. Peak currents were measured in the presence of the nominally Ca2+-free Li+ solution. The percentage of control currents remaining after external MTS modification with 5 mm reagent was computed after washout of the unreacted reagent (see “Materials and Methods”). A value of 100 means there was no effect. Mutant channels preserved the high-Ca2+ affinity as shown by the percentage of whole cell currents measured after exposure to 1 μm free-Ca2+.

https://openalex.org/W2090792042,"Members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily play pivotal roles in cell migration, differentiation, adhesion, pattern formation, and apoptosis. The family of Smad proteins acts as intracellular signal transducers of TGF-β and related peptides. Smad4, a common mediator Smad (co-Smad), performs a central role in transmitting signals from TGF-β, BMP, and activins. Schistosoma mansoni receptor-regulated Smad1 and SmSmad2 were previously identified and shown to act in TGF-β signaling. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a Smad4 homologue from S. mansoni and provide details about its role in mediation and down-regulation of TGF-β signaling in schistosomes. In order to identify the schistosome co-Smad, we designed degenerate primers based on the sequence of the conserved MH1/MH2 domains of Smad4 proteins, which were used in PCR to amplify a 137-bp PCR product. A S. mansoni adult worm pair cDNA library was screened resulting in the isolation of a cDNA clone that encodes a 738 amino acid protein (SmSmad4). SmSmad4 was shown to interact with schistosome R-Smads (SmSmad1 and SmSmad2) in vivo and in vitro. The interaction with SmSmad2 was dependent on the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SmSmad2. In addition, several potential phosphorylation sites for Erk1/2 kinases were identified in the SmSmad4 linker region and shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by an active mutant of mammalian Erk2. Furthermore, Erk-mediated phosphorylation of SmSmad4 decreased its interaction with the receptor-activated form of SmSmad2, in vitro. SmSmad4 was shown to complement a human Smad4 deficiency through the restoration of TGF-β-responsiveness in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells.

Helminths of the genus Schistosoma are the causative agents of schistosomiasis, an endemic tropical disease affecting about 200 million people worldwide, which is a major cause of morbidity (www.who.int/tdr/diseases/schisto/diseaseinfo.htm). It is generally thought that the schistosome receives host signals that are utilized in parasite development. Thus, host-parasite interactions are likely to have co-evolved and to be selective for both the intermediate and the definitive host (1Frandsen F. J. Helminthol. 1979; 53: 321-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 2Smithers S.R. Doenhoff M. Cohen S.M. Warren K.S. Immunology of Parasitic Infections. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1982: 527-607Google Scholar). In the definitive vertebrate host, the parasite migrates from the site of infection to the final destination in a complex journey that proceeds with concomitant development and maturation, likely guided by host factors (3Davies J.S. McKerrow J.H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 1277-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Salzet M. Capron A. Stefano G.B. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, female worm sexual maturation and subsequent egg production, the major cause of the pathological consequences of schistosomiasis, is induced by mating with male worms. Female sexual development is likely to be stimulated by a set of chemical and/or mechanical signals from the male (5LoVerde P.T. J. Parasitol. 2002; 88: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, an investigation of signal transduction pathways in schistosomes may permit us to understand the mechanisms by which the parasite receives and responds both to self- and to host-derived signals. Such studies will yield insights into the host-parasite relationship and male-induced female maturation. Prior investigations identified growth factor receptors and orthologues of components of signaling pathways in schistosomes (6Ramachandran H. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Mol. Biochem.

Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The intracellular signal transmission in TGF-β pathway is initiated through ligand-induced formation and activation of a heteromeric receptor complex of type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors located at the cell surface. This process involves the binding of a TGF-β ligand to the constitutively phosphorylated type II kinase receptor, which triggers the interaction with and phosphorylation and activation of the corresponding type I receptor (16Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). The activated receptor complex in turn relays the signal to the downstream member, the receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad). Activation of R-Smads occurs via direct phosphorylation of the two most C-terminal serine residues ((T/S)SXS motif) by the specific type I receptor (17Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). R-Smads are recruited to different activated receptor complexes, depending on the activating ligand. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are activated and phosphorylated by receptors of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) subfamily (18Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J.

Upon activation by the receptor complex, R-Smad forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with a common Smad (co-Smad). The co-Smad, called Smad4 in vertebrates, or Medea in Drosophila, acts as a shared partner for both BMP-specific and TGF-β/activins-specific R-Smads (24Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 25Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Smad4 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is deleted or mutated in pancreatic carcinomas, and is also known as DPC4 (deleted in pancreatic carcinoma locus 4) (26Hahn S.A. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Schutte M. Rozenblum E. Seymour A.B. Weinstein C.L. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 490-494PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Although Smad4 shares many sequence similarities with R-Smads, it lacks the phosphorylation signature located at the C-terminal end of the MH2 domain of R-Smads and thus neither associates with the receptor complex nor acts as a substrate for receptor phosphorylation (17Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The newly formed Smad4/R-Smad complex then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to promoter sequences and modulates the transcription of a subset of responsive genes required to exert the specific TGF-β ligand effect (29Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 30Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the receptor complex and the corresponding R-Smad, signal specificity is determined by the nuclear partner that binds and directs Smad4/R-Smad complex to the target gene(s). Smad proteins are considered crucial members in the TGF-β signaling since they receive the signal from the activated receptor complex at the cell surface and relay it to the nucleus where the specific outcome/phenotype will be orchestrated. Structurally, R-Smads and co-Smad consist of 2 conserved domains, located at the N and C termini of the proteins, called Mad homology domains 1 and 2 (MH1 and MH2), respectively, linked by a highly variable, proline-rich linker region (31Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MH1 domain mediates DNA binding (32Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol.

The linker region of R-Smads contains PX(S/T)P phosphorylation motif(s), the consensus phosphorylation site for the Ras-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2 (44Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Erk phosphorylation results in blocking the nuclear accumulation of R-Smads and consequently down-regulating TGF-β signaling (45Calonge M.J. Massague J. J. Biol.

The N-terminal end of the linker region also contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), which mediates the nuclear export of Smad4. The C terminus of the linker region of Smad4 contains a proline-rich transcription activation domain (Smad4 activation domain; SAD) that is not only necessary but also sufficient to activate maximal Smad-dependent transcriptional responses (35de Caestecker M.P.

Recent studies showed that schistosomes contain several members of the TGF-β pathway. A TGF-β type I receptor homologue, (SmRK1 and called SmTβR-I thereafter) was the first member to be identified and shown to be localized to the surface of the parasite (8Davies S.J. Shoemaker C.B. Pearce E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11234-11240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The identification of the schistosome type I receptor spurred the search for other members of TGF-β pathways in the parasite S. mansoni, which resulted in the identification of 2 members of R-Smad subfamily, SmSmad1 (10Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and SmSmad2 (10Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SmSmad2 was shown to interact with and act downstream of SmTβR-I, where it serves as a substrate for receptor phosphorylation and translocates into the nucleus of mammalian cells after induction with human TGF-β (10Beall M.J. McGonigle S. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol.

The above data suggest the presence of a common Smad homologue in schistosomes and underscores the significance of pursuing the search for SmSmad4. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of SmSmad4, the common Smad homologue of S. mansoni, and we demonstrate its interaction with schistosome R-Smads. Identification and Isolation of SmSmad4 cDNA—Protein sequences of Smad4 homologues were aligned using Pileup (Genetics Computer Group, GCG-Wisconsin Package, version 9.1) to define areas of high conservation in the MH1 and MH2 domains. Degenerate primers were synthesized, based on the amino acid sequence of the homologous regions, and were employed in different combinations in PCR using S. mansoni adult worm pair cDNA. One primer pair spanning a region in the MH1 domain (Fig. 1A) amplified a 137-bp PCR product, DPC4/F3 and R4 (5′-CCNCAYGTNRTNTAYGCNMGNHTNTGGMGNTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CANACNCKYTCRTARTGRTANGGRTT-3′, respectively). Based on the DNA sequence of the 137-bp product, two specific primers (DPC-fwd and rev; bp 412-435 as forward primer and the complementary sequence of bp 467-489 as reverse primer, respectively), were designed downstream of F3 and R4 primer sequences, amplified a 78-bp-specific cDNA product. The later DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using MegaPrime random priming labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and used to screen 400,000 plaques from a non-amplified S. mansoni adult worm pair λ-ZapII cDNA library.Fig. 1Multiple sequence alignment of SmSmad4 and other Smad4 homologues from different species.

Sequence analysis of the SmSmad4 cDNA revealed the presence of a unique BglII site 742-bp downstream of the vector EcoRI cloning site. A 5′-primer (bp 47-72), in which the C49 was replaced by an A creating an EcoRI site upstream of the start ATG codon, was used as a forward primer along with a reverse primer (complementary sequence of bp 752-774) to amplify a 728-bp product. The PCR product was cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), sequenced to confirm the absence of any PCR-generated errors, digested with EcoRI and BglII and recloned into the parental pSmSmad4-BlueScript-SK+ vector to generate a modified version of the cDNA clone in which the sequence upstream of the start ATG codon was removed and an EcoRI site was inserted just before and in-frame with the start codon. The modified vector, pSmSmad4-cod-BlueScript-SK+, was digested with EcoRI and XhoI to yield a SmSmad4 DNA fragment suitable for cloning in several vectors including pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences; digested with EcoRI-XhoI), pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs; digested with EcoRI-SalI) for prokaryotic expression; pADGAL4-2.1 (GAL4-activation domain vector, Stratagene; digested with EcoRI-XhoI), pBDGAL4-cam (GAL4-DNA binding domain vector, Stratagene; digested with EcoRI-SalI) for yeast two-hybrid analysis, pcDNA3.1-His (Invitrogen; digested with EcoRI-XhoI) for expression in mammalian cells, and pCITE-4a (Novagen; digested with EcoRI-XhoI) for in vitro transcription/translation (see Table S1, online Supplemental Data). Production of Anti-SmSmad4-specific Antisera—In addition to the full-length constructs, a DNA fragment encoding the SmSmad4-linker region (bp 401-1183; 261 amino acids) was also amplified, cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO, sequenced and cloned in pMAL-c2x vector for expression of a fusion protein that shares no homology to other schistosome Smad proteins. MBP-SmSmad4-Linker fusion protein was used to immunize a New Zealand rabbit and BALB/c mice. A dose of 200 μg of the fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant was used to immunize the rabbit as a primary dose and 200 μg in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were used for 2 booster doses at 4-week intervals. An activating dose (200 μg in 1× phosphate-buffered saline) was used 7 days prior to sacrificing the animal. Mice were immunized with the same reagents following same time frame except 20 μg/animal were used for each dose. Sera were titered by ELISA and IgG fractions were affinity-purified over protein A-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified. Preimmune rabbit and mice sera were processed similarly to provide reagents for negative controls. Affinity-purified IgG was used for immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses. Western Blotting and Immunofluorescence—Protein extracts were prepared from S. mansoni adult worm pairs as previously described (11Osman A. Niles E.G. LoVerde P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 20 μg were loaded per lane on 4-12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and size-separated. SDS gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore), and the blots were probed with 0.75 μg/ml of either preimmune IgG or anti-Smad4-linker IgG. Biotinylated secondary antibody reagents (goat antirabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG, 0.75 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used to probe the reactive primary antibodies and the immune complexes were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) and alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (NBT/BCIP Vector kit, Vector Laboratories). Affinity-purified IgG (5 μg/ml) was also used to localize the native SmSmad4 in adult worm cryosections, probed with biotinylated secondary antibody reagents (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) and detected with AlexaFluor 647-conjugated streptavidin (5 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.). AlexaFluor 647 is a far-red fluorochrome that emits at a maximum wavelength of 647 nm. At this wavelength, auto-fluorescence produced by phenolic compounds in schistosome sections would not be visualized. Probed sections were evaluated using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope equipped with Krypton-Argon laser and 522 nm and 680 nm filters. RT-PCR Analysis—Analysis of SmSmad4 mRNA levels in different developmental stages was performed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from different developmental stages, representing growth in both mammalian and molluscan hosts, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). All RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNaseI (RQ1 DNase; Promega) and reverse transcribed using a random hexamer, and SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II (SSRTaseII; Invitrogen) following the vendor's recommended conditions. Reverse-transcribed cDNA samples were used as templates in PCR reactions using specific primer pairs. PCR reactions were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels, ethidium bromide-stained, and analyzed using a gel-documentation system (GelDoc1000; Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (version 4.2.3; Bio-Rad). Control PCR reactions using reverse transcription reaction mix lacking SSRTaseII were also performed to evaluate the efficiency of DNase treatment. Specific primers for S. mansoni α-tubulin gene (GenBank™ accession no.: M80214; bp 424-444 and the complementary sequence of bp 777-801 as forward and reverse primers, respectively, yielding a 378-bp PCR product) were used to amplify a PCR product that served as a constitutively transcribed control (50Webster P.J. Seta K.A. Chung S.C. Mansour T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This primer pair amplifies a DNA fragment of about 410 bp when S. mansoni genomic DNA is used as a template. Therefore, in addition to its role as an amplification control to which PCR products for other genes were compared, α-tubulin served also as an additional control to assess the efficiency of DNase treatment. In order to compare SmSmad4 mRNA levels in different developmental stages with those of S. mansoni R-Smads, specific primer pairs representing C-terminal end of SmSmad4 (bp 1866-1888 and the complementary sequence of bp 2240-2269 as forward and reverse primers, respectively, yielding a 404-bp PCR product), linker region of SmSmad1 (GenBank™ accession no. AF215933; bp 454-476 and the complementary sequence of bp 761-780 as forward and reverse primers, respectively, yielding a 339-bp PCR product) and part of the MH2 domain of SmSmad2 (GenBank™ accession no. AF232025; bp 1614-1626 and the complementary sequence of bp 1902-1926 as forward and reverse primers, respectively, yielding a 313-bp PCR product) were used to amplify the specific PCR products which were separated by electrophoresis and processed as described above. Due to differences in abundance of cDNA species included in this assay, amounts of input template were varied according to the stage and/or the gene under study. Also, in order to ensure that the amplification products were analyzed in the exponential phase and below saturation limits (PCR plateau), the number of PCR cycles was also varied. 26 cycles were used for α-tubulin, 27 cycles for SmSmad4 and SmSmad2 while SmSmad1 was cycled for 29 times. All variables were considered and compensated for in data analysis. SmSmad4 Interactions with Schistosome R-Smads—Similar to the situation in higher eukaryotes, schistosome Smad4 was expected to interact with SmSmad1 and SmSmad2. In order to study these interaction patterns, a series of expression vectors (prokaryotic, yeast, and in vitro transcription/translation) of SmSmad4, SmSmad2, SmSmad1, and SmTβR-I were constructed and used. (i) Vectors—Table S1 (see online Supplemental Data) lists the plasmid vectors, insert description, and the interaction assay(s) in which they were used. SmSmad4 was e"

We examined how cells transduce the TGFβ signal from the cell surface to the gadd45β genomic locus and describe how GADD45β contributes to TGFβ biology. Following an alignment of gadd45β genomic sequences from multiple organisms, we discovered a novel TGFβ-responsive enhancer encompassing the third intron of the gadd45β gene. Using three different experimental approaches, we found that SMAD3 and SMAD4, but not SMAD2, mediate transcription from this enhancer. Three lines of evidence support our conclusions. First, overexpression of SMAD3 and SMAD4 activated the transcriptional activity from this enhancer. Second, silencing of SMAD protein levels using short interfering RNAs revealed that TGFβ-induced activation of the endogenous gadd45β gene required SMAD3 and SMAD4 but not SMAD2. In contrast, we found that the regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I depended upon all three SMAD proteins. Last, SMAD3 and SMAD4 reconstitution in SMAD-deficient cancer cells restored TGFβ induction of gadd45β. Finally, we assessed the function of GADD45β within the TGFβ response and found that GADD45β-deficient cells arrested in G2 following TGFβ treatment. These data support a role for SMAD3 and SMAD4 in activating gadd45β through its third intron to facilitate G2 progression following TGFβ treatment.

Normal epithelial cells are in constant communication with their surrounding environment, largely through the detection, interpretation, and response to extracellular signaling molecules. The TGFβ 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorHMEChuman mammary epithelial cell(s)siRNAshort interfering RNAsiScrscrambled siRNAMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPAI1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. superfamily of growth factors comprises 42 such signaling molecules in humans, many of which play fundamental roles in development and adult tissue homeostasis. The epithelial response to members of this family is highly varied and includes such diverse cellular processes as proliferation, movement, differentiation, and apoptosis. Indeed, cells harboring mutations within the signal transduction proteins or the TGFβ target genes either fail to respond or respond inappropriately to the TGFβ signal, often leading to developmental problems, oncogenesis, fibrotic disease, metastasis, and autoimmune disorders. Greater understanding of how cells interpret the TGFβ signal will facilitate the prevention, detection, and treatment of various human diseases. transforming growth factor human mammary epithelial cell(s) short interfering RNA scrambled siRNA 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The central elements of TGFβ signal transduction are now known (1Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 2Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4836) Google Scholar). TGFβ activates the serine/threonine kinase activity of a multimeric receptor complex. Activation of this complex initiates a cascade of intracellular events that culminate in altered gene expression. The SMAD proteins form the foundation of this signaling network, since they are the only proteins directly phosphorylated by the receptor complex. However, these transcription factors are by no means sufficient to impart a TGFβ response. To specifically target a gene for transcriptional regulation, the SMADs require assistance by accessory factors. Consequently, the presence and activity of these accessory factors is are important to the TGFβ transcriptional program as are the SMAD proteins. By designing the system in such a way, cell-specific responses to TGFβ can be achieved. Further, the logic of the TGFβ signaling network explains how the cell integrates multiple signals to generate highly specific phenotypic responses. In an attempt to better understand how TGFβ regulates gene transcription and how those gene products contribute to TGFβ biology, we have partially defined the TGFβ transcriptional profile in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). cDNA microarray expression analysis of TGFβ-treated HMEC revealed a set of genes involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. One of these genes, gadd45β/hMyD118, is regulated by TGFβ in multiple cell types, thus suggesting that this gene is of central importance to the TGFβ response. GADD45β and two similar small acidic nuclear proteins, GADD45α and GADD45γ, make up the GADD45 family (3Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 527-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All three proteins regulate diverse cellular mechanisms including cell growth, DNA repair, differentiation, and apoptosis, four phenotypes that are also controlled by TGFβ signaling. Aside from sequence similarity, these genes share transcriptional regulation by DNA damage insult and growth factors. gadd45β is, however, the only member of this family regulated by TGFβ (4Zhang W.

Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). gadd45β was first discovered as a transcript rapidly induced by either TGFβ treatment or the onset of terminal differentiation in M1 murine myeloid cells (6Selvakumaran M.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies employing antisense-mediated silencing established GADD45β as an important regulator of the G2/M checkpoint following genotoxic stress (8Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and apoptosis during M1 myeloid cell terminal differentiation (6Selvakumaran M. Lin H.K. Sjin R.T.

Human GADD45β, which was first identified in a complex containing the p38-activating kinase MTK1 (MEKK4), is now a well established regulator of p38 activity and consequently p38-regulated biology (5Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Takekawa M. Saito H.

TGFβ activates p38 kinase activity and induces apoptosis in normal murine hepatocytes, but not in hepatocytes derived from gadd45β knockout mice (11Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G.

An initial characterization of the molecular mechanism by which TGFβ induces gadd45β transcription has recently been reported. First, reconstitution of SMAD4 expression in SMAD4-null pancreatic cell lines restored gadd45β induction by TGFβ (5Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The nature of the TGFβ-SMAD-gadd45β link appears to be direct; exogenously expressed SMAD2 and SMAD4 or SMAD3 and SMAD4 induce gadd45β proximal promoter activity 3–4-fold (11Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the relative importance and function of each SMAD protein to the transcriptional activation of the endogenous gadd45β gene is not known. Utilizing RNA interference and reconstitution of SMAD3 and SMAD4 protein expression in SMAD-deficient cell lines, we exclude SMAD2 and include SMAD3 and SMAD4 as transcription factors involved in the TGFβ induction of gadd45β. Additionally, through a genomics-based approach, we identified a SMAD-dependent TGFβ-responsive enhancer encompassing the third intron of gadd45β. The importance of this enhancer is indicated by a 3-fold greater transcriptional induction following TGFβ treatment than transcriptional effects mediated by 5′ promoter sequences. Finally, using a cell system that does not undergo TGFβ-induced apoptosis but does respond to TGFβ by gadd45β transcriptional induction, we establish an apoptosis-independent role for GADD45β as an important mediator of G2/M progression following TGFβ treatment. Cell Culture and Drug Treatments—The following cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.0 μml-glutamine, 1.0 μm sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin and split every third day or at 80% confluence: Mv1Lu (CCL64), HaCaT, HeLa, 293, and 10T1/2. HT29 adenocarcinoma colon cells were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The HepG2 and JAR cell lines were cultured in minimal essential medium and RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. We obtained all of the cell lines from ATCC except for the HaCaT immortalized keratinocyte cell line, which was a kind gift from D. Grossman (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT), the Mv1Lu cells were a kind gift from D. Ayer (University of Utah), and the JAR cells were a kind gift from E. Adashi (University of Utah). Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in complete mammary epithelial growth medium. HMEC were seeded at passage 7 or 8 and harvested at no greater than 80% confluence for all experiments. For treatments with TGFβ (isoform type 1; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), we found little to no difference with respect to gene transcription if the cells had been previously serum-starved. The vehicle control for TGFβ comprised 4 mm HCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cyclohexamide and actinomycin D (Calbiochem) were used at 10 and 5 μg/ml, respectively, and treated as described in Fig. 2. RNA Interference—siRNAs were designed to specifically target either smad2, smad3, or smad4 in accordance with the guidelines developed by Tuschl et al. (12Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Because the sequence of mink smad2 and smad3 cDNAs is unknown, siRNAs were designed against the human sequences. The human-designed smad2 and smad3 siRNAs efficiently and specifically silenced mink SMAD2 and SMAD3 protein expression, thus indicating that these sequences are conserved in mink. We designed the smad4 siRNA-A and siRNA-B against the mink sequence, and consequently they do not silence human smad4 (data not shown). The control siRNA (scrambled siRNA; siScr) specifically recognizes human smad4 and thus does not affect mink SMAD2, SMAD3, or SMAD4 expression. The sequences of the chemically synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified RNA oligomers are as follows (sense strand shown): Smad2 5′-UCUUUGUGCAGAGCCCCAAtt; Smad3 5′-ACCUAUCCCCGAAUCCGAUtt; Smad4-A 5′-GGACGAAUAUGUUCAUGACtt; Smad4-B 5′-UUGGAUUCUUUAAUAACAGtt; siScr 5′-GGAUGAAUAUGUGCAUGACtt. To silence gadd45β expression, three siRNAs were designed (sense strand shown): siGadd45β-A (5′-GUU GAU GAA UGU GGA CCC Att), siGadd45β-B (AUC CAC UUC ACG CUC AUC Ctt), and siGadd45β-C (CUU GGU UGG UCC UUG UCU Gtt). Of these three siRNAs, siGadd45β-A was the most efficacious and was used to generate the data seen in Fig. 8. All RNA oligomers were reconstituted and annealed following the protocol of Tuschl et al. (12Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Mv1Lu cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection and transfected at 70% confluence. All siRNAs were transfected using 18 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000/10-cm2 plate according to manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen). For the SMAD silencing experiments, total RNA or protein was isolated 40–48 h after transfection. In time course experiments, we found that maximal silencing occurred 36 h after transfection for all three SMAD proteins (data not shown). For Gadd45β silencing, 3 h after the start of Gadd45β siRNA transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or TGFβ for an additional 2 h prior to RNA isolation or 12 h prior to flow cytometry. Plasmids and Genomic Alignments—We electronically cloned the human, murine, and rat gadd45β genomic loci from publicly available sequence databases. Approximately 8 kb of the genomic loci, starting at 5000 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, were aligned using the MAVID alignment algorithm (13Bray N. Pachter L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3525-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Bray N. Dubchak I. Pachter L. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The portion of this piece of genomic DNA showing conservation among all three species is shown in Fig. 7A. The G45β-1 (–1470 bp, +362 bp), G45β-2 (–972 bp, +362 bp), G45β-3 (–476 bp, +362 bp), G45β-A (–1535 bp, –1042 bp), G45β-B (–572 bp, –79 bp), and G45β-C (+941 bp, +1428 bp) reporter constructs were created as follows. The indicated region of the human gadd45β genomic locus was PCR-amplified from HMEC genomic DNA and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). These DNAs were then subcloned into pGL3basic, sequence-verified, and utilized in subsequent dual luciferase assays. J. Massague generously provided the 3TPLux reporter construct (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). The murine Smad7 cDNA (generously provided by R. Derynk, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1. Similarly, the FLAG-tagged Smad expression vectors used in the reporter experiments were created by subcloning the cDNAs from constructs provided by D. Satterwhite into pCMV2-FLAG (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). For luciferase assays, all reporters were co-transfected with an SV40-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid that was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. For retroviral infections, we PCR-amplified the smad3 or smad4 open reading frames from HMEC cDNA and then cloned them into the pBabe retroviral vector. D. Ayer generously provided the GFP-pBabe vector (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Luciferase Assays—Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect HaCaT cells as instructed by the manufacturer. We seeded cells at a density of 80,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected them the next day. Transfections were performed using 0.6 μg of DNA (including either 0.1 μg of normalization vector and 0.5 μg of reporter vector or 0.1 μg of normalization vector, 0.2 μg of reporter vector, and 0.3 μg of expression vector) and harvested 20 h after the start of transfection. For TGFβ treatment, medium containing either TGFβ (200 pm) or an equal volume of vehicle was added to cells 3 h after the start of transfection. Luciferase values were analyzed using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Dividing the firefly luciferase activity from each well by the Renilla luciferase activity from the same well normalized transfection efficiencies. Data in each experiment are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicates from a representative experiment. All experiments were performed at least three times, producing qualitatively similar results. Retroviral Transduction—Expression of the GFP, SMAD3, or SMAD4 retroviral constructs was verified by Western blot in a transient assay prior to virus production. To produce the retrovirus, Phoenix helper cells were seeded in 60-mm2 plates 24 h prior to transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000. 24 h after transfection began, we split the cells 1:3 to 10-cm2 plates. 48 h after the cells had been split, virus-containing medium was removed from the Phoenix cells, filtered (0.22 μm; low protein binding filter), and added to a 6-well plate containing the HT29 or JAR target cells (at 60% confluence). We added Polybrene (4 μg/ml) to the virus immediately before transduction of the target cells to facilitate infection. 24 h after infection, the target cells were split to 10-cm2 plates and placed under selection with 750 ng/ml puromycin for 10 days. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Trizol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate the total RNA from the HT29 and JAR retroviral polyclonal stables according to the manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler instrument and software, version 3.5 (Roche Applied Science). Intron-spanning primers (Gadd45β, forward (5′-CGGTGGAGGAGCTTTTGGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CACCCGCACGATGTTGATGT-3′); 18 S rRNA, forward (5′-GGTGAAATTCTTGGACCGGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GACTTTGGTTTCCCGGAAGC-3′)) were designed to amplify 200-bp products in order to minimize contamination from genomic DNA. PCR was performed in duplicate (or triplicate for 18 S rRNA) with a master mix consisting of cDNA template, buffer (500 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm MgCl2), dNTPs (2 mm), TaqStart antibody (Clontech), Biolase DNA polymerase (Bioline), gene-specific forward and reverse primers (10 μm), and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The PCR conditions are as follows: 35 cycles of amplification with 1-s denaturation at 95 °C and 5-s annealing at 57 °C for Gadd45β and 53 °C for 18 S rRNA. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment. We determined the copy number by comparing gene amplification with the amplification of standard samples that contained 103 to 107 copies of the gene or 105 to 109 for 18 S rRNA. The relative expression level of each gene was calculated by averaging the replicates and then dividing the average copy number of Gadd45β by the average copy number of 18 S rRNA. S.E. of the ratios was calculated using a confidence interval. Northern and Western Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Where indicated, total RNA isolation was followed by poly(A) RNA selection using a PolyATtract™ mRNA Isolation kit (Promega). Total RNA or poly(A) RNA was fractionated through formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred onto N+Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled probes were generated using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) supplemented with [32P]dCTP (ICN). To generate Northern blot probes, we PCR-amplified gene-specific sequences from human, mink, or murine cDNA. Mink gadd45β was PCR-amplified using the following degenerate primers: 5′-CTGCARATYCACTTCACSCT and 3′-GGRAYCCAYTGGTTDTTGC. Hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were carried out using ULTRA-hyb buffer (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer. For Western blotting, protein lysates were harvested in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mg/ml phenanthroline. The resulting whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following protein quantitation using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), equal amounts of protein were fractionated through Tris-glycine 4–12% gradient Nu-PAGE gels using the MES buffer system (Invitrogen). The following antibodies were used to detect the SMAD proteins in both Mv1Lu and human cell lines: SMAD3 (catalog no. 51-1500; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), SMAD2 (catalog no. S66220; Transduction Laboratories), SMAD4 (catalog no. sc-7966; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-catenin (catalog no. 610153; Transduction Laboratories). Immune complexes were visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and Western Lighting chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). gadd45β Is a Primary TGFβ-responsive Gene in Normal Human Mammary Epithelial Cells—TGFβ induces a G1 cell cycle arrest and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, but not apoptosis, in primary normal human mammary epithelial cells grown in culture (15Hosobuchi M. Stampfer M.R. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To understand the mechanisms behind these TGFβ-induced phenotypes, we partially defined the TGFβ transcriptome in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Specifically, we used cDNA microarray expression analysis to determine the relative expression of 7000 genes at 2 and 12 h after TGFβ treatment in HMEC. Data analysis revealed 54 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated TGFβ-regulated genes. Genes included in this list had a -fold change of greater than 1.3 or less 0.7 at both time points and a p value of less than 0.05 at both time points (Supplemental Table I and methods therein). Next, we identified genes within this data set that were in common to TGFβ-regulated genes identified through transcriptional profiling in other TGFβ-responsive cell systems. We surmised that because genes in this subgroup were regulated by TGFβ irrespective of cell origin or transformation status, they would be of central importance to the TGFβ cytostatic program. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1) is a well established TGFβ-induced gene and was induced 8-fold 2 h after TGFβ treatment in HMEC (Supplemental Table I). Consequently, PAI1 served as an important positive control in the microarray, in Northern blots, and in subsequent experiments (Fig. 1A). A second common TGFβ target gene identified in our expression analysis was gadd45β/hMyD118. In addition to our studies in primary normal HMEC, previous findings indicate that gadd45β is a TGFβ-induced gene in transformed cell lines derived from myeloid, breast, skin, breast, pancreas, and bone (4Zhang W.

Because of its frequent presence in the TGFβ transcriptional response and because of its previously described role in growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, we chose to characterize the upstream signal transduction pathway necessary for gadd45β transcriptional induction and, second, to examine the role of GADD45β in the TGFβ response. We first determined the scope of gadd45β transcriptional activation. Specifically, we monitored its induction by TGFβ in several cell lines and by other members of the TGFβ superfamily in HMEC. To determine whether other TGFβ-responsive cell lines responded similarly to HMEC with respect to gadd45β transcription, several cell lines were treated with TGFβ or vehicle for 1 h. The gadd45β and PAI1 transcripts were induced by TGFβ in the following cell lines: HMEC, HaCaT, Mv1Lu, PANC-1, primary breast organoid outgrowths, and to a lesser extent in HepG2 and HeLa cells (data not shown) (Fig. 1A). The Madin Darby canine kidney and 293 cell lines did not respond to TGFβ stimulation by inducing either gadd45β or PAI1. TGFβ treatment of 10T1/2 murine fibroblasts caused a moderate increase in PAI1 transcription but did not affect gadd45β mRNA levels. We also asked whether other members of the TGFβ superfamily of growth factors could regulate gadd45β transcription. Fig. 1C illustrates that both TGFβ and BMP2 induced gadd45β transcription. However, the kinetics of gadd45β induction as well as the strength of induction differed between the two ligands. Finally, of the three genes that comprise the gadd45 family, only gadd45β was found to be TGFβ-inducible in HMEC; gadd45α was not affected by TGFβ treatment, and Gadd545γ was not detected (Fig. 1B). Gadd153/Chop10, a GADD family member by virtue of its induction by cellular stress, was transiently repressed by TGFβ. To distinguish whether TGFβ treatment resulted in increased gadd45β transcription or increased gadd45β mRNA stability, we measured the gadd45β mRNA half-life before and after TGFβ treatment. HMEC were treated with TGFβ for 1 h before the addition of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D for various periods of time. Quantitative analysis of the Northern blot revealed that TGFβ failed to stabilize the gadd45β mRNA (Fig. 2, A and B). The accumulation of gadd45β mRNA within2hofTGFβ treatment suggested that it is an immediate early TGFβ-induced target gene. To test this idea, we pretreated HMEC with the protein translation inhibitor cyclohexamide 15 min before a 3-h combined TGFβ/cyclohexamide treatment. We found that the levels of gadd45β increased in a TGFβ-dependent manner irrespective of cyclohexamide pretreatment, indicating that new protein synthesis is not required for TGFβ induction of gadd45β (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that gadd45β is a direct TGFβ transcriptional target. gadd45β Is Partly Dependent upon SMAD3 and Independent of SMAD2 in Its Regulation by TGFβ —We first sought to determine whether specific inhibition of SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 abrogated gadd45β responsiveness to TGFβ. To approach this, we employed siRNA-mediated silencing of the SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 proteins. Because we were unable to achieve silencing greater than 60% of wild-type levels in HMEC, we chose to use Mv1Lu cells for our siRNA studies. Transfection of Mv1Lu cells with siRNAs specific to SMAD2 or SMAD3 reduced the respective protein expression to nearly undetectable levels (Fig. 3A). Loss of SMAD2 caused a 70% decrease in the induction of PAI1 by TGFβ. In contrast, siRNA silencing of SMAD2 had no significant effect on gadd45β induction following TGFβ treatment (Fig. 3A). SMAD3-deficient cells, however, responded to TGFβ stimulation with reduced levels of induction for both gadd45β and PAI1. Although the decrease in PAI1 induction by TGFβ observed in the SMAD2 and the SMAD3 single-knockout cells was enhanced in the double-knockout cells, the SMAD2/SMAD3 double-knockout cells behaved similarly to SMAD3-deficient cells with respect to gadd45β induction (Fig. 3A). Dose-response curves with the Smad3 siRNA (IC50 ∼1 nm) further demonstrated that TGFβ activates PAI1 and gadd45β through a mechanism that is partly dependent upon SMAD3 (Fig. 3B). SMAD4 Silencing Prevents gadd45β and PAI1 Induction by TGFβ —Of the many proteins involved in mediating the different facets of TGFβ signal transduction, SMAD4 is considered central to many of the responses. Two different siRNAs were designed against mink smad4, and the efficacy of their silencing was tested in Mv1Lu cells by Western blot (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the central role of SMAD4 in TGFβ signaling, siRNA silencing of SMAD4 resulted in a dramatic loss of gadd45β transcriptional induction following TGFβ treatment (Fig. 4B). As a confirmation of specificity, a human-specific SMAD4 siRNA, which contains mismatches at two positions relative to the mink sequence, did not affect SMAD4 protein expression or TGFβ-regulated transcription of gadd45β or PAI1. siSmad4-A and siSmad4-B both robustly silenced SMAD4 protein expression and did not interfere with SMAD3 protein expression (Fig. 4A).

In this work, we examined the topography of diacylglycerol-pyrophosphate phosphatase catalytic site within the transverse plane of the vacuole membrane. Results of protease protection analysis using endoproteinase Lys-C and labeling of cysteine residues using sulfhydryl reagents were consistent with a model where the catalytic site of diacylglycerol-pyrophosphate phosphatase was oriented to the cytosolic face of the vacuole membrane. In addition, diacylglycerol-pyrophosphate phosphatase activity was found with intact vacuoles.

Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown at 30 °C in YPDA medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 25 mg/liter adenine) or in synthetic complete medium (33Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose. The appropriate amino acid of synthetic complete medium was omitted for selection purposes. Yeast cell numbers in liquid media were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. Cultures were grown to the exponential phase (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) and harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. For zinc-depleted cultures, cells were first grown for 24 h in synthetic complete medium supplemented with 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. Cultures were harvested, washed in de-ionized distilled water, diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in media containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate, and grown for 24 h. Cultures were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown in media containing 0 or 1.4 μm zinc sulfate. This process was used to deplete internal stores of zinc. For zinc-free glassware, items were washed with Liqui-Nox and rinsed several times with distilled water followed by a final rinse with de-ionized distilled water. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Vacuoles—Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (34Klig L.S. Homann M.J. Carman G.M. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Oshiro J. Han G.-S. Iwanyshyn W.M. Conover K. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31495-31503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris maleate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were disrupted by homogenization with chilled glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) using a Biospec Products bead beater. Samples were homogenized for 10 1-min bursts followed by a 2-min cooling between bursts at 4 °C. The cell extract (supernatant) was obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate at 1,500 × g for 10 min. Vacuoles were isolated from spheroplasts by several steps of flotation and density gradient centrifugation as described by Uchida et al. (36Uchida E. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 544-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the cell extract and vacuoles was determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Staining of Vacuoles with FM4–64—Vacuolar membranes were stained with the specific styryl dye FM4–64 (38Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 50 μm. Fluorescent images were observed and recorded using an Olympus BH2-RFCA fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Sensys KAF-1400 CCD camera. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) using 10% gels or 10–20% gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting as described by Haid and Suissa (40Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with an appropriate dilution of the indicated primary antibody. Goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used as a secondary antibody against primary antibodies produced in rabbits or mice, respectively, at a dilution of 1:5000. Antibody interactions were detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence Western blotting detection kit as described by the manufacturer. Signals on the membrane were acquired by fluoroimaging analysis. The relative density of the protein signals was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Immunoblot signals were in the linear range of detectability. Endoproteinase Lys-C Treatment of Vacuoles—Vacuoles (5 μg of protein) were mixed with 1 μg of endoproteinase Lys-C and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.3 m sucrose, and 3 m urea. Urea was included in the reaction mixture, because it facilitated exposure of lysine residues to endoproteinase Lys-C and provided some protection from the endogenous vacuolar protease(s) that digested the DGPP phosphatase in the detergent-solubilized vacuole. Vacuoles were ruptured by including 0.4% Triton X-100 in the reaction mixture. After incubation, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the mixture to inhibit the protease. The reaction products were then subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 10–20% gradient gel followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-HA antibodies or with antibodies raised against the C-terminal epitope (residues 263–279) of DGPP phosphatase (20Oshiro J. Rangaswamy S. Chen X. Han G.-S. Quinn J.E.

Chemical Labeling of Cysteine Residues—The cysteine residues of vacuole membrane proteins were labeled with sulfhydryl reagents as described by Leng et al. (41Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Vacuoles (15 μg of protein) were suspended in 200 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m sucrose and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the absence or presence of 100 μm AMS, a membrane-impermeable reagent used to label cysteine residues. The reaction mixture was then diluted to 1 ml with vacuole suspension buffer and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with 250 μm MPB, a membrane-permeable reagent used to label cysteine residues with biotin. The labeling reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The sulfhydryl reagent-treated vacuoles were collected by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The vacuoles were lysed in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and mixed with 100 μl of 10% slurry of agarose-conjugated anti-HA antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. The anti-HA affinity matrix was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 s, washed twice with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE treatment buffer. After boiling and a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 10–20% gradient gel followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated NeutrAvidin to detect biotinylated proteins. The membrane was then stripped and re-probed with anti-HA antibodies to detect DGPP phosphatase. Preparation of Labeled DGPP Substrates—32P-Labeled DGPP was enzymatically synthesized from PA and ATP with purified Catharanthus roseus PA kinase as described by Wu et al. (5Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). [β-32P]DGPP was synthesized from PA and [γ-32P]ATP, whereas [α-32P]DGPP was synthesized from [32P]PA and ATP. The [32P]PA used in the latter reaction was synthesized from diacylglycerol and [γ-32P]ATP using Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (43Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled DGPP substrates were purified by thin-layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-treated plates using the solvent system chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:15:13:12:4) (5Wu W.-I.

DGPP Phosphatase Assays—DGPP phosphatase activity was routinely measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [β-32P]DGPP (10,000 cpm/nmol) (5Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 mm [β-32P]DGPP, 2 mm Triton X-100, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The function of Triton X-100 in the assay system is to solubilize the DGPP substrate (5Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All of the enzyme assays were conducted in triplicate at 30 °C. The mean ± S.D. of the assays was ± 5%. DGPP phosphatase reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. DGPP phosphatase activity was also measured with DGPP incorporated into phospholipid vesicles that were prepared by sonication (44Bangham A.D. Hesketh T.R. Kornberg H.L. Metcalfe J.C. Northcote D.H. Techniques in Lipid and Membrane Biochemistry, Part II. Elsevier Scientific Publishers, New York1982: 1-25Google Scholar). The phospholipid vesicles contained 0.18 mm PC, 0.125 mm PE, 0.125 mm PI, 0.062 mm PS, and 0.1 mm [α-32P]DGPP. The molar ratio of PC/PE/PI/PS in the vesicles was 3:2:2:1, the approximate composition of the major phospholipids in wild type S. cerevisiae (45Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). The molar ratio of the PC/PE/PI/PS mixture to DGPP was 5:1. In this assay, DGPP phosphatase activity was measured by following the formation of [32P]PA from [α-32P]DGPP (10,000 cpm/nmol) (5Wu W.-I.

Following the reaction, phospholipid vesicles (supernatant) were separated from vacuoles by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 30 min. Phospholipids were extracted (46Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:15:13:12:4) as the solvent system (5Wu W.-I.

The identity of the labeled phospholipids on the chromatography plates was confirmed by comparison with standard radioactive DGPP and PA. Radiolabeled DGPP and PA were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis, and their relative quantities were analyzed using ImageQuant software. Analysis of Vacuole Membrane Phospholipids—Phospholipids were extracted from vacuoles by the method of Bligh and Dyer (46Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase and mat of solid material between the two phases of this extraction were removed with a Pasteur pipette and subjected to a second extraction with chloroform. The chloroform phases were combined, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 500 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v). A 25-μl aliquot was used to determine the total phosphate content of the sample. The remainder was dried to a minimal volume under nitrogen. The sample was spotted onto an oxalate-EDTA (1.2% potassium oxalate, 2 mm EDTA dissolved in methanol/water (2:3, v/v)) treated high performance TLC Silica Gel 60 plate, which had been heated at 110 °C overnight and cooled to room temperature immediately prior to the application of the sample. The first dimension was developed using chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (30: 16.7:1.3:2, v/v). The plate was allowed to completely dry in the hood for at least 1 h. It was then dried in vacuo for an additional 2 h. The second dimension was developed using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (32:4:5:1, v/v). The plate was allowed to dry completely overnight in the hood. Phospholipids were visualized by acid charring (47Kates M. Techniques of Lipidology. Isolation, Analysis, and Identification of Lipids.

This is the first report describing transcriptional compensation for haploinsufficiency of a tumor suppressor gene. INI1, a component of the mammalian SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, was first identified as a homologue of the yeast Snf5 protein and as a protein that interacts with the human immunodeficiency virus integrase protein (1Muchardt C.

Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter histone-DNA contacts resulting in an altered nucleosome structure that can lead to repositioning, or sliding, of nucleosomes along the DNA (3Narlikar G.J.

A consequence of SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling is increased accessibility of transcriptional regulatory proteins to cognate binding sites on nucleosome particles (6Côté J. Quinn J.

The biological relevance of SWI/SNF complexes is evident by the numerous reports indicating that SWI/SNF enzymes positively and negatively regulate gene expression (5Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 10Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Tsukiyama T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The role of INI1 in remodeling chromatin and facilitating gene regulation is poorly understood. The ATPase subunits of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes by themselves exhibit the ability to remodel chromatin in every in vitro assay tested (12Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol.

However, the addition of INI1 and two other SWI/SNF subunits, BAF170 and BAF155, augmented remodeling to levels comparable with that of the purified enzyme complex (12Phelan M.L. Sif S. Narlikar G.J. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The first evidence implicating INI1 as a tumor suppressor arose when Versteege et al. (16Versteege I. Sevenet N. Lange J. Rousseau-Merck M.F. Ambros P. Handgretinger R. Aurias A. Delattre O. Nature. 1998; 394: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) identified bi-allelic mutations in INI1 in malignant rhabdoid tumors, an aggressive tumor of the soft tissues. Mutations in INI1 were found subsequently in other tumors, such as choroid plexus carcinomas, medulloblastomas, central primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and some cases of leukemia (17Biegel J.A.

Identification of constitutional mutations in a subset of these tumors further supported the role of INI1 as a tumor suppressor in humans (22Sévenet N. Sheridan E. Amram D. Schneider P. Handgretinger R. Delattre O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1342-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Gene-targeting experiments confirmed that Ini1 functions as a tumor suppressor in mice (23Roberts C.W. Galusha S.A. McMenamin M.E. Fletcher C.D. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although Ini1-null mice are embryonic lethal, 15–30% of mice heterozygous for Ini1 presented with poorly differentiated tumors with variable rhabdoid features. All tumors examined showed a loss of heterozygosity at the Ini1 locus. Furthermore, almost 100% of mice bearing a reversibly inactivating conditional allele of Ini1 presented rapidly with tumors. The vast majority of these tumors were classified as CD8+ T-cell lymphomas (26Roberts C.W. Leroux M.M. Fleming M.D. Orkin S.H. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note the difference in tumor penetrance between Ini1-heterozygous mice and the conditional Ini1 mice. These findings strongly suggest that Ini1 must be lost for tumorigenesis to occur. In contrast, the reduction of p53 protein levels observed in mice heterozygous for the p53 tumor suppressor predisposes the mice to tumor formation without the need for loss of heterozygosity (27Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). Where examined, other tumor suppressors, such as caveolin-1, Fhit, TαR-II (transforming growth factor-α type II receptor), and Sno, are similar to p53 in that they also exhibit a marked reduction in protein and/or RNA levels in heterozygous mice (28Razani B.

EMBO J. 1998; 16: 4657-4667Crossref Scopus (375) Google Scholar). There are data suggesting that a compensatory mechanism exists to ensure consistent levels of the components of the SWI/SNF complex. In mice deficient for the Brm ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF, the levels of Brg1 protein are increased in several tissues, including the liver, spleen, kidney, brain, lung, heart, and thymus (32Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Brg1 protein in the Brm-null mice is believed to account for the lack of severe phenotype in these mice. Furthermore, when HeLa cells were transfected with an a hemagglutinin-tagged BRM construct, BRG1 protein levels decreased as detected by indirect immunofluorescence (32Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a balance of BRG1 and BRM protein levels must be maintained in mammalian organisms. In addition, expression of a mutant BAF57, another SWI/SNF subunit, in transgenic mice suppresses the levels of endogenous BAF57 protein (33Chi T.H. Wan M. Zhao K. Taniuchi I. Chen L. Littman D.R. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, the absence of cancer and the apparent requirement for loss of heterozygosity in tumorigenesis in the Ini1 haploinsufficient tissues might be explained if Ini1 is up-regulated in the Ini1-heterozygous mice. We report here that cells and tissues heterozygous for the Ini1 tumor suppressor express levels of Ini1 protein and message that are nearly equivalent to the levels observed in wild type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WTwild typeESembryonic stemMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRTreverse transcriptase. counterparts. We further show that the rate of transcription from the Ini1 promoter is increased in Ini1-heterozygous cells, accounting for the increase in steady state message levels. Moreover, we find that exogenous expression of Ini1 results in a decrease in expression from the endogenous Ini1 promoter, suggesting that Ini1 plays a role in the regulation of its own promoter. In summary, the findings reported here indicate that expression of the Ini1 gene is tightly regulated, possibly to maintain proper levels of this important developmental regulator and tumor suppressor. wild type embryonic stem mouse embryonic fibroblast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse transcriptase. Cells—Embryonic stem (ES) cells containing a retroviral promoter trap that functionally inactivates one Ini1 allele were previously described (25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type or Ini1-heterozygous mouse embryos were prepared and cultured according to standard procedures. mRNA Analyses—RNA from indicated tissues and cells was isolated in Trizol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and Mu-MLV RT (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of RNA for each sample. In Figs. 2 and 3, Ini1 levels were amplified using the primers 5′-gcgtcaagtttcagctggagg-3′ (sequence from exon 1) and 5′-catgcggttcctgttgatggtggt-3′ (sequence from exon 4). The real-time PCR data presented in Fig. 4 used the reverse primer 5′-caccagcacctcaggctgtgacgc-3′ for Ini1 amplification (sequence from exon 5). β-Actin was amplified using primers 5′-gcttctttgcagctccttcgttg-3′ and 5′-tttgcacatgccggagccgttgt-3′. GAPDH was amplified using the primers 5′-gcagtggcaaagtggagattgt-3′ and 5′-cacggccatcacgccacagctt-3′. 18 S rRNA was amplified using primers 5′-acttggataactgtggtaattc-3′ and 5′-aattaccgcggctgctggcacc-3′. For Figs. 2 and 3, Ini1 and β-actin PCR reactions were performed for 24 cycles using HotStart Taq and MasterMix (Qiagen) supplemented with [32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cycles consisted of denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 64 °C (Ini1) or 65 °C (β-actin) for 40 s, and then extension at 72 °C for 1 min (Ini1) or 30 s (β-actin). For Fig. 4, Ini1, GAPDH, and 18 S PCR reactions consisted of 25 cycles with annealing at 64 °C for 30 s and then extension at 72 °C for 30 s.Fig. 3Levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein are roughly equivalent in WT and Ini1-heterozygous MEFs and ES cells.A, Western blots of Ini1 protein levels in WT (W) and Ini1-heterozygous ES and MEF cells.

Hybridization was performed with a radiolabeled probe consisting of exons 1–5 from the Ini1 cDNA at 50 °C in 10% dextran sulfate, 1.5× SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA), and 1% SDS, 0.5% milk, and 625 μg/ml yeast RNA extract. Blots were washed twice for 20 min with 1% SDS, 2× SSC at 50 °C, and then washed once for 15 min with 1% SDS and 0.2× SSC at 50 °C. For mRNA half-life studies, cells were grown to 80% confluency prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). Cells were harvested at 2-h intervals between 0 and 12 h after the addition of actinomycin D and again for a final time point at 24 h. Sample amplifications were carried out by real-time PCR (MJ Research) using Qiagen SYBR-green reagents to determine the linear range for each primer set. Results shown are the average of two experiments performed in triplicate for each time point. Wild type levels at time 0 were arbitrarily set to 1, and the remaining time points were adjusted accordingly. Nuclear Run-on Assay—Nuclear run-on transcription assays as described by Schübeler and Bode 2This is a sensitive transcription assay based on a simplified nuclear run-on protocol. See website: juergenbode.gmxhome.de/t01176.htm. were carried out. NaOH and EDTA were added to linearized Bluescript SK plasmids containing cDNAs corresponding to exons 1–3 of Ini1, full-length GAPDH, or no insert as a control to a final concentration of 0.4 and 10 mm, respectively. Samples were boiled for 10 min, chilled, dot-blotted in 2-μl aliquots to GeneScreen plus membranes, and cross-linked via Stratalinker. Prehybridization was carried out for at least 2 h at 60 °C in 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 1.4 m NaCl, and 325 μg/ml each of salmon sperm DNA and yeast RNA extract. Equivalent amounts of run-on RNA (∼3 × 106 counts/min) from WT and Ini1-heterozygous cell extracts were added to the blot and hybridized for 16–42 h. Blots were washed as described by Schübeler and Bode. 2This is a sensitive transcription assay based on a simplified nuclear run-on protocol. See website: juergenbode.gmxhome.de/t01176.htm. Western Analyses—Extracts from indicated tissues and cells were isolated as described previously (25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Forty-five to fifty micrograms of each sample were used for Western analysis as described (25Guidi C. Sands A.

Antibodies against Ini1, Brg1, Brm, and tubulin have been described previously (25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell.

Determination of relative protein levels was accomplished by scanning multiple film exposures and quantifying them in ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). β-Galactosidase Assays—FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used to transfect BOSC23 cells (36Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) with either a retroviral pBABE vector or a pBABE vector encoding a FLAG epitope-tagged INI (37Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), both of which were modified to carry a blasticidin resistance gene. Briefly, the blasticidin resistance gene was amplified by PCR from pEM7/Bsd (Invitrogen) and cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). The blasticidin resistance gene was then excised with ClaI and HindIII, purified via GeneClean III (Bio 101), and cloned into ClaI/HindIII-restricted pBABE-CeINI1 (37Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) or pBABE to replace the existing puromycin resistance gene. After 48 h, the transfected BOSC cell supernatants were used to infect Ini1-heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts at 80% confluence. Forty-eight hours after infection, blasticidin (10 μg/ml) was added to the mouse embryonic fibroblasts to select for infected cells. After 48 h of selection, β-galactosidase assays were performed using the Promega β-galactosidase enzyme assay system with reporter lysis buffer. Tissues and Cells Heterozygous for Ini1 Contain Levels of Ini1 Protein and mRNA That are Nearly Equivalent to Levels Present in WT Tissues and Cells—We previously generated mice heterozygous for Ini1 using an inactivating retroviral insertion vector (25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The targeted allele is interrupted by the insertion between exons 3 and 4 (Fig. 1 and see Ref. 25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase-neomycin resistance gene fusion cassette contains a 5′ splice acceptor site; thus the Ini1 promoter at the targeted locus drives expression of a fusion protein that consists of the first three exons of Ini1 fused to the β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion. In addition, exons 4–9 of Ini1 are transcribed as a fusion with the puromycin resistance gene product under the control of the PGK promoter but are not translated. All PCR-based detection of Ini1 mRNA levels in this study used primer sets in which products span the insertion site and therefore detect only mRNA from the intact, nontargeted allele. During the characterization of Ini1-heterozygous mice, we observed that various tissues from the heterozygotes contained levels of Ini1 mRNA that were approximately equivalent to those from WT tissues (Fig. 2, data not shown). We next looked at the levels of Ini1 protein and message in WT and Ini1-heterozygous mouse ES cells and MEFs. Fig. 3A shows a Western blot of the levels of the SWI/SNF components Ini1, Brg1, and Brm present in these cells. The levels of Ini1 protein appeared to be equivalent whether there were one or two functional copies of the Ini1 locus. Brg1 and Brm levels were not affected by the loss of one Ini1 allele. Consistent with previous results, Brm protein was not present at detectable levels in ES cells (38LeGouy E. Thompson E.M. Muchardt C. Renard J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To better quantify Ini1 protein levels in WT and heterozygous cells, protein samples were run next to a titration of extract (Fig. 3B). The experiment demonstrates that the intensity of the bands is within the linear range of protein detection and that Ini1 protein levels are not reduced 2-fold in the heterozygous cell lines as might be expected from the inactivation of one Ini1 allele but instead are nearly equivalent. To examine mRNA levels in WT and Ini1-heterozygous cell lines, we performed a Northern blot as well as RT-PCR. Levels of Ini1 mRNA in heterozygous cells were similar to levels in WT cells (Fig. 3C). Although the Northern blot has the potential to distinguish the fusion mRNAs from the targeted allele, the individual mRNAs can be distinguished from each other and from WT Ini1 mRNA on the basis of size. The Northern blot results were subsequently confirmed using RT-PCR (Fig. 3D). Quantification of the Western, Northern, and RT-PCR experiments consistently indicated that the levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein in Ini1-heterozygous MEFs were 80–90% of those present in WT MEFs, and the levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein in Ini1-heterozygous ES cells were 110–125% of those present in WT ES cells. Compensation of Ini1 Levels in Ini1-heterozygous Cells Is Accomplished at the Level of Transcription Initiation—We hypothesized that compensation of Ini1 mRNA levels might be achieved by either an increase in the stability of Ini1 mRNA or an increase in the rate of transcription from the Ini1 promoter. To compare the relative half-life of Ini1 mRNA in WT and Ini1-heterozygous MEF cells, cultures were treated with actinomycin D and harvested at various intervals until 24 h. Ini1 and GAPDH mRNA decay was monitored by real-time PCR. The decay rate of Ini1 message in Ini1-heterozygous cells was equivalent to that in WT cells (Fig. 4), indicating that Ini1 compensation is not mediated by an increase in Ini1 mRNA stability. We next examined the rate of transcription of Ini1 in WT and Ini1-heterozygous MEF cells via run-on transcription assay. Newly synthesized RNA from WT and Ini1-heterozygous cells was radiolabeled and used to probe cDNAs immobilized on a membrane. As described above and previously (25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), Ini1-heterozygous cells contain one wild type allele of Ini1 as well as an allele of Ini1 that is disrupted by the insertion of a retroviral vector within intron 3. This insertion results in the synthesis of a fusion transcript containing exons 1–3 of Ini1 fused to β-galactosidase under the control of the endogenous Ini1 promoter. Thus, a plasmid containing Ini1 cDNA corresponding to exons 1–3 was used in this experiment to identify only those transcripts generated from the Ini1 promoter. A plasmid containing GAPDH cDNA and an empty plasmid vector served as controls. Ini1-heterozgous cells contained roughly double the amount of radiolabeled Ini1 RNA as did WT cells (Fig. 5). If compensation were not occurring at the level of transcription, we would have expected equivalent signals in WT and Ini1-heterozygous cells because the WT cells would have produced mRNA containing Ini1 exons 1–3 from both alleles, whereas the Ini1-heterozygous cells also would have produced mRNA containing Ini1 exons 1–3 from both the WT and targeted alleles. The results therefore demonstrate the occurrence of transcriptional compensation at the Ini1 promoter. Exogenous Ini1 Expression Down-regulates Ini1 Promoter Activity—Because the rate of transcription from the Ini1 promoter is increased in cells containing one functional Ini1 allele, we asked whether exogenously expressed Ini1 would decrease the amount of transcription from the Ini1 promoter. We utilized the fact that the targeted Ini1-heterozygous cells contain a β-galactosidase gene cassette under the control of the Ini1 promoter (Ref. 25Guidi C. Sands A. Zambrowicz B. Turner T. Demers D. Webster W. Smith T. Imbalzano A. Jones S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3598-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1) and monitored the activity of the Ini1 promoter in Ini1-heterozygous MEFs infected with a retrovirus encoding FLAG-tagged Ini1 or with the empty retroviral vector. Examination of cell lysate from infected cells clearly shows that the exogenous FLAG-tagged Ini1 was expressed; however, reprobing the blot for total Ini1 protein levels revealed that the overall increase in Ini1 protein levels was less than 2-fold (Fig. 6A). The cells infected with Ini1 exhibited reduced β-galactosidase activity as compared with cells infected with empty vector (Fig. 6B). The reduction in β-galactosidase activity was ∼1.5-fold, in good agreement with the -fold overexpression of Ini1 protein. Thus, the cells are sensitive to the amount of Ini1 present and compensate both positively and negatively to maintain appropriate levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein. Transcriptional Compensation for Loss of a Tumor Suppressor Allele—In mammals, few cases involving a compensatory increase in the levels of transcription on loss of one gene copy have been documented (39Trieu M. Ma A. Eng S.R. Fedtsova N. Turner E.E. Development. 2003; 130: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), perhaps because any phenotypic differences that might occur because of haploinsufficiency may not be observed in heterozygous individuals if the targeted gene were up-regulated. However, such compensation might be advantageous to prevent the loss of gene products affecting cell proliferation. Numerous reports have linked Ini1 function to control of cell cycle (40Reincke B.S. Rosson G.B. Oswald B.W. Wright C.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 41Ae K. Kobayashi N. Sakuma R. Ogata T. Kuroda H. Kawaguchi N. Shinomiya K. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3112-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Versteege I. Medjkane S. Rouillard D. Delattre O. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6403-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 43Zhang Z.K. Davies K.P. Allen J. Zhu L. Pestell R.G. Zagzag D. Kalpana G.V. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5193-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, whereas 15–30% of Ini1-heterozygous mice present with tumors, almost 100% of mice bearing a reversibly inactivating conditional allele of Ini1 do so (26Roberts C.W. Leroux M.M. Fleming M.D. Orkin S.H. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The difference in tumor penetrance between Ini1-heterozygous mice and the conditional Ini1 mice and the correlation between loss of heterozygosity and tumor presentation in Ini1-heterozygous mice strongly suggest that Ini1 must be lost for tumorigenesis to occur. It is possible that the observed transcriptional compensation for Ini1 heterozygosity contributes to the low tumor penetrance in Ini1-heterozygous mice, because the increase in transcription rate from the single functional allele may prevent potentially deleterious effects resulting from decreased levels of Ini1 protein. An additional consideration for why cells might compensate for loss of one Ini1 allele would be to maintain stoichiometric levels of each of the components comprising a multisubunit enzyme. To date none of the mammalian SWI/SNF subunits except for BAF53 is known to exist in cells either independently or as part of different protein complexes (45Park J. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Maintenance of equivalent concentrations of multiple gene products each encoded by different genes would likely be complex and require a “sensing” mechanism to determine the relative levels of each protein and to trigger a regulatory response, positively or negatively, should the levels of one protein vary. Presently, much of the evidence for cross-talk between SWI/SNF subunits pertains to that between BRG1 and BRM, the two related ATPases (32Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, the existing biochemical studies have shown that BRG1 and BRM form distinct enzyme complexes (9Wang W. Côte J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), which may suggest a level of cross-talk that maintains the relative levels of the different enzymes. This may be a regulatory problem that is distinct from maintaining equivalent levels of subunits in the same enzyme complex. The mechanism(s) by which the expression of Ini1, BRG1, BRM, and other SWI/SNF subunit genes are regulated in response to altered levels of their own gene product or the protein levels of other subunits remain to be determined. It is important to note that the observed compensation in Ini1 levels does not appear to be exact. We consistently observed levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein in Ini1-heterozygous MEFs that were 10–20% lower than those in WT MEFs, whereas the levels of Ini1 mRNA and protein in Ini1-heterozygous ES cells were 10–25% higher than those in WT ES cells. The implication is that an individual heterozygous for Ini1 may still be susceptible to the consequences of Ini1 misregulation. We thank K. Roy for constructing the empty pBABE-Bsd vector and C. Baron for help generating the figures."
https://openalex.org/W2002452021,"Apoptosis plays an essential role in atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and activated T lymphocytes are present in atherosclerotic lesions, and we have previously reported that oxLDL induce apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes. We now show that this is preceded by an increase of Fas and FasL expression. Fas and FasL overexpression was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as ERK and JNK activation. In addition, oxLDL triggered an early production of soluble FasL by T lymphocytes. Blocking anti-Fas antibody or Fas-Fc protein, but also antioxidant molecules and inhibitors of ERK and JNK, decreased oxLDL-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, PHA-activated murine lymphocytes lacking a functional Fas receptor were partially resistant to oxLDL. Finally, Jurkat T cells deficient for FADD, an adaptor protein required for Fas signaling, resisted oxLDL-induced apoptosis. OxLDL triggered caspase 8 and 3 activation as well as ceramide production in PHA-activated lymphocytes and in Jurkat cells. Caspase activation was completely impaired in FADD-deficient cells, but ceramide production was not affected. Altogether, our results highlight the putative role of both membrane-bound and soluble FasL in oxLDL-induced Fas and FADD-dependent apoptosis of T lymphocytes and suggest an involvement of ROS, ERK, and JNK in this process."

Heparan sulfate (HS) belongs to the family of glycosaminoglycans. HS has been assigned a variety of physiological and pathological functions, such as cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cell proliferation, motility and differentiation, lipoprotein metabolism, blood coagulation, inflammation, tissue regeneration, tumor progression and invasion, pathogenic infection by bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, through specific interaction with a wide array of proteins, ligands, receptors, and pathogens (Bernfield, M., Gotte, M., Park, P.

https://openalex.org/W1986831255,"Intestinal cell growth and differentiation are tightly regulated by growth factors and extracellular matrix components along the crypt-villus axis. We previously described enterophilin-1 (Ent-1) as a new intestinal protein associated with growth arrest and enterocyte differentiation. Ent-1 interacted with sorting nexin 1 and decreased cell surface epidermal growth factor receptor. Because β1 integrins are mostly found in vivo in the proliferative crypt cells, we investigated the role of Ent-1 in the fate of β1 integrin subunits. In undifferentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells, overexpression of Ent-1 induces a marked decrease of α5β1 integrin pools, whereas α2β1 integrin is weakly affected. Conversely, overexpression of sorting nexin 1 has no effect on integrin levels despite its ability to interact with Ent-1. Interestingly, we identified focal adhesion kinase as a new Ent-1 partner using yeast two-hybrid screening and co-precipitation experiments. Furthermore by confocal microscopy, we observed that Ent-1 and β1 integrins partly co-localize on vesicular structures, suggesting a role for Ent-1 in integrin trafficking. Because focal adhesion kinase is able to bind both Ent-1 and β1 integrins, the kinase might act as a molecular bridge between the two proteins. Altogether, these results support a role of Ent-1 in regulating β1 integrin expression that could favor intestinal differentiation.

The intestinal epithelium undergoes continuous and rapid renewal, with proliferation of the multipotent stem cells limited to the crypts of Lieberkühn. At the top of the crypt, the cells lose their proliferative ability and complete differentiation during a highly organized migration on the basement membrane, a specialized extracellular matrix consisting of a complex association of various molecules, including collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin (1Beaulieu J.F. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 31: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the tip of the villus, terminally differentiated cells are extruded to the lumen (2Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 3Loeffler M. Birke A. Winton D. Potten C. J. Theor.

Intestinal epithelial cell differentiation requires two major events: the transition from stem cells to committed proliferative cells and the irreversible loss of proliferative potential as the committed cells start to differentiate. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the fine coordination between proliferation, migration, and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis are still largely unknown.The regulation of intestinal cell growth and differentiation is a multifactorial process, susceptible to various influences along the crypt-villus axis such as growth factors and basement membrane components. Indeed, in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the expression of cell surface epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Ent-1, enterophilin-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RPE, R-phycoerythrin; SNX, sorting nexin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAT, focal adhesion targeting signal.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Ent-1, enterophilin-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RPE, R-phycoerythrin; SNX, sorting nexin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FAT, focal adhesion targeting signal. dramatically decreases during differentiation (5Scheving L.A.

Growth Factors. 1999; 17: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, several studies have provided evidence for an important role for integrins during this process. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface adhesion receptors consisting of α and β subunits and mediating cell-extracellular matrix interactions (for a review see Ref. 7Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). In epithelia, such interactions are mainly achieved by integrins belonging to the β1 and β4 classes. Interestingly, basement membrane components and β integrins display a differential distribution along the crypt-villus axis. Briefly, fibronectin is abundant in the proliferative crypt compartment, whereas laminins are enriched at the villus tip (8Perreault N. Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.F. Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Beaulieu J.F. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D310-D321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, β1 and β4 integrins show differential patterns of expression in concert to the distribution of their respective ligands. α1β1, α2β1, and α5β1 integrins are expressed in proliferative crypt cells and decrease in differentiated villus cells. In fact, β1 integrin classes are largely involved in the control of cell proliferation and particularly the specific fibronectin receptor, α5β1 integrin, because of its link to the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (10Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Conversely, α3β1, α7Bβ1, and α6β4 integrins appear to be related to the process of intestinal cell differentiation (11Lussier C. Basora N. Bouatrouss Y. Beaulieu J.F. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Stutzmann J. Bellissent-Waydelich A. Fontao L. Launay J.F. Simon-Assmann P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of such basement membrane and integrin compositional changes remain to be precisely defined.We have previously cloned and characterized a new family of intestinal proteins named enterophilins (13Gassama-Diagne A. Hullin-Matsuda F. Li R.Y. Nauze M. Ragab A. Pons V. Delagebeaudeuf C. Simon M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18352-18360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have shown that enterophilin-1 (Ent-1) expression was positively correlated with growth arrest and terminal differentiation program in human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, overexpression of Ent-1 inhibited cell growth and promoted intestinal differentiation (13Gassama-Diagne A. Hullin-Matsuda F. Li R.Y. Nauze M. Ragab A. Pons V. Delagebeaudeuf C.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we recently identified the sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) as an Ent-1-binding partner (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R. Peres C. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Gassama-Diagne A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The SNXs are an emerging family of proteins (for a review see Ref. 15Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), characterized by the presence of a phox homology domain (16Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). SNX1 has been particularly involved in cell surface EGFR removal as the result of enhancing trafficking in the endosome-to-lysosome pathway (17Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported a cooperative role of Ent-1 and SNX1 on the decrease of cell surface EGFR (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R. Peres C. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Gassama-Diagne A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All of these data led us to postulate a model involving Ent-1 in the down-regulation of mitogenic signals allowing cell growth arrest and enterocyte differentiation.In this paper, we investigated the role of Ent-1 and SNX1 on the fate of β1 integrin subunits that are involved in the control of enterocyte differentiation. We herein report a role for Ent-1 in β1 integrin variations occurring during the early stages of intestinal differentiation that could be linked to the ability of Ent-1 to interact with focal adhesion kinase p125FAK, a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase co-localized to sites of integrin clustering and involved in integrin-initiated signaling events (for a review see Ref. 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Full-length Ent-1 cDNA was cloned in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech Laboratories) or pcDNA3/Myc-His (Invitrogen) plasmid to encode a N-terminally GFP-tagged protein or a C-terminally Myc-tagged protein, respectively, as previously described (13Gassama-Diagne A.

Gill (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—First, full-length Ent-1 cDNA containing vector pAS2–1 (Clontech Laboratories) was used as a bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library constructed in pGAD GH vector at EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites (Clontech Laboratories) as already described (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R. Peres C. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Gassama-Diagne A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To pinpoint the interacting domain of Ent-1, the leucine zipper region or the B30.2 domain were used in a one to one interaction test with positive library plasmids in the yeast strain SFY526 and tested as previously described (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R. Peres C. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Gassama-Diagne A. J. Biol.

Then total RNA was extracted using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. To remove traces of genomic DNA, 5 μg of total RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen), and subsequently reverse transcription reaction was performed in a reaction buffer containing dNTP, “random” primers (Roche Applied Science) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green JumpStart™ detection system (Sigma). All of the primers were designed using Primer Express™ software (PE Biosystems). Briefly, 125 ng of the reversed transcribed cDNA were used for each PCR with 300 nm of the human β1 integrin specific primers (forward, 5′-TGCCGGGTTTCACTTTGC-3′, bases 940–957; reverse, 5′-GTGACATTGTCCATCATTTGGTAAA-3′, bases 985–1009 (19Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)). The amplicon was 70 bp and was in the 5′ coding region of the human β1A integrin cDNA (20de Melker A.A. Sonnenberg A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To normalize the difference in loading amounts, hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), which is expressed along the entire length of the crypt-villus axis (21Sauvaget D. Chauffeton V. Citadelle D. Chatelet F.P. Cywiner-Golenzer C. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. Cardot P. Le Beyec J. Ribeiro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34540-34548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was used at 100 nm (forward primer, 5′-GAGGAACCAGTGCCGCTACT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CATTCTGGACGGCTTCCTTCT-3′). The PCR program with specific primers was as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, then 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. The threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained for the reactions reflecting quantity of the template in the samples. β1 integrin ΔCT was calculated by subtracting the HNF4α CT value from the β1 integrin CT value and thus represented the relative quantity of the target molecule after normalizing with the internal standard HNF4α. The β1 integrin ΔCT values of Caco-2 cells transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1 or pEGFP-C1-SNX1 were expressed as percentages of β1 integrin ΔCT values of GFP control cells.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. They were transfected with a cationic lipid (LipofectAMINE; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.Confluence-induced Differentiation of Caco-2 Cells—Caco-2 cells were seeded at 18 000 cells/cm2 and grown in 60-mm dishes in the complete medium. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped at 4 °C in PBS containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) at various times up to 23 days after plating. The samples were sonicated, and the protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (212995) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Caco-2 cells were transfected with pcDNA3/Myc-His-Ent-1 for 48 h. All of the procedures were done at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested, and then lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. After sonication, insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was subjected to a preclearing with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. Ent-1 was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, followed by 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. After two washes in lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors, followed by one wash in lysis buffer without detergent, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205873) Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins were then submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting.Immunoblotting—The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting according to standard protocols (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205873) Google Scholar, 24Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Ent-1 peptide antibody has been previously described (13Gassama-Diagne A. Hullin-Matsuda F. Li R.Y. Nauze M. Ragab A. Pons V. Delagebeaudeuf C. Simon M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18352-18360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 integrin antibody (anti-cyto-β1) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1 integrin (25Martel V. Vignoud L. Dupe S. Frachet P. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Albiges-Rizo (La Tronche, France). Monoclonal antibodies against α5 and α2 integrin subunits were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal antibody against β-actin was purchased from Sigma, and monoclonal antibody against GFP was from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal antibodies against c-Myc epitope (9E10) and against the C terminus of FAK (H-1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Revelation was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or with anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) detection.Confocal Microscopy—Caco-2 were grown on fibronectin-coated sterile glass coverslips for 38 h and then transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 15 min with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and saturated for 30 min with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then incubated 60 min with the primary antibody (monoclonal anti-FAK (clone 77) antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories or rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 integrin (anti-cyto-β1) antibody). Immunostaining was performed respectively with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO) or with Cy™5-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector laboratories) and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss; LSM 510).Analysis of Cell Surface Integrin Density by Flow Cytometry—Caco-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1, pEGFP-C1-SNX1, or empty vector and grown for 72 h. Then they were harvested in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min, and nonspecific sites were saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The cell surface β1 integrins were detected by an incubation with primary monoclonal antibodies against β1 integrin subunits (clone K20; Immunotech), α5β1 integrin (clone P1D6; DAKO), or α2β1 integrin (clone P1E6; DAKO) for 60 min, followed by incubation with a R-phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (DAKO) for 60 min. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter XL 4C). Expression of the GFP-fused proteins was monitored by fluorescence measurement, and the surface binding of the anti-β1, anti-α5β1, or anti-α2β1 integrin antibody was measured specifically on the transfected cell population. The quantity of cell surface β1 integrin subunits and α5β1 or α2β1 integrins was measured by RPE fluorescence mean and was expressed as percentages of β1 subunit or α5β1 integrin or α2β1 integrin values in GFP-transfected control cells. The results were analyzed by paired t test and were considered significantly different from GFP-transfected control cells (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***p < 0.00005).Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Alkaline phosphatase activity was determined in the Caco-2 cell extracts as previously described (13Gassama-Diagne A. Hullin-Matsuda F. Li R.Y. Nauze M. Ragab A. Pons V. Delagebeaudeuf C. Simon M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol.

These cells have proven to be the most useful in vitro model because of their unique ability to spontaneously differentiate at confluence, displaying morphological and functional characteristics of enterocytes (26Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar). We thus analyzed the β1 integrin expression pattern during the confluence-induced differentiation of Caco-2 cells. After 7 days, the cells reached confluence and began to express the intestinal differentiation marker, alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1A). As expected, Western blot analysis showed a marked decrease of β1 integrin subunits beginning at day 14 (Fig. 1B), which correlated with the appearance of the 65-kDa Ent-1 protein. As previously reported (13Gassama-Diagne A. Hullin-Matsuda F. Li R.Y. Nauze M. Ragab A. Pons V. Delagebeaudeuf C. Simon M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, we had previously observed a similar correlation between Ent-1 expression and EGFR decrease during Caco-2 cell differentiation (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R.

Then cell surface β1 integrin subunits were immunolabeled and specifically measured in the transfected cell population by flow cytometry. Interestingly, after 72 h of transfection, overexpression of Ent-1 induced a significant decrease of ∼25% of plasma membrane β1 integrin subunits, compared with the GFP-transfected cell population used as control (Fig. 2A). Conversely, overexpressed SNX1 was unable to decrease plasma membrane β1 integrin subunit pool (Fig. 2A). Thus, our results indicate that Ent-1 could down-regulate not only the cell surface EGFR as we previously demonstrated (14Pons V. Hullin-Matsuda F. Nauze M. Barbaras R. Peres C. Collet X. Perret B. Chap H. Gassama-Diagne A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but also cell surface β1 integrin subunits.Fig. 2Ent-1 enhances the decrease of β1 integrin subunits in Caco-2 cells.A, undifferentiated Caco-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1 (stippled bar), pEGFP-C1-SNX1 (hatched bar), or empty vector (control, black bar) and grown for 72 h. The cells were then labeled with monoclonal anti-β1 integrin (K20) primary antibody and RPE-conjugated secondary antibody. The relative density of cell surface β1 integrin subunit was specifically evaluated in the transfected cell population by flow cytometry. The percentage of cell surface β1 integrin was measured by RPE fluorescence mean and compared with the GFP-transfected cell population used as a control. The values represented the mean and standard error of at least three independent experiments. The results were analyzed by a paired t test and were considered significantly different from control cells (***, p < 0.00005) or nonsignificantly different (ns). B, equal amounts of proteins from transfected cell extracts were separated and analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 integrin antibody (anti-cyto-β1) and monoclonal anti-β actin antibody for loading control. Lane 1, empty vector; lane 2, GFP-Ent-1; lane 3, GFP-SNX1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further document the β1 integrin diminution, transfected Caco-2 cells were also analyzed by immunoblotting after 72 h of transfection (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the flow cytometry data, we observed that Ent-1 induced a marked decrease of β1 integrin subunit expression compared with the GFP-transfected control cells, whereas SNX1 did not. Altogether, these results suggest that Ent-1 contributed to the down-regulation of β1 integrin subunits in intestinal cells.Enterophilin-1 Induces α5β1 and α2β1 Integrin Variations in Caco-2 Cells—α5β1 integrin is largely involved in the proliferative status of intestinal crypt cells. However, other changes in β1 integrins such as α2β1 integrin were also monitored in vivo during epithelial intestinal differentiation. We thus checked for the effect of Ent-1 on both α5β1 and α2β1 integrins in Caco-2 cells. We first verified that in the Caco-2 cell model, both integrins displayed the same variations of expression as reported during in vivo intestinal differentiation. Equal amounts of proteins from undifferentiated (day 4) and fully differentiated (day 23) Caco-2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-α5 or anti-α2 subunit antibody (Fig. 3A). We thus confirmed that α5 and α2 subunits, like the β1 subunits (Fig. 1B), were highly expressed in undifferentiated proliferative Caco-2 cells, but they were strongly decreased in differentiated cells.Fig. 3Ent-1 induces a significant decrease of α5β1 integrin and a slighter diminution of α2β1 integrin in Caco-2 cells.A, equal amounts of proteins from undifferentiated (lanes 1 and 3, day 4 after plating) and differentiated (lanes 2 and 4, day 23 after plating) Caco-2 cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. α5 or α2 integrin was detected with monoclonal anti-α5 or anti-α2 integrin antibody. B, nonconfluent Caco-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1 (stippled bar), pEGFP-C1-SNX1 (hatched bar), or empty vector (control, black bar) and grown for 72 h. The cells were then labeled with monoclonal anti-α5β1 integrin (P1D6) or anti-α2β1 integrin (P1E6) primary antibody and RPE-conjugated secondary antibody and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cell surface α5β1 or α2β1 integrin in the transfected cell population was measured by RPE fluorescence mean and compared with the GFP-transfected cell population used as control, as explained in Fig. 2. The values represented the means and standard errors of three independent experiments. The results were analyzed by paired t test and were considered significantly different from control cells (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01) or nonsignificantly different (ns). C, equal amounts of proteins from transfected cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. α5 or α2 integrin subunits were detected with monoclonal anti-α5 or anti-α2 integrin antibody.

Undifferentiated Caco-2 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-Ent-1, pEGFP-C1-SNX1, or empty vector for 72 h, and cell surface integrins were immunolabeled and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. The results showed a significant 30% decrease of the plasma membrane pool of α5β1 integrins in Ent-1-transfected cells, compared with the GFP-transfected control cells (Fig. 3B, left panel), whereas a weaker diminution (∼15%) was observed for α2β1 integrin (Fig. 3B, right panel). Conversely, as shown in Fig. 2A, overexpressed SNX1 induced no change on cell surface α5β1 or α2β1 integrins (Fig. 3B).Additionally, α5 or α2 integrin expression patterns were evaluated by immunoblotting in transfected Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3C). Concordant with flow cytometry analysis, Ent-1-transfected cell extracts displayed a lower level of α5 integrin subunit compared with the"
