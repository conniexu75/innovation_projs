Barrett's metaplasia is recapitulated in p63 null mouse embryos The metaplasia arises from an embryonic epithelium rather than transdifferentiation A similar population of residual embryonic cells persists in adult mice and humans Modeling tissue damage that triggers Barrett's causes migration of embryonic cells Esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma together kill more than a million people each year. Both cancers arise in association with chronic inflammation and are preceded by robust metaplasia with intestinal cell characteristics. Gastric intestinal metaplasia is linked to H. pylori infection, whereas Barrett's metaplasia of the esophagus can be triggered by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although H. pylori suppression therapies have contributed to the recent decline of gastric adenocarcinoma, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, especially in the West, has increased dramatically in the past several decades (Spechler and Goyal, 1986Spechler S.J.

Treatments for late stages of these diseases are challenging and largely palliative, therefore considerable efforts have focused on understanding the earlier, precancerous stages of these diseases as a prerequisite to developing therapeutic approaches. Intestine-like metaplasia is characterized by a columnar epithelium containing prominent goblet cells and cells expressing intestinal markers such as villin and trefoil factors (TFF1–3). Once established, this metaplasia appears to be irreversible without ablative treatments (Naef et al., 1975Naef A.P. Savary M. Ozzello L.

The ontogeny of these metaplasias remains an intriguing mystery with cogent support for hypotheses suggesting transcommitment of resident squamous stem cells, migration of cells from lower gastrointestinal sites, colonization by circulating bone marrow cells, or the reparative emergence of submucosal glands (Souza et al., 2008Souza R.F.

In p63 null embryos, stratified epithelial tissues are lost or eroded several days after stratification due to the loss of regenerative cell populations (Yang et al., 1998Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y.

Indeed the p63 null embryos have been reported to have idiopathic metaplastic changes in both the esophagus and proximal stomach, two normally squamous tissues in the mouse (Yang et al., 1999Yang A.

This mouse rapidly develops metaplasia with the hallmarks of Barrett's esophagus. We examined the molecular properties and evolution of the metaplasia in p63 null embryos to understand its origins and applied this information to adult mouse models, testing the emergence of Barrett's metaplasia. p63 embryos develop to term but show absent or dysmorphic stratified epithelia including epidermis, breast, prostate, and thymus at birth (Yang et al., 1999Yang A.

To determine whether similar events occur in the squamous epithelia of the esophagus and proximal stomach of p63 null embryos, we examined these regions by histology. The squamocolumnar junction present at the distal esophagus in humans is shifted posteriorly in mice due to an extension of squamous epithelium to the gastric midline, as marked by the limit of p63 immunohistochemistry (Figures 1A and 1B ). Although the wild-type embryonic day (E) 18 embryo has a mature squamous epithelium in the proximal stomach, the p63 null embryo shows a remarkably well-developed columnar epithelium at this site (Figure 1C and Figure S1 available online). Barrett's esophagus in humans also lacks p63 staining unlike adjacent squamous tissues where p63 strongly decorates basal nuclei (Glickman et al., 2001Glickman J.N. Chen Y.Y. Wang H.H. Antonioli D.A. Odze R.D. Phenotypic characteristics of a distinctive multilayered epithelium suggests that it is a precursor in the development of Barrett's esophagus.Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 2001; 25: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D, top panel). Antibodies to keratin 8 stain human Barrett's esophagus as well as the metaplasia in the p63 null mouse (Figure 1D, bottom panel and Figure S1). Other similarities between human Barrett's esophagus and the metaplasia in the p63 null mouse are the positive staining with Alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), typical histological markers of goblet-like cells (Figure 1E). We probed the metaplasia and control tissues for known markers (Wang et al., 2009Wang J. Qin R. Ma Y. Wu H. Peters H. Tyska M. Shaheen N.J. Chen X.

The histological similarity between the observed metaplasia in p63 null embryos and Barrett's esophagus in humans drove us to investigate these tissues at a molecular level.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) High-magnification histological images of proximal stomach of wild-type E18 embryo showing squamous epithelium (left) and p63 null E18 embryo showing metaplastic epithelium (right).(B) Immunofluorescence micrograph of section of stomach of p63 null, E18 embryo showing distribution of villin (green) and Agr2 (red) (top panel) and keratin 8 (green; middle panel).

We compared the gene expression profile of the metaplastic epithelia with those of specific regions of the gastrointestinal tract in mutant and wild-type animals, comparing RNA from microdissected tissues on expression microarray chips. These data revealed that the wild-type and p63 null colon, small intestine, and distal stomach formed concordant pairs of overall gene expression (Figure 2A ). In contrast, comparisons of gene expression between wild-type and p63 null proximal stomach revealed stark differences, suggesting that the cells in the observed metaplasia were clearly distinct from those in normal squamous epithelia at this site (Figure 2A). Moreover, an unsupervised correlation analysis of the whole genome expression profiles of tissues in the p63 null embryos indicated only passing relationships between the metaplastic tissue and the small intestine (Figure 2B), suggesting that this metaplasia is a unique entity unrelated to other major tissues of the normal mouse gastrointestinal tract. The distinction between the metaplasia and the small intestine is underscored by examining gene expression on a global level as in the correlation coefficient analysis as well as a selected set of genes expressed in the metaplasia and small intestine (Figure 2C). Thus although many genes linked to intestinal metaplasia found in Barrett's are present in the p63 null metaplasia, many others, including Caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2), are not. A comparison of Cdx2 expression by microarray intensity across the wild-type and p63 null tissues of the gastrointestinal tract revealed Cdx2 expression restricted to the small intestine and colon of these mice (Figure S2). Cdx2 has been strongly implicated in the developmental determination of the intestinal track where it behaves as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and key regulator of intestinal differentiation and proliferation (Suh and Traber, 1996Suh E. Traber P.G. An intestine-specific homeobox gene regulates proliferation and differentiation.Mol. Cell.

Homeosis and intestinal tumours in Cdx2 mutant mice.Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Significantly, ectopic expression of Cdx2 in parietal cells resulted in an intestinal metaplasia of transgenic mice, suggesting a dominant role for this transcription factor in the transcommitment to intestinal programs (Mutoh et al., 2002Mutoh H. Hakamata Y. Sato K. Eda A. Yanaka I. Honda S. Osawa H. Kaneko Y. Sugano K. Conversion of gastric mucosa to intestinal metaplasia in Cdx2-expressing transgenic mice.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 470-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, a recent analysis of Barrett's esophagus by expression microarray did not reveal enhanced levels of Cdx2 in Barrett's over that of normal esophageal squamous epithelium (Stairs et al., 2008Stairs D.B. Nakagawa H. Klein-Szanto A. Mitchell S.D. Silberg D.G. Tobias J.W. Lynch J.P. Rustgi A.K. Cdx1 and c-Myc foster the initiation of transdifferentiation of the normal esophageal squamous epithelium toward Barrett's esophagus.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cdx2 expression can only be weakly detected in 30%–70% of Barrett's tissues and only becomes strong in cases involving dysplasia (van Baal et al., 2008van Baal J.W. Bozikas A. Pronk R. Ten Kate F.J.

Comparison of six immunohistochemical markers for the histologic diagnosis of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.Virchows Arch. 2010; 457: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Moreover, a comparison between human Barrett's esophagus and human small intestine shows a similar divide in gene expression as we found between the p63 null metaplasia and the murine small intestine (Figure S2). Together, these data argue that both Barrett's esophagus and the p63 null metaplasia are different entities from other regions of the gastrointestinal tract.Figure S2Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Relative hybridization intensity of Cdx2 probes on expression microarrays probed with RNA from esophagus (ES), proximal stomach (PS), distal stomach (DS), small intestine (SI), and large intestine (LI) from wild-type (WT) and p63 null (KO) E18 embryos.(B) Heatmaps of p63 null metaplasia and Barrett's esophagus versus esophagus and small intestine.

We next asked how the gene expression differences between wild-type and p63 null proximal stomach compared with two available, independent datasets (Stairs et al., 2008Stairs D.B. Nakagawa H.

A broad comparison of the mouse datasets with the two human Barrett's datasets showed a strong correlation between the genes differentially expressed in the metaplasia of the p63 null mouse and those differentially expressed in Barrett's esophagus compared with normal human esophagus (Figure 2D, heatmaps). Interestingly, we found a remarkable similarity in the overlapping genes in the two human datasets (Figure 2D, Venn diagrams), even though the Barrett's dataset #1 (Stairs et al., 2008Stairs D.B. Nakagawa H. Klein-Szanto A. Mitchell S.D. Silberg D.G. Tobias J.W. Lynch J.P. Rustgi A.K. Cdx1 and c-Myc foster the initiation of transdifferentiation of the normal esophageal squamous epithelium toward Barrett's esophagus.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was from Barrett's biopsies whereas the Barrett's dataset #2 was from metaplasias of patients who had progressed to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Kimchi et al., 2005Kimchi E.T. Posner M.C. Park J.O. Darga T.E. Kocherginsky M. Karrison T. Hart J. Smith K.D. Mezhir J.J. Weichselbaum R.R. Khodarev N.N. Progression of Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma is associated with the suppression of the transcriptional programs of epidermal differentiation.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3146-3154PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed of the top 50 genes overrepresented in the metaplasia of the mouse proximal stomach, approximately 50% of those present on the human arrays were overrepresented in both Barrett's esophagus datasets compared with normal human esophagus (1.5-fold cutoff, p < 0.05; Figure 2E; Table S2). Within these common genes were many of the markers established for Barrett's esophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia (Wang et al., 2009Wang J. Qin R. Ma Y. Wu H. Peters H. Tyska M. Shaheen N.J. Chen X. Differential gene expression in normal esophagus and Barrett's esophagus.J. Gastroenterol. 2009; 44: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, Botelho et al., 2010Botelho N.K.

Gene expression alterations in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2010; 10: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In fact, the fold-change in these genes in the p63 null metaplasia (mucin 4 [Muc4, 73×], keratin 20 [Krt20, 61×], trefoil factor 2 [TFF2, 49×], claudin 3 [Cldn3, 46×], Agr2 [120×], and Vil1 [27×]; p < 10−5 for all) greatly exceeded those in the Barrett's datasets (Table S2). We used antibodies to Agr2 and Vil1 to validate some of these genes, and both showed robust staining of the metaplastic tissue in the p63 null proximal stomach (cf. Figure S1). To validate some of these markers upregulated in the metaplasia of the p63 null mouse with human Barrett's esophagus, we stained sections of 16 cases of Barrett's esophagus and controls with antibodies to human keratin 7 (Krt7), keratin 8 (Krt8), Vil1, Cldn3, Fc fragment of IgG-binding protein (FCGBP), Muc4, and Agr2. All 16 Barrett's esophagus cases were positive for all of these markers, whereas antibodies to p63 showed staining restricted to squamous islands (Figure S3). Finally, we compared the gene expression datasets of the murine metaplasia and the human Barrett's esophagus at the level of gene ontology. Of the 63 gene ontology (GO) categories significantly (p < 0.01) represented in the metaplasia of the mice and the 42 identified for Barrett's esophagus, 34% or 54% were in common (Figure S3; Table S3). These findings, although broadly based, suggest that similar processes are occurring in the cells of the p63 null metaplasia and those of Barrett's esophagus. In an effort to clarify the source of the epithelial metaplasia observed in the E18 p63 null mouse, we traced markers common to both Barrett's esophagus and our metaplasia retrospectively through embryonic development. Antibodies to Cldn3, Krt7, Krt8, carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4), and Muc4 were used to trace the metaplasia from E19 to E13 (Figure 3A ; Figure S4). Each of these markers could be traced in the proximal stomach of the E13/E14 p63 null mouse to a monolayer of cells lining the proximal stomach. Curiously, whereas Cldn3, Krt7, Krt8, and Muc4 signals became weaker as one approached E13, the Car4 antibody signal was more robust and broadly expressed on this monolayer of cells at E13. When we compared the Car4 staining pattern on the p63 null and wild-type proximal stomach at E13, both yielded a similarly appearing, Car4-expressing columnar epithelium (Figure 3B). Thus the Car4-positive, columnar epithelium at E13 must represent a ground state for the metaplasia that emerges later in the proximal stomach of the p63 null mice.Figure S4Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Tracking Muc4 expression in sections of proximal stomach of p63 null embryos through indicated days of development using antibodies to Muc4 by immunofluorescence.(B) Absence of squamous differentiation in p63 null metaplasia.

Why do the p63 null embryos go on to develop a Barrett's-like metaplasia while the wild-type embryos do not? p63 is a transcription factor required for long-term self-renewal of stem cells of stratified epithelia but not for their commitment to stem cells nor for their differentiation (Yang et al., 1998Yang A.

We performed parallel exome sequencing of 237 channel genes in a well-characterized human sample, comparing variant profiles of unaffected individuals to those with the most common neuronal excitability disorder, sporadic idiopathic epilepsy. Rare missense variation in known Mendelian disease genes is prevalent in both groups at similar complexity, revealing that even deleterious ion channel mutations confer uncertain risk to an individual depending on the other variants with which they are combined. Our findings indicate that variant discovery via large scale sequencing efforts is only a first step in illuminating the complex allelic architecture underlying personal disease risk. We propose that in silico modeling of channel variation in realistic cell and network models will be crucial to future strategies assessing mutation profile pathogenicity and drug response in individuals with a broad spectrum of excitability disorders.

Mutations in multiple channel disease genes are common in unaffected individuals Personal disease risk is embedded in complex variant patterns Patterns are sufficiently rich to explain the silence of pathological alleles Computational modeling of biological networks is needed for better risk prediction Voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels comprise one of the largest and best-understood functional groups of proteins, with over 400 members spanning nearly 1% of the human genome. Channels are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, and extensive evolutionary, anatomical, biophysical, and pharmacological information on key pore-forming and regulatory subunits in each family is available (Jegla et al., 2009Jegla T.J.

Ion channels are multimeric protein complexes expressed in cell type-specific combinations and exert unique yet functionally overlapping control over excitability and signaling in both the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles. Despite this essential role, nearly half of channel genes are unstudied, and their broader involvement in non-current-related transmembrane and nuclear signaling pathways remains largely unexplored (Kaczmarek, 2006Kaczmarek L.K.

Their central position in the biology and therapy of excitability disorders, combined with the imminent arrival of gene-directed medicine, provides compelling reasons to explore genomic variation in this exemplary gene set in order to correctly diagnose, predict, and treat a broad spectrum of common human disease (Tucker et al., 2009Tucker T.

Population-based studies can provide a statistical measure of genetic risk as well as implicate novel disease loci, but individualized disease prediction requires identifying how genetic variants contribute to risk in a single individual (Durbin et al., 2010Durbin R.M.

For many common disorders, beginning with cancer (Knudson et al., 1975Knudson Jr., A.G. Hethcote H.W. Brown B.W. Mutation and childhood cancer: a probabilistic model for the incidence of retinoblastoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 5116-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), it has long been hypothesized that the appearance and severity of the disorder are a simple result of the net accumulation of genetic variants or “hits” in a disease pathway, where crossing an undefined risk threshold divides affected from unaffected individuals (Fraser, 1976Fraser F.C. The multifactorial/threshold concept — uses and misuses.Teratology. 1976; 14: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Wray and Goddard, 2010Wray N.R. Goddard M.E. Multi-locus models of genetic risk of disease.Genome Med. 2010; 2: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). While recent data suggest that this assumption may hold true in some neurological disorders (Davis et al., 2011Davis E.E. Zhang Q. Liu Q. Diplas B.H. Davey L.M. Hartley J. Stoetzel C. Szymanska K. Ramaswami G. Logan C.V. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramTTC21B contributes both causal and modifying alleles across the ciliopathy spectrum.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is less clear in the case of ion channels, which display extensive overlapping compensatory control of membrane excitability, as well as dynamic homeostatic regulation during brain development and disease (Marder and Tang, 2010Marder E. Tang L.S. Coordinating different homeostatic processes.Neuron. 2010; 66: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we performed comparisons of exomic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles, including the type, relative burden, and pattern of variants within a large ion channel candidate gene set between healthy unaffected individuals and those with severe neurological excitability disease to evaluate personal genetic liability, and explored the value of computational models to assist in personal risk prediction. Epilepsy with no known cause (idiopathic epilepsy [IE]) is an ideal condition to study the impact of sporadic genetic channel variation on cortical function, as seizure disorders affect 1%–2% of the population, and analyses of the rare Mendelian forms reveal that ion channels are major determinants of the phenotype, since 17/20 confirmed monogenic syndromes arise in individuals heterozygous for a SNP in a channel subunit gene (Reid et al., 2009Reid C.A. Berkovic S.F. Petrou S. Mechanisms of human inherited epilepsies.Prog. Neurobiol. 2009; 87: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We observed remarkable genetic complexity and overlapping patterns of both rare and common variants in known excitability disease genes across both populations, indicating that the potential for clinical expression of these common disorders is embedded in the fabric of all human genomes. A single-cell computational model of even the simplest pairwise interaction of two channel mutations reveals the unpredictability of their collective electrical signature. Given the extent of individual variation within this large gene family, scaling of multigenic combinatorial functional assays to accurately reflect neural network behavior is impractical. Therefore, personalized ion channel disease prediction will require the integration of genomic profiles with single-cell proteomics and computational modeling of dynamic circuit behavior to translate unique channel variant portfolios into more informative predictors of personal risk for excitability disorders. We performed targeted Sanger sequencing of the coding regions of 237 ion channel subunit genes to expand novel SNP discovery within known pathogenic channels, their nearest phylogenetic relatives, and others previously unexplored by medical resequencing. We examined exonic variation in 139 healthy, neurologically unaffected adults and 152 individuals of similar age and race with IE. The ion channel gene list (Table S1 available online) and comprehensive validated SNP data (Table S2) are provided in the Supplemental Information. We analyzed more than 9 million base pair reads, yielding 11,102 SNPs (Table S3). From these we assembled a validated dataset of 3095 SNPs that included all SNP types in similar proportions to those observed in the unvalidated set (Table 1 and Table S3). Not all known members of the 400+ gene family nor their still ill-defined promoter regions could be included for sequencing, and only the first 50 bp of flanking intronic regions were examined. Insertions and deletions (Indels) and copy number variants (CNVs) were not reliably detected. While we considered only exonic SNPs for subsequent evaluation, much variation occurred in the noncoding regions (introns, untranslated regions [UTRs], and promoters), which can nevertheless lead to altered gene transcription (McDaniell et al., 2010McDaniell R. Lee B.K. Song L. Liu Z. Boyle A.P. Erdos M.R. Scott L.J. Morken M.A. Kucera K.S. Battenhouse A. et al.Heritable individual-specific and allele-specific chromatin signatures in humans.Science. 2010; 328: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, despite extensive sequence information, our data significantly underestimates the potential density of variants per gene, as well as the extent of variation in each individual's ion channel sequence variation profile (“channotype”).Table 1Summary of Validated Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in 237 Ion Channel Genes Profiled in Cases of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy and Neurologically Normal IndividualsNumber of Validated SNPs per Megabases SequencedfThe number of individual SNPs per megabase sequenced does not reflect the SNP frequency.Type/Location of SNPNumber of Validated SNPsaValidated SNPs are SNPs are those that were confirmed through a combination of (1) visual validation, (2) previous discovery (dbSNP ID), (3) detected on a custom MIP chip, and (4) Biotage and/or 454 sequencing.Percent of Validated Data Set (%)Number of Novel SNPs DiscoveredCases Only (n = 152)Controls Only (n = 139)SNPs in Both Cases and Controls (n = 291)PromoterbSNPs in promoter regions are reported as such if the promoter for the gene is known and defined in our gene models.802.6180.40.10.45′ UTR792.670.20.10.53′ UTR46114.9621.40.63.0Synonymous (sSNP)93630.23515.12.24.2Nonsynonymous (nsSNP)66821.64154.92.21.9Nonsense/stop codon9<190.10.030Splice site SNPcSplice site (+2 to –2 bp from the defined exon boundary at/near the splice junction).12<190.10.030.02Splice region SNPdSplice region (–2 to –15 bp from the defined exon boundary, located in the intron, from the splice junction).902.9130.30.10.6Intron SNP73723.81012.31.04.7UndefinedeUndefined SNPs are SNP detected in regions that are not defined in our gene models.23<140.100.2Totals3095100.098914.66.315.6See also Figure S1 and Table S1.

Count of SNP Type by Gene as Enumerated in Table 1, Related to Table 1. First, we evaluated the variation in channel genes, including known alternatively spliced isoforms, in our validated data set. We discovered 989 novel SNPs, of which 351 are synonymous SNPs (sSNPs), 415 are nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), and nine are nonsense mutations (Table 1). Of these novel SNPs, 387 were “rare,” defined as present in a solitary individual when more than 145 individuals were genotyped at that position (<1% minor allele frequency [MAF]). The largest genes (Figure S1 and Table S4), RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3, were among those with the most variation (95, 88, and 57 SNPs, respectively). The smallest, HTR1B, had six SNPs, including three novel nsSNPs. Collectively, these data expand the known channel SNP lists in dbSNP and confirm the existence of rare allelic variation across a broad spectrum of ion channel genes. The rich variation agrees with that emerging from whole-genome sequencing of individuals (Durbin et al., 2010Durbin R.M. Abecasis G.R. Altshuler D.L. Auton A. Brooks L.D. Durbin R.M. Gibbs R.A.

An individual's channotype is apparently unique; in our small cohort, we found that no individuals were free of SNPs, and no two channotypes among 291 individuals were identical (Figure 1). Across both groups, we found an overlapping variety of SNP types, including sSNPs, nsSNPs, and SNPs in promoter, coding, UTR, and intronic regions. Nonsense SNPs were observed in both populations. We found SNPs in both groups for every targeted gene; of the validated SNPs, 1355 were unique to either population and the majority (1740) were shared (Table 1).Figure 1Multiple Variants Render Each Individual Channotype UniqueShow full caption(A) Low-resolution (gray background) 3D representations illustrating the most extreme channotypes present in the study cohort (two cases and two controls, each with > 450 SNPs).

Truncated channel proteins resulting from nonsense mutations can cause epilepsy (Claes et al., 2001Claes L. Del-Favero J. Ceulemans B. Lagae L. Van Broeckhoven C. De Jonghe P.

Genet. 2001; 68: 1327-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Similarly, splice site mutations are implicated in channel disease due to dropout of exons from the coding messenger RNA (mRNA) (Tsuji et al., 2007Tsuji K. Akao M. Ishii T.M. Ohno S. Makiyama T. Takenaka K. Doi T. Haruna Y. Yoshida H. Nakashima T. et al.Mechanistic basis for the pathogenesis of long QT syndrome associated with a common splicing mutation in KCNQ1 gene.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2007; 42: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although variants of these most functionally “severe” types rarely occur in our data set, the four nonsense and eight splice site variants with an observed MAF < 0.05 appeared to be enriched in the IE group (Table 1). We randomly shuffled all genotype class labels, one SNP at a time, and then tallied the variants by group again, this time under the null hypothesis. After 10,000 such permutations, a comparison of the observed tally against the null distribution resulted in a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.11. These results indicate that the numerical enrichment observed when comparing rare severe SNPs between cases and controls occurs more than 11% of the time by random chance alone. To test whether other SNP types were involved, we expanded the number of SNPs considered functionally severe by biochemical classification. We examined all missense SNPs for their relative rarity and then used a Blosum80 substitution matrix to score the amino acid substitution caused by the nsSNP as a predictor of its potential to alter ion channel behavior (Table S2 and Figure S2). Analysis of missense SNPs with MAF < 0.05 yielded 205 nsSNPs in the predicted deleterious range (−6 to 0). When these SNPs were included in the permutation analysis with the nonsense and splice site SNPs, the results again did not reach significance (FDR = 0.59). Increasing the stringency to evaluate only very rare severe SNPs (MAF < 0.01; n = 171) yielded a FDR of 0.50. Finally, we considered only very rare nsSNPs with a Blosum80 score of −6 (MAF < 0.01; n = 38) because these represent the most biochemically disruptive substitutions (e.g., Arg→Cys). After 2000 permutations, the FDR was 0.25. This increased stringency for the most destabilizing amino acid mutations still failed to reach significance. Collectively, this unbiased analysis of SNP severity in the coding regions of 237 ion channel genes from our small study population provides no evidence for an ion channel rare variant association in idiopathic epilepsy. We next compared variation within the 17 known ion channel genes causing familial human epilepsy (hEP genes) (Table S1). We found that 96.1% of cases and 66.9% of controls had a missense mutation in at least one known hEP gene. The finding of missense variants in disease-producing ion channels in unaffected individuals is not new. A smaller scale study of one ion channel (SCN5A) involved in the cardiac arrhythmia LQT3 syndrome revealed that ∼3% of 295 unaffected Caucasians have rare missense mutations in this gene (Ackerman et al., 2004Ackerman M.J. Splawski I. Makielski J.C. Tester D.J. Will M.L. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Jones G. Chadha M. Burrow C.R. et al.Spectrum and prevalence of cardiac sodium channel variants among black, white, Asian, and Hispanic individuals: implications for arrhythmogenic susceptibility and Brugada/long QT syndrome genetic testing.Heart Rhythm. 2004; 1: 600-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, we found 300 missense channel variants in 139 unaffected individuals, 23 of which are in hEP genes, signaling that the variable penetrance of alleles in channelopathy is underappreciated (Figure 2). The R393H nsSNP in the ion selective pore of the SCN1A gene, believed to cause severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Claes et al., 2001Claes L. Del-Favero J. Ceulemans B. Lagae L. Van Broeckhoven C. De Jonghe P. De novo mutations in the sodium-channel gene SCN1A cause severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 1327-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), was also detected once in our study, and only in the control population. Interestingly, in vitro functional studies of this mutation failed to produce measurable sodium current (Ohmori et al., 2006Ohmori I. Kahlig K.M. Rhodes T.H. Wang D.W. George Jr., A.L. Nonfunctional SCN1A is common in severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy.Epilepsia. 2006; 47: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), indicating that deleterious alterations in protein structure in a known hEP gene are insufficient to predict risk of epilepsy. The unexpectedly common finding of missense mutations in known hEP genes in our control cohort supports a biophysical model that other subunits, as yet unrelated to epilepsy, may constitute genetic excitability modifiers and provides direct evidence validating the multigenic basis for complex inheritance of channelopathy phenotypes. An attractive mechanism relating monogenic familial epilepsy to multigenic sporadic IE is the load hypothesis, which suggests that if IE is the result of accumulating mutations of small effect in known disease genes, then the “load” or summation"

However, the role of ATF-2 in chromatin assembly in higher organisms remains unknown. This study reveals that Drosophila ATF-2 (dATF-2) is required for heterochromatin assembly, whereas the stress-induced phosphorylation of dATF-2, via Mekk1-p38, disrupts heterochromatin. The dATF-2 protein colocalized with HP1, not only on heterochromatin but also at specific loci in euchromatin. Heat shock or osmotic stress induced phosphorylation of dATF-2 and resulted in its release from heterochromatin. This heterochromatic disruption was an epigenetic event that was transmitted to the next generation in a non-Mendelian fashion. When embryos were exposed to heat stress over multiple generations, the defective chromatin state was maintained over multiple successive generations, though it gradually returned to the normal state. The results suggest a mechanism by which the effects of stress are inherited epigenetically via the regulation of a tight chromatin structure.

Evidence has suggested that stress elicits a transgenerational modification of the genome without a corresponding change in DNA sequence, a process known as epigenetic change. Ultraviolet (UV) light stress leads to increased homologous recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana, even in unstressed generations (Molinier et al., 2006Molinier J. Ries G. Zipfel C. Hohn B. Transgeneration memory of stress in plants.Nature. 2006; 442: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), while maternal diet influences the epigenetic state of a transposable element in the agouti gene of Avy mice, as well as the phenotypes of the F1 offspring (Waterland and Jirtle, 2003Waterland R.A. Jirtle R.L. Transposable elements: targets for early nutritional effects on epigenetic gene regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5293-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that increased pup grooming and nursing by rat mothers alters the epigenetic status of a glucocorticoid receptor gene and the behavioral phenotype of the offspring (Weaver et al., 2004Weaver I.C. Cervoni N. Champagne F.A. D'Alessio A.C. Sharma S. Seckl J.R. Dymov S. Szyf M. Meaney M.J. Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior.Nat.

Furthermore, it was recently shown that paternal high-fat diet or low-protein diet exposure induced altered gene expression in offspring (Ng et al., 2010Ng S.F. Lin R.C. Laybutt D.R. Barres R.

Heterochromatin, which is enriched in histone H3 lysine-9 (H3K9) methylation and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), controls gene silencing epigenetically. Recent studies have demonstrated that, in addition to the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery (Volpe et al., 2002Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Regulation of heterochromatic silencing and histone H3 lysine-9 methylation by RNAi.Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), Atf1, the fission yeast homolog of activation transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), functions in heterochromatin nucleation (Jia et al., 2004Jia S. Noma K. Grewal S.I. RNAi-independent heterochromatin nucleation by the stress-activated ATF/CREB family proteins.Science. 2004; 304: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). ATF-2 is a member of the ATF/CREB superfamily and has a b-ZIP-type DNA-binding domain and a transactivation domain containing phosphorylation sites for stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) such as p38 (Maekawa et al., 1989Maekawa T. Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sudo T. Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S.

Transcription factor ATF cDNA clones: an extensive family of leucine zipper proteins able to selectively form DNA-binding heterodimers.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). ATF-2 forms a homo- or heterodimer with c-Jun and binds to the cyclic AMP response element (CRE). In response to various stresses, SAPKs phosphorylate ATF-2 and enhance its transactivating capacity (Gupta et al., 1995Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Transcription factor ATF2 regulation by the JNK signal transduction pathway.Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). In addition to ATF-2, the mammalian ATF-2 subfamily contains two other members, ATF-7 and CRE-BPa, while Drosophila has only one homolog of ATF-2 (dATF-2) (Sano et al., 2005Sano Y. Akimaru H. Okamura T. Nagao T. Okada M. Ishii S. Drosophila activating transcription factor-2 is involved in stress response via activation by p38, but not c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2934-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both ATF-7 and dATF-2 are phosphorylated by p38, but not by JNK, suggesting that dATF-2 is functionally related to ATF-7. ATF-7 binds to the mAM component of the ESET complex (Wang et al., 2003Wang H. An W. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Chatton B. Tempst P. Roeder R.G. Zhang Y. mAM facilitates conversion by ESET of dimethyl to trimethyl lysine 9 of histone H3 to cause transcriptional repression.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), a histone H3K9 methyltransferase, and silences the transcription of the serotonin receptor 5b (Htr5b) gene by recruiting ESET (Maekawa et al., 2010Maekawa T. Kim S. Nakai D. Makino C. Takagi T. Ogura H. Yamada K. Chatton B. Ishii S. Social isolation stress induces ATF-7 phosphorylation and impairs silencing of the 5-HT 5B receptor gene.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ATF-2 family members may contribute to the epigenetic silencing of certain euchromatic target genes by forming a heterochromatin-like structure in the absence of stress, while they induce gene expression in response to stress. However, the role of ATF-2 in heterochromatin formation in higher organisms remains unknown. In this study, we show that dATF-2 is involved in heterochromatin formation and that stress-induced activation of dATF-2 disrupts heterochromatin. Furthermore, the effect of stress-induced heterochromatin disruption can be inherited by subsequent generations. One of the insertion lines of the piggyBac (PB) transposon (Thibault et al., 2004Thibault S.T. Singer M.A. Miyazaki W.Y. Milash B. Dompe N.A. Singh C.M. Buchholz R. Demsky M. Fawcett R. Francis-Lang H.L. et al.A complementary transposon tool kit for Drosophila melanogaster using P and piggyBac.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), PB-c06407, has an insertion close to the dATF-2 locus, 69 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of dATF-2. Levels of dATF-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) were severely reduced in PB-c06407 flies compared to the wild-type (WT) (Figure 1A ), and the dATF-2 protein band was barely detectable on a western blot of extracts from PB-c06407 embryos (Figure S1A available online). Therefore, PB-c06407 was chosen as the dATF-2 mutant and was renamed dATF-2PB.Figure S1Decreased dATF-2 Protein Levels in the dATF-2 Mutant and Effect of dATF-2 Mutation on Heterochromatin at Other Loci, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) dATF-2 protein levels in the dATF-2PB mutant. Proteins were extracted from the chromatin pellet fraction of wild-type and dATF-2PB embryos and used for Western blotting with the anti-dATF-2 antibody that was raised against the PE-full-length dATF-2 fusion protein (Sano et al., 2005Sano Y.

Two genes next to the white gene are shown schematically. Total RNA was prepared from the flies with the indicated genotype, and mRNA levels were measured.

The CG32795 mRNA levels in the wm4 line were enhanced by the dATF-2 mutation: however, it has been reported that CG32795 is not repressed by heterochromatin in two wm4 lines (Vogel et al., 2009Vogel, M.J., Pagie, L., Talhout, W., Nieuwland, M., Kerkhoven, R.M., and van Steensel, B. (2009). High-resolution mapping of heterochromatin redistribution in a Drosophila position-effect variegation model. Epigenetics Chromatin 2, 1–18.Google Scholar). One possible reason for this discrepancy could be differences in the genetic backgrounds. In the present study, the wild-type and the dATF-2 mutant had similar genetic backgrounds because backcrossing was repeated. However, in the study by Vogel, HP1 binding and mRNA levels in wm4 and Oregon-R-S were compared, and it was unclear whether or not these flies had similar genetic backgrounds. In fact, they noticed a small increase (∼1.2-fold) in HP1 binding ratios on chromosome 4, which could have been due to differences in the genetic backgrounds.(C) The dATF-2 mutation also disrupts heterochromatin on other chromosomes. The effect of the dATF-2 mutation on white gene expression was examined using the 118E-15 and 118E-10 lines, in which a hsp70-white transgene is inserted at the telomeric and centromeric regions of the fourth chromosome, respectively, and 39-C12 lines in which the transgene was inserted in the banded region of the fourth chromosome. As the control, similar experiments were performed using the 39C-X line, in which a hsp70-white transgene is inserted in euchromatin at cytological region 2D on the X chromosome.

(E) The dATF-2 mutant does not exhibit the abnormal morphology of egg shell structures. The number of eggs with a normal (two) or abnormal (one or 0) number of dorsal appendages was counted. The effect of the dATF-2 mutation on position effect variegation (PEV) was examined with the In(1)wm4 line (referred to hereafter as wm4), in which a large inversion juxtaposes the white gene close to centromeric heterochromatin on the X chromosome (Tartof et al., 1984Tartof K.D. Hobbs C. Jones M. A structural basis for variegating position effects.Cell. 1984; 37: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The wm4 line, established by backcrossing with w1118 for six generations, was used in the present study. dATF-2PB heterozygotes and homozygotes relieved white silencing in a dose-dependent manner, while dATF-2 mutation did not affect the expression of white gene in the original eucromatin region (Figure 1B and Figure S1B). The dATF-2 mutation also enhanced the expression of CG32795, which lies closer to heterochromatin than white in wm4, but did not enhance the expression of CG12498 (Figure S1B). For rescue experiments with transgenic flies expressing dATF-2, the In(3L)BL1 line carrying an hsp70-lacZ transgene juxtaposed with pericentric heterochromatin of the third chromosome (Lu et al., 1996Lu B.Y. Bishop C.P. Eissenberg J.C. Developmental timing and tissue specificity of heterochromatin-mediated silencing.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar) was used instead of wm4 because the dATF-2 transgenic flies carried the white marker. LacZ silencing was relieved in dATF-2PB homozygotes, while ectopic expression of dATF-2 prevented the relief of lacZ silencing (Figure 1C). dATF-2 mutation did not affect the hsp70-lacZ expression located in the euchromatin (P[W+ HS-lacZ](65E)). The loss of either one or two copies of dATF-2 also induced the derepression of white in lines 118E-15 and 118E-10, in which an hsp70-w transgene was inserted into the telomeric and centromeric regions of the fourth chromosome (Wallrath and Elgin, 1995Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C. Position effect variegation in Drosophila is associated with an altered chromatin structure.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), respectively (Figure S1D). Furthermore, the loss of two copies of dATF-2 interfered slightly with white gene silencing in line 39C-12, in which the transgene was inserted in the banded region of the fourth chromosome. dATF-2 mutation only slightly decreased the hsp70-w expression located in the euchromatin (39C-X), which could be due to the effect of the neighboring gene. Heterochromatin formation can be divided into two stages, establishment and maintenance (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I. Establishment and maintenance of a heterochromatin domain.Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), and yeast Atf1 is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin (Jia et al., 2004Jia S. Noma K. Grewal S.I. RNAi-independent heterochromatin nucleation by the stress-activated ATF/CREB family proteins.Science. 2004; 304: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Drosophila heterochromatin is established early in development, with contributions from some maternal proteins. The loss of either maternal or zygotic dATF-2 induced the derepression of white in wm4, and the loss of both maternal and zygotic dATF-2 had an additive effect (Figure 1D), which suggests that dATF-2 is involved in both the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. Yeast Atf-1 contributes to heterochromatin formation independently of the RNAi machinery (Jia et al., 2004Jia S. Noma K. Grewal S.I. RNAi-independent heterochromatin nucleation by the stress-activated ATF/CREB family proteins.Science. 2004; 304: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). When the mutation of spindle-E (spn-E), which encode a putative DEAD-box helicase (Aravin et al., 2001Aravin A.A. Naumova N.M. Tulin A.V. Vagin V.V. Rozovsky Y.M. Gvozdev V.A. Double-stranded RNA-mediated silencing of genomic tandem repeats and transposable elements in the D. melanogaster germline.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1017-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), was combined with the dATF-2 mutation, an additive effect was observed (Figure 1E). In the heterozygotes of aubergine (aub), which encode an Argonaute protein (Kennerdell et al., 2002Kennerdell J.R. Yamaguchi S. Carthew R.W. RNAi is activated during Drosophila oocyte maturation in a manner dependent on aubergine and spindle-E.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), white silencing was relieved slightly as reported (Kavi and Birchler, 2009Kavi H.H. Birchler J.A. Interaction of RNA polymerase II and the small RNA machinery affects heterochromatic silencing in Drosophila.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2009; 2: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this effect was enhanced in the transheterozygotes of aub and dATF-2. Thus, the results suggested that dATF-2 and the RNAi machinery contribute independently to heterochromatin formation. Mutations in spn-E and aub are known to induce a derepression of trasnposon elements, and exhibit an abnormal morphology of egg shell structures (abnormal number of dorsal appendage) and a reduced hatch rate (Khurana and Theurkauf, 2010Khurana J.S. Theurkauf W. piRNAs, transposon silencing, and Drosophila germline development.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the dATF-2 mutants exhibited no such phenotypes (Figures S1E and S1F), which suggests that dATF-2 is not involved in the transposon silencing. Yeast Atf1 interacts with Swi6, the yeast homolog of HP1 (Jia et al., 2004Jia S. Noma K. Grewal S.I. RNAi-independent heterochromatin nucleation by the stress-activated ATF/CREB family proteins.Science. 2004; 304: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). dATF-2 also coprecipitated with HP1 in coimmunoprecipitation assays with S2 cell lysates (Figures S2A and S2B ). Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes indicated that both dATF-2 and HP1 colocalized at the heterochromatic chromocenter (Figure 2A ). Signals from both proteins were also detected at specific loci in euchromatin, including 6B-C and 93A (Figure S2C), suggesting that the transcription of specific genes at these loci is silenced by dATF-2. In contrast, dATF-2, but not HP1, was detected at the 1E locus, suggesting that genes at this locus are activated by dATF-2. The dATF-2 mutant cell clones in salivary glands exhibited weaker HP1 and H3K9me2 signals compared to WT cells (Figure 2B), whereas the dATF-2-overexpressing cell clones showed stronger HP1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 signals (Figure 2C and Figure S2D). These results further supported a requirement for dATF-2 in heterochromatin formation. Cells are constantly exposed to internal stresses, such as free radicals, generated as normal products of cell metabolism. To test whether background levels of stress affect dATF-2-dependent heterochromatin formation via p38 and its upstream kinase, Mekk1, we generated the Mekk1 mutant and Mekk1-overexpressing clones in salivary glands. The Mekk1 mutant cells showed strong HP1 and H3K9me2 signals (Figure 2D), whereas the Mekk1-overexpressing clones exhibited weaker HP1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 signals (Figure 2E and Figure S2E). Furthermore, Mekk1 heterozygotes showed enhanced white silencing in wm4 (Figure 2F). The loss of one copy of p38a did not affect white silencing, possibly due to the existence of two p38 genes with similar functions (p38a and p38b) (Han et al., 1998Han S.J. Choi K.Y. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Molecular cloning and characterization of a Drosophila p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Mekk1 negatively regulates dATF-2-dependent heterochromatin formation. A search of the Drosophila genome sequence indicated that consensus CREs and half-CREs are frequently present in both the euchromatin and heterochromatin of all chromosomes (data not shown). The dATF-2 binding to the two regions containing multiple CREs was examined. One of the regions (20A-CREs), located in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, involves seven tandem repeats of a 124 bp sequence, each of which contains one consensus CRE (Figure 3A and Figure S3A ). The second region (80B-CREs), located in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the third chromosome, contains three consensus CREs (Figure 3A and Figure S3B). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays with S2 cells revealed that dATF-2 localized to both these regions (Figure 3B), which were enriched in H3K9me2 (Figure 3C).Figure S3Consensus CREs in Heterochromatin and dATF-2 Phosphorylation-Dependent Heterochromatin Disruption by Osmotic Stress, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) Three loci harboring consensus CREs are shown.

Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) was less potent and not active in all cell lines. A structural analogue of GYY4137 (ZYJ1122) lacking sulfur and thence not able to release H2S was inactive. Similar results were obtained using a clonogenic assay. Incubation of GYY4137 (400 µM) in culture medium led to the generation of low (<20 µM) concentrations of H2S sustained over 7 days. In contrast, incubation of NaHS (400 µM) in the same way led to much higher (up to 400 µM) concentrations of H2S which persisted for only 1 hour. Mechanistic studies revealed that GYY4137 (400 µM) incubated for 5 days with MCF-7 but not IMR90 cells caused the generation of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 9, indicative of a pro-apoptotic effect. GYY4137 (but not ZYJ1122) also caused partial G2/M arrest of these cells. Mice xenograft studies using HL-60 and MV4-11 cells showed that GYY4137 (100–300 mg/kg/day for 14 days) significantly reduced tumor growth. We conclude that GYY4137 exhibits anti-cancer activity by releasing H2S over a period of days. We also propose that a combination of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest contributes to this effect and that H2S donors should be investigated further as potential anti-cancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2078558859,"Background Activity-induced structural remodeling of dendritic spines and glial cells was recently proposed as an important factor in neuroplasticity and suggested to accompany the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Although T1 and diffusion MRI have been used to study structural changes resulting from long-term training, the cellular basis of the findings obtained and their relationship to neuroplasticity are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Finding Here we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine the microstructural manifestations of neuroplasticity in rats that performed a spatial navigation task. We found that DTI can be used to define the selective localization of neuroplasticity induced by different tasks and that this process is age-dependent in cingulate cortex and corpus callosum and age-independent in the dentate gyrus. Conclusion/Significance We relate the observed DTI changes to the structural plasticity that occurs in astrocytes and discuss the potential of MRI for probing structural neuroplasticity and hence indirectly localizing LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2077557373,"High levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may result in greater terrestrial carbon (C) storage. In a northern hardwood ecosystem, exposure to over a decade of simulated N deposition increased C storage in soil by slowing litter decay rates, rather than increasing detrital inputs. To understand the mechanisms underlying this response, we focused on the saprotrophic fungal community residing in the forest floor and employed molecular genetic approaches to determine if the slower decomposition rates resulted from down-regulation of the transcription of key lignocellulolytic genes, by a change in fungal community composition, or by a combination of the two mechanisms. Our results indicate that across four Acer-dominated forest stands spanning a 500-km transect, community-scale expression of the cellulolytic gene cbhI under elevated N deposition did not differ significantly from that under ambient levels of N deposition. In contrast, expression of the ligninolytic gene lcc was significantly down-regulated by a factor of 2-4 fold relative to its expression under ambient N deposition. Fungal community composition was examined at the most southerly of the four sites, in which consistently lower levels of cbhI and lcc gene expression were observed over a two-year period. We recovered 19 basidiomycete and 28 ascomycete rDNA 28S operational taxonomic units; Athelia, Sistotrema, Ceratobasidium and Ceratosebacina taxa dominated the basidiomycete assemblage, and Leotiomycetes dominated the ascomycetes. Simulated N deposition increased the proportion of basidiomycete sequences recovered from forest floor, whereas the proportion of ascomycetes in the community was significantly lower under elevated N deposition. Our results suggest that chronic atmospheric N deposition may lower decomposition rates through a combination of reduced expression of ligninolytic genes such as lcc, and compositional changes in the fungal community."
https://openalex.org/W2166634786,"Recent studies have shown that adult human possess active brown adipose tissue (BAT), which might be important in controlling obesity. It is known that ß-adrenoceptor-UCP1 system regulates BAT in rodent, but its influence in adult humans remains to be shown. The present study is to determine whether BAT activity can be independently stimulated by elevated catecholamines levels in adult human, and whether it is associated with their adiposity.We studied 14 patients with pheochromocytoma and 14 normal subjects who had performed both ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT) and plasma total metanephrine (TMN) measurements during 2007-2010. The BAT detection rate and the mean BAT activity were significantly higher in patients with elevated TMN levels (Group A: 6/8 and 6.7±2.1 SUVmean· g/ml) than patients with normal TMN concentrations (Group B: 0/6 and 0.4±0.04 SUVmean· g/ml) and normal subjects (Group C: 0/14 and 0.4±0.03 SUVmean·g/ml). BAT activities were positively correlated with TMN levels (R = 0.83, p<0.0001) and were inversely related to body mass index (R = -0.47, p = 0.010), visceral fat areas (R = -0.39, p = 0.044), visceral/total fat areas (R = -0.52, p = 0.0043) and waist circumferences (R = -0.43, p = 0.019). Robust regression revealed that TMN (R = 0.81, p<0.0001) and waist circumferences (R = -0.009, p = 0.009) were the two independent predictors of BAT activities.Brown adipose tissue activity in adult human can be activated by elevated plasma TMN levels, such as in the case of patients with pheochromocytoma, and is negatively associated with central adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2043147257,"Concentration gradients regulate many cell biological and developmental processes. In rod-shaped fission yeast cells, polar cortical gradients of the DYRK family kinase Pom1 couple cell length with mitotic commitment by inhibiting a mitotic inducer positioned at midcell. However, how Pom1 gradients are established is unknown. Here, we show that Tea4, which is normally deposited at cell tips by microtubules, is both necessary and, upon ectopic cortical localization, sufficient to recruit Pom1 to the cell cortex. Pom1 then moves laterally at the plasma membrane, which it binds through a basic region exhibiting direct lipid interaction. Pom1 autophosphorylates in this region to lower lipid affinity and promote membrane release. Tea4 triggers Pom1 plasma membrane association by promoting its dephosphorylation through the protein phosphatase 1 Dis2. We propose that local dephosphorylation induces Pom1 membrane association and nucleates a gradient shaped by the opposing actions of lateral diffusion and autophosphorylation-dependent membrane detachment."
https://openalex.org/W2046034820,"The microtubule-based metaphase spindle is subjected to forces that act in diverse orientations and over a wide range of timescales. Currently, we cannot explain how this dynamic structure generates and responds to forces while maintaining overall stability, as we have a poor understanding of its micromechanical properties. Here, we combine the use of force-calibrated needles, high-resolution microscopy, and biochemical perturbations to analyze the vertebrate metaphase spindle's timescale- and orientation-dependent viscoelastic properties. We find that spindle viscosity depends on microtubule crosslinking and density. Spindle elasticity can be linked to kinetochore and nonkinetochore microtubule rigidity, and also to spindle pole organization by kinesin-5 and dynein. These data suggest a quantitative model for the micromechanics of this cytoskeletal architecture and provide insight into how structural and functional stability is maintained in the face of forces, such as those that control spindle size and position, and can result from deformations associated with chromosome movement."
https://openalex.org/W2064146176,"Haloquadratum walsbyi commonly dominates the microbial flora of hypersaline waters. Its cells are extremely fragile squares requiring >14%(w/v) salt for growth, properties that should limit its dispersal and promote geographical isolation and divergence. To assess this, the genome sequences of two isolates recovered from sites at near maximum distance on Earth, were compared.Both chromosomes are 3.1 MB in size, and 84% of each sequence was highly similar to the other (98.6% identity), comprising the core sequence. ORFs of this shared sequence were completely synteneic (conserved in genomic orientation and order), without inversion or rearrangement. Strain-specific insertions/deletions could be precisely mapped, often allowing the genetic events to be inferred. Many inferred deletions were associated with short direct repeats (4-20 bp). Deletion-coupled insertions are frequent, producing different sequences at identical positions. In cases where the inserted and deleted sequences are homologous, this leads to variant genes in a common synteneic background (as already described by others). Cas/CRISPR systems are present in C23(T) but have been lost in HBSQ001 except for a few spacer remnants. Numerous types of mobile genetic elements occur in both strains, most of which appear to be active, and with some specifically targetting others. Strain C23(T) carries two ∼6 kb plasmids that show similarity to halovirus His1 and to sequences nearby halovirus/plasmid gene clusters commonly found in haloarchaea.Deletion-coupled insertions show that Hqr. walsbyi evolves by uptake and precise integration of foreign DNA, probably originating from close relatives. Change is also driven by mobile genetic elements but these do not by themselves explain the atypically low gene coding density found in this species. The remarkable genome conservation despite the presence of active systems for genome rearrangement implies both an efficient global dispersal system, and a high selective fitness for this species."

Here, we show that the potassium channel Kir2.1, mutations in which are associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome, is selected as cargo into Golgi export carriers in an unusual signal-dependent manner. Unlike conventional trafficking signals, which are typically comprised of short linear peptide sequences, Golgi exit of Kir2.1 is dictated by residues that are embedded within the confluence of two separate domains. This signal patch forms a recognition site for interaction with the AP1 adaptor complex, thereby marking Kir2.1 for incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi.

Golgi trafficking controls the density of Kir 2.1 channels at the cell surface Kir2.1 mutations associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome arrest at the Golgi Residues on distinct cytoplasmic domains of Kir2.1 form the trafficking signal The signal patch forms a recognition site for interaction with AP1 adaptor complex The Golgi apparatus is well appreciated to act as the central biosynthetic sorting station, responsible for properly targeting newly synthesized membrane proteins to their appropriate subcellular destinations (De Matteis and Luini, 2008De Matteis M.A. Luini A. Exiting the Golgi complex.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Endosomal sorting processes provide a framework for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. It is well established that endosome- and lysosome-destined proteins are recognized at the Golgi as cargo for inclusion into clathrin-coated vesicles by short, linear tyrosine-containing or dihydrophobic signals that serve as recognition sites for interaction with clathrin adaptor complexes and GGA proteins (Bonifacino and Traub, 2003Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Although much less is known about how newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins are sorted to the cell surface, an emerging body of evidence indicates that select plasmalemma proteins may also leave the Golgi by signal-dependent processes, rather than by default trafficking pathways as once believed (Rodriguez-Boulan and Müsch, 2005Rodriguez-Boulan E. Müsch A. Protein sorting in the Golgi complex: shifting paradigms.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsets of membrane proteins in polarized epithelial cells, for example, are sorted at the Golgi for traffic to the basolateral membrane in a clathrin-dependent manner (Deborde et al., 2008Deborde S. Perret E. Gravotta D. Deora A. Salvarezza S. Schreiner R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Clathrin is a key regulator of basolateral polarity.Nature. 2008; 452: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) by short linear peptide sequences (Campo et al., 2005Campo C. Mason A.

Although these signals share remarkable similarity with endosomal sorting signals, the clathrin-associated sorting proteins that interact with them at the Golgi remain to be discovered. Other cell surface proteins (see below) rely on completely unrelated structures for Golgi export, and the sorting machineries that decode these putative signals also remain unknown. Different coat proteins (Wang et al., 2006Wang C.W. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) have been implicated in Golgi-to-cell-surface traffic, but these are considered to play important roles in carrier vesicle formation rather than in cargo recognition. Signal-dependent Golgi export processes have been implicated in controlling the surface density of inwardly rectifying K+(Kir) channels (Nichols and Lopatin, 1997Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Inward rectifier potassium channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become evident that different trafficking processes regulate Kir channels to control neuronal excitability, action potential cessation, hormone secretion, heart rate, and salt balance. Several Kir channels have been postulated to leave the Golgi in a signal-dependent manner (Stockklausner and Klocker, 2003Stockklausner C. Klocker N. Surface expression of inward rectifier potassium channels is controlled by selective Golgi export.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17000-17005Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Yoo et al., 2005Yoo D. Fang L. Mason A. Kim B.Y. Welling P.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 35281-35289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the Kir2.1 channel (Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a mouse inward rectifier potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), a short cluster of highly conserved basic amino acids in the cytoplasmic N terminus is required for Golgi exit (Stockklausner and Klocker, 2003Stockklausner C. Klocker N. Surface expression of inward rectifier potassium channels is controlled by selective Golgi export.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17000-17005Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A nearly identical structure in the kidney potassium channel Kir1.1 (ROMK) is necessary for forward trafficking in the secretory pathway (Yoo et al., 2005Yoo D. Fang L. Mason A. Kim B.Y. Welling P.A. A phosphorylation-dependent export structure in ROMK (Kir 1.1) channel overrides an endoplasmic reticulum localization signal.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35281-35289Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with a shared signal-dependent Golgi export process. Nevertheless, the sequences exhibit no resemblance to known trafficking signals, and it is completely unknown how they might control Golgi exit. In the present study, a human Kir2.1 channel disease, Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS1) (Plaster et al., 2001Plaster N.M. Tawil R. Tristani-Firouzi M. Canún S. Bendahhou S. Tsunoda A. Donaldson M.R.

The Kir2.1 channel (Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a mouse inward rectifier potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) is responsible for controlling membrane excitability in many cell types. Because it is especially important in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Zaritsky et al., 2001Zaritsky J.J. Redell J.B. Tempel B.L. Schwarz T.L. The consequences of disrupting cardiac inwardly rectifying K(+) current (I(K1)) as revealed by the targeted deletion of the murine Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 genes.J.

Bernheim L. Human myoblast fusion requires expression of functional inward rectifier Kir2.1 channels.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), loss of Kir2.1 function in ATS1 is manifested as a disorder of ventricular arrhythmias, periodic paralysis, and skeletomuscular dysplasia (Andersen et al., 1971Andersen E.D.

Scott W. et al.Andersen's syndrome: a distinct periodic paralysis.Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Of the many ATS1 mutations, we found that one of them in the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kir2.1 surprisingly blocks Golgi export. Our investigation into the underlying pathologic mechanism revealed that Golgi exit of Kir 2.1 is dictated by an unusual signal. Unlike conventional short, linear trafficking signals, the Golgi export signal in Kir2.1 is formed by a patch of residues that are located within the confluence of cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains. This signal patch creates an interaction site for the AP1 adaptin complex, allowing properly folded Kir2.1 channels to be incorporated into clathrin-coated vesicles at the trans-Golgi for export to the cell surface. Exploration of the Golgi export mechanism in Kir2.1 was guided by mapping the location of an ATS1 mutation, Δ314-15 (Plaster et al., 2001Plaster N.M. Tawil R. Tristani-Firouzi M. Canún S. Bendahhou S. Tsunoda A. Donaldson M.R. Iannaccone S.T. Brunt E.

Arrabit C. Zhou W. Kwiatkowski W. Collins A. Slesinger P.A. Choe S. Cytoplasmic domain structures of Kir2.1 and Kir3.1 show sites for modulating gating and rectification.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the involved C-terminal residues, SY315, juxtapose the N-terminal Golgi trafficking determinant at a domain interface (Figure 1). The mutation has been reported to block surface expression (Bendahhou et al., 2003Bendahhou S. Donaldson M.R. Plaster N.M. Tristani-Firouzi M. Fu Y.H. Ptácek L.J. Defective potassium channel Kir2.1 trafficking underlies Andersen-Tawil syndrome.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51779-51785Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is not known. Because our studies revealed that the mutation does not impair subunit assembly or cause misfolding or ER retention (Figure S1 available online), we wondered whether it might instead disrupt Golgi trafficking and provide a model for understanding the export signal. In fact, Kir2.1Δ314-15 channels exhibit an unusual mistrafficking phenotype (Figure 2). As measured by HA-antibody binding of external HA-epitope-tagged channels (Figure 2A), the Δ314-15 mutation reduced cell surface expression to background levels, comparable to the effects of removing the “ER export” signal (ΔFCYE) (Ma et al., 2001Ma D.

Role of ER export signals in controlling surface potassium channel numbers.Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy (Figure 2B) revealed that Kir2.1Δ314-15 channels colocalize with markers of the medial Golgi (GM130; Nakamura et al., 1995Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N.

Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar), unlike the robust surface localization of the wild-type channel and the ER retention phenotype of ΔFCYE mutant channels. As evaluated by Pearson's colocalization analysis, the degree of Kir2.1Δ314-15 channel localization in the Golgi is significant.Figure S1Kir2.1 Δ314-15 Channels Are Capable of Tetrameric Assembly, Indicating that the Mutation Does Not Alter Global Structure, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Co-immunoprecipitation studies: COS7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged Kir2.1 channels (either WT, V302M, or Δ314-315) in the absence (-) or presence of myc-tagged, wild-type Kir 2.1 at a 1:1 ratio.

The relationship between the Kir2.1 current density (I/Io) and the fraction of the mutant (Fmut) precisely fits the binominal prediction for a full dominant negative effect (I I/Io = (1- Fmut)4), where the incorporation of one or more mutant subunits into a tetramer completely suppresses channel activity. Thus, the Δ314-15 mutation does not alter subunit tetramerization.(C and D) (C) Co-localization: These observations are supported by the high degree of co-localization at the Golgi of WT and Δ 314-315 Kir 2.1 in COS-7 cells co-expressing both channels.

The relationship between the Kir2.1 current density (I/Io) and the fraction of the mutant (Fmut) precisely fits the binominal prediction for a full dominant negative effect (I I/Io = (1- Fmut)4), where the incorporation of one or more mutant subunits into a tetramer completely suppresses channel activity. Thus, the Δ314-15 mutation does not alter subunit tetramerization. (C and D) (C) Co-localization: These observations are supported by the high degree of co-localization at the Golgi of WT and Δ 314-315 Kir 2.1 in COS-7 cells co-expressing both channels. As observed by confocal microscopy and, D. quantified by cell surface HA-antibody binding and luminometry (n = 8, mean ± S.D., ∗p < 0.01) expression of the Δ314-15 mutant blocked wild-type Kir2.1 channel at the Golgi. Collectively, the observations make it improbable that the Δ 314-315 mutation introduces a global-folding defect.

(H) Quantification of colocalization (mean ± SEM; n = 20; ∗p < 0.001). Scale bar, 14 μm. See also Figure S1. Because the effects of ATS1 are notably manifested in the heart, we examined whether the unusual Golgi mistrafficking phenotype of the Δ314-15 mutant is recapitulated in cardiomyocytes. The issue is particularly germane because the Golgi exhibits an atypical subcellular distribution in cardiomyocytes, localizing throughout the cytoplasm within linear tracks between contractile bundles, similar to what has been described in skeletal muscle (Rahkila et al., 1997Rahkila P.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these studies, wild-type and Δ314-15 Kir2.1 were delivered to adult rat ventricular myocytes by adenoviral-mediated cDNA transfer, and their subcellular localization was inspected by confocal microscopy (Figures 2E–2H). Wild-type channels localized to the cell surface and along tubular invaginations, characteristic of sarcolemmal and transverse-tubular localization of the endogenous channel (Melnyk et al., 2002Melnyk P. Zhang L. Shrier A. Nattel S. Differential distribution of Kir2.1 and Kir2.3 subunits in canine atrium and ventricle.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1123-H1133PubMed Google Scholar). Kir2.1 Δ314-15 channels, by contrast, were entirely intracellular, accumulating in large punctae that colocalize with either GM130 (Figure 2F) or TGN38 (Figure 2G) in the Golgi. In fact, nearly all Kir2.1 Δ314-15 is contained within GM130 or TGN38 structures (Figure 2H). The steady-state colocalization of the mutant channel with trans- and cis-Golgi markers indicate the mutation blocks channel trafficking between the terminal Golgi cisterna and trans-Golgi network. In the face of an uninterrupted and dominant ER export process (Ma et al., 2001Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

USA. 2001; 98: 2431-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), mutant channels have no place to go except to amass within cis- and trans-Golgi compartments, causing Golgi structures to increase in size. Because the mutant channels are rapidly translocated from the Golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum upon Brefeldin A treatment, we suspected that Kir2.1Δ314-15 channels are retained in the Golgi by virtue of a block in signal-dependent anterograde trafficking rather than formation of insoluble aggregates (Kopito, 2000Kopito R.R. Aggresomes, inclusion bodies and protein aggregation.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). To test this, we monitored Kir2.1 trafficking in the secretory pathway by several independent measures (Figure 3). Biosynthetic trafficking of Kir2.1 to the plasmalemma was studied by pulse-chase, cell surface immunoprecipitation (Figures 3A and 3B). In these studies, external HA-tagged channels were metabolically labeled in COS7 cells with a short pulse of S35-methionine (10 min) and then chased for variable times. Newly synthesized channels were captured at the plasmalemma by HA immunoprecipitation and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, wild-type channels appeared at the plasmalemma within the first 10 min of the chase period and gradually increased thereafter. By contrast, Kir2.1Δ314-15 channels were not detected at the cell surface over the entire chase period. Thus, 314-15-dependent trafficking occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway, consistent with a Golgi exit mechanism. To determine whether the trafficking step is harbored in the Golgi, Kir2.1 movement was monitored by live cell imaging (Figures 3C and 3D), using the reversible photoactivable fluorescent protein Dronpa (Ando et al., 2004Ando R. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Regulated fast nucleocytoplasmic shuttling observed by reversible protein highlighting.Science. 2004; 306: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, Habuchi et al., 2005Habuchi S. Ando R. Dedecker P. Verheijen W. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Hofkens J. Reversible single-molecule photoswitching in the GFP-like fluorescent protein Dronpa.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 9511-9516Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). For these studies, Dronpa-Kir2.1 fluorescence throughout the cell was first erased to background levels, and the population of channels at the Golgi (as detected with DS-red-Golgi) was specifically photoactivated and chased. Over time, the Golgi-delimited population of WT Dronpa-Kir 2.1 gradually diminished at a rate and kinetic comparable to the biosynthetic surface delivery (Figure 3C). These channels did not appear to accumulate in endosomes before they reached the cell surface, suggesting a direct trafficking route from the Golgi to the plasmalemma. By contrast, the Dronpa-Kir2.1Δ314-15 channel remained in the Golgi over the entire chase period. Taken together, the data indicate that the trafficking operation is controlled at the Golgi (Figures 3C and 3D). Studies of glycosylation state maturation revealed that the Δ314-15 mutation arrests traffic between the terminal cisterna and TGN, corroborating and extending these conclusions (Figure S2). The finding that the C-terminal ATS1 mutation blocks Golgi exit, identical to mutations in the N-terminal Golgi trafficking structure, suggests that the export signal is formed by neighboring residues in the tertiary structure. trans-reconstitution studies offer further support for shared requirements of the juxtaposing N- and C-terminal structures; we found that Golgi export of N-terminal truncated channels can be restored upon coexpression of a polypeptide encoding the Kir2.1 N terminus unless the fragments harbor the ATS1 mutation or mutations in the key N-terminal residues (Figure S3). To more precisely define the Golgi export structure, residues bordering the subunit interface were identified in the crystal structure and subjected to alanine replacement mutagenesis (Figure 4). External HA-tagged channels bearing the mutations were expressed in COS7 cells, the extent of traffic to the plasmalemma was quantified by cell surface antibody binding, and Golgi targeting was quantified by GM-130 colocalization (Figure 4A). Of the 18 mutations tested, 6 shifted the localization of the channel from the cell surface to the Golgi, revealing necessary components of the Golgi trafficking structure. Of the N-terminal residues, R46 had the largest contribution, but R44 exhibited additive effects. A tract of responsive mutations in the cytoplasmic C terminus identified residues Y315, E319, I320, and W322 as Golgi export determinants.Figure 4Golgi Export Signal Sequence Elucidated by Structure-Guided MutagenesisShow full caption(A) Cell surface expression and Golgi localization of external HA-tagged Kir2.1 channels as quantified by surface HA-antibody binding (mean ± SEM; n = 6; ∗p < 0.001, cell surface normalized to total protein abundance) and colocalization with the Golgi marker GM130, using Pearson's correlation (mean ± SEM; n = 15; ∗p < 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2082266845,"Background The contribution of neuroinflammation and specifically brain lymphocyte invasion is increasingly recognised as a substantial pathophysiological mechanism after stroke. FTY720 is a potent treatment for primary neuroinflammatory diseases by inhibiting lymphocyte circulation and brain immigration. Previous studies using transient focal ischemia models showed a protective effect of FTY720 but did only partially characterize the involved pathways. We tested the neuroprotective properties of FTY720 in permanent and transient cortical ischemia and analyzed the underlying neuroimmunological mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings FTY720 treatment resulted in substantial reduction of circulating lymphocytes while blood monocyte counts were significantly increased. The number of histologically and flow cytometrically analyzed brain invading T- and B lymphocytes was significantly reduced in FTY720 treated mice. However, despite testing a variety of treatment protocols, infarct volume and behavioural dysfunction were not reduced 7d after permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Additionally, we did not measure a significant reduction in infarct volume at 24h after 60 min filament-induced MCAO, and did not see differences in brain edema between PBS and FTY720 treatment. Analysis of brain cytokine expression revealed complex effects of FTY720 on postischemic neuroinflammation comprising a substantial reduction of delayed proinflammatory cytokine expression at 3d but an early increase of IL-1β and IFN-γ at 24 h after MCAO. Also, serum cytokine levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were increased in FTY720 treated animals compared to controls. Conclusions/Significance In the present study we were able to detect a reduction of lymphocyte brain invasion by FTY720 but could not achieve a significant reduction of infarct volumes and behavioural dysfunction. This lack of neuroprotection despite effective lymphopenia might be attributed to a divergent impact of FTY720 on cytokine expression and possible activation of innate immune cells after brain ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2067871582,"Aim The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) among blood donors in southwest Switzerland. Background HEV is recognized as a food-borne disease in industrialized countries, transmitted mainly through pork meat. Cases of transmission through blood transfusion have also been reported. Recent studies have revealed seroprevalence rates of 13.5%, 16.6% and 20.6% among blood donors in England, France and Denmark, respectively. Methods We analyzed 550 consecutive blood donor samples collected in the region of Lausanne, canton of Vaud, Switzerland, for the presence of anti-HEV IgG, using the MP Diagnostics HEV ELISA kit. For each donor, we documented age, sex and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value. Results The study panel was composed of 332 men (60.4%) and 218 women (39.6%). Overall, anti-HEV IgG was found in 27 of 550 samples (4.9%). The seroprevalence was 5.4% (18/332) in men and 4.1% (9/218) in women. The presence of anti-HEV IgG was not correlated with age, gender or ALT values. However, we observed a peak in seroprevalence of 5.3% in individuals aged 51 to 70 years old. Conclusions Compared with other European countries, HEV seroprevalence among blood donors in southwest Switzerland is low. The low seroprevalence may be explained by the sensitivity of commercial tests used and/or the strict regulation of animal and meat imports. Data regarding HEV prevalence in Swiss livestock are lacking and merit exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2013286203,"Avian influenza H5N1 and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses are known to induce viral pneumonia and subsequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The mortality rate of ARDS/DAD is extremely high, at approximately 60%, and no effective treatment for ARDS/DAD has been established. We examined serial pathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus to determine the progress from viral pneumonia to ARDS/DAD. Mice were intranasally infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus, and their lungs were examined both macro- and micro-pathologically every 2 days. We also evaluated general condition, survival rate, body weight, viral loads in lung, and surfactant proteins in serum. As a result, all infected mice died within 9 days postinfection. At 2 days postinfection, inflammation in alveolar septa, i.e., interstitial pneumonia, was observed around bronchioles. From 4 to 6 days postinfection, interstitial pneumonia with alveolar collapse expanded throughout the lungs. From 6 to 9 days postinfection, DAD with severe alveolar collapse was observed in the lungs of all of dying and dead mice. In contrast, DAD was not observed in the live infected-mice from 2 to 6 days postinfection, despite their poor general condition. In addition, histopathological analysis was performed in mice infected with a dose of PR8 virus which was 50% of the lethal dose for mice in the 20-day observation period. DAD with alveolar collapse was observed in all dead mice. However, in the surviving mice, instead of DAD, glandular metaplasia was broadly observed in their lungs. The present study indicates that DAD with severe alveolar collapse is associated with death in this mouse infection model of influenza virus. Inhibition of the development of DAD with alveolar collapse may decrease the mortality rate in severe viral pneumonia caused by influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W1996278040,"Elucidating the ecological mechanisms underlying community assembly in subtropical forests remains a central challenge for ecologists. The assembly of species into communities can be due to interspecific differences in habitat associations, and there is increasing evidence that these associations may have an underlying phylogenetic structure in contemporary terrestrial communities. In other words, by examining the degree to which closely related species prefer similar habitats and the degree to which they co-occur, ecologists are able to infer the mechanisms underlying community assembly. Here we implement this approach in a diverse subtropical tree community in China using a long-term forest dynamics plot and a molecular phylogeny generated from three DNA barcode loci. We find that there is phylogenetic signal in plant-habitat associations (i.e. closely related species tend to prefer similar habitats) and that patterns of co-occurrence within habitats are typically non-random with respect to phylogeny. In particular, we found phylogenetic clustering in valley and low-slope habitats in this forest, indicating a filtering of lineages plays a dominant role in structuring communities in these habitats and we found evidence of phylogenetic overdispersion in high-slope, ridge-top and high-gully habitats, indicating that distantly related species tended to co-occur in these high elevation habitats and that lineage filtering is less important in structuring these communities. Thus we infer that non-neutral niche-based processes acting upon evolutionarily conserved habitat preferences explain the assembly of local scale communities in the forest studied."
https://openalex.org/W2099310850,"INAD is a scaffolding protein that regulates signaling in Drosophila photoreceptors. One of its PDZ domains, PDZ5, cycles between reduced and oxidized forms in response to light, but it is unclear how light affects its redox potential. Through biochemical and structural studies, we show that the redox potential of PDZ5 is allosterically regulated by its interaction with another INAD domain, PDZ4. Whereas isolated PDZ5 is stable in the oxidized state, formation of a PDZ45 “supramodule” locks PDZ5 in the reduced state by raising the redox potential of its Cys606/Cys645 disulfide bond by ∼330 mV. Acidification, potentially mediated via light and PLCβ-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2, disrupts the interaction between PDZ4 and PDZ5, leading to PDZ5 oxidation and dissociation from the TRP Ca2+ channel, a key component of fly visual signaling. These results show that scaffolding proteins can actively modulate the intrinsic redox potentials of their disulfide bonds to exert regulatory roles in signaling.

A recent study indicated that in addition to acting as a master scaffolding protein, INAD plays a critical dynamic role in regulating phototransduction on a millisecond timescale (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Dynamic scaffolding in a G protein-coupled signaling system.Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Namely, a pair of Cys residues in INAD PDZ5 (Cys606 and Cys645) undergo reversible, disulfide-mediated oxidation in response to light. When flies are kept in the dark, the two Cys residues in PDZ5 are in the reduced form. Upon exposure to bright light, PDZ5 is converted to the oxidized state by formation of the intramolecular Cys606-Cys645 disulfide bond. Importantly, the authors demonstrated that this transient, light-dependent disulfide-mediated oxidation is required for efficient visual signal termination as well as visually mediated reflex behavior of flies (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Dynamic scaffolding in a G protein-coupled signaling system.Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, there are a number of major conceptual challenges regarding the mechanistic basis of the INAD-mediated dynamic signaling. Most critically, the redox potential surrounding the INAD-organized signaling complex microvilli is not expected to fluctuate with large amplitude on a millisecond timescale in response to light. This immediately begs the question: how is the light-dependent, transient disulfide bond formation/breaking of INAD PDZ5 achieved? Additionally, it was shown that the ePKC is required for the conformational switch of PDZ5 (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Dynamic scaffolding in a G protein-coupled signaling system.Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, PDZ5 does not contain any obvious PKC phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, it is not clear how INAD PDZ5 maintains the reduced state when flies are kept in dark as the PDZ5 disulfide is highly stable due to its extremely negative redox potential. Finally, although the structure of INAD PDZ5 in its oxidized form contains a somewhat deformed target-binding groove (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Dynamic scaffolding in a G protein-coupled signaling system.Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it has not been proven that the target binding of INAD PDZ5 is disulfide bond dependent. Here, we demonstrate that the redox potential of INAD PDZ5 is allosterically regulated by the direct conformational coupling of the fourth and fifth PDZ domains. Formation of the PDZ45 supramodule locks PDZ5 in the reduced state. Acidification uncouples the PDZ45 tandem and thereby unlocks its reduced conformation followed by the dissociation of the TRP channel from PDZ5. The allosteric regulation of the redox potential fluctuation of the INAD PDZ5 disulfide bond at a range of ∼330 mV is unprecedented for cellular signaling proteins. This protein redox potential regulation mechanism may have general implications in other cell signaling processes that utilize disulfide bond containing intracellular proteins. Finally, regulation of protein conformational couplings by protons originating from PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis may represent a new paradigm for cellular signal transduction in general. The most plausible explanation for the INAD PDZ5 disulfide-mediated visual signal regulation is that the two PDZ5 conformers have distinct target-binding properties. Oxidation of PDZ5 may cause temporary dissociation of its target, and thereby terminate signaling. Although PDZ5 has been implied to interact with PLCβ (Tsunoda et al., 1997Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), partly due to a sequencing error of PLCβ (the penultimate residue should be a “Tyr” instead of a “Cys” as originally reported). Identification of a specific PDZ5 target would be highly valuable in evaluating the mechanistic basis of the redox-dependent target binding of the domain. Aided by structure-based prediction of potential PDZ5 binders, we screened a small PDZ-binding peptide library. Among twelve peptides tested, the carboxyl peptide of proteoglycan NG2 showed the highest binding affinity toward reduced PDZ5 (Figure 1A ). These data also demonstrated that a bulky aromatic residue at the −2 position is critical, and Trp at the −1 position is highly preferred for carboxyl peptides to bind to PDZ5. The Drosophila ortholog of NG2 is Kon-tiki/Perdido (Kon/Perd), which has the same C-terminal four amino acids as NG2 (Figure 1A). As expected, the Kon peptide binds to PDZ5 with the same affinity as the NG2 peptide (Figure 1A). A search of the Drosophila genome for proteins containing the carboxyl tail peptide sequences of “YWΨ” (“Ψ” represents Val, Leu, and Ile) identified Kon/Perd as the only match. Although the physiological relevance, if any, of the INAD PDZ5/Kon interaction is unknown, identification of Kon as a high-affinity PDZ5 ligand provides a powerful tool for investigating the impact of the PDZ5 conformational switch on its target binding. We demonstrate that the reduced-to-oxidized conformational transition of PDZ5 induces a ∼20-fold decrease in its affinity for the Kon peptide (Figure 1B; see Figures S1A–S1C available online), supporting the structure-based prediction that oxidation of PDZ5 can weaken its target binding (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism governing their specific interaction, we solved the solution structure of the reduced PDZ5/Kon peptide complex (Figure 1C; Figure S1D and Table S1). INAD PDZ5 adopts a canonical PDZ fold similar to its ligand-free form (Figure 1C) (Mishra et al., 2007Mishra P. Socolich M. Wall M.A. Graves J. Wang Z. Ranganathan R. Dynamic scaffolding in a G protein-coupled signaling system.Cell. 2007; 131: 80-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The Kon peptide binds to the αB/βB groove of INAD PDZ5 by pairing antiparallelly with βB. The side chain of Val(0) of the Kon peptide inserts into the hydrophobic pocket at the end of the αB/βB groove. The side chain of Trp(−1) makes extensive contacts with Ile612 from βC and Ser598 from βB of PDZ5. A hydrogen bond between the side-chain amide of Trp(−1) and the backbone carbonyl of Gln(−3) further stabilizes the bound peptide. The side chain of Tyr(−2) is sandwiched between the aromatic rings of Tyr646 and Phe642 from αB (Figure 1D). The complex structure explains the high selectivity of PDZ5 for the Trp(−1) and Tyr(−2) in the Kon peptide. In view of fast timescale of the fly visual signaling, we asked whether INAD PDZ5 might be able to cycle rapidly between the reduced and oxidized conformations by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectrum of PDZ5 purified with buffer containing 1 mM DTT showed two distinct sets of peaks, each corresponding to the reduced and oxidized states (Figure S2A ). The result indicates that 1 mM DTT cannot reduce PDZ5 and the coexisting reduced and oxidized conformers exchange at a slow NMR timescale. PDZ5 could be completely oxidized when the purified protein was passed through a preparative gel filtration column twice with the column buffer undegassed and free of reducing reagent (Figure 2A , top trace). Upon addition of 10 mM DTT, the oxidized PDZ underwent a time-dependent conversion to its reduced state (Figures 2A and 2B). The measured rate constant (from oxidized to reduced state) is ∼0.3 M-1 · min-1, which is very slow considering the fast fly visual signaling events. We further measured the standard redox potential of the Cys606-Cys645 disulfide bond by NMR spectroscopy using DTT as the redox potential buffer (Figure 2C). The conversion reaction at each DTT concentration was considered to be in equilibrium if the peak intensities of two spectra acquired for the same mixture were the same after 5 hr. The measured standard redox potential for the Cys606-Cys645 disulfide formation is −0.37 V (Figure 2D), a value far below the standard redox potentials of the cytoplasmic milieu in most cells (−0.2∼−0.3 V) (Keese et al., 1999Keese M.A. Saffrich R.

Thus, both kinetic and thermodynamic data indicate that INAD PDZ5 is highly stable in its oxidized form and cannot spontaneously cycle between the reduced and oxidized conformations at speeds compatible with visual signaling. This implies that other factors must interact directly or indirectly with PDZ5 to regulate its redox potential and redox-dependent conformational cycling.Figure 2The Oxidation Kinetics and the Redox Potential of the Isolated PDZ5 and the PDZ45 TandemShow full caption(A) Oxidized PDZ5 (0.5 mM) was mixed with 10 mM reduced DTT, a selected methyl region of the 1H-NMR spectrum was recorded as a function of time.

Here we investigated the microRNAs expressed in human limbal-peripheral corneal (LPC) epithelia containing corneal epithelial progenitor cells (CEPCs) and early transit amplifying cells, and their role in corneal epithelium. Methodology/Principal Findings Human LPC epithelia was extracted for small RNAs or dissociated for CEPC culture. By Agilent Human microRNA Microarray V2 platform and GeneSpring GX11.0 analysis, we found differential expression of 18 microRNAs against central corneal (CC) epithelia, which were devoid of CEPCs. Among them, miR-184 was up-regulated in CC epithelia, similar to reported finding. Cluster miR-143/145 was expressed strongly in LPC but weakly in CC epithelia (P = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney U-test). This was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Locked nucleic acid-based in situ hybridization on corneal rim cryosections showed miR-143/145 presence localized to the parabasal cells of limbal epithelium but negligible in basal and superficial epithelia. With holoclone forming ability, CEPCs transfected with lentiviral plasmid containing mature miR-145 sequence gave rise to defective epithelium in organotypic culture and had increased cytokeratin-3/12 and connexin-43 expressions and decreased ABCG2 and p63 compared with cells transfected with scrambled sequences. Global gene expression was analyzed using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray and GeneSpring GX11.0. With a 5-fold difference compared to cells with scrambled sequences, miR-145 up-regulated 324 genes (containing genes for immune response) and down-regulated 277 genes (containing genes for epithelial development and stem cell maintenance). As validated by qPCR and luciferase reporter assay, our results showed miR-145 suppressed integrin β8 (ITGB8) expression in both human corneal epithelial cells and primary CEPCs. Conclusion/Significance We found expression of miR-143/145 cluster in human corneal epithelium. Our results also showed that miR-145 regulated the corneal epithelium formation and maintenance of epithelial integrity, via ITGB8 targeting."

The training dataset is characterized by the number of recorded presences/absences and by their geographical locations. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the training dataset characteristics on model performance and to compare the relative importance of three factors influencing model predictive capability; size of training dataset, stage of the biological invasion, and choice of input variables. Nine models were assessed for their ability to predict the distribution of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, a major pest of corn in North America that has recently invaded Europe. Twenty-six training datasets of various sizes (from 10 to 428 presence records) corresponding to two different stages of invasion (1955 and 1980) and three sets of input bioclimatic variables (19 variables, six variables selected using information on insect biology, and three linear combinations of 19 variables derived from Principal Component Analysis) were considered. The models were fitted to each training dataset in turn and their performance was assessed using independent data from North America and Europe. The models were ranked according to the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and the likelihood ratio. Model performance was highly sensitive to the geographical area used for calibration; most of the models performed poorly when fitted to a restricted area corresponding to an early stage of the invasion. Our results also showed that Principal Component Analysis was useful in reducing the number of model input variables for the models that performed poorly with 19 input variables. DOMAIN, Environmental Distance, MAXENT, and Envelope Score were the most accurate models but all the models tested in this study led to a substantial rate of mis-classification."
https://openalex.org/W2046906763,"The environmental mechanisms that determine the inter-annual and seasonal variability in incidence of coccidioidomycosis are unclear. In this study, we use Arizona coccidioidomycosis case data for 1995–2006 to generate a timeseries of monthly estimates of exposure rates in Maricopa County, AZ and Pima County, AZ. We reveal a seasonal autocorrelation structure for exposure rates in both Maricopa County and Pima County which indicates that exposure rates are strongly related from the fall to the spring. An abrupt end to this autocorrelation relationship occurs near the the onset of the summer precipitation season and increasing exposure rates related to the subsequent season. The identification of the autocorrelation structure enabled us to construct a “primary” exposure season that spans August-March and a “secondary” season that spans April–June which are then used in subsequent analyses. We show that October–December precipitation is positively associated with rates of exposure for the primary exposure season in both Maricopa County (R = 0.72, p = 0.012) and Pima County (R = 0.69, p = 0.019). In addition, exposure rates during the primary exposure seasons are negatively associated with concurrent precipitation in Maricopa (R = −0.79, p = 0.004) and Pima (R = −0.64, p = 0.019), possibly due to reduced spore dispersion. These associations enabled the generation of models to estimate exposure rates for the primary exposure season. The models explain 69% (p = 0.009) and 54% (p = 0.045) of the variance in the study period for Maricopa and Pima counties, respectively. We did not find any significant predictors for exposure rates during the secondary season. This study builds on previous studies examining the causes of temporal fluctuations in coccidioidomycosis, and corroborates the “grow and blow” hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2081954430,"In group-living organisms, consensual decision of site selection results from the interplay between individual responses to site characteristics and to group-members. Individuals independently gather personal information by exploring their environment. Through social interaction, the presence of others provides public information that could be used by individuals and modulates the individual probability of joining/leaving a site. The way that individual's information processing and the network of interactions influence the dynamics of public information (depending on population size) that in turn affect discrimination in site quality is a central question. Using binary choice between sheltering sites of different quality, we demonstrate that cockroaches in group dramatically outperform the problem-solving ability of single individual. Such use of public information allows animals to discriminate between alternatives whereas isolated individuals are ineffective (i.e. the personal discrimination efficiency is weak). Our theoretical results, obtained from a mathematical model based on behavioral rules derived from experiments, highlight that the collective discrimination emerges from competing amplification processes relying on the modulation of the individual sheltering time without shelters comparison and communication modulation. Finally, we well demonstrated here the adaptive value of such decision algorithm. Without any behavioral change, the system is able to shift to a more effective strategy when alternatives are present: the modification of the spatio-temporal distributions of individuals leading to the collective selection of the best resource. This collective discrimination implying such parsimonious and widespread mechanism must be shared by many group living-species."
https://openalex.org/W2029731718,"The distribution of genetic diversity among plant populations growing along elevational gradients can be affected by neutral as well as selective processes. Molecular markers used to study these patterns usually target neutral processes only, but may also be affected by selection. In this study, the effects of elevation and successional stage on genetic diversity of a dominant tree species were investigated controlling for neutrality of the microsatellite loci used.Diversity and differentiation among 24 populations of Castanopsis eyrei from different elevations (251-920 m) and successional stages were analysed by eight microsatellite loci. We found that one of the loci (Ccu97H18) strongly deviated from a neutral model of differentiation among populations due to either divergent selection or hitchhiking with an unknown selected locus. The analysis showed that C. eyrei populations had a high level of genetic diversity within populations (A(R) = 7.6, H(E) = 0.82). Genetic variation increased with elevation for both the putatively selected locus Ccu97H18 and the neutral loci. At locus Ccu97H18 one allele was dominant at low elevations, which was replaced at higher elevations by an increasing number of other alleles. The level of genetic differentiation at neutral loci was similar to that of other Fagaceae species (F(ST) = 0.032, = 0.15). Population differentiation followed a model of isolation by distance but additionally, strongly significant isolation by elevation was found, both for neutral loci and the putatively selected locus.The results indicate higher gene flow among similar elevational levels than across different elevational levels and suggest a selective influence of elevation on the distribution of genetic diversity in C. eyrei. The study underlines the importance to check the selective neutrality of marker loci in analyses of population structure."
https://openalex.org/W2068572301,"Epi-macrobenthic species richness, abundance and composition are linked with type, assemblage and structural complexity of seabed habitat within coastal ecosystems. However, the evaluation of these habitats is highly hindered by limitations related to both waterborne surveys (slow acquisition, shallow water and low reactivity) and water clarity (turbid for most coastal areas). Substratum type/diversity and bathymetric features were elucidated using a supervised method applied to airborne bathymetric LiDAR waveforms over Saint-Siméon-Bonaventure's nearshore area (Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Québec, Canada). High-resolution underwater photographs were taken at three hundred stations across an 8-km(2) study area. Seven models based upon state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Naïve Bayes, Regression Tree, Classification Tree, C 4.5, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and CN2 learners were tested for predicting eight epi-macrobenthic species diversity metrics as a function of the class number. The Random Forest outperformed other models with a three-discretized Simpson index applied to epi-macrobenthic communities, explaining 69% (Classification Accuracy) of its variability by mean bathymetry, time range and skewness derived from the LiDAR waveform. Corroborating marine ecological theory, areas with low Simpson epi-macrobenthic diversity responded to low water depths, high skewness and time range, whereas higher Simpson diversity relied upon deeper bottoms (correlated with stronger hydrodynamics) and low skewness and time range. The degree of species heterogeneity was therefore positively linked with the degree of the structural complexity of the benthic cover. This work underpins that fully exploited bathymetric LiDAR (not only bathymetrically derived by-products), coupled with proficient machine learner, is able to rapidly predict habitat characteristics at a spatial resolution relevant to epi-macrobenthos diversity, ranging from clear to turbid waters. This method might serve both to nurture marine ecological theory and to manage areas with high species heterogeneity where navigation is hazardous and water clarity opaque to passive optical sensors."

This study evaluates the effects of SB-269970, a selective 5-HT₇ antagonist, in a translational model of working memory deficit and investigates whether it modulates cortical glutamate and/or dopamine neurotransmission in rats. The effect of SB-269970 was evaluated in the delayed non-matching to position task alone or in combination with MK-801, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and, in separate experiments, with scopolamine, a non-selective muscarinic antagonist. SB-269970 (10 mg/kg) significantly reversed the deficits induced by MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) but augmented the deficit induced by scopolamine (0.06 mg/kg). The ability of SB-269970 to modulate MK-801-induced glutamate and dopamine extracellular levels was separately evaluated using biosensor technology and microdialysis in the prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats. SB-269970 normalized MK-801 -induced glutamate but not dopamine extracellular levels in the prefrontal cortex. Rat plasma and brain concentrations of MK-801 were not affected by co-administration of SB-269970, arguing for a pharmacodynamic rather than a pharmacokinetic mechanism.

PcGs inactivate or maintain the silenced state of their target chromatin by forming complexes, including Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2). Three PRC2 complexes have been identified and characterized in Arabidopsis; of these, the EMF and VRN complexes suppress flowering by catalyzing the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 of FLOWER LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWER LOCUS C (FLC). However, little is known about the role of PRC1 in regulating the floral transition, although AtRING1A, AtRING1B, AtBMI1A, and AtBMI1B are believed to regulate shoot apical meristem and embryonic development as components of PRC1. Moreover, among the five RING finger PcGs in the Arabidopsis genome, four have been characterized. Here, we report that the fifth, AtBMI1C, is a novel, ubiquitously expressed nuclear PcG protein and part of PRC1, which is evolutionarily conserved with Psc and BMI1. Overexpression of AtBMI1C caused increased H2A monoubiquitination and flowering defects in Arabidopsis. Both the suppression of FLC and activation of FT were observed in AtBMI1C-overexpressing lines, resulting in early flowering. No change in the H3K27me3 level in FLC chromatin was detected in an AtBMI1C-overexpressing line. Our results suggest that AtBMI1C participates in flowering time control by regulating the expression of FLC; moreover, the repression of FLC by AtBMI1C is not due to the activity of PRC2. Instead, it is likely the result of PRC1 activity, into which AtBMI1C is integrated."
https://openalex.org/W2006119177,"Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus recently identified in association with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Despite its worldwide occurrence, little is known on the pathogenesis of HBoV infections. In addition, few systematic studies of HBoV in ARI have been conducted in Latin America. Therefore, in order to test whether active viral replication of human bocavirus is associated with respiratory diseases and to understand the clinical impact of this virus in patients with these diseases, we performed a 3-year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV in outpatients and inpatients with symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 1015 patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for HBoV DNA by PCR. All samples positive for HBoV were tested by PCR for all other respiratory viruses, had HBoV viral loads determined by quantitative real time PCR and, when possible, were tested by RT-PCR for HBoV VP1 mRNA, as evidence of active viral replication. HBoV was detected in 4.8% of patients, with annual rates of 10.0%, 3.0% and 3.0% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The range of respiratory symptoms was similar between HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative ARI patients. However, a higher rate of diarrhea was observed in HBoV-positive patients. High HBoV viral loads (>108 copies/mL) and diarrhea were significantly more frequent in patients with exclusive infection by HBoV and in patients with detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA than in patients with viral co-infection, detected in 72.9% of patients with HBoV. In summary, our data demonstrated that active HBoV replication was detected in a small percentage of patients with ARI and was correlated with concurrent diarrhea and lack of other viral co-infections."
https://openalex.org/W1989551904,"Extending genome wide association analysis by the inclusion of gene expression data may assist in the dissection of complex traits. We examined piebald, a pigmentation phenotype in both human and Merino sheep, by analysing multiple data types using a systems approach. First, a case control analysis of 49,034 ovine SNP was performed which confirmed a multigenic basis for the condition. We combined these results with gene expression data from five tissue types analysed with a skin-specific microarray. Promoter sequence analysis of differentially expressed genes allowed us to reverse-engineer a regulatory network. Likewise, by testing two-loci models derived from all pair-wise comparisons across piebald-associated SNP, we generated an epistatic network. At the intersection of both networks, we identified thirteen genes with insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) and the tetraspanin platelet activator CD9 at the kernel of the intersection. Further, we report a number of differentially expressed genes in regions containing highly associated SNP including ATRN, DOCK7, FGFR1OP, GLI3, SILV and TBX15. The application of network theory facilitated co-analysis of genetic variation with gene expression, recapitulated aspects of the known molecular biology of skin pigmentation and provided insights into the transcription regulation and epistatic interactions involved in piebald Merino sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2004294595,"It is well established that genomic alterations play an essential role in oncogenesis, disease progression, and response of tumors to therapeutic intervention. The advances of next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) provide unprecedented capabilities to scan genomes for changes such as mutations, deletions, and alterations of chromosomal copy number. However, the cost of full-genome sequencing still prevents the routine application of NGS in many areas. Capturing and sequencing the coding exons of genes (the ""exome"") can be a cost-effective approach for identifying changes that result in alteration of protein sequences. We applied an exome-sequencing technology (Roche Nimblegen capture paired with 454 sequencing) to identify sequence variation and mutations in eight commonly used cancer cell lines from a variety of tissue origins (A2780, A549, Colo205, GTL16, NCI-H661, MDA-MB468, PC3, and RD). We showed that this technology can accurately identify sequence variation, providing ∼95% concordance with Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 performed on the same cell lines. Furthermore, we detected 19 of the 21 mutations reported in Sanger COSMIC database for these cell lines. We identified an average of 2,779 potential novel sequence variations/mutations per cell line, of which 1,904 were non-synonymous. Many non-synonymous changes were identified in kinases and known cancer-related genes. In addition we confirmed that the read-depth of exome sequence data can be used to estimate high-level gene amplifications and identify homologous deletions. In summary, we demonstrate that exome sequencing can be a reliable and cost-effective way for identifying alterations in cancer genomes, and we have generated a comprehensive catalogue of genomic alterations in coding regions of eight cancer cell lines. These findings could provide important insights into cancer pathways and mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2165346130,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes often carry one or more mutations associated with drug resistance upon transmission into a therapy-naïve individual. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in chronically-infected therapy-naïve patients enrolled in a multi-center cohort in North America. Pre-therapy clinical significance was quantified by plasma viral load (pVL) and CD4+ cell count (CD4) at baseline. Naïve bulk sequences of HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were screened for resistance mutations as defined by the World Health Organization surveillance list. The overall prevalence of TDR was 14.2%. We used a Bayesian network to identify co-transmission of TDR mutations in clusters associated with specific drugs or drug classes. Aggregate effects of mutations by drug class were estimated by fitting linear models of pVL and CD4 on weighted sums over TDR mutations according to the Stanford HIV Database algorithm. Transmitted resistance to both classes of reverse transcriptase inhibitors was significantly associated with lower CD4, but had opposing effects on pVL. In contrast, position-specific analyses of TDR mutations revealed substantial effects on CD4 and pVL at several residue positions that were being masked in the aggregate analyses, and significant interaction effects as well. Residue positions in RT with predominant effects on CD4 or pVL (D67 and M184) were re-evaluated in causal models using an inverse probability-weighting scheme to address the problem of confounding by other mutations and demographic or risk factors. We found that causal effect estimates of mutations M184V/I ( pVL) and D67N/G ( and pVL) were compensated by K103N/S and K219Q/E/N/R. As TDR becomes an increasing dilemma in this modern era of highly-active antiretroviral therapy, these results have immediate significance for the clinical management of HIV-1 infections and our understanding of the ongoing adaptation of HIV-1 to human populations."

Employing well characterized bovine preovulatory follicle model, granulosa cells (GCs) and follicle wall were collected from the preovulatory follicle before, 1, 10 and 22 h post peak LH surge. Microarray analysis performed on GCs revealed that 450 and 111 genes were differentially expressed at 1 and 22 h post peak LH surge, respectively. For validation, qPCR and immunocytochemistry analyses were carried out for some of the differentially expressed genes. Expression analysis of many of these genes showed distinct expression patterns in GCs and the follicle wall. To study molecular functions and genetic networks, microarray data was analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis which revealed majority of the differentially expressed genes to cluster within processes like steroidogenesis, cell survival and cell differentiation. In the ovarian follicle, IGF-I is established to be an important regulator of the above mentioned molecular functions. Thus, further experiments were conducted to verify the effects of increased intrafollicular IGF-I levels on the expression of genes associated with the above mentioned processes. For this purpose, buffalo cows were administered with exogenous bGH to transiently increase circulating and intrafollicular concentrations of IGF-I. The results indicated that increased intrafollicular concentrations of IGF-I caused changes in expression of genes associated with steroidogenesis (StAR, SRF) and apoptosis (BCL-2, FKHR, PAWR). These results taken together suggest that onset of gonadotropin surge triggers activation of various biological pathways and that the effects of growth factors and peptides on gonadotropin actions could be examined during preovulatory follicle development."

ELOVL6 is expressed in lipogenic tissues and it is regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1).We investigated whether ELOVL6 genetic variation is associated with insulin sensitivity in a population from southern Spain.We undertook a prospective, population-based study collecting phenotypic, metabolic, nutritional and genetic information. Measurements were made of weight and height and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Insulin resistance was measured by homeostasis model assessment. The type of dietary fat was assessed from samples of cooking oil taken from the participants' kitchens and analyzed by gas chromatography. Five SNPs of the ELOVL6 gene were analyzed by SNPlex.Carriers of the minor alleles of the SNPs rs9997926 and rs6824447 had a lower risk of having high HOMA_IR, whereas carriers of the minor allele rs17041272 had a higher risk of being insulin resistant. An interaction was detected between the rs6824447 polymorphism and the intake of oil in relation with insulin resistance, such that carriers of this minor allele who consumed sunflower oil had lower HOMA_IR than those who did not have this allele (P = 0.001).Genetic variations in the ELOVL6 gene were associated with insulin sensitivity in this population-based study."

Reactive antibodies against 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus (pH1N1) were detected using a haemagglutination inhibition test (antigen A/California/7/2009). Proportions of samples with antibodies at titre ≥ 40 and geometric mean of the titres (GMT) were calculated and compared among 6 age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, ≥ 70 years). The highest proportions of cross-reactive antibodies at titre ≥ 40 before the pandemic were observed among 18-29 year olds, 12.5% (95% CI 7.3-19.5%). The highest increase in seroprevalence between pre- and post-pandemic was also observed among 18-29 year olds, 29.9% (95% CI 16.7-43.2%). Effects of sampling period (pre- and post-pandemic), age, sex, and prior influenza immunization on titre were investigated with Tobit regression analysis using three birth cohorts (after 1976, between 1957 and 1976, and before 1957). The GMT increased between the pre- and post-pandemic period by a factor of 10.2 (95% CI 5.0-20.7) in the birth cohort born after 1976, 6.3 (95% CI 3.3-11.9) in those born between 1957 and 1976 and 2.4 (95% CI 1.3-4.3) in those born before 1957.We demonstrate that infection rates differed among age groups and that the measured pre-pandemic level of cross-reactive antibodies towards pH1N1 did not add information in relation to protection and prediction of the most affected age groups among adults in the pandemic."

Muscle biopsy and blood samples were obtained at rest for all groups and immediately post-RE (75% 1RM, 8×10 repetitions of leg-press and extension exercise) for EX and EX+PRO only. At 24 h post-RE (or post-resting biopsy for CON), a further muscle biopsy was obtained. Participants then consumed an oral glucose load (OGTT) containing 2 g of [U-¹³C] glucose during an infusion of 6, 6-[²H₂] glucose. Blood samples were obtained every 10 min for 2 h to determine glucose kinetics. EX+PRO ingested an additional 25 g of intact whey protein with the OGTT. A final biopsy sample was obtained at the end of the OGTT.Fasted plasma glucose and insulin were similar for all groups and were not different immediately post- and 24 h post-RE. Following RE, muscle glycogen was 26±8 and 19±6% lower in EX and EX+PRO, respectively. During OGTT, plasma glucose AUC was lower for EX and EX+PRO (75.1±2.7 and 75.3±2.8 mmol·L⁻¹∶120 min, respectively) compared with CON (90.6±4.1 mmol·L⁻¹∶120 min). Plasma insulin response was 13±2 and 21±4% lower for EX and CON, respectively, compared with EX+PRO. Glucose disappearance from the circulation was ∼12% greater in EX and EX+PRO compared with CON. Basal 24 h post-RE and insulin-stimulated PAS-AS160/TBC1D4 phosphorylation was greater for EX and EX+PRO.Prior RE improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity through an increase in the rate at which glucose is disposed from the circulation. However, co-ingesting protein during a high-glucose load does not augment this response at 24 h post-exercise in healthy, insulin-sensitive individuals."

Rhesus macaques (RM) are an important animal model for the study and development of vaccines against HIV/AIDS. Our laboratory has helped to develop and study DNA-based vaccines in which recent technological advances, including genetic optimization and in vivo electroporation (EP), have helped to dramatically boost their immunogenicity. In this study, RMs were immunized with a DNA vaccine including individual plasmids encoding SIV gag, env, and pol alone, or in combination with a molecular adjuvant, plasmid DNA expressing the chemokine ligand 5 (RANTES), followed by EP. Along with standard immunological assays, flow-based activation analysis without ex vivo restimulation and high-throughput gene expression analysis was performed. Strong cellular immunity was induced by vaccination which was supported by all assays including PBMC microarray analysis that identified the up-regulation of 563 gene sequences including those involved in interferon signaling. Furthermore, 699 gene sequences were differentially regulated in these groups at peak viremia following SIVmac251 challenge. We observed that the RANTES-adjuvanted animals were significantly better at suppressing viral replication during chronic infection and exhibited a distinct pattern of gene expression which included immune cell-trafficking and cell cycle genes. Furthermore, a greater percentage of vaccine-induced central memory CD8+ T-cells capable of an activated phenotype were detected in these animals as measured by activation analysis. Thus, co-immunization with the RANTES molecular adjuvant followed by EP led to the generation of cellular immunity that was transcriptionally distinct and had a greater protective efficacy than its DNA alone counterpart. Furthermore, activation analysis and high-throughput gene expression data may provide better insight into mechanisms of viral control than may be observed using standard immunological assays."
https://openalex.org/W2029520913,"In the past decade, the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has shown a high potential for the discovery of new treatments for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Pharmacological inhibitors of Syk catalytic site bearing therapeutic potential have been developed, with however limited specificity towards Syk. To address this topic, we opted for the design of drug-like compounds that could impede the interaction of Syk with its cellular partners while maintaining an active kinase protein. To achieve this challenging task, we used the powerful potential of intracellular antibodies for the modulation of cellular functions in vivo, combined to structure-based in silico screening. In our previous studies, we reported the anti-allergic properties of the intracellular antibody G4G11. With the aim of finding functional mimics of G4G11, we developed an Antibody Displacement Assay and we isolated the drug-like compound C-13, with promising in vivo anti-allergic activity. The likely binding cavity of this compound is located at the close vicinity of G4G11 epitope, far away from the catalytic site of Syk. Here we report the virtual screen of a collection of 500,000 molecules against this new cavity, which led to the isolation of 1000 compounds subsequently evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory effects using the Antibody Displacement Assay. Eighty five compounds were selected and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the liberation of allergic mediators from mast cells. Among them, 10 compounds inhibited degranulation with IC₅₀ values ≤ 10 µM. The most bioactive compounds combine biological activity, significant inhibition of antibody binding and strong affinity for Syk. Moreover, these molecules show a good potential for oral bioavailability and are not kinase catalytic site inhibitors. These bioactive compounds could be used as starting points for the development of new classes of non-enzymatic inhibitors of Syk and for drug discovery endeavour in the field of inflammation related disorders."

As such, it is a major relay in the ascending auditory pathway of all birds and in songbirds mediates the auditory feedback necessary for the learning and maintenance of song. To clarify the organization of MLd, we applied three calcium binding protein antibodies to tissue sections from the brains of adult male and female zebra finches. The staining patterns resulting from the application of parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin antibodies differed from each other and in different parts of the nucleus. Parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity was distributed throughout the whole nucleus, as defined by the totality of the terminations of brainstem auditory afferents; in other words parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity defines the boundaries of MLd. Staining patterns of parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin defined two regions of MLd: inner (MLd.I) and outer (MLd.O). MLd.O largely surrounds MLd.I and is distinct from the surrounding intercollicular nucleus. Unlike the case in some non-songbirds, however, the two MLd regions do not correspond to the terminal zones of the projections of the brainstem auditory nuclei angularis and laminaris, which have been found to overlap substantially throughout the nucleus in zebra finches."

Comparison of 589 independent sequences from 1,421 A. palmata contigs, with 10,247 A. millepora contigs resulted in the identification of 196 putative homologues. Most of the homologous pairs demonstrated high amino acid similarities (over 90%). Comparisons of putative homologues showing low amino acid similarities (under 90%) among the Acropora species to the near complete datasets from two other cnidarians (Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis) implied that some were non-orthologous. Within 86 homologous pairs, 39 exhibited dN/dS ratios significantly less than 1, suggesting that these genes are under purifying selection associated with functional constraints. Eight independent genes showed dN/dS ratios exceeding 1, while three deviated significantly from 1, suggesting that these genes may play important roles in the adaptive evolution of Acropora. Our results also indicated that CEL-III lectin was under positive selection, consistent with a possible role in immunity or symbiont recognition. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible functions of the genes under positive selection to provide insight into the evolutionary process of corals."

Myelin is essential for saltatory nerve conduction in the vertebrate nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms of maturation and myelination by oligodendrocytes remain elusive.In the present study, we showed that maturation of oligodendrocytes was attenuated by sodium orthovanadate (a comprehensive inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases) and PTPi IV (a specific inhibitor of SHP-2). It is also found that SHP-2 was persistently expressed during maturation process of OPCs. Down-regulation of endogenous SHP-2 led to impairment of oligodendrocytes maturation and this effect was triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) dependent. Furthermore, over-expression of SHP-2 was shown to promote maturation of oligodendrocytes. Finally, it has been identified that SHP-2 was involved in activation of Akt and extracellular-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) induced by T3 in oligodendrocytes.SHP-2 promotes oligodendrocytes maturation via Akt and ERK1/2 signaling in vitro."

A very small proportion of individuals (∼2%) had identical multilocus genotypes. Genetic differentiation between orchards was low (F(ST)<0.026), with significant differentiation observed only between orchards from different regions, but no isolation by distance was detected.

https://openalex.org/W2009718827,"The EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) functions as a constitutive active form of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and activates multiple downstream signaling pathways similar to CD40 signaling in a ligand-independent manner. LMP1 expression in EBV-infected cells has been postulated to play an important role in pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, variable levels of LMP1 expression were detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. At present, the regulation of LMP1 levels in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is poorly understood. Here we show that LMP1 mRNAs are transcribed in an EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line (C666-1) and other EBV-negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells stably re-infected with EBV. The protein levels of LMP1 could readily be detected after incubation with proteasome inhibitor, MG132 suggesting that LMP1 protein is rapidly degraded via proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Interestingly, we observed that Id1 overexpression could stabilize LMP1 protein in EBV-infected cells. In contrary, Id1 knockdown significantly reduced LMP1 levels in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Id1 interacts with LMP1 by binding to the CTAR1 domain of LMP1. N-terminal region of Id1 is required for the interaction with LMP1. Furthermore, binding of Id1 to LMP1 suppressed polyubiquitination of LMP1 and may be involved in stabilization of LMP1 in EBV-infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036306599,"Background The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays an important role in folding stabilization and activation of client proteins. Besides, Hsp90 of mammals and mammalian pathogens displays immunostimulatory properties. Here, we investigated the role of plant-derived Hsp90s as B-cell mitogens by measuring their proliferative responses in vitro. Methodology Plant cytosolic Hsp90 isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHsp81.2) and Nicotiana benthamiana (NbHsp90.3) were expressed in E. coli. Over-expression of recombinant plant Hsp90s (rpHsp90s) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using and anti-AtHsp81.2 polyclonal anti-body. Both recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and their identity confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Recombinant AtHsp81.2 and NbHsp90.3 proteins induced prominent proliferative responses in spleen cells form BALB/c mice. Polymyxin-B, a potent inhibitor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), did not eliminate the rpHsp90-induced proliferation. In addition, in vitro incubation of spleen cells with rpHsp90 led to the expansion of CD19-bearing populations, suggesting a direct effect of these proteins on B lymphocytes. This effect was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, where a direct binding of rpHsp90 to B- but not to T-cells was observed in cells from BALB/c and C3H/HeN mice. Finally, we examined the involvement of Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) molecules in the rpHsp90s induction of B-cell proliferation. Spleen cells from C3H/HeJ mice, which carry a point mutation in the cytoplasmic region of TLR4, responded poorly to prAtHsp90. However, the interaction between rpHsp90 and B-cells from C3H/HeJ mice was not altered, suggesting that the mutation on TLR4 would be affecting the signal cascade but not the rpHsp90-TLR4 receptor interaction. Conclusions Our results show for the first time that spleen cell proliferation can be stimulated by a non-pathogen-derived Hsp90. Furthermore, our data provide a new example of a non-pathogen-derived ligand for TLRs."

https://openalex.org/W2002398367,"The rates of immunologic and clinical progression are lower in patients with drug-resistant HIV compared to wild-type HIV. This difference is not fully explained by viral load. It has been argued that reductions in T cell activation and/or viral fitness might result in preserved target cells and an altered relationship between the level of viremia and the rate of CD4+ T cell loss. We tested this hypothesis over time in a cohort of patients with highly resistant HIV. Fifty-four antiretroviral-treated patients with multi-drug resistant HIV and detectable plasma HIV RNA were followed longitudinally. CD4+ T cell counts and HIV RNA levels were measured every 4 weeks and T cell activation (CD38/HLA-DR) was measured every 16 weeks. We found that the levels of CD4+ T cell activation over time were a strong independent predictor of CD4+ T cell counts while CD8+ T cell activation was more strongly associated with viremia. Using spectral analysis, we found strong evidence for oscillatory (or cyclic) behavior in CD4+ T cell counts, HIV RNA levels, and T cell activation. Each of the cell populations exhibited an oscillatory behavior with similar frequencies. Collectively, these data suggest that there may be a mechanistic link between T cell activation, CD4+ T cell counts, and viremia and lends support for the hypothesis of altered predator-prey dynamics as a possible explanation of the stability of CD4+ T cell counts in the presence of sustained multi-drug resistant viremia."
https://openalex.org/W2006101847,"We recently reported that the oxidized avidin, named AvidinOX®, resides for weeks within injected tissues as a consequence of the formation of Schiff's bases between its aldehyde groups and tissue protein amino groups. We also showed, in a mouse pre-clinical model, the usefulness of AvidinOX for the delivery of radiolabeled biotin to inoperable tumors. Taking into account that AvidinOX is the first oxidized glycoprotein known to chemically link to injected tissues, we tested in the mouse a panel of additional oxidized glycoproteins, with the aim of investigating the phenomenon. We produced oxidized ovalbumin and mannosylated streptavidin which share with avidin glycosylation pattern and tetrameric structure, respectively and found that neither of them linked significantly to cells in vitro nor to injected tissues in vivo, despite the presence of functional aldehyde groups. The study, extended to additional oxidized glycoproteins, showed that the in vivo chemical conjugation is a distinctive property of the oxidized avidin. Relevance of the high cationic charge of avidin into the stable linkage of AvidinOX to tissues is demonstrated as the oxidized acetylated avidin lost the property. Plasmon resonance on matrix proteins and cellular impedance analyses showed in vitro that avidin exhibits a peculiar interaction with proteins and cells that allows the formation of highly stable Schiff's bases, after oxidation."

Scar/WAVE-induced and Arp2/3-complex-mediated actin nucleation is crucial for actin assembly in protruding lamellipodia to drive cell migration. The heteropentameric Scar/WAVE-complex is composed of Scar/WAVE, Abi, Nap, Pir and a small polypeptide Brk1/HSPC300, and recent work suggested that free Brk1 serves as a homooligomeric precursor in the assembly of this complex. Here we characterized the Brk1 trimer from Dictyostelium by analytical ultracentrifugation and gelfiltration. We show for the first time its dissociation at concentrations in the nanomolar range as well as an exchange of subunits within different DdBrk1 containing complexes. Moreover, we determined the three-dimensional structure of DdBrk1 at 1.5 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography. Three chains of DdBrk1 are associated with each other forming a parallel triple coiled-coil bundle. Notably, this structure is highly similar to the heterotrimeric α-helical bundle of HSPC300/WAVE1/Abi2 within the human Scar/WAVE-complex. This finding, together with the fact that Brk1 is collectively sandwiched by the remaining subunits and also constitutes the main subunit connecting the triple-coil domain of the HSPC300/WAVE1/Abi2/ heterotrimer to Sra1(Pir1), implies a critical function of this subunit in the assembly process of the entire Scar/WAVE-complex."

A reduction in inflammation and neural damage was associated with immunomodulatory or “tolerogenic” responses to E-selectin. The purpose of the current study on ApoE deficient mice is to assess the capacity of this stroke prevention innovation to influence atherosclerosis, a major underlying cause for ischemic strokes; human E-selectin is being translated as a potential clinical prevention strategy for secondary stroke. Female ApoE−/− mice received intranasal delivery of E-selectin prior to (pre-tolerization) or simultaneously with initiation of a high-fat diet. After 7 weeks on the high-fat diet, lipid lesions in the aorta, serum triglycerides, and total cholesterol were assessed as markers of atherosclerosis development. We also assessed E-selectin-specific antibodies and cytokine responses, in addition to inflammatory responses that included macrophage infiltration of the aorta and altered gene expression profiles of aortic mRNA. Intranasal delivery of E-selectin prior to initiation of high-fat chow decreased atherosclerosis, serum total cholesterol, and expression of the leucocyte chemoattractant CCL21 that is typically upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE−/− mice. This response was associated with the induction of E-selectin specific cells producing the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 and immunosuppressive antibody isotypes. Intranasal administration of E-selectin generates E-selectin specific immune responses that are immunosuppressive in nature and can ameliorate atherosclerosis, a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. These results provide additional preclinical support for the potential of induction of mucosal tolerance to E-selectin to prevent stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2029678909,"Background Dia2 is an F-box protein found in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae. Together with Skp1 and Cul1, Dia2 forms the substrate-determining part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, otherwise known as the SCF. Dia2 has previously been implicated in the control of replication and genome stability via its interaction with the replisome progression complex. Principal Findings We identified components of the RSC chromatin remodelling complex as genetic interactors with Dia2, suggesting an additional role for Dia2 in the regulation of transcription. We show that Dia2 is involved in controlling assembly of the RSC complex. RSC belongs to a group of ATP-dependent nucleosome-remodelling complexes that controls the repositioning of nucleosomes. The RSC complex is expressed abundantly and its 17 subunits are recruited to chromatin in response to both transcription activation and repression. In the absence of Dia2, RSC-mediated transcription regulation was impaired, with concomitant abnormalities in nucleosome positioning. Conclusions Our findings imply that Dia2 is required for the correct assembly and function of the RSC complex. Dia2, by controlling the RSC chromatin remodeller, fine-tunes transcription by controlling nucleosome positioning during transcriptional activation and repression."

However, most of them require researchers to remain online and wait for returned results. The latter not only requires highly available network connection, but also may cause the network overload. Moreover, so far none of the existing approaches has been designed to address the following problems when retrieving the remote data in a mobile network environment: (1) the resources of mobile devices are limited; (2) network connection is relatively of low quality; and (3) mobile users are not always online. To address the aforementioned problems, we integrate an agent migration approach with a multi-agent system to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to the required resources or services. More importantly, the approach is fit for the mobile computing environments. Presented in this paper are also the system architecture, the migration strategy, as well as the security authentication of agent migration. As a demonstration, the remote data retrieval from GenBank was used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach."
