https://openalex.org/W2093658654,"The process of variable transmission in silicate glasses has been accomplished by optically pumping color centers by electron transfer from europium (II) or cerium (III) which absorb sunlight at higher energies than the color center. Absorbed energy quickly pumps the visible color center band to a maximum. Upon removal of activating light, the visible color spontaneously decays."
https://openalex.org/W2018549089,The ratios of bismuth-210 to lead-210 in rain samples were used to calculate tropospheric residence time for lead-210. The value of about 6 days thus obtained agrees closely with the average interval between two rainfalls.

https://openalex.org/W2020473461,"When susceptible oat tissues were treated with victorin, the toxin produced by the fungus Helminthosporium victoriae, and suspended and shaken in water, they lost electrolytes much more rapidly than untreated controls. Similar results were obtained with susceptible plants infected with H. victoriae but not with victorin-treated or inoculated, resistant plants. These results provide further evidence of the specificity of victorin and its ability to produce all the symptoms of Victoria blight of oats. They also suggest that changes in permeability, by affecting the salt balance of cells, may play a role in the augmented respiration characteristic of diseased plants."

One explanation for this difference is the radically contrasting sky orientations that are viewed from different parts of the globe, a determinative environmental factor in the development of cosmological systems that should not be neglected by the anthropologist and cultural historian."

The latter probably arise from fragments of normal imagery whose origins are unrecognized because of reduced awareness."

https://openalex.org/W2143956409,Light effects will produce the seasonal forms of Ascia monuste L. but they are not yet proved to be the only causative agent. The long-day form is melanic; the short-day form is white. Only females exhibit the effect. The capacity to form melanic females is most frequent in the Florida population and is probably genetically determined.
https://openalex.org/W2076123160,"The possible effects of radiation on the chemical reactivity of solids are described briefly. Three topics are reviewed in detail as examples of the problems involved in such effects: (1) radioinduced adsorption and desorption of O2 on zinc oxide, (2) radiation effects on silica gel's catalytic activity for H/ .sub 2/-D/sub 2/ isotope exchange reaction and adsorption capacity for H/sub 2/ and O/sub 2/, and (3) effects of S35 and external radiation on S and O isotope exchange between solid sulfate and SO/sub 2/ or O/sub 2/ gas. A bibliography of 53 references is given. (D.L.C.)"

https://openalex.org/W2031719497,The Competitive Research Grants Office was established in 1978 by the federal government to encourage and support basic research related to agriculture. The effort has been enfeebled by controversy and continues to teeter on the edge of congressional extinction. The origins of the Competitive Research Grants Office and its first 3 years of operation make an interesting portrait of the problems of science and government in these times.

Finocchiaro's Galileo and the Art of Reasoning (15 May, p. 780), the third symbol in the passage quoted from the book should have been ""A12."" The first sentence of the passage quoted from Galileo's Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems should have read, ""The art of demonstration is learned by reading works which contain demonstrations."""
