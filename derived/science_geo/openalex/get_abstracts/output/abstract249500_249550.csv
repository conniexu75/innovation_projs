https://openalex.org/W1990053396,"The canonical Wnt signalling pathway plays a key role during embryogenesis and defects in this pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of tumours, including breast cancer. The gene for secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) encodes a soluble Wnt antagonist and is located in a chromosomal region (8p22–p12) that is often deleted in breast cancer. In colon, lung, bladder and ovarian cancer SFRP1 expression is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation. We have previously shown that loss of SFRP1 protein expression is a common event in breast tumours that is associated with poor overall survival in patients with early breast cancer. To investigate the cause of SFRP1 loss in breast cancer, we performed mutation, methylation and expression analysis in human primary breast tumours and breast cell lines. No SFRP1 gene mutations were detected. However, promoter methylation of SFRP1 was frequently observed in both primary breast cancer (61%, n=130) and cell lines analysed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). We found a tight correlation (P<0.001) between methylation and loss of SFRP1 expression in primary breast cancer tissue. SFRP1 expression was restored after treatment of tumour cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Most interestingly, SFRP1 promoter methylation was an independent factor for adverse patient survival in Kaplan–Meier analysis. Our results indicate that promoter hypermethylation is the predominant mechanism of SFRP1 gene silencing in human breast cancer and that SFRP1 gene inactivation in breast cancer is associated with unfavourable prognosis."

Upon entry into S-phase several subunits of the MCM hexameric complex are phosphorylated. It is thought that phosphorylation activates the intrinsic MCM DNA helicase activity, thus allowing formation of active replication forks. Cdc7, Cdk2, and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinases regulate S-phase entry and S-phase progression and are known to phosphorylate the Mcm2 subunit. In this work, by in vitro kinase reactions and mass spectrometry analysis of the products, we have mapped phosphorylation sites in the N terminus of Mcm2 by Cdc7, Cdk2, Cdk1, and CK2. We found that Cdc7 phosphorylates Mcm2 in at least three different sites, one of which corresponds to a site also reported to be phosphorylated by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related. Three serine/proline sites were identified for Cdk2 and Cdk1, and a unique site was phosphorylated by CK2. We raised specific anti-phosphopeptide antibodies and found that all the sites identified in vitro are also phosphorylated in cells. Importantly, although all the Cdc7-dependent Mcm2 phosphosites fluctuate during the cell cycle with kinetics similar to Cdc7 kinase activity and Cdc7 protein levels, phosphorylation of Mcm2 in the putative cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) consensus sites is constant during the cell cycle. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the majority of the Mcm2 isoforms phosphorylated by Cdc7 are not stably associated with chromatin. This study forms the basis for understanding how MCM functions are regulated by multiple kinases within the cell cycle and in response to external perturbations.

In eukaryotic organisms during the G1 phase of the cell cycle a multiprotein complex known as the pre-replicative complex is formed around origin DNA. This contains the origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. Once in S-phase several components of the pre-replicative complex are phosphorylated by at least two kinases, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 3The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CK2, casein kinase 2; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; NHDF, human dermal fibroblast; HA, hemagglutinin; HU, hydroxyurea; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ATR, Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related. and the Cdc7 kinase. This leads to the unwinding of double-stranded DNA and to the loading of several proteins such as Cdc45 and the GINS complex, which, together with DNA polymerases, participate in the semi-conservative synthesis of new DNA strands during chain elongation (1Diffley J.F.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The MCM complex appears to be a crucial target of the S-phase-promoting kinases, and multiple subunits become phosphorylated at the time of origin activation (reviewed in Ref. 6Forsburg S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Once initiation has occurred, the Mcm2-7 complex travels together with replicating enzymes on DNA, being required for replication fork progression possibly by acting as the replicative helicase (4Blow J.J.

Several lines of evidence indicate that various subunits of Mcm2-7 complex are subject to multiple phosphorylations. In particular, phosphorylation of the Mcm2 protein, generally detected as altered mobility in SDS-PAGE (9Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Montagnoli A. Tenca P. Sola F. Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), appears to occur in a cell cycle-dependent manner, being detected as cells enter S-phase until mitosis. Although Mcm2 is a good substrate for both CDKs and Cdc7 kinases, it is unclear whether these kinases act independently or cooperate in MCM phosphorylation. In budding yeast it was suggested that the only cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk1, must act before Cdc7/Dbf4 (11Nougarede R. Della S.F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3795-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), whereas in a Xenopus in vitro DNA replication system only chromatin that was exposed in a sequential manner to Cdc7 first, followed by Cdk2 kinase, can efficiently replicate. Reversing the order of the kinases appeared to be detrimental to DNA replication in this system (12Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, in vitro phosphorylation assays using purified human recombinant proteins have indicated that pre-phosphorylation of MCMs with CDKs can stimulate Cdc7 activity, suggesting that CDK phosphorylation may be a prerequisite for Cdc7 function at origins (9Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, the checkpoint kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related was shown to interact with Mcm7 through its regulatory subunit ATRIP and to phosphorylate Mcm2 specifically at Ser-108, suggesting that MCM is a target of the S-phase checkpoint pathway (14Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Yoo H.Y. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53353-53364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that Ser-108 Mcm2 phosphorylation is increased in cells challenged with DNA-damaging agents. However, because basal levels of Mcm2 Ser-108 phosphorylation are detected in the absence of damage or in cells in which ATR activity is impaired, it is likely that a different kinase exists that is able to phosphorylate Mcm2 at the same site (14Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Yoo H.Y. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53353-53364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Finally, Mcm2 contains a canonical consensus site for casein kinase 2 (CK2), a kinase with pleiotropic functions that has also been implicated in regulating DNA replication proteins (16Kulartz M. Hiller E. Kappes F. Pinna L.A. Knippers R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 1011-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). At present it is not known whether all these kinases indeed phosphorylate Mcm2 in cells, what is the temporal sequence of different phosphorylation events, and, ultimately, how phosphorylation at different sites contributes to MCM function. To begin to address these questions, we set out to map specific phosphosites in the human Mcm2 protein. By generating specific immunological reagents we found that the Mcm2 N-terminal tail is phosphorylated in at least seven different sites and that the observed cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Mcm2 occurs almost exclusively at Cdc7-dependent sites. We also found that Cdc7 kinase can phosphorylate Mcm2 in the same site that is also recognized by ATR and that Cdc7 and Cdk can phosphorylate adjacent serines. Recombinant Proteins and Synthetic Peptides—Recombinant human N-terminal Mcm2 protein, corresponding to residues 10-294, was produced as described in Ref. 18Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F.

Mcm2-HA for cell expression was obtained by cloning the full-length Mcm2 into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA-HA. Point mutations described under “Results” were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutants were sequenced in their entirety. Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase was obtained as described in Ref. 18Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C. Berthelsen J. Santocanale C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Cdk2/A, Cdk1/B were produced as described elsewhere (19Lolli G. Thaler F. Valsasina B. Roletto F. Knapp S. Uggeri M. Bachi A. Matafora V. Storici P. Stewart A. Kalisz H.M. Isacchi A. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and CK2 was purchased from Calbiochem. Synthetic biotinylated peptides with sequence RTDALTSSPGRDLPPFG unphosphorylated or phosphorylated in residues Ser-40, Ser-41, or Ser-40 and Ser-41 were custom synthesized (Tufts University). Mcm2 biotinylated peptides 49-64 and 36-44 were synthesized in-house. Kinase and Phosphatase Assays—For in vitro kinase assay 6 μm N-terminal recombinant Mcm2 (wild type or mutants) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP (kinase buffer), and 10 nm Cdc7/Dbf4 or Cdk2/cyclin E or CK2. For kinase assay after immunoprecipitation, the beads were equilibrated in kinase buffer and incubated in the same buffer containing 6 μm Mcm2 for 30 min at 37 °C. For liquid chromatography/MS analysis, enzyme substrate ratio was decreased to 1:10, and the reaction was performed for 2 h in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT. Peptide phosphorylation in Fig. 2E was performed with 50 μm peptide as substrate, 4 nm enzyme, 10 μm ATP traced with radiolabeled [γ-33P]ATP in 40-μl reaction in a 96-well plate. Dowex resin (Supelco) was used to capture residual ATP before counting radioactivity. For Dot Blot analysis 50 μm peptide substrate were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in the presence of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 500 μm ATP, and 50 nm Cdc7/Dbf4 or Cdk2/CycA. For the phosphatase experiment, 15 μg of HeLa extract prepared without phosphatase inhibitors was incubated with 100 units of λ-phosphatase (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 30 °C. Liquid Chromatography/MS Analysis—20 μg of Mcm2-(10-294) protein was analyzed before or after phosphorylation with the different kinases. The chromatographic separations were performed on a 1100 Agilent instrument using a Vydac C-4 column (2.1-mm i.d._25-cm length, particle size 5 μ, pore size 300 A). After column equilibration by 10% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, an eluent program was performed with a linear gradient from 10 to 75% ACN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 35 min. The flow rate was set to 0.2 ml/min. The eluate from the column was sent directly to the MS instrument. Positive ion ESI mass spectra were obtained using 1946 single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent) with an orthogonal ESI source. The needle voltage was set at 3000 V. The nebulizer as well as drying gas (nitrogen) were maintained at 30 psi and a flow rate of 10 liters/min, respectively. The mass range was set to m/z 600-2000. The resulting final ESI mass spectrum of intact protein samples was deconvoluted automatically using Agilent chemstation deconvolution software. For peptide analysis the chromatography separation was performed on a Vydac C-18 column (2.1-mm i.d. 25-cm length, particle size 5 μ, pore size 300 A) with an elution gradient from 5 to 75% ACN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60 min. In-gel Tryptic Digestion—Protein digestion was performed with trypsin by using the Digest Pro system (Intavis, Koeln, Germany) following the standard protocol. The elution mixture was then dried in a speed vacuum and redissolved in 10 μl of aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample desalting was performed by ZipTip C18 (Millipore) with fractionated elution of 10 μl of 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, followed by 10 μl of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and finally 10 μl of 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. 0.5 μl of each sample was used for MALDI-MS analysis, and the remaining material was dried down and redissolved in 0.1% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile for nano-ESI MS/MS analysis. Additional digestion with AspN on ZipTip eluates was performed, redissolving dried ZipTip eluate in 10 μl of NH4HCO3 50 mm and adding 0.1 μg of AspN protease and incubating at 37 °C. The digestion was monitored by MALDI MS, mixing 0.5 μl of digestion mixture with 0.5 μl of matrix and analyzing it in reflector mode. MALDI-MS—Samples for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis were prepared by spotting 0.5 μl of peptide mixture with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 50:50 acetonitrile:water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and analyzed on a Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems). All spectra were collected in reflector mode using four peptides of known mass as external calibration standards. Nano-ESI-MS/MS—Tandem mass spectrometry was performed on a hybrid quadrupole-time of flight instrument (Q-ToF2; Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a Z-spray source and calibrated by injecting a solution of Glu-Fibrinopeptide (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.5 pmol/μl) at 0.5 μl/min, applying 3.2 kV to the spraying capillary, and a collision energy of 29 V. For phosphosite assignment by MS/MS, the desalted samples were dried down in a speed vacuum, redissolved in a 1:1 acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid mixture, and loaded directly into nanoflow probe tips (Micromass). Each fraction was subjected to MS analysis over the 100-2000 m/z scan range; MS/MS analyses were performed by manually selecting the phosphorylated peptides and fragmenting them under user-defined parameters of collision energy. Antibodies—The anti-pSer-13, -pSer-40/41, -pSer-108, and -pSer-139 Mcm2-specific antibodies were generated in collaboration with Zymed Laboratories Inc. by immunizing rabbits with the phosphopeptides MAS-pS-PAQRRR, APLT-pS-pS-PGR, EELTA-pS-QRE, and LLYD-pS-DEEDE, respectively. The antibodies were then purified from serum with two rounds of affinity chromatography using both phospho- and nonphosphopeptide affinity columns. The phospho-Ser-53 Mcm2-specific antibody was generated in collaboration with BIOSOURCE by injecting the rabbits with the phosphopeptide FEDE-pS-EGLLG. In this case crude antiserum was used in the experiments. Antibodies against pSer-41 and pSer-27 Mcm2 were purchased from Bethyl. Antibody to total Mcm2 was from BD Biosciences; anti-Cyclin A and Cyclin B were from Santa Cruz. For Cdc7 Western blots an antibody from Neomarker was used. Immunoprecipitation of HA-Mcm2 was performed using anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science). Cdc7 immunoprecipitations were performed with the monoclonal antibody 12A10 that was developed together with ARETA (www.Areta.com), while an anti-ATR antibody from Santa Cruz (N19) was used for ATR immunoprecipitation. For peptide competition experiments, the anti-phospho Mcm2 antibodies were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with the corresponding peptides before adding to the membranes. The peptides used were MAS-pS-PAQRRR, FEDE-pS-EGLLG, EELTA-pS-QRE, LLYD-pS-DEEDE (and the corresponding unphosphorylated peptides) for anti-pSer-13, pSer-53, pSer-108 and -pSer-139 antibodies, respectively. Synthetic peptides with sequence RTDALTSSPGRDLPPFG unphosphorylated or phosphorylated in residues Ser-41 or Ser-40 plus Ser-41 were used for anti-pSer-41 and anti-pSer-40/41 competition experiments. A ratio between peptides and purified antibodies of 5:1 (w/w) was used, while for anti-pSer-53 serum, 0.5 μg of peptides were used per μl of crude serum. Cell Synchronization and Protein Preparations—HeLa cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were grown in fibroblast basal medium (Promocell) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and growth factors. NHDF were synchronized in G0 by culturing the cells in medium without serum for 48 h. Thymidine synchronization was obtained by adding thymidine (2 mm) for 14 h. Synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry using FACScan (BD Biosciences). For total protein extraction, cells were lysed in SDS buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 1 mm DTT) and sonicated. For chromatin binding experiments, cells were lysed in CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma cocktails I and II) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min (sup fraction). The pellet was washed and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (pellet fraction). For immunoprecipitation purposes, cells were lysed in Triton buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton. The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-Mcm2 (BD Biosciences) 1:300, anti-Ser-41 Mcm2 (Bethyl) 1:1000, anti-Ser-40 Mcm2 1:200, anti-Ser-108 Mcm2 1:200. As secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG Cy3 conjugate was used (Sigma). In the indicated cases, cells were incubated in CSK buffer for 10 min on ice before fixation. For competition experiments the antibodies were preincubated with the corresponding peptides as previously indicated before adding to the coverslips. Transfections—HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Small interference RNA experiments were as previously described (10Montagnoli A. Tenca P. Sola F. Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Identification of Mcm2 Phosphosites in Vitro—To address the regulation of MCMs by phosphorylation, we began to identify phosphorylated sites on the Mcm2 protein. Annotation of the human Mcm2 amino acid sequence has been recently updated in its N terminus, and here we refer to its new Swiss Prot accession number, P49736. We and others have previously shown that an Mcm2 N-terminal fragment, corresponding to amino acids 10-294, is a good substrate for both Cdc7 and CDKs (9Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Montagnoli A. Bosotti R. Villa F. Rialland M. Brotherton D. Mercurio C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42744-42752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We extended these observations and also found that CK2 kinase, which has been proposed to modulate DNA replication by phosphorylating multiple substrates (17Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), efficiently uses the Mcm2 N-terminal fragment as a substrate. Incubation of Mcm2-(10-294) with recombinant Cdk2/A, Cdc7/Dbf4, or CK2 in the presence of radiolabeled ATP resulted in a highly labeled Mcm2-(10-294) (Fig. 1A) after SDS-PAGE separation and autoradiography. LC/MS analysis of Mcm2-(10-294) after incubation with the kinases of interest and cold ATP clearly showed the presence of several Mcm2-(10-294) species differing by 80 Da and phosphorylated in up to three sites in the reactions performed either with Cdk2 or Cdc7. Similar results were obtained using Cdk1/CycB kinase (data not shown). In contrast, only one phosphate group was added by CK2 (Fig. 1B). For all three samples, phosphorylated Mcm2-(10-294) was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Comparison of spectra obtained before and after phosphatase treatment allowed us to determine that Cdk2/CycA and Cdk1/CycB kinase complexes showed a completely superimposable pattern with three phosphorylated peptides (regions 10-17, 20-30, 34-44). Nano-ESI MS/MS analysis on the selected peptides identified Ser-13, Ser-27, and Ser-41 as phosphorylated residues (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). Two of three of these sites, Ser-27 and Ser-41, correspond to canonical S/TPXR/K CDK consensus sites (21Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Tucker J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas just the partial consensus sequence S/TP was observed in Ser-13. Using the same procedure we found that the peptide 134-149 was stoichiometrically phosphorylated (MW 1973.84) by CK2, and again by nano-ESI MS/MS we confirmed that CK2 can phosphorylate Mcm2 at serine 139 (data not shown) in a context that corresponds to the canonical casein kinase II phosphorylation motif (17Pinna L.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3873-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 139 into alanine completely abolished CK2 phosphorylation, clearly indicating that Ser-139 is the only amino acid that can be modified by the kinase in the Mcm2-(10-294) fragment (supplemental Fig. S2A). Upon tryptic digestion of MCM2-(10-294) phosphorylated by Cdc7, three different phosphopeptides were detected (34-44, 45-79, and 83-115). The phosphorylated form of peptide 83-115 after partial digestion with AspN endoprotease could be analyzed by nano-ESI MS/MS, and phosphorylation on Ser-108 was clearly detected (Fig. 2A). The nano-ESI MS/MS analysis of the other two peptides was not successful due to the large molecular weight of peptide 45-79 and to the poor ionization properties and low stoichiometry of peptide 36-44 after Cdc7 phosphorylation. Therefore the corresponding synthetic peptides (36-44 and 49-64) were produced, and upon in vitro phosphorylation with Cdc7/Dbf4, pSer-53 (Fig. 2B), and pSer-40 (Fig. 2C) were identified as specific phosphoamino acids. Mcm2 Ser-40, Mcm2 Ser-53, and Mcm2 Ser-108 are the first specific sites reported for Cdc7 kinase. Alignment of the sequences surrounding phosphorylated serines did not reveal an obvious consensus motif, although we observed that acidic amino acids surround both Ser-53 and Ser-108. Intriguingly, Ser-108 is the same residue that was found phosphorylated by ATR kinase (14Cortez D. Glick G. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10078-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) by two separate groups. We then independently confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATR phosphorylates Mcm2 N terminus at Ser-108 and that Ser-108 is the only residue phosphorylated by this kinase in this Mcm2 fragment (supplemental Fig. S2B). We also noticed that Cdc7 phosphorylation on Ser-40 immediately precedes Ser-41, which in the previous experiment was found phosphorylated by Cdk2. If surrounding negative charges are needed for better substrate recognition by Cdc7, then the introduction of a phosphate group in position +1 (Ser-41) may facilitate phosphorylation by Cdc7 on Ser-40. This observation prompted us to further investigate the relationships between Cdk2 and Cdc7 in the phosphorylation of a MCM2 peptide spanning this region (amino acids 36-44). As expected, both kinases were able to independently phosphorylate the peptide, and MS/MS analysis confirmed that only Ser-40 was phosphorylated by Cdc7 (Fig. 2C) and only Ser-41 was phosphorylated by Cdk2 (supplemental Fig. S1). We then tested whether the same peptide could be phosphorylated on both residues. Peptide 36-44 was first incubated with Cdk2, and products of the reaction were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography as a single phosphorylated peptide on Ser-41. This was then incubated with Cdc7 kinase, and MALDI analysis indicated that a second phosphate group was transferred. MS/MS analysis confirmed that both Ser-40 and Ser-41 were modified (Fig. 2D). Thus, under these experimental conditions Cdc7 and Cdk2 phosphorylation of this peptide are not mutually exclusive. By MALDI-MS we observed that pre-phosphorylation of Mcm2 peptide 36-44 on Ser-41 by Cdk2 appears to increase the efficiency of Cdc7 phosphorylation on Ser-40 (data not shown). To further explore this phenomenon we compared the efficiency of Cdc7 kinase in the phosphorylation of two synthetic peptides spanning this region, either unphosphorylated or monophosphorylated in Ser-41. Indeed, we found that Cdc7 activity was increased ∼3-fold when the phosphorylated pSer-41 peptide was used as substrate (Fig. 2E). This result supports the hypothesis that the negatively charged residues may facilitate phosphorylation by Cdc7. Alignment of N-terminal tails of Mcm2 proteins from human, mouse, and Xenopus indicates that the serines phosphorylated by Cdc7 and CK2 are highly conserved, whereas only two of three sites identified for Cdk phosphorylation are found in all three species (Fig. 3). Characterization of Anti-phospho-Mcm2 Antibodies—With the goal of verifying whether the phosphosites that were mapped in Mcm2 protein in vitro with purified kinases were also phosphorylated in vivo, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against synthetic phosphopeptides spanning Ser-13, Ser-53, Ser-108, and Ser-139. We also immunized animals with a peptide carrying double-phosphorylated Ser-40 and Ser-41. Specific anti-pSer-13, -pSer-108, and -pSer-139 antibodies were then affinity purified on antigen columns. Anti-pSer-27 and anti-pSer-41 antibodies were purchased from a commercial source. To check the specificity of the immunological reagents, purified antibodies were used as probes in Western blot experiments against recombinant Mcm2 mock treated or phosphorylated with the relevant kinase. We found that anti-pSer-13 antibody specifically recognizes Mcm2 phosphorylated by either Cdk2 or Cdk1 kinases (Fig. 4A), that anti-pSer-139 recognizes Mcm2 phosphorylated by CK2 but not by Cdc7 (Fig. 4B), and that anti-pSer-108 and anti-pSer-53 recognize Mcm2 phosphorylated by Cdc7 (Fig. 4C). Finally, to characterize the antibodies obtained by immunization with the double-phosphorylated Ser-40 and Ser-41 peptide, we tested them against a panel of four synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 34 to 49 either unphosphorylated, mono-phosphorylated on Ser-40 or Ser-41, or double phosphorylated on Ser-40 plus Ser-41. We found that these antibodies only recognized the double-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4D, top panel), and therefore this reagent will be defined as anti-Ser-40/41 antibody throughout the entire work. Consistent with MS data when mono-phosphorylated peptide on Ser-41 was incubated with Cdc7 kinase, phosphorylation at Ser-40 was also easily detected using the anti-pSer-40/41 antibody (Fig. 4D, middle panel). Importantly a double-phosphorylated peptide cannot be detected after incubation of mono-phosphorylated Ser-40 peptide with Cdk2, strongly suggesting that previous phosphorylation in Ser-40 prevents substrate recognition by this kinase (Fig. 4D, bottom panel). Using the same set of peptides we tested the specificity of the commercial anti-pSer-41 antibody. We found that this reagent equally recognizes the mono-phosphorylated peptide in Ser-41 and the double-phosphorylated peptides in Ser-40 and Ser-41 (Fig. 4E, top pane"
https://openalex.org/W1999736053,"We have proposed that the age-associated increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by electron transport chain (ETC) dysfunction may cause the elevated basal level of p38 MAPK stress response pathway activity. However, the mechanism by which ROS activates this pathway is not clear. Here we propose that activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by complex I (CI) generated ROS, in response to rotenone (ROT) treatment, is based on the ability of reduced Trx to bind to and inhibit ASK 1 and its release from the complex upon oxidation. This balance of free vs. bound ASK1 regulates the level of p38 MAPK pathway activity. To support this mechanism we demonstrate that the production of ROS by ROT treated AML12 hepatocyte cells dissociates the Trx-ASK1 complex, thereby increasing p38 MAPK pathway activity. This mechanism is supported by the ability of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) to prevent dissociation of Trx-ASK1 and activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. We also demonstrated that the ratio of ASK1/Trx-ASK1 increases in aged mouse livers and that this correlates with the increased basal activity of the p38 MAPK pathway. The longevity of Snell dwarf mice has been attributed to their resistance to oxidative stress. A comparison of the levels of Trx-ASK1 in young and aged dwarfs showed a higher abundance of the complex than in their age-matched controls. These results, which are indicative of a decreased level of oxidative stress, suggest that increased ROS production in aged liver may alter the ratio of ASK1 and Trx-ASK1, thereby increasing the age-associated basal level of p38 MAPK pathway activity."
https://openalex.org/W1993532132,"The third complement component (C3) is an acute phase protein that plays a central role in reperfusion injury in several organ models. To investigate the contribution of local synthesis of C3 and distinguish it from that of circulating complement mainly produced by hepatic synthesis, we employed a mouse renal isograft model. Our model demonstrated a close relationship between the extent of intrarenal expression of C3 and cold-ischemia induced injury. Ischemic C3-positive donor kidneys transplanted into C3-positive or C3-negative recipients developed widespread tissue damage and severe acute renal failure. In contrast, ischemic C3-negative isografts exhibited only mild degrees of functional and structural disturbance, even when transplanted into normal C3-positive recipients. Thus local synthesis of C3, mostly identified in the tubular epithelium, was essential for complement-mediated reperfusion damage, whereas circulating C3 had a negligible effect. Our results suggest a two-compartment model for the pathogenic function of C3, in which the extravascular compartment is the domain of local synthesis of C3, and where the role of circulating C3 is redundant. Our data cast new light on the mechanism of complement-mediated tissue injury in nonimmunological disorders, and challenges the longstanding dogma that circulating components are the main complement effectors of extravascular tissue damage."
https://openalex.org/W1986840808,"Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is an autosomal dominant disorder mainly characterized by the extracellular deposition of transthyretin, with special involvement of the peripheral nerve. Several animal models have been generated, including transgenic mice carrying the most prevalent TTR mutation (TTR Val30Met). TTR-Val30Met mice without endogenous TTR (TTR-Val30Met X TTR-KO) were previously analyzed in our laboratory and approximately 60% of the animals over 1 year of age were found to have deposition as amyloid, i.e., with Congo red (CR) -positive material, constituting a good tool to investigate the effect of drugs on TTR deposition and fibrillogenesis. We recently showed that the drug doxycycline acts in vitro as a TTR fibril disrupter. In the present work we assessed the activity of this drug in vivo in the TTR-Met30Val X TTR-KO mice. Doxycycline was administrated in the drinking water to 23- to 28-month-old mice over a period of 3 months. Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed no differences in nonfibrillar TTR deposition between treated (n=11) and untreated mice (n=11). However, CR-positive material was observed only in the control group (untreated) whereas none of the animals treated with doxycycline was CR-positive. Immunohistochemistry for several markers associated with amyloid, such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and serum amyloid P component (SAP), was performed. MMP-9 was altered with significantly lower levels in treated animals compared with the control group. Mouse SAP was absent in treated animals, being observed only in untreated animals presenting TTR congophilic deposits. These results indicate that doxycycline is capable of disrupting TTR CR-positive amyloid deposits and decreases standard markers associated with fibrillar deposition, being a potential drug in the treatment of amyloidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2092665840,"The p53 family consists of p53, p63, and p73, each of which has multiple isoforms due to transcription at two separate promoters and alternative splicing. Although p53 is a bona fide tumor suppressor, p63 appears to have a Janus-faced function as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. To address the two opposing functions of p63, we analyzed its target genes. Here, we found that GPX2, which encodes a glutathione peroxidase, is up-regulated by p63 but not p53. Accordingly, a unique responsive element was found in the promoter of the GPX2 gene that can be activated and bound by p63 but not p53. We also found that upon overexpression, GPX2 alleviates the apoptotic response of MCF7 cells to oxidative stresses. Interestingly, the protective function of GPX2 is p53 dependent. Likewise, we showed that a deficiency in GPX2 renders MCF7 cells susceptible to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Given that the ΔN isoform of p63 is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells, the observations here provide an insight into the mechanism by which some isoforms of p63 serve as a pro-survival factor by up-regulating GPX2 to reduce the p53-dependent oxidative stress-induced apoptotic response.

GPX2, a member of the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 2The abbreviations used are: GPX, glutathione peroxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; nt, nucleotide; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. 2The abbreviations used are: GPX, glutathione peroxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; nt, nucleotide; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. family, is a selenoprotein and a glutathione peroxidase (1Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). GPX2 is a tetrameric enzyme localized in cytosol and capable of reducing hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. GPX2 appears to be expressed in selected tissues, including mammary tissue and the gastrointestinal track, and thus it was originally designated GPX-GI (2Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its tissue-specific expression, it is hypothesized that GPX2 in the gastrointestinal track plays a critical role in protecting mammals from the toxicity, including cancer formation, by ingested lipid hydroperoxides or reactive oxygen species derived from inflammation (1Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, a deficiency in Gpx2 together with Gpx1 predisposes mice susceptible to bacteria-associated inflammation and cancer (3Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Chu P.G. Longmate J.A. Huycke M.M. Wilczynski S. Doroshow J.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), suggesting that peroxidative stress plays a role in ileal and colonic pathology and inflammation.As a selenoprotein, the expression of GPX2 can be regulated posttranscriptionally by the availability of selenium (1Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of GPX2 is found to oscillate rapidly in response to selenium deprivation and supplementation, suggesting that GPX2 is a major selenoprotein for cell survival (4Wingler K. Bocher M. Flohe L. Kollmus H. Brigelius-Flohe R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, GPX2 is found to be transcriptionally regulated by oxidants and antioxidants (1Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Brigelius-Flohe R. Muller C. Menard J. Florian S. Schmehl K. Wingler K. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For example, GPX2 is regulated by antioxidants via Nrf2 transcription factor (6Banning A. Deubel S. Kluth D. Zhou Z. Brigelius-Flohe R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4914-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and retinoic acids via three putative retinoic acid-responsive elements in the GPX2 promoter (7Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Lee L. Wilczynski S. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased expression of GPX2 in the small intestine coincides with rapid growth of the intestine, consistent with its potential regulation by β-catenin/T cell factor-4 in colonic epithelium (1Chu F.F. Esworthy R.S. Doroshow J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).p63, a member of the p53 family, is expressed as two major groups, the TA and ΔN variants (8Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C.

Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The TA variant, which is expressed from the upstream promoter, contains an activation domain similar to the first activation domain in p53 and thus has a strong transcriptional activity (10Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Like p53, TA p63 is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when overexpressed (8Osada M. Ohba M. Kawahara C. Ishioka C. Kanamaru R. Katoh I. Ikawa Y. Nimura Y. Nakagawara A. Obinata M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). However, the ΔN variant, which is expressed from the cryptic promoter in intron 3, lacks an activation domain conserved in p53 but obtains 14 unique residues at the N terminus (10Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). These 14 amino acids together with the adjacent residues constitute an activation domain for the ΔN variant (11Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the ΔN variant also possesses a transcriptional activity and is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, albeit much weaker than the TA variant (11Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ΔN, but not the TA, variant is highly expressed in the basal epithelial cells and often amplified in tumor cells (12Di Como C.J. Urist M.J. Babayan I. Drobnjak M. Hedvat C.V.

Jen J. Sidransky D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5462-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition, the ΔN variant has a dominant negative activity toward p53, although wild-type p63 and p53 are incapable of forming a heterotetramer (14Davison T.S. Vagner C. Kaghad M. Ayed A. Caput D. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18709-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although ΔNp63 may compete with p53 to bind to the p53-responsive element in, and thus attenuate the induction of, some p53 target genes, only a small subset of the promoters of the p53 target genes are recognized by ΔNp63 (15Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which ΔNp63 inhibits p53 merits further study.In this study, we found that p63, especially ΔNp63γ, up-regulate GPX2, which inhibits the activation of p53 by reducing the extent of oxidative stresses and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Thus, we have provided a novel mechanism by which ΔNp63 regulates its own unique target genes, which serve as a mediator of ΔNp63 to antagonize the activity of p53.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—For inducible expression of GPX2, a cDNA fragment that contains a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence at the 5′-end, GPX2 open reading frame, and 304-bp 3′-untranslated region, was amplified from an Expressed Sequence Tag clone (GenBank™ accession code BG468501) with the forward primer (5′-AAG CTT ACC ATG GAG TAC CCA TAC GAC GTA CCA GAT TAC GCT GCT TTC ATT GCC AAG TCC TTC TAT G-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CTC GAG CTT CTA GCA GAG TGG CTC CAG GC-3′), confirmed by DNA sequencing, and then cloned into pcDNA4 tetracycline-inducible expression vector (Invitrogen).To generate constructs that express p53 small interfering RNA (siRNA), a DNA oligonucleotide as reported previously (16Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) was synthesized and cloned into pBabe-U6 at BamH1 and XhoI sites. The PolIII promoter-driven plasmid pBabe-U6 was described previously (17Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To generate a construct that express GPX2 siRNA under the control of tetracycline, one pair of oligos was cloned into pBabe-H1 at HindIII and BglII sites, and the resulting construct was designated pBabe-GPX2. pBabe-H1 is a PolIII promoter-driven plasmid with a tetracycline operator sequence inserted before the transcriptional starting site (18van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The siRNA oligos cloned in pBabe-GPX2 are sense, 5′-GAT CCC CGG TAG ATT TCA ATA CGT TCT TCA AGA GAG AAC GTA TTG AAA TCT ACC TTT TTG GAA A-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAG GTA GAT TTC AAT ACG TTC TCT CTT GAA GAA CGT ATT GAA ATC TAC C GGG-3′, with the siRNA targeting region shown in bold.The luciferase reporter under the control of the p21 promoter was as previously described (19Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 162-bp fragment from the GPX2 promoter (from nt –140 to +22) was amplified from the genomic DNA purified from MCF7 cells with a forward primer, 5′-CTC GAG CTT ACA GGT GGG GAC CTG TTT TTG-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-AAG CTT TGA AGC GCA GAG TGA GCC CCG-3′, and confirmed by sequencing. The fragment was cloned into a promoter-less luciferase reporter vector pGL2 (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting plasmid is designated pGL2-GPX2 (–140/+22). pGL2-GPX2(–140/+22)M was generated with the same GPX2 promoter fragment that contains two point mutations in the potential p53 response element (from nt –129 to –101); that is, the C at nt –126 and the C at nt –107 were replaced with A and T, respectively.Cell Culture—MCF7 cell lines, which inducibly express various isoforms of the p53 family proteins, were cultured as described previously (11Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell.

MCF7-GPX2 cell lines, which inducibly express GPX2 under the control of the tetracycline-regulated promoter, were generated as described (23Dohn M. Nozell S. Willis A. Chen X. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 223: 221-235PubMed Google Scholar). To generate inducible GPX2 knockdown cell lines, pBabe-H1-GPX2siRNA was transfected into MCF7 cells in which a tetracycline repressor is expressed by pcDNA6. The resulting GPX2 knockdown cell lines were selected with puromycin and confirmed by Northern blot analysis.Affymetrix GeneChip Assay and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). U133 plus GeneChip, which contains oligos representing 37,000 unique human transcripts, was purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Northern blot analysis and preparation of p21 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were as described previously (24Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4257-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The GPX2 probe was prepared from an Expressed Sequence Tag clone (GenBank™ accession code BG468501).Luciferase Assay—A dual luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter, 0.25 μg of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 that expresses a p53 family protein, and 5 ng of Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL-CMV (Promega) were cotransfected into H1299 cells. The fold increase in relative luciferase activity is a product of the luciferase activity induced by a p53 family protein divided by that induced by an empty pcDNA3 vector. The pGL2-p21A luciferase reporter under the control of the two p53-responsive elements in the p21 promoter was used as a positive control (19Nozell S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP was performed as previously described (17Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Harms K.L. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2014-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells, which were uninduced (–) or induced (+) to expression p63γ or ΔNp63γ for 24 h, were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and chromatin was sonicated to generate 200- to 1000-bp DNA fragments. Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with various antibodies. The DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. After phenol and chloroform extraction, DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. To amplify the region from nt –340 to –120 in the GPX2 promoter, PCR was performed with the forward primer 5′-GTA GGA GTC AAT CCT GCA TCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAC AGG TCC CCA CCT GTA AG-3′. To amplify the region from nt –2312 to –2131 in the p21 promoter, PCR was performed with the forward primer 5′-CAG GCT GTG GCT CTG ATT GG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTC AGA GTA ACA GGC TAA GG-3′.Cell Survival Assay—To determine the cytotoxicity induced by H2O2, cells seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate, were induced with or without tetracycline (1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h, treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 2.5 h, and then rinsed with and cultured in fresh medium. At the times indicated, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline twice to remove dead cells and debris. Live cells on the plate were trypsinized and collected separately. Cells from each plate were counted at least three times using the Coulter cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The average number of cells from three wells was used for survival ratio determination. The percentage of live cells on day 0 was set as 100%. The percentage of live cells after various days of treatment was the product of total live cells divided by total number of cells on day 0.Western Blot Analysis—Mouse anti-Mdm2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against p53, p21, HA, and Myc epitopes and actin were described previously (26Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anti-DR5 was kindly provided by Dr. T. Zhou (The University of Alabama at Birmingham).DNA Histogram Analysis—Cells were seeded at 4 × 105/10-cm plate, induced with or without tetracycline for 72 h, treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 2.5 h, and rinsed with and cultured in fresh medium for 24 h. Both floating dead cells in the medium and live cells on the plate were collected and fixed with 10 ml of 70% ethanol for 24 h. The fixed cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 50 μg/ml each of RNase A and propidium iodide (Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter within 4 h. The percentages of cells in the sub-G1, G0-G1, S, and G2-M phases were determined using the CELLQuest program (BD Biosciences).RESULTSIdentification of GPX2 as a Unique Target Gene of p63—To identify novel target genes regulated by the p53 family, Affymetrix GeneChip assay was performed. Total RNA was isolated from MCF7 cells that were uninduced and induced to express p63γ by withdrawal of tetracycline from the culture medium. cRNA was synthesized and used to hybridize the Affymetrix U133 plus GeneChip. We found that GPX2, a potential novel target gene regulated by p53 family members, was highly induced in cells expressing p63γ. To confirm the microarray study, we performed Northern blot analysis. The level of p21 was examined as a positive control and found to be induced by p53 and p63γ (Fig. 1), consistent with our previous report (11Dohn M. Zhang S. Chen X. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3193-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Liu G. Nozell S. Xiao H. Chen X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Nozell S.

Here, we found that GPX2 was highly induced by p63γ and ΔNp63γ, weakly by p63α and ΔNp63α, but not by p53 and p53(R249S). We also found that GPX2 is not induced in cells upon DNA damage (data not shown). This indicates that GPX2 is a unique target of p63, but not p53.As a member of the p53 family, p63 is capable of transactivating a promoter that contains a p53-responsive element (RRRC(A/T)(A/T)GYYY; R represents purine, whereas Y represents pyrimidine) (27el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), although not all of the p53 target genes can be regulated by p63 (15Harms K. Nozell S. Chen X. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 822-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that in addition to recognizing the p53-responsive element, p63 selectively transactivates a promoter that contains a unique sequence (RRRCGTGYYY) (28Osada M. Park H.L. Nagakawa Y. Yamashita K. Fomenkov A. Kim M.S. Wu G. Nomoto S. Trink B. Sidransky D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6077-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, no consensus p53- or p63-responsive element was found in the genomic locus encoding the GPX2 gene. Nevertheless, we cloned the promoter of the GPX2 gene in front of a luciferase reporter for luciferase assay (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, we found that the GPX2 promoter from nt –140 to +22 was activated highly by p63γ and ΔNp63γ, weakly by p63α and ΔNp63α, but not by mutant ΔNp63γ(R149W), wild-type p53, and mutant p53(R249S) (Fig. 2B). Arg-149 in p63 corresponds to Arg-175 in p53, and mutation of this residue alters the overall structure of p53 and renders p53 incapable of binding to DNA (29Willis A. Jung E.J. Wakefield T. Chen X. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). R149W mutation in ΔNp63 was found in ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip and palate (EEC) syndrome (30Brunner H.G. Hamel B.C. Van Bokhoven H. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of p63γ and ΔNp63γ to transactivate GPX2 is consistent with their ability to regulate the endogenous GPX2 gene. As a positive control, we showed that the luciferase reporter under the control of the p21 promoter was activated highly by p53 and p63γ, weakly by p63α and ΔNp63γ, but not by p53(R249S), ΔNp63α, and ΔNp63γ(R149W) (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2Identification of a p63-responsive element in the GPX2 promoter. A, schematic presentation of the GPX2 locus and luciferase reporter constructs. A potential p63-responsive element is located at nt –129 to –101 in the promoter of the GPX2 gene. The reporter construct, pGL2-GPX2 (–140/+22M), carries two nucleotide substitutions in which the first C in both half sites was substituted with A and T, respectively. B, the potential p63 binding site in the GPX2 promoter is responsive to p63γ and ΔNp63γ, weakly to p63α and ΔNp63α, but not to p53, mutant p53(R249S), and mutant ΔNp63γ(R149W). C, schematic presentation of the p21 luciferase reporter construct. D, the p21 promoter is responsive to p53 and p63γ, weakly to p63α and ΔNp63γ, but not to mutant p53(R249S), ΔNp63α, and mutant ΔNp63γ. E, schematic presentation of the GPX2 and p21 promoter and the location of the potential p53 family-responsive element(s) and PCR primers used for ChIP assay. F, p63γ directly binds to the GPX2 and p21 promoter in vivo. p63γ-DNA complexes were captured with anti-Myc. Anti-FLAG antibody was used as a control. G, ΔNp63γ directly binds to the GPX2 and p21 promoter in vivo. The experiments were performed as described in panel F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Upon further searching for a potential responsive element within the promoter from nt –140 to +22, we found a sequence (–129 GGACCTGTTTttgctaagtCATCCTGGGG–101) that shares some common nucleotides (in bold) with the canonical p53-responsive element and recently reported unique p63-responsive element. To determine whether this element is required, we mutated two nucleotides predicted to be critical for p53- and p63-responsive elements, that is, the first C in both half site was replaced with A and T, respectively. The resulting reporter was designated pGL2-GPX2(–140/+22)M. We found that the luciferase activity for pGL2-GPX2(–140/+22)M was not significantly increased by p63γ and ΔNp63γ (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that RRRCCTGYYY is a novel responsive element for p63γ and ΔNp63γ.Next, we performed ChIP assay to determine whether p63γ and ΔNp63γ directly bind to the novel responsive element in the GPX2 gene in vivo. The p63-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. We found that the captured fragment with the novel responsive element in the GPX2 gene was highly enriched upon inducible expression of p63γ or ΔNp63γ (Fig. 2F). No DNA fragment was enriched by the control antibody anti-FLAG (Fig. 2F). As a positive control, the fragment with the upstream p53-responsive element in the p21 gene was enriched upon inducible expression of p63γ or ΔNp63γ (Fig. 2G).Overexpression of GPX2 Decreases the Sensitivity of MCF7 Cells to Oxidative Stress-induced Cell Death—To determine whether GPX2 has an effect on cell proliferation, we generated MCF7 cell lines that express GPX2 tagged with HA at the N terminus under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Four representative clones are shown in Fig. 3A. Next, we performed growth rate analysis with the MCF7-GPX2–31 cell line and found that GPX2 had no effect on the growth rate of MCF7 cells over a 5-day period (Fig. 3B). Thus, expression of GPX2 alone has little, if any, effect on cell proliferation.FIGURE 3Overexpression of GPX2 decreases the sensitivity of cells to H2O2-induced cell death. A, the level of HA-tagged GPX2 in four representative MCF7 cell lines was quantified by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. Extracts were collected from cells uninduced (–) or induced (+) to express GPX2 for 24 h. B, expression of GPX2 alone has little effect on MCF7 cell proliferation. Growth rate of MCF7 cells uninduced or induced to express GPX2 over a 5-day period. C, GPX2 protects MCF7 cells from H2O2-induced cell death. MCF7 cells were uninduced (control) or induced (GPX2) to express GPX2 for 3 days and then treated with 0–250 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h. 24 h following the treatment, surviving cells were counted. D, tetracycline has no effect on H2O2-induced cell death. The experiment was performed as in panel C. E, GPX2 protects MCF7 cells from H2O2-induced cell death. MCF7 cells were uninduced (control) or induced (GPX2) to express GPX2 for 3 days and then treated with 75 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h. The surviving cells were determined over a 4-day period. F, GPX2 protects MCF7 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. MCF7 cells were uninduced (control) or induced (GPX2) to express GPX2 for 3 days and then treated with 0 or 75 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h. 24 h following treatment, both floating dead cells in the medium and live cells on the plate were collected and stained with propidium iodide for DNA histogram analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on the expression pattern of GPX2 in the gastrointestinal tract, it is hypothesized that GPX2 may play a role in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by food-borne alkyl hydroperoxide (5Brigelius-Flohe R. Muller C. Menard J. Florian S. Schmehl K. Wingler K. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether overexpression of GPX2 inhibits oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in MCF7 cells. Upon addition of tetracycline to induce GPX2, MCF7 cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 2.5 h. 24 h following the treatment, surviving cells were counted. We found that the number of surviving cells was significantly increased by induction of GPX2 (Fig. 3C). As a control, the parental MCF7 cells in the presence or absence of tetracycline were similarly treated with H2O2 for 2.5 h. We found that tetracycline itself had no effect on cell survival (Fig. 3D). To further determine the effect of GPX2 on the survival rate of cells exposed to oxidative stresses, we examined the number of surviving cells at various times following treatment with 75 μm H2O2 for 2.5 h. We found that upon induction of GPX2, MCF7 cells began to proliferate on day 2 after H2O2 treatment. In contrast, in the absence of GPX2, MCF7 cells failed to proliferate over the 4-day testing period (Fig. 3E).To determine the underlying mechanism by which GPX2 is able to alleviate the toxicity of H2O2 to MCF7 cells, apoptosis was examined by DNA histogram analysis. In control cells without treatment with H2O2, GPX2 has no effect on apoptosis as less than 0.3% of cells underwent apoptosis (Fig. 3F), suggesting that endogenous GPX2 is sufficient to eliminate the toxic effect of endogenous oxidative stresses. However, upon treatment with H2O2, exogenous GPX2 reduced the level of apoptosis from 7.82 to 1.30% (Fig. 3F). These data are consistent with that obtained from the cell survival assay.GPX2-mediated Protection of Oxidative Stress-induced Apoptosis Is p53 Dependent—The importance of p53 in mediating hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis has been well established, as elimination of p53 function enhances the survival rate of H2O2-treated cells (31Kitamura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2025744983,"Wnt signaling plays pivotal roles in the regulation of embryogenesis and cancer development. Xenopus Dapper (Dpr) was identified as an interacting protein for Dishevelled (Dvl), a Wnt signaling mediator, and modulates Wnt signaling. However, it is largely unclear how Dpr regulates Wnt signaling. Here, we present evidence that human Dpr1, the ortholog of Xenopus Dpr, inhibits Wnt signaling. We have identified the regions responsible for the Dpr-Dvl interaction in both proteins and found that the interaction interface is formed between the DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin) domain of Dvl and the central and the C-terminal regions of Dpr1. The inhibitory function of human Dpr1 requires both its N and C terminus. Overexpression of the C-terminal region corresponding to the last 225 amino acids of Dpr1, in contrast to wild-type Dpr1, enhances Wnt signaling, suggesting a dominant negative function of this region. Furthermore, we have shown that Dpr1 induces Dvl degradation via a lysosome inhibitor-sensitive and proteasome inhibitor-insensitive mechanism. Knockdown of Dpr1 by RNA interference up-regulates endogenous Dvl2 protein. Taken together, our data indicate that the inhibitory activity of Dpr on Wnt signaling is conserved from Xenopus to human and that Dpr1 antagonizes Wnt signaling by inducing Dvl degradation.

It inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β-induced degradation of β-catenin and therefore activates the expression of target genes via the β-catenin-T-cell factor-lymphoid enhancer factor complex (3Moon R.T.

Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Dvl is also involved in a β-catenin-independent noncanonical pathway by influencing calcium influx, the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and GTP-binding proteins (5Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Dapper (Dpr), originally identified as a Dvl-interacting protein, has been shown to inhibit both Dvl-mediated canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways and is required for formation of the notochord and head structures in Xenopus embryos (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Several Dpr-related proteins have been identified, and they may have distinct functions. Frodo, which shares 90% identity with Dpr at the amino acid level, promotes Wnt signaling in axis formation and in eye and neural development in Xenopus embryos (7Gloy J. Hikasa H. Sokol S.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Frodo has also been shown to associate with T-cell factor via its N terminus and may directly link Dvl signaling to T-cell factor in a β-catenin-independent way (8Hikasa H. Sokol S.Y. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4725-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The zebrafish Dpr1, similar to Xenopus Frodo, was suggested to be a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (9Waxman J.S. Hocking A.M. Stoick C.L. Moon R.T. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 5909-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the fish Dpr2, which exhibits a high similarity at both the N and C terminus, albeit having an overall low similarity to Dpr1, specifically antagonizes transforming growth factor-β/Nodal signaling (10Zhang L. Zhou H. Su Y. Sun Z. Zhang H. Zhang Y. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Science. 2004; 306: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both Dpr1 and Dpr2 are highly conserved from fish to human (11Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 907-913PubMed Google Scholar, 12Katoh M. Int. J. Mol.

Dpr1 not only regulates embryo development but may have an important role in tumorigenesis, and a computer analysis predicted that both Dpr1 and Dpr2 may be involved in the formation of certain tumors (11Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 907-913PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that down-regulation of human Dpr1, an ortholog of Xenopus Dpr, was observed in hepatocellular carcinoma, and this down-regulation significantly correlated with the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin (14Yau T.O. Chan C.Y. Chan K.L. Lee M.F. Wong C.M. Fan S.T. Ng I.O. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To further define the functions of Dpr1, we have cloned human Dpr1 and mouse Dpr1. In this report, we have shown that mammalian Dpr1 inhibits expression of the Wnt-responsive reporters lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)-luciferase and TopFlash-luciferase. We have further demonstrated that Dpr1 binds Dvl and induces its degradation in a lysosome inhibitor-sensitive pathway. Construction of Plasmids—Human Dpr1 cDNA was assembled from two human EST clones WF08 (GenBank™ accession number gi:24420531) and BX356369 (gi:46285645) and subcloned into pCMV-Myc with EcoRI and XhoI and into pCMV-HA with HindIII and XbaI. Mouse Dpr1 cDNA was constructed by assembling the mouse expressed sequence tag BE952137 (gi:10592199), a reverse transcription-PCR product from mouse thymus covering the very 5′-end and PCR product from mouse genomic DNA covering the 3′-end. Myc-tagged Dpr1 deletions were generated by restriction digestions and PCR and subcloned into pCMV-Myc. All of the sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. Dvl constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Xi He (Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School) (15Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). LEF-luciferase and TopFlash-luciferase were obtained from Dr. Zhijie Chang (Tsinghua University). Cell Culture—HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C. Generating the Dpr1 Antibody—Dpr1 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbit with human Dpr1 (282–516)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—HeLa cells or HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method or Lipofectamine (Roche Applied Science). At 40 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After 12,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the precipitants were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and the immune complexes eluted with sample buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with primary antibodies against the HA tag (made in-house), Myc tag (made in-house), and FLAG tag (Sigma, M2) and secondary anti-mouse antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. Most experiments were carried with human Dpr1 unless mouse Dpr1 was indicated. Goat anti-Dvl2 (sc-7399) and mouse anti-β-catenin (sc-7963) antibodies was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK293T cells were transfected with various plasmids as indicated in the figures. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured by a luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Reporter activity was normalized to the control Renilla. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraform-aldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and with fluorescein- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for an additional 40 min. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). RNA Interference—pSUPER.retro (pSR) (OligoEngine) was used for the expression of siRNA. The target sequence of hDpr1 is 5′-ATCTGCAGATCTCATAGGATT-3′, corresponding to 713–733nt of hDpr1 (pSR01). A nonspecific siRNA expression vector, pNS, containing the sequence 5′-AGCGGACTAAGTCCATTGC-3′, was constructed as a negative control. These sequences were all analyzed by a BLAST search of the GenBank™ Data Base to avoid similar sequences found in the human genome. Oligonucleotides were synthesized (Bioasin, Shanghai, China) and inserted into the pSR vector in the SalI and KpnI sites. Dpr1 Antagonizes Wnt Signaling via Dvl—Xenopus Dpr has been shown to act as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To test whether the inhibitory function of Dpr on Wnt signaling is conserved in mammalian cells, the cDNAs encoding human and mouse Dpr1 were cloned and examined for their activities with Wnt-responsive reporters. Overexpression of human or mouse Dpr1 interfered with Wnt- and Dvl-induced expression of the reporters LEF-luciferase (16Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Chan S.C. Han J. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A–C), whereas they had no effect on the control reporter Fopflash-luciferase (data not shown). Human Dpr1 also inhibited c-Jun-mediated reporter expression (data not shown), which is consistent with the previous results obtained with Xenopus Dpr and supports the notion that Dpr1 antagonizes both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We presumed that increased expression of Dvl should be able to reverse the inhibitory effect of Dpr1 if Dpr1 functions on Dvl to modulate Wnt signaling. Overexpression of Dvl2 indeed overcame Dpr1 inhibition (Fig. 1D). To examine the activity of endogenous Dpr1 on Wnt signaling, we constructed a siRNA against human Dpr1, which could specifically knock down human Dpr1 expression but had no effect on Smad3 expression (Fig. 1F). Down-regulation of endogenous Dpr1 by RNAi not only led to a higher basal expression of the LEF-luciferase reporter, but also increased Dvl2- and Wnt1-promoted expression of this reporter, whereas a nonspecific siRNA had no effect (Fig. 1E). Our data suggest a conserved inhibitory function of Dpr1 in the Wnt signaling pathway from Xenopus to mouse and human. These results are also in agreement with a recent observation that down-regulation of Dpr1 in hepatocellular carcinoma leads to a high Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity (14Yau T.O. Chan C.Y. Chan K.L. Lee M.F. Wong C.M. Fan S.T. Ng I.O. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interaction between Mammalian Dpr1 and Dvl at the Endogenous Levels—It was reported that Xenopus Dpr1 can directly interact with Xenopus Dvl (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction with mammalian Dpr1, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay with the endogenous proteins. The antibody we generated against a human Dpr1 fragment (amino acids 282–516) could detect endogenous Dpr1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Indeed, Dvl2 was found in anti-Dpr1 immunoprecipitant but not in the control with a nonspecific antibody (Fig. 2A, upper panel). To further consolidate this interaction, we studied subcellular localization of Dpr1 and Dvl2 in HeLa cells. Dpr1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm as spots (Fig. 2B), and most Dpr1 proteins were co-localized with Dvl2 (Fig. 2C). These data further support that Dpr1 binds Dvl at the physiological condition. Identification of the Regions Responsible for the Dpr1-Dvl Interaction—There are three conserved domains in Dvl proteins, the N-terminal DIX (Dishevelled and Axin) domain, the middle PDZ (PSD-95, Discs-large, and ZO-1) domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain, each of which mediates association with a variety of Dvl-associating proteins (19Wharton Jr., K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To map the regions of Dvl responsible for the interaction with Dpr1, plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Dvl deletion mutants were transfected with or without Myc-tagged human Dpr1 into HEK293T cells. The protein complexes were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, the DIX domain deletion (Δ1–109 amino acids) and PDZ domain deletion (Δ241–390 amino acids) mutants of Dvl2, similar to wild type, retained the ability to bind to Dpr1, whereas deletion of the DEP domain (Δ365–667 amino acids) virtually eliminated its association with Dpr1. Furthermore, Dpr1 interacted with a short region containing DEP domain (429–593 amino acids) but not with another long region containing PDZ domain (134–432 amino acids) (Fig. 3B), indicating that the DEP domain is sufficient for Dpr1 binding. This result suggests that Dvl binds to human Dpr1 and Xenopus Dpr via different regions, with the DEP domain binding to human Dpr1 and the PDZ domain to Xenopus Dpr (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S.

Interestingly, the DIX domain of Xenopus Dvl has been reported to mediate its association with Frodo (7Gloy J. Hikasa H. Sokol S.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To identify the Dvl-associating regions of Dpr1, similar co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in HEK293T cells with truncation mutants of Dpr1 (Fig. 4A). The mutants containing the C-terminal regions of Dpr1 (C1 and C2 of human Dpr1 and C1 of mouse Dpr1) interacted with Dvl (Fig. 4B), consistent with the previous reports that the C terminus of Xenopus Dpr and Frodo is critical for Dvl binding (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Gloy J.

The C-terminal region of Dpr1 has been shown to mediate a direct binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl (6Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T.

Furthermore, the peptides derived from the C-terminal tail of Dpr inhibits Wnt1-induced secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos (20Wong H.C. Bourdelas A. Krauss A. Lee H.J. Shao Y. Wu D. Mlodzik M. Shi D.L. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of the Dpr1 C-terminal tail-mediated interaction with Dvl. In addition, we found that the N2 mutant of Dpr1 (amino acids 1–619) that lacks the C-terminal region also associated with Dvl, whereas the N1 mutant (amino acids 1–331) did not. These data were confirmed by the subcellular co-localization of Dpr1 mutants with Dvl. The N1 mutant that does not bind to Dvl did not co-localize with Dvl (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results indicate that Dpr1 can interact with Dvl via two regions, the central and the C-terminal regions. Next, we attempted to investigate the functional significance of the Dpr1-Dvl interaction by examining the effect of Dpr1 truncated mutants on Wnt signaling with the LEF-luciferase reporter. Neither the N nor the C terminus of Dpr1 had inhibitory effects on Wnt-activated reporter expression (Fig. 4D). An N-terminal truncation mutant (Dpr1-C3) lacking the first 96 amino acids lost the ability to inhibit Wnt signaling, implying that both the N and the C terminus of Dpr1 is required for its modulating activity on Wnt signaling. Notably, overexpression of the Dpr1 C-terminal C2 mutant resulted in constantly increased Wnt signaling, suggesting that the C-terminal region may possess a dominant negative effect on endogenous Dpr1. Dpr1 Induces Dvl Degradation—When Dvl was co-expressed with Dpr1, we noticed a low protein level of both endogenous and ectopically expressed Dvl (Figs. 2A, 3A, and 4B), suggesting that overexpression of Dpr1 may lead to Dvl degradation. To test this possibility, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Dpr1 and Dvl and treated with or without different protein degradation inhibitors. Co-expression of Dpr1 with Dvl led to decreased protein levels of Dvl (Fig. 5A), and lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1, NH4Cl, and chloroquine blocked Dpr1-induced degradation of Dvl. However, the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin had no effect, although MG132 was effective in preventing glycogen synthase kinase 3β-promoted degradation of β-catenin via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway (Fig. 5B) (21Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Dpr1 also induced degradation of endogenous Dvl2 in a similar manner (Fig. 5C). To investigate the role of endogenous Dpr1 in regulating Dvl2 protein stability, HeLa cells were transfected with pSUPER-encoding Dpr1-specific siRNA or a nonspecific siRNA and treated with puromycin for 72 h to select the transfected cells. Thereafter, the cells were harvested for the examination of endogenous protein expression by immunoblotting. Expression of Dpr1-specific siRNA effectively knocked down the endogenous Dpr1 protein level (Fig. 5D, middle panel). Importantly, endogenous Dvl2 protein levels were evidently increased when Dpr1 protein was knocked down (Fig. 5D, upper panel). This result clearly shows that Dpr1 plays an important role in modulating Dvl protein levels in the physiological condition. We further examined whether any of the Dpr1 deletion mutants has an effect on Dvl stability when they were co-expressed with Dvl2 and found that none of them induced Dvl2 degradation (Fig. 5E). These results together suggest that Dpr1 interferes with Wnt signaling by directly binding to and targeting Dvl for lysosome inhibitor-sensitive degradation. Dpr proteins belong to a newly defined protein family. Although much more work is needed to elucidate their physiological and pathological functions in embryos and adult tissues, it appears that Dpr1 and Dpr2 play distinct roles by modulating Wnt signaling and transforming growth factor-β signaling, respectively. Here, we show that Dpr1 interacts with Dvl and enhances Dvl degradation in a lysosome inhibitor-sensitive and proteasome inhibitor-insensitive manner in an analogous way to the activity of Dpr2 that associates with transforming growth factor-β type I receptors and targets them for lysosomal degradation (10Zhang L. Zhou H. Su Y. Sun Z. Zhang H. Zhang Y. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Science. 2004; 306: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Dvl shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (22Itoh K. Brott B.K. Bae G.U. Ratcliffe M.J. Sokol S.Y. J. Biol. 2005; 4: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and can also be recruited to the plasma membrane (23Medina A. Steinbeisser H. Dev.

Science. 2003; 301: 1391-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). How Dpr1 promotes Dvl degradation awaits further investigation. A recent study demonstrated that PR72, a protein phosphatase type 2A regulatory subunit, can induce Dvl degradation probably in a proteasome inhibitor-sensitive manner (25Creyghton M.P. Roel G. Eichhorn P.J. Hijmans E.M. Maurer I. Destree O. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the stability of Dvl can be regulated by distinct mechanisms possibly according to its different subcellular localizations. We are grateful to Drs. Shengcai Lin, Anming Meng, Zhijie Chang, and Xi He for plasmids, Jieqi Wang for technical assistance, and Dr. Shengcai Lin for critical reading of the manuscript."

Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most serious complications in diabetic patients and a leading cause of blindness. Among its earliest steps is the loss of retinal microvascular pericytes. Hyperglycemia is a prerequisite for the development of the chronic complications of diabetes, but the precise mechanisms leading to vascular and tissue damage have not been fully elucidated. Biochemical mechanisms that have been hypothesized to account for the adverse effects of hyperglycemia include increased glucose flux through the polyol pathway (1Yabe-Nishimura C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 21-33PubMed Google Scholar), formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) 2The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end products; ROS, reactive oxygen species; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; AR, aldose reductase; TK, transketolase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BRP, bovine retinal pericytes; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry; G5.6, 5.6 mmol/liter d-glucose; G28, 28 mmol/liter d-glucose; T, thiamine; BT, benfotiamine; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum. 2The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end products; ROS, reactive oxygen species; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; AR, aldose reductase; TK, transketolase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BRP, bovine retinal pericytes; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry; G5.6, 5.6 mmol/liter d-glucose; G28, 28 mmol/liter d-glucose; T, thiamine; BT, benfotiamine; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that excess production of ROS inside the endothelium, resulting from increased glucose flux through the Krebs cycle, may represent a possible common denominator (“unifying mechanism”) of these apparently independent biochemical pathways (5Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). In fact, ROS can partially inhibit glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase, resulting in the accumulation of glycolytic metabolites, among which glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) is particularly active in promoting AGE formation, protein kinase C activation, and increased flux through the hexosamine pathway. Previous studies suggested that polyol pathway hyperactivity is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (8Kinoshita J.H. Am. J.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2404-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Aldose reductase (AR), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway, catalyzes the reduction of glucose to the corresponding sugar alcohol, sorbitol, which is then converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The flux through this alternative route increases significantly when supranormal glucose levels saturate hexokinase, the enzyme responsible for transforming glucose into glucose 6-phosphate, the first metabolite of glycolysis, and the sugar becomes widely available to AR (10Beyer T.A.

Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In these conditions, sorbitol, which is slowly metabolized and not readily diffusible through cell membranes, may accumulate, leading to imbalances in intracellular homeostasis and contributing to the development of the long-term complications of diabetes (8Kinoshita J.H.

Potentially, thiamine could prevent cell damage induced by hyperglycemia by removing excess G3P from the cytoplasm and facilitating utilization of acetyl-CoA derived from accelerated glycolysis (18La Selva M.

We have shown previously that thiamine (18La Selva M. Beltramo E. Pagnozzi F. Bena E. Molinatti P.A. Molinatti G.M. Porta M.

Jahan I. Ng R. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, benfotiamine has been shown to prevent experimental diabetic retinopathy (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), and high doses of thiamine and benfotiamine have been reported to prevent incipient nephropathy in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (24Babaei-Jadidi R. Karachalias N. Ahmed N. Battah S. Thornalley P.J. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2110-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To account for the above results, it was shown that benfotiamine normalizes excess ROS production in the endothelium, along with the hexosamine pathway, AGE formation, and the diacylglycerol-protein kinase C pathway, thus involving three branches of the unifying mechanism (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to verify whether thiamine and benfotiamine also modify high glucose-induced activation of the polyol pathway (i.e. the branch of the unifying mechanism for which an effect of vitamin B1 has not been explored thus far) in endothelial cells and retinal pericytes. Reagents—Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Benfotiamine was a kind gift of Wörwag Pharma (Böblingen, Germany). Cell Cultures—Human endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from human umbilical cords and cultured with a partial modification of Jaffe's method (25Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar) as described previously (18La Selva M. Beltramo E. Pagnozzi F. Bena E. Molinatti P.A. Molinatti G.M. Porta M. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pooled cells from 3-5 cords were grown in medium 199-Hepes modification (M199) with 20% FCS added, until confluent. In secondary cultures, HUVEC were kept in M199 + 20% FCS + 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. Bovine retinal pericytes (BRP) were obtained from pools of 15-20 bovine retinas with a partial modification of the method of Wong et al. (26Wong H.C. Boulton M. Marshall J. Clark P. Investig. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 1767-1775PubMed Google Scholar) and McIntosh et al. (27McIntosh L.C. Muckersie L. Forrester J.V. Tissue Cell. 1988; 20: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as described previously (28Brignardello E. Beltramo E. Molinatti P.A. Aragno M. Gatto V. Tamagno E. Danni O. Porta M. Boccuzzi G. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). BRP were characterized by 3G5 (a specific membrane ganglioside) fluorescence immunostaining (29Nayak R.C. Berman A.B. George K.L. Eisenbarth G.S. King K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5.6 mmol/liter glucose with 20% FCS in primary cultures and 10% FCS in secondary cultures. For all experiments, cells were incubated for 7 days with one of the following: 5.6 mmol/liter glucose (G5.6), 28 mmol/liter glucose (G28), 5.6 mmol/liter glucose plus 50 or 100 μmol/liter thiamine; 5.6 mmol/liter glucose plus 50 or 100 μmol/liter benfotiamine; 28 mmol/liter glucose plus 50 or 100 μmol/liter thiamine; 28 mmol/liter glucose plus 50 or 100 μmol/liter benfotiamine. Aldose Reductase and Transketolase mRNAs—Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC and BRP by the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). Contaminating DNA was removed using DNase I enclosed in the kit. The yield of each RNA sample was checked by spectrophotometric measurement of absorbance at 260 nm. RT-PCR was performed with 0,5 μg of RNA using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The assay was designed for multiplex RT-PCR, each reaction set containing primers for AR or TK and for β-actin as an internal control, using the QuantumRNA β-actin internal standards (Ambion, Austin, TX). Amplification was performed using the following cycling parameters: hold at 50 °C for 30 min (reverse transcriptase step), hold at 95 °C for 15 min (hot-start to PCR), 22 or 20 cycles of 95 °C (30 s)/55 °C (30 s)/72 °C (1 min) followed by a final hold at 72 °C for 10 min. The number of cycles for each of the reactions was determined by the linear range of amplification (data not shown). The RT-PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and were quantified using an image analysis system (1D Image Analysis System, Kodak Co.). To determine the levels of AR and TK mRNA expression, the ratios of AR to β-actin and TK to β-actin were evaluated (according to QuantumRNA β-actin internal standards instruction manual). Primers used for AR were as follows: 5′ primer, CCTGGAAGTCCCCTCCAGGGCAGG; 3′ primer, GGTTGAAGTTGGAGATGCCAATAGC (which generated a 432-bp product). Primers for TK were as follows: 5′ primer, CCCAGCTACAAAGTTGGGGACAAG; 3′ primer, GGTCATCCTTGCTCTTCAGGACC (which generated a 580-bp product). Enzyme Assays—HUVEC and BRP were harvested by trypsinization and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cell suspensions were lysed with 250 μl of M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in the supernatant fractions were determined using the Bradford reagent. AR activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing 10 mmol/liter d,l-glyceraldehyde, 0.1 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.38 mol/liter ammonium sulfate, 10 mmol/liter NADPH, and 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA (30Nishimura C.

One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADPH/min. TK activity was determined in a reaction mixture containing 15 mmol/liter ribose 5-phosphate, 250 μmol/liter NADH, 0.1 mol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 units/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase. The enzyme reaction was started by the addition of 100-μl supernatant fractions, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 10-min intervals for 2 h. The activity was deduced from the difference in the absorbance at 10 and 80 min (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M.

One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of NADH/min. Determination of Intracellular Sorbitol Levels—HUVEC and BRP were harvested by trypsinization and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The cell suspensions were sonicated and lyophilized. The dried samples were dissolved in 0.3 mol/liter HAH-DMAP reagent (0.46 mmol/liter hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 0.33 mmol/liter 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine dissolved in 1 ml of 2,1 (v/v) pyridine, methanol), placed on the heating module at 75 °C for 25 min with the addition of 1.5 ml of acetic anhydride, and then heated at 75 °C for an additional 15 min. After the mixture was cooled at room temperature, 2 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane was added. Samples were immediately washed twice by adding 2 ml of 1.0 n hydrochloric acid, mixing, and aspirating the upper aqueous layer. The lower organic layers were placed on the heating module at 75 °C and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. When dry, residues were reconstituted with the mobile phase of LC/MS/MS (TSQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA). Sorbitol levels were determined by LC/MS/MS (TSQ, Finnigan MAT) using a modification of the method of Gordon and Wayne (32Gordon O.G. Wayne C.M. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 633-638Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the supernatant fractions was determined using the Bradford reagent. Determination of Intracellular Glucose Levels—The intracellular glucose content in HUVEC and BRP was assessed by Amplex® Red glucose assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a sensitive one-step fluorometric method for detecting glucose. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated, and centrifuged at 11000 × g at room temperature for 10 min. The upper clear aqueous layer was used to measure glucose concentration according to the instruction manual. Statistical Analysis—Because of the batch-to-batch variations, AR and TK mRNA expression, intracellular glucose, and sorbitol levels are expressed as percentages (mean ± S.D.) of the results obtained with positive control conditions (i.e. cells grown in 5.6 mmol/liter glucose alone) within each experiment unless stated otherwise. Statistical comparisons between groups were carried out using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Results were considered significant if the p value was 0.05 or less. Effects of Thiamine and Benfotiamine on Aldose Reductase Expression and Activity—AR expression (n = 6) was increased in the presence of high glucose concentrations both in HUVEC (183.5 ± 36.3% versus G5.6, p = 0.028) and BRP (218.9 ± 41.6%, p = 0.031). This effect of high glucose was reversed by the addition of thiamine and benfotiamine, both in HUVEC (Fig. 1, A and B) and in BRP (Fig. 1, C and D). AR activity was also increased in high glucose (n = 6) in HUVEC (6.5 ± 0.9 versus 1.8 ± 0.6 nmol/min/mg protein in G5.6, p = 0.027), as well as BRP (4.5 ± 0.3 versus 1.1 ± 0.2 nmol/min/mg protein in G5.6, p = 0.027). Again, this high glucose-induced effect was reversed by thiamine and benfotiamine (Fig. 2). Thiamine and benfotiamine on their own (i.e. when added to physiological glucose) had no significant effect on AR mRNA expression and activity.FIGURE 2Effects of thiamine and benfotiamine on AR activity induced by high glucose in HUVEC (A) and in BRP (B).

Again, high glucose on its own had no significant effects in either HUVEC or BRP, whereas the further addition of thiamine and benfotiamine activated TK in both cell types (Fig. 4). Neither thiamine or benfotiamine on their own had any significant effect on TK.FIGURE 4Effects of thiamine and benfotiamine on TK activity induced by high glucose in HUVEC (A) and in BRP (B).

The addition of thiamine and benfotiamine to high glucose completely normalized intracellular glucose levels and decreased sorbitol concentrations (Fig. 5). Abnormal glucose metabolism, activation of AR, and the subsequent accumulation of intracellular sorbitol were suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and macroangiopathy (1Yabe-Nishimura C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 21-33PubMed Google Scholar). Increased erythrocyte sorbitol/blood glucose ratio (33Aida K. Tawata M. Shindo H. Onaya T. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and AR protein levels (34Hamada Y. Nishimura C. Koh N. Sakakibara F. Nakamura J. Tanimoto T. Hotta N. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were reported in diabetic patients with complications. Moreover, a recent study on rat and human retinas demonstrates that there is a role for the polyol pathway in human diabetic retinopathy and that aldose reduction inhibition prevents vascular processes culminating in the development of acellular capillaries (9Dagher Z. Park Y.S. Asnaghi V. Hoehn T. Gerhardinger C. Lorenzi M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2404-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study, we confirm that AR expression and activity, and sorbitol levels are increased in human endothelial cells and bovine retinal pericytes cultured in high glucose. AR has low affinity for glucose so that, under physiological conditions, the polyol pathway uses a rather small percentage of total glucose available. However, in a high glucose environment, when hexokinase is saturated (11Cardenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), part of the excess intracellular glucose is converted to sorbitol by AR. We show also that thiamine and benfotiamine reduce increased intracellular glucose concentrations as well as AR activation and increased sorbitol levels in high glucose. Thiamine acts as a coenzyme for three enzymes involved in glucose breakdown: transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. By shifting excess G3P into the pentose phosphate shunt and excess acetyl-CoA into the Krebs cycle and accelerating the latter, thiamine may increase glucose disposal. Consequently, by reducing substrate inhibition, it might accelerate glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase (the first rate-limiting enzyme of intracellular glycolysis), reduce intracellular free glucose, and ultimately relieve pressure on the polyol pathway. Modulation of TK appears to play a major role in the metabolic effects of thiamine and its derivatives. Activation of this enzyme by benfotiamine was shown to inhibit three of the four major biochemical pathways implicated in the “unifying hypothesis” on the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced vascular damage: the hexosamine pathway, protein kinase C activation, and AGE formation (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). We reported previously that thiamine shares with aminoguanidine, a known inhibitor of non-enzymatic glycation and AGE formation, the ability to normalize pericyte adhesion to extracellular matrix produced by endothelial cells cultured in high glucose (35Beltramo E. Pomero F. Allione A. D'Alù F. Ponte E. Porta M. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Beltramo E. Buttiglieri S. Pomero F. Allione A. D'Alù F. Ponte E. Porta M. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that thiamine and benfotiamine prevent high glucose-induced apoptosis in both cell types (37Beltramo E. Berrone E. Buttiglieri S. Porta M. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 2004; 20: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, as TK may shift excess G3P from glycolysis into the non-oxidative pentose phosphate shunt, its activation by thiamine might reduce superoxide overproduction. However, the possible effects of thiamine and benfotiamine on the polyol pathway, the fourth biochemical mechanism involved in the unifying hypothesis, were never explored. Our results confirm that TK mRNA and activity increased after the addition of thiamine and benfotiamine to high glucose, although not in the presence of high glucose alone. As suggested above, this might result in shifting of free glucose into glycolysis and away from the polyol pathway, thus accounting for reduced AR mRNA and activity along with sorbitol concentrations. Thiamine and benfotiamine were shown to prevent incipient nephropathy and retinopathy in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, in which they increased the conversion of triosephosphates to ribose 5-phosphate through activation of TK, decreased protein kinase C activation, and reduced protein glycation (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nat.

Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2110-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Activation of TK by high dose thiamine and benfotiamine was reported also in human red blood cells (22Thornalley P.J. Jahan I. Ng R. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), bovine aortic endothelial cells, and the retinas of diabetic rats (23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). One of the goals of research in AR and the pathophysiology of diabetic complications is the development of drugs that are effective in inhibiting excess flux through the polyol pathway. We propose that thiamine and benfotiamine may exert such effects. Together with recent reports (22Thornalley P.J. Jahan I. Ng R. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Hammes H.P. Du X. Edelstein D. Taguchi T. Matsumura T. Ju Q. Lin J. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Hannak D. Neumaier M. Bergfeld R.

https://openalex.org/W2020073853,"The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, Met, is a strong prognostic indicator of breast cancer patient outcome and survival, suggesting that therapies targeting Met may have beneficial outcomes in the clinic. (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a catechin found in green tea, has been recognized as a potential therapeutic agent. We assessed the ability of EGCG to inhibit HGF signaling in the immortalized, nontumorigenic breast cell line, MCF10A, and the invasive breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231. HGF treatment in both cell lines induced rapid, sustained activation of Met, ERK and AKT. Pretreatment of cells with concentrations of EGCG as low as 0.3 μ M inhibited HGF-induced Met phosphorylation and downstream activation of AKT and ERK. Treatment with 5.0 μ M EGCG blocked the ability of HGF to induce cell motility and invasion. We assessed the ability of alternative green tea catechins to inhibit HGF-induced signaling and motility. (−)-Epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) functioned similar to EGCG by completely blocking HGF-induced signaling as low as 0.6 μ M and motility at 5 μ M in MCF10A cells; whereas, (−)-epicatechin (EC) was unable to inhibit HGF-induced events at any concentration tested. (−)-Epigallocatechin (EGC), however, completely repressed HGF-induced AKT and ERK phosphorylation at concentrations of 10 and 20 μ M, but was incapable of blocking Met activation. Despite these observations, EGC did inhibit HGF-induced motility in MCF10A cells at 10 μ M. These observations suggest that the R1 galloyl and the R2 hydroxyl groups are important in mediating the green tea catechins' inhibitory effect towards HGF/Met signaling. These combined in vitro studies reveal the possible benefits of green tea polyphenols as cancer therapeutic agents to inhibit Met signaling and potentially block invasive cancer growth."
https://openalex.org/W2152251049,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered an important factor in ischemia/reperfusion injury to cardiac myocytes. Mitochondrial respiration, mainly at the level of complex I and III, is an important source of ROS generation and hence a potential contributor of cardiac reperfusion injury. Appropriate antioxidant strategies could be particularly useful to limit this ROS generation and associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Melatonin has been shown to effectively protect against ischemic-reperfusion myocardial damage. The mechanism by which melatonin exerts this cardioprotective effect is not well established. In the present study we examined the effects of melatonin on various parameters of mitochondrial bioenergetics in a Langerdoff isolated perfused rat heart model. After isolation of mitochondria from control, ischemic-reperfused and melatonin-treated ischemic-reperfused rat heart, various bioenergetic parameters were evaluated such as rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, complex I and complex III activity, H2O2 production as well as the degree of lipid peroxidation, cardiolipin content, and cardiolipin oxidation. We found that reperfusion significantly altered all these mitochondrial parameters, while melatonin treatment had strong protective effect attenuating these alterations. This effect appears to be due, at least in part, to the preservation, by ROS attack, of the content and integrity of cardiolipin molecules which play a pivotal role in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Protection of mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with an improvement of post-ischemic hemodynamic function of the heart. Melatonin had also strong protective effect against oxidative alterations to complex I and III as well as to cardiolipin in isolated mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2161319100,"We reported previously that predelivery of the anti-oxidant gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to the heart by adeno associated virus (AAV) markedly reduces injury after acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, the effect of HO-1 gene delivery on postinfarction recovery has not been investigated. In the current study, we assessed the effect of HO-1 gene delivery on post-MI left ventricle (LV) remodeling and function using echocardiographic imaging and histomorphometric approaches. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 4 x 10(11) particles of AAV-LacZ (control) or AAV-hHO-1 in the LV wall. Eight wk after gene transfer, the animals were subjected to 30 min of ischemia by ligation of left anterior descending artery (LAD) followed by reperfusion. Echocardiographic measurements were obtained in a blinded fashion prior and at 1.5 and 3 months after I/R. Ejection fraction (EF) was reduced by 13% and 40% in the HO-1 and LacZ groups, respectively at 1.5 months after MI. Three months after MI, EF recovered fully in the HO-1, but only partially in the LacZ-treated animals. Post-MI LV dimensions were markedly increased and the anterior wall was markedly thinned in the LacZ-treated animals compared with the HO-1-treated animals. Significant myocardial scarring and fibrosis were observed in the LacZ-group in association with elevated levels of interstitial collagen I and III and MMP-2 activity. Post-MI myofibroblast accumulation was reduced in the HO-1-treated animals, and retroviral overexpression of HO-1 reduced proliferation of isolated cardiac fibroblasts. Our data indicate that rAAV-HO-1 gene transfer markedly reduces fibrosis and ventricular remodeling and restores LV function and chamber dimensions after myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2158842221,"Several 3-keto-synthases have been studied, including the soluble fatty acid synthases, those involved in polyketide synthesis, and the FAE1-like 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthases. All of these condensing enzymes have a common ancestor and an enzymatic mechanism that involves a catalytic triad consisting of Cys, His, and His/Asn. In contrast to the FAE1-like family of enzymes that mediate plant microsomal fatty acid elongation, the condensation step of elongation in animals and in fungi appears to be mediated by the Elop homologs. Curiously these proteins bear no resemblance to the well characterized 3-keto-synthases. There are three ELO genes in yeast that encode the homologous Elo1p, Elo2p, and Elo3p proteins. Elo2p and Elo3p are required for synthesis of the very long-chain fatty acids, and mutants lacking both Elo2p and Elo3p are inviable confirming that the very long-chain fatty acids are essential for cellular functions. In this study we show that heterologous expression of several Arabidopsis FAE1-like genes rescues the lethality of an elo2Deltaelo3Delta yeast mutant. We further demonstrate that FAE1 acts in conjunction with the 3-keto and trans-2,3-enoyl reductases of the elongase system. These studies indicate that even though the plant-specific FAE1 family of condensing enzymes evolved independently of the Elop family of condensing enzymes, they utilize the same reductases and presumably dehydratase that the Elop proteins rely upon."
https://openalex.org/W1965850475,"Duplication of chromatin following DNA replication requires spatial reorganization of chromatin domains assisted by chromatin assembly factor CAF-1. Here, we tested the genomic consequences of CAF-1 loss and the function of chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 in heterochromatin formation. Genes located in heterochromatic regions are usually silent, and we found that this transcriptional repression persists in the absence of CAF-1 in Arabidopsis. However, using microarrays we observed that genes that are active during late S-phase, when heterochromatin is duplicated, were up-regulated in CAF-1 mutants. Arabidopsis CAF-1 mutants also have reduced cytological heterochromatin content; however, DNA methylation of pericentromeric repeats was normal, demonstrating that CAF-1 is not required for maintenance of DNA methylation. Instead, hypomethylation of the genome, which has only mild effects on the development of wild-type plants, completely arrested development of CAF-1 mutants. These results suggest that CAF-1 functions in heterochromatin formation. CAF-1 and DNA methylation, which is also needed for heterochromatin formation, have partially redundant functions that are essential for cell proliferation. Interestingly, transcriptional repression and heterochromatin compaction can be genetically separated, and CAF-1 is required only for the complete compaction of heterochromatin but not to maintain transcriptional repression of heterochromatic genes."
https://openalex.org/W2102072515,"Deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is one of the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Beta-secretase, a beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), is essential for Abeta biosynthesis. Although inhibition of BACE1 is considered a valid therapeutic target for AD, the enzymatic dynamics of BACE1 in regulating APP processing and Abeta generation has not yet been fully defined. To examine this issue, tightly controlled inducible BACE1 gene expression was established in the neuronal cell line N2ABP1 and the non-neuronal cell line E2BP1 using an ecdysone-inducible system. The BACE1 protein level was increased in a time- and dosage-dependent manner in the inducible BACE1 stable cells by treatment with inducer ponasterone A. The generation of APP CTFbeta, the beta-secretase product, increased proportionally with the level of BACE1 protein expression. However, Abeta40/42 production sharply increased to the plateau level with a relatively small increase in BACE1 expression. Although further increasing BACE1 expression increased beta-secretase activity, it had no additional effect on Abeta production. Furthermore, we found that BACE1 mRNA levels and BACE1 promoter activity were significantly lower than APP mRNA levels and APP promoter activity. Our data demonstrate that lower BACE transcription is responsible for the minority of APP undergoing the amyloidogenic pathway and relatively lower Abeta production in the normal conditions, and that a slight increase in BACE1 can induce a dramatic elevation in Abeta production, indicating that the increase in BACE1 can potentially increase neuritic plaque formation in the pathological condition."
https://openalex.org/W2045254177,"Heterotrimeric G protein signaling specificity has been attributed to select combinations of Gα, β, and γ subunits, their interactions with other signaling proteins, and their localization in the cell. With few exceptions, the G protein subunit combinations that exist in vivo and the significance of these specific combinations are largely unknown. We have begun to approach these problems in HeLa cells by: 1) determining the concentrations of Gα and Gβ subunits; 2) examining receptor-dependent activities of two effector systems (adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase Cβ); and 3) systematically silencing each of the Gα and Gβ subunits by using small interfering RNA while quantifying resultant changes in effector function and the concentrations of other relevant proteins in the network. HeLa cells express equimolar amounts of total Gα and Gβ subunits. The most prevalent Gα proteins were one member of each Gα subfamily (Gαs, Gαi3, Gα11, and Gα13). We substantially abrogated expression of most of the Gα and Gβ proteins expressed in these cells, singly and some in combinations. As expected, agonist-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase Cβ was specifically eliminated following the silencing of Gαs or Gαq/11, respectively. We also confirmed that Gβ subunits are necessary for stable accumulation of Gα proteins in vivo. Gβ subunits demonstrated little isoform specificity for receptor-dependent modulation of effector activity. We observed compensatory changes in G protein accumulation following silencing of individual genes, as well as an apparent reciprocal relationship between the expression of certain Gαq and Gαi subfamily members. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the adaptability and remarkable resilience of G protein signaling networks.

These findings provide a foundation for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the adaptability and remarkable resilience of G protein signaling networks. Signal-transducing heterotrimeric G proteins are associated with the inner face of the plasma membrane, positioned as middlemen for activation by membrane-spanning, heptahelical receptors, and regulation of a variety of intracellular effectors. Interactions among these proteins are controlled by agonist-induced changes of receptor conformation and nucleotide-driven conformational changes of the α subunits of the G proteins (Gα). A ligand-bound receptor catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on a cognate Gα, and as a result, the (at least partial) dissociation of Gα from a complex of Gβ and Gγ subunits. These activated subunits are then capable of modulating the functional properties of effector proteins (e.g. adenylyl cyclases and phospholipases). The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα serves as a molecular timer, returning the protein to the GDP-bound state and allowing reformation of the inactive heterotrimer. Much remains to be learned about the specificity of G protein signaling in vivo, the relative importance of isoforms of G protein subunits with apparently redundant functions, and the qualitative and quantitative significance of the fact that many hundreds of G protein heterotrimers can be assembled from the collection of G protein α, β, and γ subunits that are expressed in single cells. There is evidence for exquisite specificity of signaling through certain pathways. For example, intranuclear injection of anti-sense oligonucleotides against specific G protein subunits revealed that the M4-muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels requires Gαoa,Gβ3, and Gγ4, whereas similar inhibition initiated by somatostatin receptors requires Gαob,Gβ1, and Gγ3 subunits (1Kleuss C.

Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Mammalian Cell Culture—HeLa cells (from ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in the same lot of serum and passaged twice weekly by trypsinization. Fresh cultures were established from the same frozen stock after 10 passages. Transient RNA Interference (RNAi) Transfection—Single-stranded 21-mer oligonucleotides (containing 19 ribonucleotides and 2 3′-deoxythymidine residues) targeting the open reading frames of selected proteins were designed using the Dharmacon siRNA Design Center. Candidate sequences were subjected to further BLAST analysis against the human genome data base (NCBI) and selected for further study if no more than 14 contiguous bases were identical to coding regions of known human gene sequences. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed as described (4Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T.

Transient transfections of RNAi duplexes were accomplished using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HeLa cells were seeded at 44 × 104/100-mm dish 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected using 19 μl of Oligofectamine and a total of 190 pmol of RNAi duplex(es) in a final volume of 3.8 ml. Two days later the cells were trypsinized, counted, plated at 55 × 104/100-mm dish, and subjected to a second transfection. One day after the second transfection the cells were trypsinized, pooled, and distributed to 12-well plates.

Cells were incubated with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors (100 μm Ro-20-1724 and 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the initiation of ligand-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Experiments were terminated by addition of ice-cold 5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm cAMP, and 5% trichloroacetic acid containing [32P]cAMP (to monitor recovery during cAMP purification). Radiolabeled cAMP was separated from other labeled compounds by successive Dowex (AG 50W-X4, Bio-Rad) and alumina chromatography as described (5Salomon Y. Londos D. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Total Inositol Phosphate Accumulation—Total inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation was determined by incubating HeLa cells for 48 h with 10 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol (1 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm LiCl prior to the initiation of ligand-dependent IP synthesis. Reactions were terminated by addition of ice-cold 10 mm formic acid to precipitate protein. The soluble lysate was applied to a 1-ml Dowex AG (1-X8) column, which was washed successively with 15 ml of 10 mm formic acid containing 10 mm myo-inositol and 15 ml of 5 mm Na-tetraborate, 60 mm ammonium formate, prior to elution with 2.0 ml of 1.0 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. Total [3H]IP was determined by scintillation counting and normalized to the amount of acid-precipitated protein. Protein was quantified as described by Bradford (Bio-Rad) (6Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding—β2-Adrenergic receptor concentrations were estimated for cells seeded in 6-well plates using 2 nm [125I]CYP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of the β2-adrenergic receptor-selective antagonist ICI-118,551 (10 μm) or the non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol (10 μm). Each measurement was conducted in triplicate. Ligand binding reactions were quenched in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl and immediately filtered through Whatman GF/C filters. Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. Duplicate 6-well plates were cultured to permit determinations of cell number and total protein content. Recombinant Gα and Gβ Proteins—Recombinant bovine Gαs,short, Gαi1 (rat), Gαi2 (rat), and Gαi3 (rat) were purified after expression in Escherichia coli as described (7Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); the Gαi proteins were coexpressed with protein N-myristoyl transferase and were thus myristoylated at their amino termini. Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses encoding human Gαs,long, mouse Gα11, or mouse Gα13 and baculoviruses encoding Gβ1 and His6-Gγ2, and the G proteins were isolated as described (8Kozasa T. G Proteins Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1999: 23-38Google Scholar). Purified mouse Gαq and Gα12 were gifts from G. Tall and P. Sternweis, respectively (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Recombinant bovine Gβ1 and human Gβ2, Gβ3, and Gβ4 proteins were provided by S. Gibson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Protein concentrations were determined using an Amido Black staining assay (9Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Purity was >90% for all proteins as assessed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Sample Preparation for Immunoblotting—Total cellular lysates were prepared by rinsing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and harvesting in SDS-PAGE lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.25% (w/v) SDS, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.25% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were centrifuged for 1 h (100,000 × g, 4 °C, Beckman TLA 45 rotor) to pellet viscous DNA. Plasma membrane fractions from HeLa cells were prepared essentially as described (10Ross E.M. Maguire M.E. Sturgill T.W. Biltonen R.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5761-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (600 p.s.i. for 30 min). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min (600 × g, 4 °C). The resulting supernatant fraction was layered onto a 23 and 43% sucrose step gradient and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4°C, Beckman SW 41 rotor). The enriched plasma membranes were collected at the gradient interfaces and recovered by centrifugation (200,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C, Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor). The membranes were suspended in 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations for total lysates and membranes were determined with the Amido Black protein assay (9Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—In preparation for immunoblotting, total cell lysates (5-30 μg) or plasma membranes (5-20 μg) were solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel buffer (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For detecting adenylyl cyclase proteins, plasma membranes (50-100 μg) were treated with 1% SDS, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (5 min at 80 °C) prior to the addition of SDS-PAGE buffer. Antibody specificities, dilutions, and sources are shown in Table 1. Following incubation with primary antibody, immunoblots were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted in wash buffer and incubated with the blots for 1 h. The blots were subsequently washed and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry—Immunoblots were scanned into Adobe Photoshop 5.0, and the pixel intensities (arbitrary units) of the immunoreactive bands were quantified. For quantitative immunoblots, endogenous HeLa cell protein levels were interpolated from the pixel intensities of the known amounts of purified Gα or Gβ subunit standards loaded on the same gel. For relative protein determinations, the pixel intensity of immunoreactive bands in samples prepared from RNAi-transfected cells was normalized to the corresponding immunoreactive band intensity identified in an equal amount of lysate prepared from mock-transfected cells. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Relative quantification of mRNA levels was achieved using quantitative RT-PCR. Single component amplification reactions were conducted using the relative standard curve or comparative Ct methods and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a TaqMan gene expression probe specific for amplifying a particular Gα or Gβ subunit cDNA sequence was mixed together with a One-Step TaqMan RT-PCR master mixture and 100 ng of total RNA/reaction. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion) and quantified spectro-photometrically (A260). Fluorescence data were collected following each amplification cycle using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Ct values were calculated from threshold values set to manual. Data Analysis—Differences between measured values (mean ± S.D.) were determined using a one-tailed t test or single analysis of variance (p < 0.05, InStat, Prism). Endogenous G Protein Subunits in HeLa Cells—Ten proteins were identified as products of the 16 mammalian Gα genes by both RT-PCR (data not shown) and immunoblotting (see control lanes in Fig. 1A): Gαs (long and short splice variants), Gαq,Gα11,Gαi1,Gαi2,Gαi3,Gαo,Gα12, and Gα13. All positive RT-PCR signals were confirmed by cDNA sequencing, and antibody specificity was verified by target-specific RNAi-mediated silencing of antigens (also shown in Fig. 1A). Transcripts of two additional Gα genes, Gαz and Gα16, were identified by RT-PCR, but the corresponding proteins were not detected despite multiple attempts to blot 100 μg of enriched plasma membrane fractions with sensitive antibodies (detection limit of <1 ng of purified protein). No mRNA or protein was detected for Gα14. We did not address possible expression of Gα subunits that are primarily found in specialized sensory tissues (Gαolf, Gαt (1 and 2), and Gαg). Of the five Gβ genes, we detected expression of four in HeLa cells: Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ4, and Gβ5; we found no evidence for expression of Gβ3. Because Gβ5 subunits appear to form selective heterodimers with RGS proteins of the R7 family (which contain Gγ-like domains) (12Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Ching S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and there is little credible evidence for the existence in vivo of heterodimers containing Gβ5 and Gγ subunits, we focused our efforts on Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 subunits (Fig. 1B). We also examined the expression of Gγ subunits in HeLa cells. Perhaps surprisingly, RT-PCR analysis positively identified transcripts of all 12 Gγ genes, including Gγ1, whose expression is largely restricted to the retina (13Peng Y.W. Robishaw J.D. Levine M.A. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10882-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of specific and sensitive antisera to most Gγ proteins, we have limited our studies to date to Gα and Gβ. Prior to examining the effects of silencing individual G protein subunits, we quantified the amounts of Gα and Gβ proteins in total lysates from control cells (Fig. 1C). Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that 80% of the entire Gα subunit protein pool was accounted for by one member of each of the four subfamilies of Gα proteins: Gαi3, Gα11, Gα13, and the sum of long and short splice variants of Gαs.Gβ1 and Gβ2 were expressed at similar levels and together accounted for 80% of the total Gβ subunit pool; Gβ4 comprised the remaining 20%. There was no significant difference between the total amount of Gβ protein detected with a pan Gβ antibody (Gβ1-4) and the sum of Gβ subunits calculated from data obtained using isoform-specific Gβ antibodies. Transformation of the data in Fig. 1C to molar quantities reveals that the sum of the Gα subunits (22 ± 2 pmol/mg lysate) closely approximates that of the Gβ proteins (21 ± 3 pmol/mg of lysate), consistent with the notion that most or all of these subunits exist as oligomers. Knockdown of G Protein Subunits—Immunoblots showed remarkable (more than 90%) knockdown of endogenous protein expression for each Gα and Gβ subunit (Fig. 1, A and B) after silencing by siRNAs, either individually or in combination. Greater than 90% knockdown of Gα subunits was deemed necessary to test changes in receptor-modulated effector responses, because the reported stoichiometry of G protein to effector can, in some instances, exceed 10:1 (14Ostrom R.S. Post S.R. Insel P.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 407-412PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, multiple RNAi duplexes (range: 2 to 10) were designed and generated toward each target; in general, most duplexes silenced target protein expression more than 75%. In several instances (particularly with Gβ subunits) treatment with RNAi oligonucleotides not only silenced the intended target but also caused cell death. Interestingly, our most lethal RNAi duplex targeted green fluorescent protein using a sequence with no significant (>12 nucleotide) overlap with the open reading frame of any known human gene, indicating that cell death may be caused by mechanisms unrelated to specific mRNA sequence recognition by RISC complexes. We rigorously avoided using siRNAs that had adverse effects on cell growth or viability. Knockdown of Gαs: Anticipated Effect on Ligand-stimulated Activation of Adenylyl Cyclases—Gαs proteins mediate activation of adenylyl cyclases by so called Gs-coupled G protein-coupled receptors. As anticipated, knockdown of Gαs completely abrogated ligand-dependent increases in cAMP synthesis (Fig. 2, A and B) stimulated by either INE, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, or PGE1, an EP prostanoid receptor agonist. A combination of RT-PCR, radioactive ligand-binding assays, and RNAi-mediated silencing of cell surface receptors (see Table 1) demonstrated that INE stimulation of cAMP synthesis occurred exclusively via the β2-adrenergic receptor, whereas PGE1 signaling was mediated via two EP receptor isoforms, EP2 and EP4 (data not shown). We found no evidence of expression of β1-or β3-adrenergic receptors or EP1 or EP3 prostanoid receptors in HeLa cells. The functional effects of loss of Gαs were specific. Thus, silencing of Gαs did not prevent UK 14,304-dependent inhibition of cAMP synthesis or stimulation of phospholipase Cβ activity by histamine (data not shown). These data confirm the functionality and specificity of Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclases using RNAi-mediated gene suppression and illustrate the utility of this approach to study G protein signaling in a population of intact cells. Silencing of Gαq and Gα11: Anticipated Effects on Activation of Phospholipase Cβ—Gαq and Gα11 (along with Gα14 and Gα16) mediate cell surface receptor activation of PLCβ, which catalyzes the synthesis of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate from phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate. Inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in HeLa cells was increased following activation of the H1-histamine receptor by agonist. The simultaneous knockdown of Gαq and Gα11 (denoted as Gαq/11) eliminated histamine-stimulated IP accumulation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the silencing of either Gαq or Gα11 individually decreased histamine-dependent IP accumulation by ∼50%, despite the fact that concentrations of Gα11 in HeLa cells exceed those of Gαq by 10-fold (Fig. 1C). The amount of [3H] incorporated into acid-precipitable material was unchanged in cells lacking Gαq/11, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol kinase and phosphatase activities were unaffected. Silencing Gαq/11 modestly (but significantly) increased ligand-dependent cAMP responses (∼30%) without affecting UK 14,304-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). Knockdown of Gαi/o: Incomplete Effects on Inhibition of Adenylyl Cyclase—Gαi/o subunits transduce signals from cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular pathways (see Ref. 15Albert P.R. Robillard L. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar for review), including inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity. cAMP synthesis in HeLa cells can be inhibited by α2a- and α2b-adrenergic receptors. 3S. K. Gibson, unpublished observations. Despite silencing each of the Gαi1-3 subunits, individually or in combinations of two, we observed no significant change in the ability of the synthetic α2-adrenergic receptor agonist UK-14,304 to inhibit INE-(data not shown) or forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis (Fig. 2D). We observed a 60% reduction in the magnitude of such inhibition only when all three Gαi subunits were silenced (denoted Gαi1-3) (Fig. 2D). Thus, α2-adrenergic receptors displayed no absolute specificity for Gαi1-3 isoforms for the inhibition of INE or forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Interestingly, knockdown of Gαi1 did specifically interfere with UK 14,304-mediated inhibition of PGE1-stimulated cAMP synthesis (Fig. 2E), suggesting that a PGE1-stimulated adenylyl cyclase may preferentially localize with or couple to this G protein. It is most puzzling, therefore, that simultaneous silencing of Gαi1-3 subunits did not abrogate inhibition of PGE1-activated cAMP synthesis by UK 14,304. Residual inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity in all experiments was eliminated by treatment of cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the Gαi subunit expression may have been insufficiently silenced and/or that Gαo subunits, in the absence of Gαi1-3 subunits, may have contributed to the inhibition of cAMP synthesis (16Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual silencing of Gαo (both a and b splice variants) had no effect on UK-14,304-mediated inhibition of cAMP synthesis. Recall that Gαz was not detected in these cells. Silencing of Gα Subunits: Alterations in Accumulation of Other Gα Proteins—Silencing of individual G protein α subunits routinely resulted in loss of more than 90% of that protein, detected by immunoblotting (Table 2, highlighted in yellow). Quantification of non-targeted Gα proteins revealed that the concentrations of Gαi3 and Gα11 (Table 2) and Gα13 (data not shown) were not significantly"

The expression of these genes was enhanced after the infection with Plasmodium gallinaceum. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of Lp strongly restricted the development of Plasmodium oocysts, reducing their number by 90%. In Vg-ΔREL1-A transgenic mosquitoes, with gain-of-function phenotype of Toll/REL1 immune pathway activated after blood feeding, both the Lp and LpRfb genes were overexpressed independently of septic injury. The same phenotype was observed in the mosquitoes with RNAi knockdown of Cactus, an IκB inhibitor in the Toll/REL1 pathway. These results showed that, in the mosquito fat body, both Lp and LpRfb gene expression were regulated by the Toll/REL1 pathway during immune induction by pathogen and parasite infections. Indeed, the proximal region of the LpRfb promoter contained closely linked binding motifs for GATA and NF-κB transcription factors. Transfection and in vivo RNAi knockdown experiments showed that the bindings of both GATA and NF-κB transcription factors to the corresponding motif were required for the induction of the LpRfb gene.

It delivers lipids to various organs via the hemolymph as a reusable shuttle, with no concomitant degradation of the protein matrix of the Lp particle. The fat body, which is an insect analog of vertebrate liver and adipose tissue combined, plays a key role in lipid metabolism by being the site of lipid storage and mobilization. The loading and unloading of lipids into and from fat body cells is accomplished by a shuttle mechanism involving Lp and a multiprotein complex called a lipid transfer particle. The lipophorin particle consists of three apolipoproteins: apolipoprotein I, apolipoprotein II, and apolipoprotein III (1Law J.H. Wells M.A. J. Biol.

Likewise, mosquito Aedes aegypti Lp consists of apoLpI and apoLpII, the mRNAs of which originate from a single large precursor RNA, indicating that they are encoded by the same gene. Aedes Lp protein level increases upon ingestion of a blood meal, when the mosquito needs an increased rate of lipid transport to developing oocytes. Lipophorin in the whole bodies reaches its maximal levels by 40–48 h post-blood meal (PBM) when major events of egg yolk and lipid deposition have been completed. However, Lp mRNA and the rate of Lp synthesis in the fat body reach their maximal levels at 18–20 h PBM (7Capurro M de L. de Bianchi A.G. Marinotti O. Comp. Biochem.

In the mosquito fat body, the regulation of expression of most genes involved in vitellogenesis is governed through a blood meal-driven hormonal cascade, with the terminal signal being a steroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (17Raikhel A.S.

In the mosquito, a rising Lp titer and/or a falling titer of 20-hydroxyecdysone could serve as signals activating transcription of the AaLpRfb gene (10Sun J. Hiraoka T. Dittmer N.T. Cho K.H.

Lipid carrier proteins have been reported to reduce the toxicity of lipopolysaccharide in both invertebrates (20Kato Y. Motoi Y. Taniai K. Kadonookuda K. Hiramatsu M. Yamakawa M. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Recent evidence shows that a retinoid and fatty-acid binding protein (RFABG) is up-regulated in the midgut of Anopheles gambiae during infection by Plasmodium and is important for the parasite development (34Vlachou D. Schlegelmilch T. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1185-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).In this study, we systematically investigated the responses of two genes associated with lipid metabolism, Lp and LpR, during pathogen and parasite infections in the mosquito A. aegypti. We showed that, in the fat body, the tissue of insect systemic immunity and metabolism, Lp and LpRfb gene expression were up-regulated as a result of infection and regulated by the Toll/REL1 pathway. The results of this study have shed further light on the link between the lipid metabolism and immunity and infection in these vectors of major human diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESInsects—The mosquitoes, A. aegypti, were maintained in laboratory culture as described previously (35Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Adults were provided with water and a 10% sucrose solution. Vitellogenesis was initiated by feeding females, 3–5 days after eclosion, with a blood meal from rats. All dissections were performed in Aedes physiological saline (36Hagedorn H.H. Turner S. Hagedorn E.A. Pontecorvo D. Greenbaum P. Pfeiffer D. Wheelock G. Flanagan T.R. J. Insect Physiol. 1977; 23: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Real-time PCR—Dissected fat bodies from abdomens of 10–15 individual mosquitoes were homogenized using a motor-driven pellet pestle mixer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) and lysed by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's protocol. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out using an Ominiscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing oligo(dT) primers and 2 μg of total RNA at 37 °C for 1 h. Real-time PCR was performed using the iCycler iQ system (Bio-Rad), and reactions were performed in 96-well plates with a Quanti-Tect SYBR PCR kit (Qiagen). To quantify relative gene expression, standard curves were generated using 10-fold serial dilution of cDNA pools containing high concentrations of the gene of interest. The protocol for amplifying the cDNA product was 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, then 59 °C for 45 s, followed by melting curve analysis to detect specific product amplification. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate and normalized to the internal control, β-actin mRNA. Real-time data were collected by the iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System software version 3.0 for Windows. Raw data were exported to Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) for analysis. Real-time PCR primers are as follows: LpR forward primer, CGAAAGTCAGTGCAAGTTCATCAG; LpR reverse primer, CTGGCTTCGGTCCCTTCTGAG; Lp forward primer, CAGCCAGAACAATGTGGGTAAGCTC; Lp reverse primer, GACCTTACGTGCGAGCAACTTGTTC; Actin forward primer, GACTACCTGATGAAGATCCTGAC; and Actin reverse primer, GCACAGCTTCTCCTTAATGTCAC.Synthesis and Microinjection of dsRNA—Synthesis of dsRNA was accomplished by simultaneous transcription of both strands of template DNA with a HiScribe RNAi Transcription Kit (New England Biolabs). The plasmid LITMUS 28iMal containing a nonfunctional portion of the Escherichia coli male gene that encodes maltose-binding protein was used to generate control dsRNA. After RNA synthesis, the samples were treated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dsRNA was then suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled water with a final concentration of 5 μg/μl. The formation of dsRNA was confirmed by running 0.2 μl of these reactions in a 1.0% agarose gel in TBE (90 mm Tris borate//2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). A Picospritzer II (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) was used to introduce 200 nl of this dsRNA into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized mosquito females at 2–3 days post-eclosion.Septic Injury and Infection Experiments—Septic injuries were performed by pricking mosquitoes in the rear part of the abdomen with an acupuncture needle dipped into either bacterial culture or a fungal spore suspension. Plasmodium gallinaceum is routinely maintained in the laboratory by natural sporozoite transmission between the A. aegypti RED strain and chicks. One-week-old birds are infected by exposure to infected mosquitoes. The parasitemia was monitored daily on thin Giemsa-stained blood smears from 1 week after the infection until a gametocytemia range of 1–3% was reached. For the infections, 4-day-old female mosquitoes were fed on anesthetized chicken that had been infected with P. gallinaceum 9 days previously. To determine parasite oocyst development, midguts were dissected 7 days post-infection and then stained with 1% mercurochrome. Parasite oocyst numbers were determined by means of light microscopy (Nikon E400, Japan).Western Blotting Analysis—SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were conducted as described previously (35Hays A.R. Raikhel A.S. Roux's Arch. Dev. Biol. 1990; 199: 114-121Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting, to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were probed with AaLp and β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. Immune complexes were visualized by the addition of SuperSignal WestDura Extended-Duration Substrate (Pierce).Isolation of the 5′ Upstream Region of the Fat Body-specific LpR Gene— To clone the 5′ upstream region of the LpRfb gene, a Vectorette library was constructed in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Vectorette II, Sigma Genosys Ltd.). Genomic DNA was digested by restriction enzyme ClaI and then ligated with the corresponding Vectorette units to the digested end of the DNA. A PCR was performed using universal Vectorette and specific primers from the Vectorette library. The Vectorette amplicons were then subcloned and sequenced.Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Each protein was synthesized by a coupled in vitro transcription-translation (TnT) system (Promega). The corresponding cDNA clones were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) (Invitrogen). The in vitro transcription-translation reactions programmed by the circular plasmid DNA utilized the T7 promoter. To confirm the synthesis of proteins with expected size, the control TnT reactions of each protein were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the resulting reactions were analyzed by means of SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The annealed deoxyoligonucleotide of NF-κB and GATA motifs were purified from 15% TBE Criterion Precast Gel (Bio-Rad), and labeling of double-stranded oligonucleotides and EMSA was performed with a gel-shift assay system (Promega). The protein-DNA complex was separated on 5% TBA Criterion Precast Gel (Bio-Rad) and visualized by means of autoradiography.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay in the Aag-2 Cell Line— Cell line Aag-2 from A. aegypti (37Fallon A.M. Sun D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was maintained in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). The coding region sequences of the AaREL1-A, AaREL1-B, AaREL2, and AaGATAa were inserted into the pAc5.1/V5/HisA (Invitrogen) vector. The LpR2.4 kb promoter was inserted into pGL3/firefly luciferase vector (Promega) to form the reporter construct pLpR2.4-luc. Cells were incubated at 26 °C until they reached at least 70% confluency (∼24 h). Transfection was conducted using Effectin (Qiagen) with an optimal DNA-lipid ratio of 1:25 (w/v), following the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 150 ng each of pLpR2.4-luc, AaREL1, AaGATAa, and pRLCMV/Renilla luciferase (Promega) were mixed in a 24-well plate with a total volume of 250 μl of growth medium and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The expression vector pAc5.1/V5/HisA was used as carrier DNA so that each well received an equal amount of total DNA. Renilla luciferase served as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The cells transfected with empty expression vectors pAv5.1/V5/HisA were used as a negative control. The transfection mixture was added to Aag2 cells for 6 h at 27°C. Transfection mixtures were then removed and replaced with fresh growth media. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Dual luciferase activities were measured using Lumimark (Bio-Rad). The relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalization of the firefly luciferase activity against Renilla luciferase activity.RESULTSThe Effect of Bacterial and Fungal Infection on Lp and LpR Gene Expression—To investigate whether A. aegypti Lp gene expression was affected as a result of infection, we measured its transcript levels after infections with Gram (–) bacterium Escherichia cloacae, Gram (+) bacterium Micrococcus luteus, and spores of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Mosquitoes were injected at 20 h, and the expression of the Lp gene was monitored at 5, 12, and 24 h post-infection. In infected vitellogenic female mosquitoes, the Lp transcript expression level exhibited >2-fold increase at 5 h post-infection after injection of both Gram (+) bacteria and fungi when compared with those in control mosquitoes (Fig. 1A). The transcript levels remained significantly higher in infected mosquitoes at 12 and 24 h post-infection after either M. luteus or B. bassiana infections than in control mosquitoes (Fig. 1A). In contrast, infection with E. cloacae had no effect on the expression of the Lp gene (Fig. 1A).To investigate whether or not the Lp protein level was affected by the infection with bacteria and fungus, we performed a Western blot analysis with Lp antibodies (10Sun J. Hiraoka T. Dittmer N.T. Cho K.H. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed similarly to those described above for the Lp transcript levels after infections with Gram (–) bacterium E. cloacae, Gram (+) bacterium M. luteus, and spores of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana. In fat bodies of control mosquitoes, the Lp protein levels were decreased significantly by 44 h PBM (corresponding to 24 h post-infection). Injection of E. cloacae had no effect on the Lp protein profile. In contrast, infections with either M. luteus or B. bassiana spores resulted in sustained elevated levels of the Lp protein (Fig. 1B).Next, we investigated responses of the LpRfb, as a second gene involved in lipid metabolism. In infected previtellogenic female mosquitoes, the LpRfb transcript expression level was significantly increased by either M. luteus or B. bassiana infections but not by E. cloacae (Fig. 1C). The elevation of this gene in response to infection exhibited a maximal elevated response at expression 12 h post-infection (Fig. 1C). When infections were performed in blood-fed female mosquitoes, the LpRfb transcript responded similarly to that of previtellogenic mosquitoes, elevating its level 12 h post-infection in response to Gram (+) bacteria and fungi (Fig. 1D). In the control blood-fed female mosquito, LpRfb transcripts in the fat body reached their maximal levels as reported previously (14Cheon H.M. Seo S.J. Sun J. Sappington T.W. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Seo S.J. Cheon. H.M. Sun J. Sappington T.W. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41954-41962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Therefore, we observed a significant effect of infections on the expression of two essential genes of lipid metabolism, Lp and LpRfb. Importantly, expression of both these genes was elevated in the Aedes fat body in response to Gram (+) bacteria and fungal infections but not to Gram (–) bacteria. This type of immune regulation suggested involvement of the Toll/REL1 pathway in controlling expression of these two genes (38Shin S.W. Kokoza V. Bian G. Cheon H.M. Kim Y.J. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol.

The level of Lp transcripts was significantly elevated in the fat body at 24 h after feeding on an infective blood meal, the stage when ookinetes invade the midgut (Fig. 2A). The expression levels of the LpRfb gene were also elevated in parasite-infected mosquitoes compared with those of uninfected mosquitoes but at a later stage (32 h PBM) (Fig. 2B). These experiments clearly showed that malaria infection caused the elevated expression of both Lp and LpRfb genes in the Aedes fat body.FIGURE 2The expression profiles of AaLp and AaLpRfb genes after P. gallinaceum infection. AaLp (A) and AaLpRfb (B) genes exhibited increased levels of expression after feeding in A. aegypti mosquitoes on the Plasmodium-infected blood. Real-time PCR was performed as described in Fig. 1. Data represent means ± S.E. of triplicate samples. Standard errors are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the phenotypic effects on parasite development of silencing Lp and LpR genes, we prepared knock-out mosquitoes by injecting the females at 1–2 days post-eclosion with respective dsRNA. Mosquitoes with knockdown phenotype for Lp and LpR were infected with P. gallinaceum at 4 days after dsRNA injection. Infection levels were scored by the number of oocysts per midgut at 7 days post-infection (Fig. 3A). Controls showed that treatments with either anti-Lp or anti-LpR dsRNAi resulted in successful knockdown of both target genes (Fig. 3, B and C). Table 1 summarizes statistically evaluated results from three independent experiments. The Lp knockdown showed a marked and statistically significant effect (U test, p < 5–6, two-tailed): depletion of Lp resulted in a 12-fold decrease in parasite oocyst numbers (Fig. 3C and Table 1) and complete abolishment of egg development in ovaries of blood-fed mosquitoes (data not shown). In contrast, RNAi treatment of LpR had no significant effect on the parasite load compared with the control, iMal (U test, p = 0.32, two-tailed).FIGURE 3Effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown of AaLp and AaLpRfb on P. gallinaceum development in the mosquito midgut. A. aegypti female mosquitoes were injected with AaLp dsRNA (iLp), AaLpR dsRNA (iLpR), or with a control dsRNA derived from the noncoding region of a bacterial gene (iMal). Four days later, mosquitoes were infected with P. gallinaceum, and midguts were collected 7 days post-infection. A, AaLp knockdown (iLp) shows 12-fold reduction of oocyst numbers compared with control mosquitoes, whereas AaLpR knockdown (iLpR) shows no significant effect on parasite development. The data represent the pooled data set of three independent experiments. B and C, controls showing effect of AaLp dsRNA (iLp), AaLpR dsRNA (iLpR), and (iMal) on the levels of AaLp (B) and AaLpR (C) mRNA, which were determined by means of real-time PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Lipophorin influences vectorial capacity for P. gallinaceumdsRNANumber of experimentsTotal number of midgutsParasite loadRange of oocyst numbersU-testMal3559214-374p < 5-6Lp35590-44Mal3559214-374p = 0.32LpR353737-283 Open table in a new tab Toll/REL1 Pathway Regulation of Mosquito Lp and LpRfb Genes—Activation the Lp and LpRfb genes by Gram (+) bacteria, fungi, and Plasmodium, but not by Gram (–) bacteria, suggested that the Toll/REL1 pathway was involved in immune regulation of these genes (38Shin S.W.

https://openalex.org/W2034006228,"Unregulated microglial activation has been implicated as a pivotal factor contributing to Parkinson's disease. Using mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures, we address the novel possibility that peptides endogenous to the substantia nigra (SN), substance P and dynorphin (10(-13)-10(-14) M), are opposing mediators of microglial activation and consequent DA neurotoxicity. Here, we identify that substance P (10(-13)-10(-14) M) is selectively toxic to DA neurons in a microglia-dependent manner. Mechanistically, substance P (10(-13)-10(-14) M) activated microglial NADPH oxidase to produce extracellular superoxide and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Neuron-glia cultures from mice lacking a functional NADPH oxidase complex (PHOX-/-) were insensitive to substance P (10(-13)-10(-14) M) -induced loss of DA neuron function. Mixed glia cultures from (PHOX-/-) mice failed to show a significant increase in intracellular ROS in response to substance P compared with control cultures (PHOX+/+). Further, dynorphin (10(-14) M) inhibited substance P (10(-13) M) -induced loss of [3H] DA uptake. Here we demonstrate a tightly regulated mechanism governing microglia-derived oxidative stress, where the neuropeptide balance of dynorphin and substance P is critical to DA neuron survival."
https://openalex.org/W2010753579,"The mannose receptor family comprises four members in mammals, Endo180 (CD280), DEC-205 (CD205), phospholipase A(2) receptor (PLA(2)R) and the mannose receptor (MR, CD206), whose extracellular portion contains a similar domain arrangement: an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CysR) followed by a single fibronectin type II domain (FNII) and 8-10 C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). These proteins mediate diverse functions ranging from extracellular matrix turnover through collagen uptake to homeostasis and immunity based on sugar recognition. Endo180 and the MR are multivalent transmembrane receptors capable of interacting with multiple ligands; in both receptors FNII recognizes collagens, and a single CTLD retains lectin activity (CTLD2 in Endo180 and CTLD4 in MR). It is expected that the overall conformation of these multivalent molecules would deeply influence their function as the availability of their binding sites could be altered under different conditions. However, conflicting reports have been published on the three-dimensional arrangement of these receptors. Here, we have used single particle electron microscopy to elucidate the three-dimensional organization of the MR and Endo180. Strikingly, we have found that both receptors display distinct three-dimensional structures, which are, however, conceptually very similar: a bent and compact conformation built upon interactions of the CysR domain and the lone functional CTLD. Biochemical and electron microscopy experiments indicate that, under a low pH mimicking the endosomal environment, both MR and Endo180 experience large conformational changes. We propose a structural model for the mannose receptor family where at least two conformations exist that may serve to regulate differences in ligand selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2161478881,"We have analyzed the sequence of a mitochondrial integral membrane protein, Mdm12, and found that it forms the prototype for a novel domain, designated the SMP domain, that is common to an extended family of membrane-associated proteins. Comprehensive sequence searches using protein alignment models of SMP proteins were cross-validated by statistical resampling; providing strong support for these relationships. No consensus of 3-dimensional structure was reached upon threading sequences through known folds. SMP proteins are widespread amongst eukaryotic species with a particular enrichment in plants and features suggestive of species-specific functional variations. Members of 2 SMP families, the mitochore and tricalbin proteins, are essential components of protein complexes involved in mitochondrial inheritance and receptor endocytosis while a third SMP protein family, HT008, is associated with the Rvs161-Rvs167 complex, a known regulator of sphingolipid metabolism. In addition, HT008 and PDZK8 SMP proteins possess additional protein-protein interaction domains in domain architectures that are typical of protein scaffolds and adaptors. We therefore predict that the SMP domain is an important link between these distinct membrane-associated proteins and a key regulatory hub for unidentified global regulators.-Lee, I., Hong, W. Diverse membrane-associated proteins contain a novel SMP domain."

PS-341 induces apoptosis and has shown broad antitumor activity with selectivity for transformed cells. We studied the effect of PS-341 on lysosomal and mitochondrial permeabilization, including the role of caspase-2 activation in apoptosis induction in the BxPC-3 human pancreatic carcinoma cell line. PS-341 induced a dose-dependent apoptosis in association with reactive oxygen species generation and cleavage of caspase-2 to its 33- and 14-kDa fragments. PS-341 disrupted lysosomes with redistribution of cathepsin B to the cytosol, as shown using fluorescence confocal microscopy, that was blocked by the free radical scavenger tiron but not by a caspase-2 inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-VDVAD-fluoromethyl ketone (FMK)). PS-341-induced caspase-2 activation was attenuated by a selective pharmacological inhibitor of cathepsin B (R-3032), suggesting that cathepsin B release occurs upstream of caspase-2. PS-341-induced mitochondrial depolarization was attenuated by Z-VDVAD-FMK, tiron, and an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (bongkrekic acid). Regulation of mitochondrial permeability by caspase-2 was confirmed using caspase-2 small interfering RNA. PS-341-induced cytochrome c release and phosphatidylserine externalization were attenuated by Z-VDVAD-FMK and partially by R-3032. PS-341 activated the BH3-only proteins Bik and Bim and down-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA and protein expression.

Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fifth most incident cancer in the United States (1Jemal A. Tiwari R.C. Murray T. Ghafoor A. Samuels A. Ward E. Feuer E.J. Thun M.J. Society A.C. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2004; 54: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar), and fewer than 5% of affected patients survive 5 years after diagnosis. Pancreatic cancers are among the most intrinsically resistant tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs and irradiation. A novel agent targeting the proteosome has recently been developed and shown to display broad antitumor activity (2Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Maas J. Pien C.S. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar) and to overcome resistance to chemotherapy (3Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Richardson P.G. Poulaki V. Tai Y.T. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Schlossman R. Munshi N.C. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Blood. 2003; 101: 2377-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Based upon highly favorable results in patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (4Richardson P.G. Barlogie B. Berenson J. Singhal S. Jagannath S. Irwin D. Rajkumar S.V. Srkalovic G. Alsina M. Alexanian R. Siegel D. Orlowski R.Z. Kuter D. Limentani S.A. Lee S. Hideshima T. Esseltine D.L. Kauffman M. Adams J. Schenkein D.P. Anderson K.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2609-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), PS-341 (bortezomib or Velcade®) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this indication, and this drug is currently undergoing evaluation in several other cancers. PS-341, a dipeptidyl boronic acid, is a highly selective and reversible inhibitor of the 26 S proteosome, which is a multicatalytic enzyme that degrades damaged or misfolded/unfolded cellular proteins targeted by ubiquitin conjugation (5Voorhees P.M. Dees E.C. O'Neil B. Orlowski R.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6316-6325PubMed Google Scholar). The proteosome contributes to cellular homeostasis by directly or indirectly regulating intracellular protein levels, including those regulating cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcription factor activation (5Voorhees P.M. Dees E.C. O'Neil B. Orlowski R.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6316-6325PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A.

PS-341 has shown activity against several malignant cell types with selectivity for transformed cells compared with normal cells (5Voorhees P.M. Dees E.C. O'Neil B. Orlowski R.Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6316-6325PubMed Google Scholar). PS-341 has been shown to promote apoptosis by diverse mechanisms, including the membrane death receptor pathway, as evidenced by the ability of PS-341 to act cooperatively with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (e.g. TRAIL) to induce apoptosis (7Johnson T.R. Stone K. Nikrad M. Yeh T. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Nesterov A. Kraft A.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4953-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PS-341 can also stabilize proapoptotic Bax by inhibiting its degradation (8Li B. Dou Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and engage the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (9Ling Y.H. Liebes L. Zou Y. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33714-33723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PS-341-induced apoptosis may, in part, be regulated by the Bcl-2 family (6Mitsiades N. Mitsiades C.S. Poulaki V. Chauhan D. Fanourakis G. Gu X. Bailey C. Joseph M. Libermann T.A. Treon S.P. Richardson P.G. Hideshima T. Anderson K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 8Li B. Dou Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family includes the BH3-only proteins, so-called because they contain a BH3 protein interaction domain (e.g. Bid, Bik, and Bim) and serve as triggers for the apoptotic signal, whereas Bax and Bak act downstream to regulate apoptosis purportedly through permeabilization of mitochondria (10Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PS-341 can stabilize IκB, thereby decreasing the antiapoptotic effects of nuclear factor κB (11Hideshima T. Richardson P. Chauhan D. Palombella V.J. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Anderson K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are dependent upon activation of a caspase cascade. Recent data suggest that a caspase-independent mechanism involving lysosomes may function in the initiation of cell death (12Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Lysosomes release a family of proteases known as cathepsins that translocate to the cytosol in response to signals including oxidative stress, increased sphingosine levels, and Fas and tumor necrosis factor-α ligation (13Guicciardi M.E. Leist M. Gores G.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Of the 11 known cathepsins in mammalian lysosomes, cathepsin B and D are the most prominent and stable at physiological pH, and cathepsin B is ubiquitously expressed (13Guicciardi M.E. Leist M. Gores G.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes treated with tumor necrosis factor-R1, lysosomal permeabilization with release of cathepsin B into the cytosol has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-dependent cell death (14Werneburg N.W. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G947-G956Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ability of cathepsin B to induce cell death was shown in a cell-free system whereby cathepsin B produced chromatin condensation and apoptotic morphology (15Vancompernolle K. Van Herreweghe F. Pynaert G. Van de Craen M. De Vos K. Totty N. Sterling A. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although cathepsin B has been shown to play a role in apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (14Werneburg N.W. Guicciardi M.E. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G947-G956Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), cellular mechanisms responsible for ligand- or drug-induced lysosomal permeabilization are poorly understood. Whereas evidence supports participation of the mitochondria in transmitting a death signal initiated at the lysosomes (17Paquet C. Sane A.T. Beauchemin M. Bertrand R. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which lysosomal disruption leads to mitochondrial permeabilization remains unknown. In this regard, in vitro cleavage experiments have shown that the major human caspases are poor substrates for lysosomal extracts or cathepsins (18Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Bromme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The placement of caspase-2 within the known apoptotic signaling pathways remains incompletely understood. Recent evidence suggests that caspase-2 can serve as a proximal caspase that can be activated by cytotoxic stress and may be involved in the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (19Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 20Lin C.F. Chen C.L. Chang W.T. Jan M.S. Hsu L.J. Wu R.H. Tang M.J. Chang W.C. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40755-40761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this regard, sequential caspase-2 and caspase-8 activation were shown to occur upstream of mitochondria during ceramide- and etoposide-induced apoptosis (20Lin C.F. Chen C.L. Chang W.T. Jan M.S. Hsu L.J. Wu R.H. Tang M.J. Chang W.C. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40755-40761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chemotherapy-induced apoptosis has been shown to involve oxidative stress (21Simon H.U. Haj-Yehia A. Levi-Schaffer F. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar, 22Davis Jr., W. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). Caspase-2 has also been reported to be cleaved by effector caspase-3, indicating that it can function downstream of mitochondria during apoptotic signaling (23O'Reilly L.A. Ekert P. Harvey N. Marsden V. Cullen L. Vaux D.L. Hacker G. Magnusson C. Pakusch M. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Strasser A. Huang D.C. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Caspase-2 is recruited to a large protein complex whose formation occurs independently of an Apaf1/apoptosome pathway and is sufficient to mediate its activation (24Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of caspase-2 activation remain unclear. After an apoptotic stimulus, caspase-2 processing occurs by two proteolytic steps. A first cleavage at aspartic acid 316 generates two fragments: one of 32-33 kDa, the large subunit, and a second fragment of 14 kDa, the small subunit. The appearance of the 32-33-kDa fragment has been generally used as marker of caspase-2 activation (25Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Sh I.L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21010-21017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 26Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Of note, oocytes from caspase-2-deficient mice display resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (27Bergeron L. Perez G. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Whereas data suggest that caspase-2 regulates apoptosis, an siRNA 2The abbreviations and trivial name used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HE, dihydroethidium; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PI, propidium iodide. was shown to inhibit caspase-2 expression but not to suppress apoptosis in transformed cells (19Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 28Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2004; 306: 1863Google Scholar). Additionally, the absence of severe phenotypic abnormalities in caspase-2-deficient mice has cast doubt as to the importance of this caspase in apoptosis (27Bergeron L. Perez G. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the relationship of lysosomal disruption and caspase-2 activation to mitochondrial apoptotic signaling induced by PS-341 in BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. Our results indicate that PS-341 triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lysosomal permeabilization with cathepsin B redistribution to the cytosol. Oxidative stress and cathepsin B activate caspase-2, which is required for mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-2 can serve as a link between the lysosomes and the mitochondria. PS-341 also down-regulates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and activates proapototic BH-3-only proteins. Cell Culture and Reagents—BxPC-3 and CFPAC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). BxPC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES. CFPAC-1 cells were grown in Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, and for both cell lines, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PS-341 was generously provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The superoxide scavenger tiron (Sigma) was utilized as outlined below. Caspase-2, Caspase-8, and Cathepsin B Inhibitor—An irreversible caspase-2 inhibitor I, Z-VDVAD-FMK, was purchased from Calbiochem. A cell-permeable and irreversible caspase-8 inhibitor, Z-IETD-FMK, was obtained (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). A selective, reversible cathepsin B inhibitor, R-3032, was obtained from Celera Genomics (South San Francisco, CA) (29Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Feldstein A. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Taniai M. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The R-3032 dose was based on pharmacokinetic data demonstrating a half-life of 4.2 h and preliminary data demonstrating that extracellular concentrations of 10 μm were required to maximally inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α/actinomycin D-mediated apoptosis in cultured murine hepatocytes (29Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Feldstein A. Bronk S.F. Rydzewski R. Taniai M. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The KI for cathepsin B is 0.02 μm, and the drug does not inhibit caspases. Antibodies—For Western blotting, membranes were probed with primary antibodies, including rabbit polyclonal antibodies against caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and caspase-3 (BD Biosciences). Murine monoclonal antibodies were obtained against caspase-2 (clone G310-1248), caspase-8, cytochrome c (all from BD Biosciences), Bcl-2 (Ab-3; Calbiochem), and Smac/DIABLO (clone 78-1-118; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Monoclonal antibodies against Bax, Bcl-xL, and β actin were purchased from Sigma. A goat polyclonal anti-BID antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. A goat NBK/Bik antibody and a rabbit-caspase-2L (C-20) antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit anti-Bim/BOD antibody was obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, Canada). A goat anti-mouse IgG AP and goat anti-rabbit IgG AP-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Annexin V Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate, grown overnight, and then treated with PS-341. For experiments employing inhibitors, cells were preincubated with 5 mm tiron or 50 μm Z-VDVAD-FMK, both for 3 h, or 20 μm R-3032 for 24 h followed by PS-341 treatment. After treatments, adherent and floating cells were collected by trypsinization and centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended and incubated in complete medium for 10 min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed with PBS twice and resuspended in 500 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer (BD Biosciences) with 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Biosciences) and 0.5 μl of propidium iodide (Sigma). The percentage of cells with annexin V+/propidium iodide (PI)- was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Western Blotting—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/plate overnight. At the indicated time periods (see figure legends), cells were harvested by RIPA B lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 250 μg/ml sodium vanadate) on ice for 15 min. Total cellular proteins were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was measured by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Total cell lysates (50 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking nonspecific binding sites with I-Block (Tropix, Foster City, CA) at room temperature for 1 h, membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washes in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with the corresponding alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Signal was detected by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (2.0 × 106) were preincubated with 5 mm tiron for 3 h, followed by PS-341 treatment. After drug exposure, cells were collected in 1× PBS and lysed in a permeabilization buffer (210 mmol/liter d-mannitol, 70 mmol/liter sucrose, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter sodium succinate, 200 μmol/liter EGTA, 0.15% bovine serum albumin, and 80 μg/ml digitonin) on ice, as described previously (30Leist M. Volbracht C. Fava E. Nicotera P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant (i.e. cytosolic enriched fraction) was collected. Protein from the subcellular fractionation was quantified, separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Detection of ROS Generation—Dihydroethidium (HE) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was utilized to measure ROS generation in BxPC-3 cells. Cells (2.0 × 106) were preincubated with 5 mm tiron or 50 μm Z-VDVAD-FMK for 3 h or with 20 μm R-3032 for 24 h, followed by PS-341 treatment. After drug exposure, cells were collected by trypsinization and incubated in complete medium for 10 min. Then cells were incubated in 2 μm of HE (excitation wavelength 488 nm; emission 605 nm) at 37 °C for 15 min and washed with PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of PBS and then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Analysis of Mitochondrial Depolarization—5,5′,6,6-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine (JC-1) (Sigma) was employed to measure mitochondrial depolarization in BxPC-3 cells. Cells (2.0 × 106) were preincubated with 5 mm tiron, 50 μm Z-VDVAD-FMK, or 50 μm bongkrekic acid (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, for 3 h, followed by the addition of PS-341. After incubation for the designated time, cells were collected by trypsinization and incubated in complete medium for 10 min. Then cells were incubated in 5 μg/ml JC-1 at 37 °C for 15 min and washed with PBS. Both red (λem, 590 nm for FL2-H) and green (λem, 527 nm for FL1-H) fluorescence emissions were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. RNA Interference—BxPC-3 cells (1.7 × 106 cells/plate) were mock-transfected or transfected with 10 nm siCONTROL® nontargeting siRNA duplex or transfected with human caspase-2-specific siRNA duplex (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using siLectFect™, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Twenty-four hours after cells were transfected, media were replaced with fresh media with or without 100 nm PS-341 and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then analyzed for mitochondrial depolarization using JC-1 staining as described above. Transfection of Cathepsin B-Green Fluorescent Protein—The rat cathepsin B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. Gregory Gores (Mayo Clinic). Cells (0.4 × 106) were seeded overnight before transfection. Transfection was performed with 1 ml of Opti-MEM I containing 6 μl of Plus reagent, 1 μg of plasmid, and 4 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After a 24-h transfection, cells were preincubated with 5 mm tiron or 50 μm Z-VDVAD-FMK for 3 h with 20 μm R-3032 for 24 h, followed by PS-341 treatment for 24 h. Confocal microscopy was performed with an inverted Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM S10) using excitation of 488 nm and emission of 507 nm. Measurement of Caspase-2 Activity—ICH-1/caspase-2 protease activity was measured in cell lysates obtained from cultured cells with colorimetric substrates (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Cells (1.0 × 106) were preincubated with 20 or 50 μm R-3032 for 24 h, followed by PS-341 treatment. After drug exposure, cells were collected by trypsinization. 2-5 × 106 cells were pelleted, and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer on ice for 10 min. The cytosolic extract was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and protein concentration was assayed. Protease activity was measured by adding 50 μl of cytosolic extract (200 μg), 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer, and 200 μm VDVAD-p-nitroanilide substrate and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The colorimetric signal was detected using a VERSAmax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) at wavelength of 405 nm. -Fold increase in caspase-2 activity was then determined relative to untreated control. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate overnight. After drug treatments, cells were harvested and dissolved in 1 ml of TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instruction. The RNA A260/A280 ratios were between 1.6 and 1.8. cDNA was made from 1 μg of total RNA with the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA expression level was detected by real time PCR using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Gene expression level was quantified using the threshold PCR cycle number (Ct) method. In brief, the relative expression level of the target gene compared with that of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was calculated as 2-ΔCt, where ΔCt = Cttarget gene - CtGAPDH. The ratio of relative expression of the target gene to that of untreated cells was then calculated as 2-DΔCt, where ΔCt = ΔCttreated - ΔCtuntreated (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). The primers were as follows: sequence of GAPDH (GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT (forward) and TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG (reverse)), Bcl-2 (GGATGCCTTTGTGGAACTGT (forward) and AGCCTGCAGCTTTGTTTCAT (reverse)), and Bcl-xL (GGAGCTGGTGGTTGACTTTC (forward) and CTCCGATTCAGTCCCTTCTG (reverse)). The PCR was run for 35 cycles with a 58 °C annealing cycle (30 s), a 72 °C extension cycle (30 s), and a 95 °C denaturing cycle (50 s) plus final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. Statistical Analysis—All experiments, except immunoblots, were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. values. Statistical significance was determined utilizing the Student's t test or a one-way analysis of variance. Statistical significance was defined as p value of <0.05. PS-341 Induces Cytotoxic Stress and Activates Caspase-2-mediated Apoptosis—Induction of oxidative stress by cytotoxic drugs has been shown to directly engage the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (22Davis Jr., W. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the potential for PS-341 to generate ROS in BxPC-3 cells. Cells were incubated in dihydroethidium (HE), and the fluorescence signal was detected by flow cytometry. PS-341 treatment produced a 5-6-fold increase in ROS generation relative to control that was significantly attenuated by preincubation of cells with the superoxide scavenger, tiron (Fig. 1A). Induction of oxidative stress by PS-341 was confirmed by measuring γ-glutamylcysteine synthase mRNA levels. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo biosynthesis of GSH, an abundant physiological antioxidant (32Tatebe S. Unate H. Sinicrope F.A. Sakatani T. Sugamura K. Makino M. Ito H. Savaraj N. Kaibara N. Kuo M.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PS-341 (50 and 100 nm doses at 24 h) produced a 1.8-fold induction in γ-glutamylcysteine synthase mRNA expression compared with control (data not shown). PS-341 treatment of BxPC-3 cells produced a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis, as detected by phosphatidylserine externalization using an annexin V binding assay (Fig. 1B). PS-341 treatment cleaved caspase-8 to its active 43- and 18-kDa fragments and reduced the level of full-length Bid (Fig. 1C). To confirm that PS-341 can activate caspase-8 and engage the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we utilized a specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (Z-IEHD-FMK). Z-IETD-FMK was found to block PS-341-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and to attenuate PS-341-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). After Bid cleavage, its truncated form is translocated to the mitochondria, where it mediates cross-talk with the mitochondrial pathway (33Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). PS-341 cleaved downstream effector caspase-9 and caspase-3 and triggered the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived caspase activator) proteins (Fig. 1C). Smac has been shown to promote caspase-9 activation via Apaf-1 and to antagonize the inhibitory effect of XIAP on caspase-9 (34Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Rosen S. Reed J.C. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2000201029,"Defective mitotic spindles or an impaired spindle-kinetochore interaction activates the spindle checkpoint. We have previously shown that BubR1 haplo-insufficiency results in enhanced genomic instability and tumorigenesis in mice. Here we report that BubR1 deficiency also leads to a compromised response to DNA damage. Following treatment with doxorubicin, BubR1(+/-) murine fibroblast cells (MEF) were defective in undergoing G(2)/M arrest. Thus, whereas in the presence of DNA damage BubR1(+/+) MEF cells remained arrested in mitosis, BubR1(+/-) MEFs rapidly exited from mitosis and divided. The impaired mitotic arrest of BubR1(+/-) MEFs was associated with low levels of phospho-histone H2AX, p53, and p21 after DNA damage caused by treatment with both doxorubicin and ultraviolet light (UV). The impaired expression of p53 and p21 was also confirmed in human cell lines with BubR1 knockdown via RNA interference. Affinity pull-down coupled with mass spectrometry identified Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) as one of the proteins interacting with BubR1. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the physical interaction between BubR1 and PARP-1. Our further study revealed that the ability of retaining intact PARP-1 or its cleavage product p89 was compromised in BubR1(+/-) MEFs upon treatment with doxorubicin or UV. Given that PARP-1 mediates DNA damage responses and regulates the activity of p53, our studies suggest that there exists a cross-talk between the spindle checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint and that BubR1 may play an important role in mediating the cross-talk."
https://openalex.org/W1974879139,"Despite intensive research over the last two decades, there are still no specific markers of endogenous lipid hydroperoxide-mediated DNA damage. We recently demonstrated that heptanone-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine adducts are formed in the DNA of rat intestinal epithelial cells that stably express cyclooxygenase-2. Heptanone-etheno adducts can only arise from the reaction of lipid hydroperoxide-derived 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal with DNA. This raised the possibility that similar adducts would be formed in vivo in settings where cyclooxygenase-2 expression is increased. Therefore, DNA-adduct formation was studied in C57BL/6JAPCmin mice, a colorectal cancer mouse model in which cyclooxygenase-2 is up-regulated. 15(S)-Hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid is the major lipid hydroperoxide produced endogenously by cyclooxygenase-2. It undergoes homolytic decomposition to the DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophile 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal, which forms heptanone-etheno adducts with DNA. A quantitative comparison was made of the heptanone-etheno-DNA adducts present in C57BL/6J and C57BL/6JAPCmin mice. Using highly specific and sensitive methodology based on stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, we have detected the endogenous formation of heptanone-etheno adducts in mammalian tissue DNA for the first time. In addition, we found that there were statistically significant increased levels of the heptanone-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine and heptanone-etheno-2′-deoxycytidine adducts in the C57BL/6JAPCmin mice when compared with the control C57BL/6J mice.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Each year ∼130,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and ∼56,000 will die from the disease.

Furthermore, for individuals with inherited familial adenomatous polyposis, NSAID intake was associated with a reduction in polyp number and size (1Waddell W.R. Gasner G.F. Cerise E.J. Loughry R.W.

Likewise, NSAIDs have demonstrated their efficacy to inhibit carcinoma formation in animal models (5Pollard M. Luckert P.H.

The molecular mechanism for the ability of NSAIDs to inhibit tumor formation is not known. However, most NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 (9Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). The COX-1 enzyme, which is constitutively expressed in nearly all tissues in the body, predominantly plays a housekeeping role by mediating normal physiologic processes such as protection of the stomach and platelet aggregation (10Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Tiano H.F. Loftin C.D. Ghanayem B.I. Chulada P.C. Mahler J.F. Lee C.A. Goulding E.H. Kluckman K.D. Kim H.S. Smithies O. Cell. 1995; 83: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The other isoform, COX-2, is inducible by various mitogens, growth factors, and mediators of inflammation in certain cells and tissues (11Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar). Although COX-1 is constitutively present in normal colon tissue, COX-2 levels are low to undetectable. In contrast, COX-2 mRNA is up-regulated in tumor tissue, and COX-2 protein is expressed in high amounts (12Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rats that have been subjected to carcinogens, COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were increased in the tumors (13DuBois R.N. Radhika A. Reddy B.S. Entingh A.J. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1259-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells overexpressing COX-2 have an altered cellular adhesion pathway, fail to undergo apoptosis, have increased invasiveness, and cell cycle prolongation (14Tsujii M. DuBois R.N.

All of these changes were reversed by the addition of an NSAID, suggesting that COX-2-derived metabolites play an important role in tumorigenesis (14Tsujii M. DuBois R.N.

In animal models, the absence of COX-2 expression inhibited polyp formation to 84% of control (17Chulada P.C. Thompson M.B. Mahler J.F. Doyle C.M. Gaul B.W. Lee C. Tiano H.F. Morham S.G. Smithies O. Langenbach R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4705-4708PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of the COX-2 gene in transgenic mice was sufficient to induce polyp formation in >85% of the mice (18Liu C.H. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C. Wu M.T. Smith E. Haudenschild C. Lane T.F. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18563-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is the preferred substrate for COX-2. It catalyzes the bis-dioxygenation of arachidonic acid to form PGG2, a cyclic endoperoxide with a hydroperoxide at C-15. This is followed by reduction of the C15-hydroperoxide to give PGH2 (the peroxidase reaction). PGH2 is the precursor to the formation of thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, and other PGs (9Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar, 19Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar). When mice were fed eicosapentaenoic acid, an ω-3 fatty acid, this resulted in a significant reduction in intestinal arachidonic acid content and PGE2 levels as well as a 64% reduction in polyp load (20Petrik M.B. McEntee M.F. Chiu C.H. Whelan J. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, when cytosolic phospholipase 2, a phospholipase that has been well characterized as a major arachidonic acid releasing enzyme, was deleted in Min mice, there was an 83% reduction in polyp number (21Hong K.H. Bonventre J.C. O'Leary E. Bonventre J.V. Lander E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3935-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit polyp formation by NSAIDs and the reduction of arachidonic acid availability suggested that eicosanoid production may be very important in promoting carcinogenesis. In addition, eicosanoids have the ability to modulate various steps involved in carcinogenesis such as apoptosis and angiogenesis. However, eicosanoids are also produced by COX-1, which is present in both affected and unaffected tissue. This suggests that there may be a link between polyp formation and COX-2 up-regulation through a pathway that does not involve the biosynthesis of eicosanoids. COX-2 can convert arachidonic acid into 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-(Z,Z,Z,E)-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) (22Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), which is derived from 15-HPETE, a prototypic ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipid hydroperoxide. In settings of oxidative stress, where reducing pathways were compromised, 15-HPETE may survive long enough to induce DNA damage. Recently, it was demonstrated that 15-HPETE underwent homolytic decomposition to form DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophiles, HPNE, HNE, ONE, and EDE (23Williams M.V. Lee S.H. Blair I.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two distinct pathways of decomposition were identified. The first involved the intermediate formation of HPNE, and the second involved a series of complex rearrangements to EDE (24Pryor W.A. Porter N.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 541-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HPNE was shown to be the immediate precursor of ONE and HNE (22Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 23Williams M.V. Lee S.H. Blair I.A.

Oe T. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EDE also formed unsubstituted etheno adducts (25Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and ONE formed heptanone-etheno adducts (30Rindgen D. Lee S.H. Nakajima M. Blair I.A. Chem. Res.

Toxicol. 2003; 16: 893-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). However, HPNE was 10 times more efficient in the formation of unsubstituted etheno adducts than EDE, suggesting that it is the primary source for the formation of these adducts (29Lee S.H. Arora J.A. Oe T. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unsubstituted etheno adducts are highly mutagenic in mammalian cells and have been detected in human DNA (33Levine R.L. Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Pandya G. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4098-4104PubMed Google Scholar, 34Akasaka S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the ONE-derived heptanone-etheno adduct, HϵdCyd, was highly mutagenic in both bacteria and human cells. 3M. Pollack, I.-Y. Yang, H. Y. Kim, C. Torres, F. Johnson, I. A. Blair, and M. Moriya, submitted for publication. Interestingly, there were substantial differences in mutational frequency and base substitution between bacteria and human cells. 3M. Pollack, I.-Y. Yang, H. Y. Kim, C. Torres, F. Johnson, I. A. Blair, and M. Moriya, submitted for publication. In earlier studies we showed that vitamin C induces the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides to DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophiles. This made it possible to develop an in vitro system to show that DNA damage occurred in rat intestinal epithelial cells stably expressing COX-2. There was a dose-dependent increase in HϵdGuo adduct formation in the presence of vitamin C in these cells (35Lee S.H. Williams M.V. DuBois R.N. Blair I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28337-28346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). HϵdGuo adduct formation together with 15-(S)-HPETE biosynthesis was inhibited by a specific COX-2 inhibitor (35Lee S.H. Williams M.V. DuBois R.N. Blair I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28337-28346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is now substantial evidence that COX-2-mediated DNA damage may play a role in tumorigenesis. Min mice are one of the most commonly used mouse models for colorectal cancer. These mice spontaneously develop large numbers of polyps. In addition, up-regulation of COX-2 in the small intestine in these mice has been well characterized (36Williams C.S. Luongo C. Radhika A. Zhang T. Lamps L.W. Nanney L.B. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 1134-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore, this mouse model and its wild type, non-COX-2 expressing counterpart were used to examine whether heptanone-etheno adducts were present in the DNA. A quantitative stable isotope dilution LC/ESI/MS/MS assay was used to quantify heptanone-etheno adducts in the small intestinal tissue. Materials and Reagents—Ammonium acetate, activated calf thymus, vitamin C, DNase I, and zinc chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 15(S)-HPETE was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). High performance liquid chromatography grade water and acetonitrile were obtained from Fisher. Nuclease P1 and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. 13C15N-Labeled DNA with >99% isotopic purity, prepared by growing algae in 13C15N-enriched media, was supplied by Spectra Stable Isotopes (Columbia, MD). Gases were supplied by BOC Gases (Lebanon, NJ). Animals—C57BL/6J and C57BL/6JAPCmin mice were obtained as gifts from Dr. Colin Funk of Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada. Mice were fed ad libitum and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. The entire small intestine was removed and immediately frozen at -80 °C until required for DNA extraction. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry for the quantitative analysis of five DNA adducts was conducted with a Finnigan TSQ Quantum Ultra AM spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) equipped with an ESI source in the positive ion mode. Operating conditions were: spray voltage, 4.5 kV; heated capillary temperature, 350 °C. Nitrogen was used for the sheath gas and auxiliary gas set at 60 and 10 (in arbitrary units), respectively. Collision-induced dissociation was performed using argon as the collision gas at 1.5 milliTorr in the second (radio frequency-only) quadrupole. An additional direct current offset voltage was applied to the region of the second multipole ion guide (Q0) at 5 V to impart enough translational kinetic energy to the ions so that solvent adduct ions dissociate to form sample ions. MRM analysis at unit resolution was maintained for both precursor and product ions. The following MRM transitions were monitored: CϵdGuo (m/z 476 → 360; 15N5-labeled CϵdGuo (m/z 481 → 365); CϵdCyd (m/z 436 → 320); 15N3-labeled CϵdCyd (m/z 439 → 323); HϵdAdo (m/z 388 → 272); 15N5-labeled HϵdAdo (m/z 393 → 277); HϵdCyd (m/z 364 → 248); 15N3-labeled HϵdCyd (m/z 367→251); HϵdGuo (m/z 404 → 288); 15N5-labeled HϵdGuo (m/z 409 → 293). Liquid Chromatography—LC/UV chromatography for quantitative DNA base analysis was conducted using gradient system 1 on a Hitachi L-2130 Intelligent Pump equipped with a Hitachi L2450 diode array detector (Hitachi, San Jose, CA). The separation employed a Phenomenex Jupiter 5-μm C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Solvent A was water, and solvent B was acetonitrile. The gradient was as follows; 0% B at 0 min, 0% B at 5 min, 8% B at 25 min, 100% B at 26 min, 100% B at 36 min, 0% B at 37 min, and 0% B at 52 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The separation was performed at ambient temperature. LC/ESI/MS analysis for DNA adducts on gradient system 2 was performed using a Hitachi L-2130 Intelligent Pump. The separation employed a Phenomenex Luna 3-μm C8 column (150 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 3 μm). Solvent A was 5 mm ammonium acetate in water, and solvent B was 5 mm ammonium acetate in acetonitrile. The gradient was as follows: 6% B at 0 min, 6% B at 2 min, 9% B at 12 min, 55% B at 22 min, 80% B at 30 min,80% B at 33 min,6% B at 35 min,and6% B at 45 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. The separation was performed at ambient temperature. Extraction of DNA from Mouse Tissue—DNA isolation from the small intestine of mice was performed using a Wako DNA extraction WB kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Briefly, tissue was homogenized in lysis solution and then treated with an enzyme reaction solution, RNase, and protease to liberate the DNA from the nucleus. This was followed by NaI extraction and several wash steps to purify the DNA. Typically several mg of DNA were obtained. It was hydrolyzed as described below, and normal bases were quantified by LC/UV using system 1. Hydrolysis of DNA and Isolation of DNA Adducts—The extracted DNA was combined and dissolved in Chelex-treated 10 mm Tris buffer (22Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) containing 100 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4, 1 ml). DNase I (556 units) dissolved in 10 mm MOPS containing 120 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. At the end of the incubation the pH was adjusted to 9.0 by adding 0.1 m glycine buffer (pH 10.0), nuclease P1 (15.5 units) was added, and incubation was continued for a further 2 h at 37 °C. 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was then added followed by alkaline phosphatase (30 units) in SAP 10× buffer, and incubation was conducted for 2 h at 37°C.Thesamples were filtered through a 0.2-μm Costar cartridge. At this time an aliquot was removed for LC/UV analysis of the bases using gradient system 1. Quantitation of DNA bases was carried out by constructing standard curves of known amount of bases. The remaining sample was applied to a solid phase extraction cartridge (6 ml, Supelclean LC-18, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) that had been prewashed with acetonitrile (18 ml) and water (18 ml). The cartridge was then washed with water (4 ml) and a methanol/water mixture (1 ml, 5:95 v/v). Adducts were eluted with an acetonitrile/water mixture (6 ml, 1:1 v/v). The eluates were evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Analysis of Adducts—The adducts were redissolved in water/acetonitrile (100 μl 94:6 v/v). Aliquots (10 μl) were analyzed by LC/ESI/MRM/MS using gradient system 2. The 15N5- or 15N3-labeled internal standards were added to the samples before hydrolysis. Quantitation was performed from standard curves constructed by the ratio of known amounts of authentic standards and internal standards. For the MRM analysis, parent ions were monitored for the protonated molecular ion of the endogenous adduct and for its 15N5 or 15N3 internal standard. Product ions that were monitored corresponded to the loss of the 2′-deoxyribose moiety (BH2+) from the endogenous adduct and its 15N5 or 15N3 internal standard. Adduct levels were normalized to the amount of DNA as detected by base analysis mentioned above. Artifact Formation during Isolation and Analysis—Duplicate small intestine samples from Min mice were spiked with 13C15N-labeled DNA (520 μg) before defrosting. The amount of unlabeled DNA in each sample was estimated as 650 μg. Labeled and unlabeled DNA were extracted from the tissues, hydrolyzed in the presence of 15N internal standards using DNase, nuclease P1, and alkaline phosphatase. DNA adducts were isolated by solid phase extraction as described above. The samples were then analyzed by LC/MRM/MS, monitoring the following transitions: m/z 404 → m/z 288 (endogenous HϵdGuo), m/z 419 → m/z 298 (13C1015N5-labeled HϵdGuo from labeled DNA), m/z 409 → m/z 293, 15N5-labeled HϵdGuo, internal standard), m/z 388 → m/z 272 (endogenous HϵdAdo), m/z 403 → m/z 282 (13C1015N5-labeled HϵdAdo from labeled DNA), m/z 393 → m/z 277 (15N5-labeled HϵdAdo, internal standard), m/z 364 → m/z 248 (endogenous HϵdCyd), m/z 376 → m/z 255 (13C915N3-labeled HϵdCyd from labeled DNA), m/z 367 → m/z 251 (15N3-labeled HϵdCyd internal standard). Reaction of 15(S)-HPETE with Calf Thymus DNA—15(S)-HPETE (5 mm) in Chelex-treated water (22Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) was reacted with vitamin C (2 mm) in the presence of calf thymus DNA (5 mm) for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction was placed on ice for 15 min. DNA was precipitated by cold ethanol and 2.9 m sodium acetate. It was hydrolyzed as described above, and normal bases were quantified by LC/UV using system 1.

DNA was then isolated from the tissue and hydrolyzed using the normal work up procedure. 15N5-Labeled HϵdGuo, 15N5-labeled HϵdAdo, and 15N3-labeled HϵdCyd internal standards were added to the DNA hydrolysates. Amounts of the three 13C15N-labeled heptanone-etheno adducts were all <0.05% of the relevant 15N internal standard. This showed that no artifactual adduct formation had occurred (Fig. 8, A-C). In contrast, the expected amounts of endogenous HϵdGuo (Fig. 8A) and HϵdCyd (Fig. 8C) were observed. As expected, the amount of endogenous HϵdAdo was below the limit of detection of the assay (Fig. 8B). DNA Adducts Formed in Calf Thymus DNA—15(S)-HPETE was decomposed in the presence of vitamin C and calf thymus DNA. LC/ESI/MRM/MS was conducted for the quantification of the adducts formed.

PCC7002 that code for lyases that attach PCB to cysteine-84 (consensus numbering) of the β-subunits of CPC and possibly allophycocyanin; homologous genes are also found in other cyanobacteria (36Shen G.

Using biochemical, enzymatic, and molecular biological methods, we now show that alr0617 codes for a PCB:phycobiliprotein lyase that catalyzes the covalent attachment of PCB to cysteine-84 of the β-subunits of CPC (CpcB) and PEC (PecB). In analogy to cpeS from Calothrix PCC7601 (37Cobley J.G. Clark A.C. Weerasurya S. Queseda F.A. Xiao J.Y. Bandrapali N. D'Silva I. Thounaojam M. Oda J.F. Sumiyoshi T. Chu M.H. Mol.

The name cpeS was nonetheless retained for alr0617, at least for the time being, in view of the comparably broad substrate specificity of the lyase. The enzymatic function of CpeS from Anabaena sp. PCC7120 was further demonstrated by co-expression in E. coli of dual plasmids containing cpcB(C155I) or pecB(C155I), with cpeS (i.e. alr0617), ho1 and pcyA, resulting in biosynthesis of the respective β-subunits singly chromophorylated at cysteine-β84. Proteins—Cloning and expression generally followed the standard procedures of Sambrook et al. (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The integral genes, cpcE and cpcF, were PCR-amplified as described previously from Anabaena sp., pecA, pecE, and pecF from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Mastigocladus laminosus (Fischerella PCC7603) (15Zhao K.-H. Ran Y. Li M. Sun Y.-N. Zhou M. Storf M. Kupka M. Böhm S. Bubenzer C. Scheer H.

Mutants cpcB(C155I), cpcB(C84S), pecB(C155I), and pecB(C84S) were generated from cpcB and pecB of M. laminosus (41Zhao K.H. Zhu J.P. Song B. Zhou M. Storf M. Böhm S. Bubenzer C. Scheer H. Biochim.

Grossman A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 610-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120) were constructed in this work using the primers P1-P8 shown below. They were cloned first into pBluescript (Stratagene), and then subcloned into pET30a (Novagen). CpeS, without an His tag, was obtained by expressing pGEMEX (Promega) containing alr0617 (26Zhao K.-H.

For the construction of dual plasmids, the following genes from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 were PCR-amplified via primers P8-P13: cpeS, ho1 (= all1897, annotated according to its high homology with ho1 from Synechococcus PCC 6803 (43Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E.

The PCR-amplified ho1 and pcyA were cloned together in pACYCDuet-1 (Novagen) to produce pHO-PcyA, and alr0617 was cloned in pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen) to produce pCDF-CpeS. All molecular constructions were verified by sequencing as follows. P1: 5′-GGACCCGGGATGACATTAGACGTATTTAC-3′, upstream; P2: 5′-ATTCTCGAGTTAACCTACAGCAGCAGCAG-3′, downstream; P3: 5′-ATACCCGGGATGCTCGATGCTTTTTC-3′, upstream; P4: 5′-GTGCTCGAGTTAAACAACCGCAGAAGC-3′, downstream; P5: 5′-GTACCCGGGATGAGTATTACACCTGAG-3′, upstream; P6: 5′-CGCCTCGAGCTAAACTGATTGTAAAGACT-3′, downstream; P7: 5′-GCGCCCGGGATGAATATCGAAGAGTTTTTT-3′, upstream; P8: 5′-GGGCTCGAGGTTTTAACTTGACGCAGAATT-3′, downstream; P9: 5′-GGCGATATCCGGGATGAATATTGAAGAGTTT-3′, upstream; P10: 5′-CTACCATGGCGATGAGCAGCAATTTAGCA-3′, upstream; P11: 5′-ATCCTGCAGTTACTCAGCCGTGGCAAGTT-3′, downstream; P12: 5′-CGCGATATCGATGTCACTTACTTCCATTC-3′, upstream; and P13: 5′-TACCTCGAGCCGTTATTCTGGGAGATC-3′, downstream. For P1-P8, all upstream primers have a SmaI site (CCCGGG) and the downstream primers have a XhoI site (CTCGAG) (both marked in bold), which ensure correct ligation of the fragments to pBluescript and then to pET30. P1 and P2 were used for cpcB, P3 and P4 for pecB, P5 and P6 for nblB, and P7 and P8 for alr0617. For P8-P13, the upstream primers for pcyA and alr0617 have an EcoRV site (GATATC), and the downstream primers have an XhoI site (CTCGAG); the upstream primer for ho1 has an NcoI site (CCATTG), and the downstream primer has a PstI site (CTGCAG). P8 and P9 were used for alr0617, P10 and P11 for ho1, and P12 and P13 for pcyA. Expressions—The pET-based plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing kanamycin (30 μg·ml-1) at 37 °C for genes from M. laminosus or at 20 °C for genes from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. When the cell density reached A600 = 0.5-0.7, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added. Cells were collected by centrifugation 5 h after induction (for genes from M. laminosus) or after 6 h (for genes from Anabaena sp.), then washed twice with doubly distilled water and stored at -20 °C until use (15Zhao K.-H.

Storf M. Bubenzer C. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dual plasmids were transformed together into BL21(DE3) cells under the respective antibiotic selections (chloromycetin for pHO-PcyA and streptomycin for pCDF-cpeS). One of the four plasmids pET-CpcB(C155I), pET-CpcB, pET-PecB(C155I), or pET-PecB, was used together with pCDF-CpeS and pHO-PcyA to produce PCB-CpcB(C155I), PCB-CpcB, PCB-PecB(C155I), or PCB-PecB, respectively. In the control experiment, pCDF-CpeS was omitted from the transformations. Cells were grown at 20 °C in LB-medium containing kanamycin (20 μg·ml-1), chloromycetin (17 μg·ml-1), and streptomycin (25 μg·ml-1). When the cell density reached A600 = 0.5-0.7, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added. Cells were collected by centrifugation 12 h after induction, washed twice with doubly distilled water, and stored at -20 °C until use. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (KPP, 20 mm, pH 7.2) containing NaCl (0.5 m) and disrupted by sonication (5 min, 45 W, Branson model 450W). The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the crude proteins was purified via Ni2+-affinity chromatography on chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The initial buffer was KPP (20 mm, pH 7.2) containing NaCl (1 m), the elution buffer also contained imidazole (0.5 m) or EDTA (100 mm). After collection, the samples were dialyzed twice against the initial buffer and kept at -20 °C until use. Quantification of Phycocyanobilin and Protein—PCB was prepared as described before (25Storf M. Parbel A. Meyer M. Strohmann B. Scheer H. Deng M. Zheng M. Zhou M. Zhao K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12444-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PCB concentrations were determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient ϵ690 = 37,900 m-1·cm-1 in methanol/2% HCl (44Cole W.J. Chapman D.J. Siegelman H.W. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2929-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions given by the supplier, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed with the buffer system of Laemmli (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R for the protein, and with ZnCl2 for bilin chromophores (47Berkelman T. Lagarias J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The amounts of bilins in reconstituted phycobiliproteins were quantified by comparing their fluorescence intensity on the same SDS-PAGE. Gels were photographed, the negatives were scanned (model NUSCAN 700, Shanghai Zhongjing Computer Ltd., China), and the intensity was evaluated with Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe). Care was taken to avoid saturation. Complex Formation of CpeS with Other Proteins—CpeS with no His tag was incubated with His-tagged apo-proteins (CpcB(C155I) or PecB(C155I)), α84 lyases (CpcE, CpcF, PecE, and PecF), or CpeS at 4 °C overnight. The mixtures were then loaded on a Ni2+ affinity column, washed three times with 5 column volumes of initial buffer (see above), once with the same buffer but also containing 50 mm imidazole, and, finally, with the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. The eluate from the last wash was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded by a Lamda 25 spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Formation of the photochromic PVB-PecA (i.e. α-PEC) in the lyase reaction was monitored by the absorption at 570 nm and by double-difference spectroscopy of the reversible photoreaction of the PVB chromophore as previously described (48Zhao K.H. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 244-253Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model LS 45), and were not corrected. Excitation was done on the blue side of the visible absorption maxima (580-620 nm). The extinction coefficients of the reconstituted and biosynthesized PCB-CpcB(C155I), PCB-CpcB, PCB-PecB(C155I), and PCB-PecB were determined based on the extinction coefficient of PCB in CPC in 8 m acidic urea (49Glazer A.N. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (ϵ660 = 35,500 m-1cm-1). Fluorescence yields ΦF of the reconstituted and biosynthesized PCB-CpcB(C155I), PCB-CpcB, PCB-PecB(C155I), and PCB-PecB were determined in KPP buffer (20 mm, pH 7.2), using the known fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.27) of CPC from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (50Cai Y.A. Murphy J.T. Wedemayer G.J. Glazer A.N. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 186-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as standard. Lyase Activity Assay: Optimization of Reconstitution—PCB was reconstituted by incubating the desired apoprotein (CpcB(C155I), CpcB(C84S), CpcB, PecB(C155I), PecB(C84S), or PecB, 12-46 μm), with CpeS (12-40 μm) in KPP (20-1000 mm, pH 6.0-11.0) containing one or more of the following: Tris·HCl (0-100 mm), NaCl (0-500 mm), mercaptoethanol (ME, 0-5 mm), various metal ions (0-5 mm), EDTA (0-20 mm), Triton X-100 (TX100) or reduced TX100 (0-1% v/v) and glycerol (0-25% v/v). Then PCB (final concentration = 3-10 μm) was added as a concentrated solution ín Me2SO (0.3-1 mm), such that the final concentration of Me2SO was 1% (v/v). The mixture was incubated at 20-75 °C for 1-3 h in the dark. Reconstitution was assayed via the absorption and fluorescence of the mixture. Optimum conditions were as follows: KPP (500 mm, pH 7.5), PCB (5 μm), NaCl (150 mm), EDTA (1 mm), no Tris·HCl, ME, metal ions, TX100, or glycerol, incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was inspected by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The sample was then purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography (see above) and the imidazole (500 mm) eluate was dialyzed to remove imidazole. The dialysate was then inspected again by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. For kinetic tests, only purified proteins were used. Reconstitution of PCB with CpcB and PecB was followed by fluorescence (emission at 645 and 630 nm and excitation at 620 and 600 nm, respectively). The purified apo-proteins (CpcB(C155I) or PecB(C155I), 25 μm) and different amounts of PCB were incubated at 37 °C in the optimum reconstitution system (see above). At regular time intervals, the reaction was terminated by rapidly cooling the samples on ice to 0 °C, and then the product was analyzed spectroscopically without delay (11Zhao K.H. Su P. Böhm S.

Scheer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Km, vmax, and kcat were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots, using Origin V7 (Origin Lab Corp.). Chromophore Cleavage Assay—CpeS (2 μm) was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with donor chromoprotein (reconstituted and purified PCB-CpcB(C155I) or PCB-PecB(C155I), 1.0 μm)), PecA (4 μm), and PecE/F (4 μm). In the control experiments, CpeS was omitted under otherwise identical conditions. Chromophore transfer was assayed by the reversible photochemistry of reconstituted PVB-PecA (i.e. α-PEC (48Zhao K.H. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 244-253Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar)). Chromopeptides from PCB-CpcB(C155I) and PCB-PecB(C155I)— Reconstituted chromoproteins, CpcB(C155I) or PecB(C155I), were purified by Ni2+ chromatography (see above) and dialyzed against KPP (20 mm, pH 7.2). The desired chromoprotein solution was acidified with HCl to pH 1.5, and pepsin was added to the sample (1:1, w/w). The mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and then fractionated on Bio-Gel P-60 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with dilute HCl (pH 2.5). Colorless peptides and salts were eluted with the same solvent (51Zhao K.H. Haessner R. Cmiel E. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 235-243Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the adsorbed chromopeptides were eluted with acetic acid (30%, v/v) in dilute HCl (pH 2.5). The collected samples were dried with a rotary evaporator and subjected to HPLC (Waters 2695 system with model 2487 variable wavelength detector) on a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies) using a gradient of KPP (100 mm, pH 2.1) and acetonitrile (80:20 to 60:40), as described by Storf (52Storf M. Chromophorbindung und Photochemie der α-Untereinheit des Phycoerythrocyanins aus Mastigocladus laminosus, Dissertation. Ludwig Maximilians Universität, München2004Google Scholar). For the controls, natural β-CPC and β-PEC were isolated from M. laminosus via isoelectric focusing (48Zhao K.H. Scheer H. Biochim. Biophys.

PCC7002. The genome of Anabaena sp. PCC7120 contains a single gene homologous to cpcS, namely alr0617. This gene was expressed in E. coli, with and without N-terminal His and S tags. Incubation of PCB and CpcB with CpeS resulted in a rapid increase of absorption ∼619 nm and the emergence of a bright red fluorescence (λmax = 643 nm). Identical results were obtained with a mutant lacking the β-155 binding site, namely CpcB(C155I) (Fig. 1A), however, there was no such reaction with mutant CpcB(C84S) lacking the binding cysteine-β84 (see below). The affinity-purified product has the intense visible absorption and fluorescence typical of native biliproteins, with the position of the bands red-shifted compared with holo-β-CPC, peaking in the range associated with the cysteine-β84 chromophore of CPC (53Debreczeny M.P.

Moreover, we deduce that one green fluorescent protein or two cytochrome c molecules must reside within the central proteolytic chamber while the remaining substrate molecules occupy, singly, both antechambers. The results imply therefore an additional role for 20S proteasomes in the storage of substrates prior to their degradation, specifically in cases where translocation rates are slower than proteolysis.

Cells depend upon the regulated degradation of their various proteins to maintain homeostasis and change metabolic state. A key component of this process is the proteasome, a large multisubunit proteolytic machine (for reviews, see Refs. 1Zwickl P. Voges D. Baumeister W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The assembly is built from four stacked rings containing seven subunits in each ring: two internal β-rings harboring catalytic β-subunits and two outer α-rings that define a gated channel leading into the internal proteolytic chamber (11Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). The four rings form a hollow interior with three large chambers interconnected by a narrow channel with restricted orifices. The selectivity of the proteasome is achieved by this architecture that occludes its active sites within its central chamber, leading to a model by which unfolded substrates are fed into the central catalytic cavity as extended chains (12Wenzel T. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The proteins are degraded in a processive manner without releasing the substrate before it is degraded to peptides (13Akopian T.N. Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1791-1798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Kisselev A.F. Akopian T.N. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The rate of proteolysis in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteasomes is determined not only by the kinetics of degradation but also by the translocation of substrate molecules into and product molecules out of the proteasome (16Dolenc I. Seemuller E. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Luciani F. Kesmir C. Mishto M. Or-Guil M. de Boer R.J. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2422-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).These steric constraints raise several questions about how substrate molecules are translocated through the internal cavities to the proteolytic core: specifically, whether more than one protein can bind simultaneously and the role of the two antechambers in the translocation process. These questions are challenging to address using established biochemical and structural biology approaches. Results from solution-based methods dependent upon molecular mass or changes in cross-sectional area are often ambiguous because the differences between free and ligand-bound forms of the complex are relatively small. Because the proteasome has broad substrate specificity and there are no constraints on the substrate conformation within the internal cavities, it is difficult to interpret additional density in terms of stoichiometry in both electron microscopy (EM) 3The abbreviations used are: EM, electron microscopy; MS, mass spectrometry; Cyt c, cytochrome c; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: EM, electron microscopy; MS, mass spectrometry; Cyt c, cytochrome c; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and x-ray crystallography analyses of the ligand-bound proteasome. Moreover, the D7 symmetry of the archaeal proteasome poses an additional difficulty in defining unambiguously the alignment of the substrate-bound proteasome particles in EM images. We therefore decided to apply mass spectrometry (MS) in conjunction with EM to resolve the various ligand-bound forms.Non-covalent macromolecular complexes such as GroEL (18Rostom A.A. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4718-4719Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), proteasomes (19Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Loo J.A. Berhane B. Kaddis C.S. Wooding K.M. Xie Y. Kaufman S.L. Chernushevich I.V. J. Am. Soc.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) can survive the phase transition from the electrospray process in solution to the gas phase of the mass spectrometer. This survival, together with an understanding of the factors that influence the transmission of macromolecular ions, prompted us to develop an instrument optimized for high mass tandem experiments (22Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Because of the small difference in mass between ligand-bound and free forms of the proteasome it has not been possible to resolve the various substrate-bound forms of the core particle from mass spectra alone (20Loo J.A. Berhane B. Kaddis C.S. Wooding K.M. Xie Y. Kaufman S.L. Chernushevich I.V. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, using a tandem MS approach we have shown previously that it is possible to dissociate only a selected region of the mass spectrum, allowing us to resolve overlapping charge states that arise from polydispersity (23Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the presence of different substrate-bound forms of complexes (24McCammon M.G. Hernandez H. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5950-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We reasoned that such an approach would also allow us to resolve the various ligand-bound forms of the proteasome.To trap substrate molecules within the T. acidophilum proteasome we formed host-guest complexes between the 20S proteasome and either cytochrome c (Cyt c) (25Huffman H.A. Sadeghi M. Seemuller E. Baumeister W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8679-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or green fluorescent protein (GFP). To prevent degradation of the two substrates the proteasome was covalently inhibited. In both host-guest complexes the EM data indicate additional density within the three proteasome cavities. However, because particle-averaging methods were employed to generate these images, it is not possible to determine unambiguously whether the three chambers are occupied simultaneously. Accelerating selected ions formed from the proteasome-substrate complex through a gas-filled collision cell induced dissociation of α-subunits from the outer rings with concomitant loss of substrate molecules. By contrast, under the same conditions, substrate molecules protected within the catalytic chamber are retained, enabling us to define the stoichiometry and location of the sequestered Cyt c and GFP molecules.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubstrates, Inhibitors, Antibodies, and Chemicals—Horse heart ferricytochrome c (Cyt c) was purchased from Sigma. His6-GFP was obtained by recombinant high level expression of an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible plasmid (pTrc99A_His6-GFP) using the E. coli strain KY2266. His6-GFP was purified in a two-step purification scheme. A nickel-affinity chromatography step (His-Trap columns; GE Healthcare), followed by a size-exclusion chromatography step (HiLoad Superdex 200; GE Healthcare), yielded a homogeneous His6-GFP preparation. Purity of the proteins was confirmed by native and SDS-PAGE. The proteasome inhibitor clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone was purchased from CalBiochem. The monoclonal antibodies anti-Cyt c and anti-GFP were used at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:200, respectively, and were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.Preparation of Proteasome-Substrate Complexes—The T. acidophilum proteasome was isolated as described previously (26Zwickl P. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Formation of the host-guest proteasome complex was monitored using their spectroscopic signatures, 409 nm (Cyt c) and 395 nm (GFP) as previously described (25Huffman H.A. Sadeghi M. Seemuller E. Baumeister W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8679-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20S proteasomes (1 μm) were inhibited with clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (70 μm) for 30 min at 22 °C prior to mixing with substrate. Substrates (100 μm) were unfolded in 2.3 m guanidine HCl at 60 °C and mixed with the inhibited proteasome to give a final concentration of 2 m guanidine HCl. The proteasome-substrate solution was incubated at 60 °C for 30 min and then cooled rapidly on ice for 1 h. For GFP the mixture was diluted 10-fold and both complexes separated from unbound substrate by size exclusion chromatography. Control samples for single particle EM and MS were prepared as described above without heating of the substrate molecule prior to incubation with 20S proteasomes. For the MS control experiment excess ligand was not removed prior to analysis, whereas for the EM control unbound substrate was removed as described above. To distinguish between sequestered and externally bound substrate, SDS-PAGE followed by Western immunoassay was carried out with either anti-Cyt c or anti-GFP antibodies on denatured host-guest complexes, control complexes, and Cyt c or GFP. The antibodies reacted only with the individual Cyt c and GFP proteins and the denatured host-guest complexes (data not shown); however, no interaction was obtained with the EM control complexes.Cryo-electron Microscopy—For cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3 μl of protein solution containing host-guest complexes consisting of inhibited 20S proteasomes with either Cyt c or GFP were applied to glow-discharged lacy carbon grids, incubated for 1 min, washed twice with 3 μl of deionized water, and plunged into liquid ethane. Focal pairs (defocus values -2.5 and -3.5 μm, respectively) of ice-embedded 20S particles were recorded under low dose conditions on a Philips CM20 microscope operated at 160 kV and at a nominal magnification of ×46750 using a CCD camera (pixel size 14 μm, pixel size on the specimen level 0.3 nm). The protocols used for image processing are described in the supplemental information.Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization-MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments were conducted on a high mass Q-TOF-type instrument (22Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) adapted for a QSTAR XL platform (19Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immediately prior to MS, aliquots were buffer exchanged using Bio-Rad Biospin columns into 1 m ammonium acetate solution and stored on ice. Typically, 2 μl of solution was electrosprayed from gold-coated borosilicate capillaries prepared in-house as described (27Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The following experimental parameters were used: capillary voltage up to 1.2 kV, declustering potential 150 V, focusing potential 250 V, declustering potential-2 55 V, and collision energy up to 130 V, MCP 2350. In tandem MS argon was used as a collision gas. All spectra were calibrated externally by using a solution of cesium iodide (100 mg/ml). The assignment approach is described in detail in the supplemental information.RESULTSTo visualize bound substrate within 20S proteasomes, we imaged host-guest complexes using cryo-EM. 20S proteasomes appear well separated when negatively stained on continuous carbon but aggregate when embedded in vitreous ice, resulting in high particle density (Fig. 1). Therefore a defocus -2.5 μm was used for the first image of a focal pair in order to have enough contrast to align individual images. The side view averages obtained for the Cyt c and GFP host-guest complexes together with the two controls clearly display the catalytic chamber and the two antechambers. In the control samples all three chambers appear to be unoccupied. For both host-guest complexes, the contrast inside the particles is diminished, which we attribute to bound substrate. The difference images show density for substrates in all three cavities. The Cyt c difference image appears narrower than the corresponding GFP complex. Furthermore, although the densities in all three cavities are similar for GFP, for Cyt c the density in the catalytic chamber appears more elongated than the respective densities at the positions of the antechambers. These observations might reflect the presence of more than one Cyt c molecule in the central chamber. Because we cannot group the particle projections unambiguously, according to their different rotational states around the cylinder axis of the 20S particle, we cannot conclude whether the two antechambers and the catalytic chamber of the proteasome are de facto occupied simultaneously.To determine the number of bound substrate molecules we first recorded MS spectra of the bound proteasome complexes (Fig. 2). However, because of heterogeneity of binding and overlap of charge states we could not determine unambiguously the number of bound substrates using this method. We therefore decided to apply a tandem MS approach because the asymmetric dissociation that is a characteristic of this approach leads to highly charged monomer ions and relatively low charged “stripped” complexes (28Sobott F. McCammon M.G. Robinson C.V. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 230: 193-200Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Jurchen J.C. Williams E.R. J. Am. Chem.

Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently the peaks of the stripped complexes have a greater separation between the charge states than traditional MS experiments (23Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and such an approach has been used previously to separate overlapping charge states that arise from polydispersity or other heterogeneous complex systems (23Aquilina J.A. Benesch J.L. Bateman O.A. Slingsby C. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Nanoflow mass spectrum of Cyt c host-guest complex. The vertical lines represent calculated m/z values for different charge states of the following complexes (with their charge state at ∼10,800 indicated in parentheses): free proteasome in blue (64+), proteasome bound to one Cyt c molecule in orange (65+), proteasome with two Cyt c molecules in green (66+), and proteasome bound to three Cyt c molecules in pink (67+). These isotope models illustrate the difficulty in defining the number of bound substrates using MS. Similar results were obtained for GFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We first established optimal conditions for collisional activation and tandem MS of the free 20S proteasome. A single charge state (69+)was isolated from the complex using the quadrupole mass filter and subjected to collisions with argon to induce dissociation (Fig. 3A). Two series of charge states are observed at higher m/z values than 69+, assigned to stripped complexes having lost one and two α-subunits (Table 1). At low m/z values only α-subunits are dissociated from the proteasome, consistent with the architecture in which the two α7 ring structures are exposed and in accord with previous analysis of free 20S proteasomes (19Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Loo J.A. Berhane B. Kaddis C.S. Wooding K.M. Xie Y. Kaufman S.L. Chernushevich I.V. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Comparison of these tandem MS with those recorded for the host-guest complex formed with Cyt c reveals additional peaks, presumably due to the presence of substrate molecules within the proteasome assembly and also to formation of a dimer (65+) (Fig. 3B). To ensure that we could distinguish nonspecific binding from occupancy within cavities we mixed Cyt c with the 20S proteasome at a ratio of 10:1 without applying heat or denaturant to unfold substrate molecules and without removing excess ligand bound to the proteasome. The MS/MS spectrum recorded for this control solution when compared with that of the Cyt c host-guest complex shows a clear difference in peak width (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, at low m/z, the dissociation of both Cyt c (with an average charge state of 9+) and α-subunit ions is clearly observed for the mixed solution, whereas only α-subunits are observed for the corresponding host-guest complex. Charge states in electrospray mass spectra are dictated by the surface area of the protein or complex (32Kaltashov I.A. Mohimen A. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 5370-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For the proteasome this gives rise to a series of charges from 65+ to 75+. Binding of substrate proteins within the proteasome would not be expected to change the overall charge state of the complex because substrate molecules will be buried within the proteasome. This broadening of peaks and release of highly charged Cyt c is attributed to multiple copies of the substrate protein adhering to the outer surface of the proteasome. Conversely Cyt c molecules sequestered within the proteasome have no overall charge and are not therefore detected in tandem mass spectra. Because analogous results were obtained for the GFP host-guest complexes we conclude that there is no evidence for Cyt c or GFP adhering to the outer surfaces in agreement with results from antibody binding experiments.FIGURE 3Tandem MS of the free, Cyt c host-guest complex and Cyt c mixed with 20S proteasome from T. acidophilum. Free proteasome (A), proteasome/Cyt c host-guest complex (1:100 ratio) (B), and intact proteasome mixed with Cyt c (1:10 ratio) (C). Dissociation of the complex generates product ions from the loss of only the exposed α-subunits, consistent with the known architecture of the complex. Peaks between 12,000 and 16,000 m/z correspond to the loss of one α-subunit, and the series at 17,000-25,000 correspond to the loss of two α-subunits. At low m/z 1,000-2,000 series of peaks are assigned to individual α-subunits. The schematic shows the sequential dissociation pathway. The charge states that were isolated for tandem MS are labeled. The tandem MS of the mixed proteasome Cyt c sample (C) gives rise to stripping of Cyt c molecules, labeled by asterisk, while the broadening of the charge distributions is due to the unspecific binding of Cyt c molecules. The region between 12,000 and 15,000 m/z in panel C was magnified three times.

Open table in a new tab The peaks assigned to the free proteasome are broader than corresponding peaks in the MS/MS spectra of proteasome-Cyt c complexes (Fig. 3, A and B). This broadness of peaks is an indication of the extent to which water/buffer molecules are trapped within gas phase assemblies (27Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and allows us to conclude that a greater number are trapped within the internal cavities of the free 20S proteasome than in the Cyt c host-guest complex. Further comparison of the free and substrate-bound forms of the stripped proteasomes was complicated by the changing distribution of water/buffer molecules. The narrow peaks of the bound proteasome species indicate that a discrete number of substrates had replaced the trapped water/buffer molecules. We therefore compared the α-subunit region of the spectra recorded for the two host-guest complexes (Fig. 4). From this comparison we were able to identify peaks common to both spectra that arise from proteasomes without substrate molecules (A) -apo α13β14(inhibitor)14 and peaks corresponding to binding of three (C) one and two (B) Cyt c molecules. Similarly for the same region of spectra recorded for the GFP host-guest complex, the dominant charge state series corresponds to two GFP molecules (see supplemental material). None of the charge states corresponds to binding of three GFP molecules. From the α-subunit region of the spectra recorded for the two host-guest complexes we can conclude therefore that up to three Cyt c or up to two GFP molecules can bind within the proteasome.FIGURE 4Analysis of the Cyt c and GFP proteasome complexes.

By contrast, activating mutations in B-RAF are rare in ocular melanoma. This study aimed to determine the role of wild-type B-Raf (WTB-Raf) in uveal melanoma cell growth. We used cell lines derived from primary tumors of uveal melanoma to assess the role of WTB-Raf in cell proliferation and to characterize its upstream regulators and downstream effectors. Melanoma cell lines expressing WTB-Raf and WTRas grew with similar proliferation rates, showed constitutive activation of ERK1/2, and had similar levels of B-Raf expression and B-Raf kinase activity as melanoma cell lines expressing the activating V600E mutation (V600EB-Raf). They were equally as sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 for cell proliferation and transformation as V600EB-Raf cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of Raf-1 did not affect either ERK1/2 activation, whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of B-Raf reduced cell proliferation by up to 65% through the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation, irrespective of the mutational status of B-Raf. Pharmacological inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and siRNA-mediated depletion of PKA greatly reduced B-Raf activity, ERK1/2 activation, and cell proliferation in WTB-Raf cells, whereas it did not affect V600EB-Raf cells, demonstrating a key role of PKA in mediating WTB-Raf/ERK signaling for uveal melanoma cell growth. Moreover, inactivation or depletion of PKA did not affect Rap-1 activity, and Rap-1 depletion did not affect either B-Raf activity or ERK1/2 activation. This ruled out a role for Rap1 in the PKA-mediated B-Raf/ERK activation in WTB-Raf cells. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of cyclin D1 in mediating PKA/WTB-Raf signaling for cell proliferation.

Recently, activating point mutations in B-RAF were detected in a large scale screen for genes mutated in human cancer (1Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J.

About 80% of the B-Raf mutations seen in human cancers have the valine at position 600 in the activation segment substituted by a glutamic acid, which corresponds to the hot spot transversion T1799A mutation. Reconstitution experiments have shown that this mutation increases the activity of ectopically expressed B-Raf kinase and induces cell transformation (1Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A. Mould C. Parker A. Stevens C. Watt S.

Herlyn M. Tuveson D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5198-5202PubMed Google Scholar). This gain of function mutation in B-RAF (V600EB-Raf) is largely responsible for the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and is therefore for the acquisition of self-sufficiency in the growth signal in human cutaneous melanoma cells (1Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A.

Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. Davis N. Dicks E. Ewing R. Floyd Y. Gray K. Hall S. Hawes R. Hughes J. Kosmidou V. Menzies A.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 756-759PubMed Google Scholar). However, about 20% of cutaneous melanoma have no mutations in either B-RAF or RAS. This suggests that other molecular mechanisms activate the ERK signaling pathway. Consistent with this, the overexpression of B-Raf without gene amplification has been shown to be one of the mechanisms by which the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 stimulates cell growth in cutaneous melanoma cell lines expressing WTB-Raf and WTN-Ras (7Tanami H. Imoto I. Hirasawa A. Yuki Y. Sonoda I. Inoue J. Yasui K. Misawa-Furihata A. Kawakami Y. Inazawa J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8796-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, in melanoma cell lines that express normal levels of WTB-Raf, no constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and no implication of ERK1/2 in cell proliferation have been seen (8Karasarides M. Chiloeches A. Hayward R. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Scanlon I. Friedlos F. Ogilvie L. Hedley D. Martin J. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Marais R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6292-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The precise effect of WTB-Raf overexpression on the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 is still unknown, since reconstitution experiments showed that ectopically overexpressed WTB-Raf did not activate ERK1/2 in COS cells (9Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Cell. 2004; 116: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). During malignant transformation, cutaneous melanoma cells also acquire the ability to overexpress growth factor receptors and to express and secrete growth factors that together activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. It is therefore likely that autocrine growth factor activation loops are also involved in the acquisition of autonomous growth via the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in cutaneous melanoma (6Satyamoorthy K. Li G. Gerrero M.R. Brose M.S. Volpe P. Weber B.L. Van Belle P. Elder D.E. Herlyn M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 756-759PubMed Google Scholar).Unlike cutaneous melanoma, which has been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of ocular (uveal and conjunctival) melanoma. Uveal melanoma is the most common primary ocular neoplasm in adult humans in developed countries. Although cutaneous and uveal melanomas share similar histological features, mutations in the genes encoding the major signaling pathway proteins that control cell proliferation, including those affected in cutaneous melanoma, are infrequent in uveal melanoma (10Calipel A.

This is consistent with the differences in the epidemiological and cytogenetic aspects of cutaneous and uveal melanomas. We recently demonstrated a large increase in the activity of endogenous B-Raf kinase and a constitutive activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in the rare uveal melanoma cell lines that express V600EB-Raf (10Calipel A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42409-42418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). siRNA-mediated depletion of V600EB-Raf reduced ERK1/2 activation, cell proliferation, and transformation in uveal melanoma cell lines, showing that oncogenic V600EB-Raf activates a similar signaling pathway for tumorigenesis in both uveal and cutaneous melanomas (10Calipel A.

However, constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in the absence of mutations in RAS and B-RAF has been shown in primary tumors and cell lines of uveal melanoma, demonstrating a large difference between cutaneous and uveal melanomas (18Weber A. Hengge U.R. Urbanik D. Markwart A. Mirmohammadsaegh A. Reichel M.B. Wittekind C. Wiedemann P. Tannapfel A. Lab.

However, the intracellular signaling responsible for the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and the role of ERK1/2 in proliferation and transformation have not been characterized. It has been recently suggested that in the absence of mutations in RAS or B-RAF, the Ras/B-Raf signaling pathway could not be involved in uveal melanoma (20Kilic E. Bruggenwirth H.T. Verbiest M.M. Zwarthoff E.C. Mooy N.M. Luyten G.P. de Klein A. Melanoma Res. 2004; 14: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We showed in a recent study that the c-Kit/ERK1/2 autocrine loop was activated and participated in cell proliferation and transformation of uveal melanoma cell lines, showing the potential role of ERK1/2 in uveal melanoma tumorigenesis (21Lefevre G. Glotin A.L. Calipel A. Mouriaux F. Tran T. Kherrouche Z. Maurage C.A. Auclair C. Mascarelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31769-31779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the Ras and Raf signaling in controlling ERK1/2 activation and proliferation in the absence of RAS and B-RAF mutations has not been studied in uveal melanoma cells. Moreover, the heterogeneity of WTB-Raf uveal melanoma cell lines with respect to c-Kit expression and the response to glivec suggests a role for other growth factors/chemokines for cell proliferation. However, proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes is tightly controlled by exogenous growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 and hepatocyte growth factor, that exert their mitogenic activity, at least in part, through the activation of ERK1/2. Endothelins, adrenergic β2-receptor agonists such as isoproterenol and epinephrine, some prostaglandins, and various cAMP-elevating agents have also been shown together with growth factors to be growth-promoting agents of normal uveal melanocytes (22Hu D.N. Stjernschantz J. McCormick S.A. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Mouriaux F. Chahud F. Maurage C.A. Malecaze F. Labalette P. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This supports the suggestion that signaling pathways other than ERK1/2, such as cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), stimulate the proliferation of normal uveal melanocytes and possibly the autonomous growth of uveal melanoma cells. The high complexity of the cross-talk between ERK signaling and both the PKA-dependent and PKA-independent cAMP pathway in regulating cell proliferation suggests that the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the ERK1/2 signaling in uveal melanoma are more complex than previously suspected (24Dumaz N. Marais R. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3491-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M.

For the first time, we show that WTB-Raf-mediated ERK1/2 activation plays a major role in the proliferation and transformation of uveal melanocytes and that Raf-1 is not involved in this activation. We identified PKA as a main upstream activator of WTB-Raf for ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation, suggesting that the PKA/B-Raf pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic strategies against WTB-Raf expressing uveal melanoma.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—92.1, Mel270 (provided by Dr. M. Jager, University of Leiden, The Netherlands), OCM-1 (provided by Dr. F. Malecaze, Ophthalmology Department, CHU Toulouse, France), and TP31 (provided by Dr. S. Guerin, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Quebec, Canada) cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 2.5 μg/ml fungizone/amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), as previously described (10Calipel A.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified air/CO2 (19:1) atmosphere.Cell Proliferation Assay—We investigated cell proliferation by treating cells with specific pharmacological inhibitors and activators of signaling pathways. Stock solutions were made up in Me2SO with a final concentration of Me2SO in the culture media not exceeding 0.1%; this concentration has been shown to have no effect on melanoma cell proliferation. Cells were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/well. The plates were incubated for 3 days and then treated with 1) the MEK inhibitor, UO126 (Calbiochem); 2) the Raf inhibitor, Raf kinase inhibitor II/BAY43-9006 (Calbiochem); 3) the Ras farnesylation inhibitor, FPT III, and FTS (Calbiochem); 4) the PKA inhibitor, (Rp)-8-Br-cAMP-S (Calbiochem); 5) the activator of Epac, 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (Tocris Bioscience); and 6) the cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP (Calbiochem). The inhibitors were added both 2 h before induction of cell proliferation and at induction, and the activator was then added for the indicated times. The number of viable cells was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric method after 3 days of culture in either low serum conditions (0.5% FCS) or normal serum conditions (5% FCS). The percentage growth inhibition was calculated with respect to control Me2SO-treated cells.Cell Cycle Progression Analysis—We analyzed cell cycle progression by determining the DNA content of the cells with propidium iodide (PI). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol by incubation at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The cells were rehydrated in cold phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Roche Applied Science), and stained with 50 μg/ml PI by incubation at 4 °C for at least 15 min. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics ALTRA; Beckman Coulter).Transformation Assay—We analyzed cell transformation using a clonogenic assay by determining the ability of cells to form colonies in soft agar under anchorage-independent conditions. Melanoma cells were suspended in complete medium containing 0.3% agar and either pharmacological inhibitors or vehicle. The cells were then plated on a layer of 0.7% agar in complete medium in 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks. Pharmacological inhibitors or vehicle were added every 3 days during the culture period. Colonies in three randomly chosen 9-cm2 areas were counted on day 10 of the culture period.Genomic DNA Purification, PCR, and Mutation Screening—Genomic DNA was prepared from melanoma cell lines according to standard procedures, checked by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel, and quantified by spectrophotometry. We analyzed exons 1, 2, and 12 of the human HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS and exons 11 and 15 of B-Raf using specific PCR as previously described (10Calipel A. Lefevre G. Pouponnot C. Mouriaux F. Eychene A.

Sci. 1993; 34: 2203-2209PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR amplification was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 250 ng of genomic DNA, a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 IU of Patinium High Fidelity TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). DNA was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and was then amplified by 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The last cycle contained a 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The amplified products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified with the Qiagen MiniElute purification kit before sequencing (MWG Biotech).Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin, 20 kIU/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad kit. Cell lysates were mixed with 3× Laemmli buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. They were then resolved by SDS-PAGE (10 or 15% polyacrylamide gels), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon™; Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting, and probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against ERK1/2 (dilution 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), B-Raf (dilution 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), PTEN (dilution 1:250; BD Biosciences), Sprouty2 (dilution 1:500; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), Rap1 (dilution 1:600; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RKIP (dilution 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), the α catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAα cat), and the γ catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAγ cat) (dilution 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We used a polyclonal antibody directed against phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (dilution 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) to analyze the activation of these kinases during melanoma cell proliferation. Membranes were probed with a rat monoclonal antibody directed against α-tubulin (dilution 1:4000; Serotec) or with a goat antibody directed against actin (dilution 1:1000; Santa Cruz) to control for equal loading. The primary antibodies were tagged with specific secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane was placed against BioMax Light-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantification was carried out using the Eastman Kodak Co. image station 2000 MM and 1D3.6 software.Gene Silencing—Uveal melanoma cells were plated at 50–60% confluence in complete melanoma cell culture medium in 12-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then transiently transfected in Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and siRNA for either WTB-Raf (Eurogentec) (forward, 5′-GUG AAA UCU CGA UGG AGU GdTdT-3′; reverse, 5′-CAC UCC AUC GAG AUU UCA CdTdT-3′) targeting 1798 nucleotides downstream from the start codon or a scrambled sequence of WTB-Raf as a control (forward, 5′-AAA UGG GUG GAG CUC UUG AdTdT-3′; reverse, 5′-UCA AGA GCU CCA CCC AUU UdTdT-3′). The sequences targeting V600EB-Raf were 5′-GAG AAA UCU CGA UGG AGU G dTdT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAC UCC AUC GAG AUU UCU C dTdT-3′ (reverse), and those targeting Raf-1 were 5′-UGU GCG AAA UGG AAU GAG CdTdT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCU CAU UCC AUU UCG CAC AdTdT-3′ (reverse) (Eurogentec). As a control, a nonspecific siRNA duplex containing the same nucleotides but in irregular sequence (scrambled) was used (forward, 5′-AAA UGG GUG GAG CUC UUG AdTdT-3′; reverse, 5′-UCA AGA GCU CCA CCC AUU U dTdT-3′). Cells were also transiently transfected with a mixture of siRNAs for the PKAα cat and PKAγ cat (siRNA gene silencers; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and siRNAs for Rap1 (siRNA gene silencers; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 5 h, the Opti-MEM I medium was replaced by complete culture medium. We assessed the effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and WTB-Raf, V600EB-Raf, Raf-1, Rap1, and PKA down-regulation 72 h after transfection using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and Western blotting, as previously described (10Calipel A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42409-42418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).B-Raf Expression and B-Raf Kinase Activity—Uveal melanoma cell lines were cultured in overnight serum depletion medium. B-Raf was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μl of monoclonal B-Raf antibody (dilution 1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from extracts containing equal amounts of protein in lysis buffer supplemented with 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Test kinase buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm cold ATP, 75 mm magnesium chloride, and inactive MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) was added. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. A SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out, and the proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The phosphorylated B-Raf substrate was probed with anti-phospho-MEK1 antibodies. Antibody binding was visualized using a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection system and quantified using the Kodak image station 2000 MM and 1D3.6 software. The relative kinase activity was determined after quantifying the amount of immunoprecipitated B-Raf by Western blotting by probing the membrane with the B-Raf antibody, as described above using the 1D3.6 software (Kodak).PKA Activity—PKA activity was measured using a fluorescent Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) assay (PepTag nonradioactive cAMP-dependent protein kinase assay; Promega) on whole-cell extracts containing equal amounts of protein according to the supplier's instructions. Kemptide is a specific substrate of PKA. As kemptide is phosphorylated, it becomes negatively charged and migrates toward the anode on an agarose gel run at neutral pH. The phosphorylated Kemptide was visualized by UV light, and the fluorescent intensity of phosphorylated Kemptide was quantified spectrophotometrically at 570 nm.Determination of Rap1 Activation—A GST fusion protein of the Rap-1 binding domain of RalGDS (GST-RalGDS-RBD) was a gift from Dr. J. De Gunzburg (INSERM 528, Institut Curie, France). The cell lines were cultured in serum-depleted medium for 18 h and were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with the GST-RalGDS-RBD that had been previously coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads.

Importantly, GITR functions as a pivotal regulator of physiologic and pathologic immune responses by abrogating the suppressive effects of T regulatory cells and costimulating T effector cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GITR-triggered signal transduction pathways remain unclear. Interestingly, GITR-induced stimulation of TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) 5-deficient T cells resulted in decreased activation of nuclear factor κB as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, whereas activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase was less affected. Consistent with impaired signaling, costimulatory effects of GITR were diminished in TRAF5-/- T cells. In sum, our studies indicate that TRAF5 plays a crucial role in GITR-induced signaling pathways that augment T cell activation.

Although the importance of GITR in modulating immune responses has become apparent, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of GITR-induced signaling (for review, see Ref. 9Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1448-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).TRAFs are adapter proteins that transmit extracellular signals upon recruitment to the cytoplasmic domains of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) where they serve as foci for the induction of molecular events including nuclear factor κB(NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation (10Arch R.H.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 193-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). TRAF5 has been implicated in signaling pathways triggered by several TNFRs, where it can serve as a surrogate for TRAF2 as evidenced by the redundancy of the two TRAFs in TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation (12Tada K.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9803-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). TRAF5 has also been implicated in limiting the induction of T helper type 2 responses likely triggered by Ox40 (16So T. Salek-Ardakani S. Nakano H. Ware C.F. Croft M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4292-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Given the predominant function of TRAF2 and the mild phenotype of TRAF5-deficient mice, a clear role for TRAF5 in TNFR-induced signaling has yet to emerge.GITR activates all three subfamilies of MAPK and the canonical NF-κB pathway and promotes survival during early stages of T cell activation (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our recent results indicate that GITR employs TRAFs as signaling intermediates in a manner distinct from other TNFRs. Specifically, TRAF4, the orphan member of the TRAF family, enhances NF-κB activation triggered by GITR (17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 4J. M. Stockhausen, L. Paik, J. L. Yen, and R. H. Arch, manuscript in preparation. 4J. M. Stockhausen, L. Paik, J. L. Yen, and R. H. Arch, manuscript in preparation. Intriguingly, TRAF2 negatively regulates GITR-induced NF-κB activation, implying disparate functions of TRAF5 and TRAF2 downstream of GITR (9Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1448-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7875-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells did not reveal interactions between TRAF5 and the human homologue of GITR, termed activation-inducible TNFR, arguing that TRAF5 is not engaged in GITR-mediated signaling (20Kwon B. Yu K.Y. Ni J. Yu G.L. Jang I.K. Kim Y.J. Xing L. Liu D. Wang S.X. Kwon B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6056-6061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, more recently published data suggest a weak interaction between GITR and TRAF5 (21Hauer J. Puschner S. Ramakrishnan P. Simon U. Bongers M. Federle C. Engelmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2874-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Further, despite weak or transient interaction between GITR and TRAF2 as well as the apparent lack of interaction between GITR and TRAF4, both TRAFs are critical for regulating GITR-induced NF-κB activation (9Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1448-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol.

To define further the molecular mechanisms of GITR-induced signaling, we analyzed the impact of TRAF5 deficiency on signaling pathways and T cell activation after GITR cross-linking. These studies revealed that TRAF5 is crucial for activation of NF-κB and specific subsets of MAPK as well as T cell costimulation triggered by GITR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—To generate TRAF5-/- mice, a 6-kb KpnI-HindIII fragment containing exons I and II of TRAF5 was replaced with a neomycin resistance cassette placed in reverse transcriptional orientation in a targeting construct. R1 embryonic stem cells electroporated with this construct were selected and maintained as previously described (22Shiels H. Li X. Schumacker P.T. Maltepe E. Padrid P.A. Sperling A. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 679-C688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Multiple isolated clones were injected and chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories. The mutant allele was back-crossed for more than 10 generations to the DO11.10 and C57BL/6 backgrounds, respectively. DO11.10 mice expressing a T cell receptor transgene specific for a peptide of ovalbumin (OVA323-339) presented on I-Ad were a gift from Dr. K. Murphy (23Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University.Antibodies—Abs specific for phosphorylated and total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal anti-IκBα (BD Biosciences), polyclonal anti-TRAF5 (C19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-actin (C4; Chemicon International), and polyclonal secondary Abs coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Western blotting. Anti-CD3ϵ (145-2C11), anti-CD4 (H129.1), anti-CD25 (PC61), anti-CD28 (PV.1), and control rat IgG2a (R35-95) Abs were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-GITR Abs (BAF524, 108619) and control goat Ab were purchased from R+D Systems. For flow cytometry, Abs were conjugated directly to fluorescein isothiocyanate or phosphatidylethanolamine as indicated or biotinylated for detection with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or phycoerythrin-streptavidin (BD Biosciences).Cell Line, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. HEK293 cells were transfected with constant total amounts of DNA using the Effectene system (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression construct of TRAF5 used for these studies was generated by amplifying TRAF5 cDNA from the Matchmaker T cell cDNA library that is derived from a Kaplan T-lymphoma cell line and was purchased from Clontech (24Arch R.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 558-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers (sense ATG GCC ATG GCT CAT TCG GAG GAG CAA, antisense GGA TCC CTA CAG ATC CTC CAA GTC AGT) contained NcoI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, for subcloning into pcDNA3 (Stratagene). The final construct was sequenced to confirm the product. The induction of NF-κB activity was calculated by dividing the relative luciferase units from the reporter plasmid containing two canonical NF-κB sites with units from a similar reporter plasmid containing only a minimal promoter.Immunoblot Analysis—DO11.10 splenocytes were isolated and activated as described previously (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Activated DO11.10 splenocytes (5 × 106 cells) from TRAF5-/-, TRAF5+/-, or TRAF5+/+ littermates were treated with GITR-specific or control Ab (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for indicated times. MAPK and NF-κB activation were measured as described previously (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation was also quantified by analyzing the relative IκBα levels in cells. To normalize cellular levels of IκBα to actin or other protein loading controls, short exposures of Western blots of three independent experiments were scanned and analyzed using ImageJ software (version 1.34n, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health).Proliferation Assays and Cytokine Production—TRAF5-deficient or -sufficient cells (105) were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates and treated with the indicated concentrations of OVA323-339 or soluble anti-CD3 Ab and control, GITR-specific, or CD28-specific Abs (5 μg/ml). One μCi of [3H]thymidine (ICN Biomedical) per well was added for the last 8 h of culture. To measure IL-2 production, 106 splenocytes/well were stimulated with the indicated Abs (5 μg/ml) on 12-well plates coated with 0.1 μg/ml of anti-CD3. IL-2 levels in the supernatants were analyzed after 72 h using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol.RESULTSTRAF5 Does Not Influence Antigen-induced T Cell Activation or GITR Expression—To determine whether TRAF5 is required for GITR-induced molecular and cellular events, TRAF5-/- mice were generated by deleting exons I and II of the traf5 gene (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, TRAF5-/- mice were crossed to DO11.10 mice, and Southern blot analysis verified the genotypes of all mice (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of TRAF5 protein in homozygous mutants on the DO11.10 background (Fig. 1C). GITR surface levels on T cells increase in response to T cell receptor stimulation (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, decreased GITR expression caused by TRAF5 deficiency during primary antigenic stimulation could hamper activation of GITR-induced signaling events. However, flow cytometric analysis revealed similar surface levels of GITR and the T cell activation marker CD25 (IL-2 receptor α chain) (Fig. 2, A and B). These results and similar percentages of CD4+ T cells between TRAF5 genotypes argue that differences in GITR expression or secondary effects during antigenic T cell stimulation in the absence of distinct TNFR-induced signals do not confound TRAF5-dependent effects on GITR-induced signaling pathways.FIGURE 2TRAF5 deficiency does not cause inherent defects in T cell activation. Naïve DO11.10 splenocytes of the indicated genotypes were cultured with 0.3 μm OVA323-339 peptide for 3 days and rested for 18 h. A, GITR surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. The dotted line indicates isotype control staining. GITR expression is depicted by the gray shaded line for TRAF5-/- T cells and the dark line for TRAF5+/+ T cells. B, activated T cells were double stained for CD4 and CD25 prior to flow cytometric analysis. Similar expression patterns were observed in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TRAF5 Positively Regulates NF-κB Activation Triggered by GITR— We have previously shown that GITR employs TRAF2 as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation (19Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7875-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that other TRAFs are involved in activating this pathway downstream of GITR. IκBα is a crucial regulator of NF-κB activation (for review, see Refs. 25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 26Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar, 27Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 1999: RE1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IκBα degradation has been firmly established as a critical molecular event in the canonical NF-κB activation pathways and IκBα itself is a transcriptional target of NF-κB, we have used cellular IκBα levels as surrogate marker for NF-κB activation similar to our previous studies (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7875-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DO11.10 T cells were activated with cognate antigen (OVA323-339) to augment GITR expression. GITR cross-linking on activated DO11.10 T cells from TRAF5-/-, TRAF5+/+, and TRAF5+/- littermates revealed significantly diminished NF-κB activation, monitored by IκBα degradation, in the absence of TRAF5-/- (Fig. 3A). To quantify these results, the levels of IκBα were normalized to actin or other protein loading controls using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) after scanning short exposures of Western blots from three individual experiments. These analyses confirmed a statistically significant reduction of NF-κB activation in TRAF5-deficient T cells compared with TRAF5-sufficient controls (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Although TRAF5 heterozygous T cells exhibited a delay and reduced magnitude in IκBα degradation compared with control cells in some experiments, the differences to TRAF5+/+ cells were not significant. Interestingly, the lack of TRAF5 resulted in increased levels of IκBα in response to GITR-induced signaling, suggesting that TRAF5-independent pathways play also a role in regulating transcription or stability of IκBα. Taken together, these results argue that TRAF5 is a critical regulator of GITR-induced NF-κB activation but that one copy of TRAF5 in the genome is sufficient to control downstream signaling events.FIGURE 3TRAF5 is critical for GITR-induced NF-κB activation. A, naïve DO11.10 splenocytes from TRAF5+/+, TRAF5+/-, and TRAF5-/- littermates were activated with 0.3 μm OVA323-339 for 3 days and rested for 18 h. IκBα levels were measured by Western blot analysis of activated T cells stimulated with isotype control for 20 min (C) or GITR-specific Abs (5 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Membranes were subsequently stripped and probed for actin to determine loading of total protein. Shown is one representative of three independent experiments. B, to quantify the observed differences in NF-κB activation, relative IκBα levels in TRAF5+/+ (filled circles) and TRAF5-/- (open circles) T cells from three independent experiments were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Presented are the mean values and S.E. of the mean. C, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression constructs of the indicated proteins as well as NF-κB luciferase reporter constructs. Analysis of NF-κB activation was performed as previously described (17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate further the role of TRAF5 in GITR-induced NF-κB activation, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression constructs of GITR ligand and full-length GITR as well as TRAF5 similar to our published studies of TRAF4 and TRAF2 (17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7875-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous results, co-expression of GITR and GITR ligand triggered NF-κB activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). However, in contrast to TRAF2 and TRAF4, exogenous expression of TRAF5 was sufficient to activate NF-κB in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, GITR-induced NF-κB activation in the presence of exogenous TRAF5 was not altered beyond the level triggered by either stimulus alone. Decreasing TRAF5 expression by titrating the TRAF5 expression construct produced similar findings, suggesting that exogenous expression of TRAF5 causes maximal NF-κB activation that masks any augmentation of GITR-induced NF-κB activation (data not shown). As a control, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with GITR, GITR ligand, and TRAF4, which resulted in GITR-induced NF-κB activation as previously described (17Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In sum, these findings indicate that TRAFs fulfill distinct functions downstream of GITR and suggest distinct regulatory mechanisms for diverse TRAF-mediated events.TRAF5 Is Critical for GITR-induced Activation of p38 and ERK—Previously, we have observed that GITR cross-linking triggers activation of all three MAPK subsets (4Esparza E.M. Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether TRAF5 regulates GITR-triggered MAPK activation, MAPK phosphorylation was monitored upon GITR cross-linking on activated T cells. Similar to the canonical NF-κB pathway, GITR-induced activation of p38, ERK1, and ERK2 was significantly reduced in TRAF5-/- DO11.10 T cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, in contrast to p38 and ERK, JNK phosphorylation was less affected by TRAF5 levels, arguing that TRAF5-independent pathways mediate JNK activation triggered by GITR. The finding that TRAF5 is pivotal for GITR-induced activation of p38 and ERK suggests that these MAPKs along with NF-κB orchestrate GITR-induced T cell costimulation.FIGURE 4TRAF5 is engaged in GITR-induced activation of p38 and ERK, but not JNK. Western blot analysis of phosphorylated forms of MAPKs was performed from activated DO11.10 splenocytes from TRAF5-/-, TRAF5+/+, and TRAF5+/- littermates stimulated with control Ab for 20 min denoted (C) or GITR-specific Ab (5 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Membranes were subsequently stripped and probed for total MAPK protein levels.

Arch R.H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7869-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine the role of TRAF5 in GITR-induced cellular events, activated DO11.10 T cells were treated with suboptimal concentrations of OVA323-339 in the presence of control, GITR-, or CD28-specific Abs. Consistent with reduced activation of NF-κB, p38, and ERK, TRAF5 deficiency resulted in diminished GITR-induced enhancement of antigen-dependent T cell proliferation (Fig. 5A). Proliferation of T cells treated with isotype control Abs of irrelevant specificity or CD28-specific Abs as controls was unaffected by TRAF5 deficiency. However, TRAF5 deficiency did not completely ablate GITR-induced costimulation, suggesting residual TRAF5-independent effects downstream of GITR.FIGURE 5TRAF5-dependent signaling is critical for GITR-induced enhancement, T cell proliferation, and IL-2 production. A, antigen-activated DO11.10 T cells from TRAF5-/- (dashed lines) or TRAF5+/+ (solid lines) mice were re-stimulated with the indicated concentrations of OVA323-339 with control (circles), GITR-specific (squares), or CD28-specific (triangles) Abs (5 μg/ml). Proliferation was determined 48 h post re-stimulation. Error bars indicating S.D. of triplicate samples are mostly obscured by the symbols. Shown is one representative of three independent experiments.

Therefore, we analyzed the effects of TRAF5 on GITR-induced T cell proliferation by stimulating naïve splenocytes from TRAF5-/- or TRAF5+/+ C57BL/6 mice. Consistent with previous studies, TRAF5 deficiency did not significantly affect the number or percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or GITR surface expression (Ref. 13Nakano H. Sakon S. Koseki H.

However, the lack of TRAF5 resulted in diminished T cell proliferation induced by CD3- and GITR-specific Abs at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 5B). Stimulation of naïve DO11.10 T cells with their specific antigen in the presence of control or GITR-specific Abs yielded analogous results (data not shown). Consistent with GITR-induced NF-κB and MAPK activation not being completely abolished in TRAF5-/- T cells, GITR-induced costimulation was not eliminated entirely in TRAF5-/- T cells, suggesting that TRAF5-independent pathways contribute to the costimulatory effects of GITR. These observations highlight the importance of TRAF5 in GITR-induced costimulatory pathways but indicate that TRAF5-independent mechanisms can also play a role downstream of GITR in T cells.Besides augmenting proliferation, GITR-induced signaling enhances the production of IL-2, which is a cardinal feature of costimulation (3Ronchetti S.

To define the role of TRAF5 in this event, IL-2 levels in supernatants of TRAF5-/- and TRAF5+/+ splenocytes stimulated with CD3-specific Ab and control or GITR-specific Abs for 72 h were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Whereas TRAF5 deficiency did not alter IL-2 production caused by T cell receptor signaling alone, increased IL-2 levels induced by GITR in wild type cells were absent in TRAF5-/- cells (Fig. 5C). Given that IL-2 is an NF-κB-dependent gene product, this result confirms the importance of TRAF5 in activating NF-κB downstream of GITR. Taken together, our analyses revealed that TRAF5 is a pivotal signaling intermediate that regulates T cell costimulation induced by GITR.DISCUSSIONGITR functions as a costimulatory receptor augmenting T cell activation and rendering T effector cells refractory to suppression by T regulatory cells (2Tone M.

https://openalex.org/W2137509780,"T cell activation after contact with an antigen-presenting cell depends on the regulated assembly of the T cell receptor signaling complex, which involves the polarized assembly of a stable, raft-like macrodomain surrounding engaged T cell receptors. Here we show that the preformed reggie/flotillin caps present in resting T cells act as priming platforms for macrodomain assembly. Preformed reggie-1/flotillin-2 caps are exceptionally stable, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Upon T cell stimulation, signaling molecules are recruited to the stable reggie/flotillin caps. Importantly, a trans-negative reggie-1/flotillin-2 deletion mutant, which interferes with assembly of the preformed reggie/flotillin cap, impairs raft polarization and macrodomain formation after T cell activation. Accordingly, expression of the trans-negative reggie-1 mutant leads to the incorrect positioning of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav, resulting in defects in cytoskeletal reorganization. Thus, the preformed reggie/flotillin caps are stable priming platforms for the assembly of multiprotein complexes controlling actin reorganization during T cell activation."

AhR-containing murine hepatoma 1c1c7 cultures underwent apoptosis following exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) + cycloheximide (CHX). In contrast, Tao cells, an AhR-deficient variant of the 1c1c7 line, were refractory to this treatment. AhR sense/antisense transfection studies demonstrated that AhR contents influenced susceptibility to the pro-apoptotic effects of TNFα + CHX. 1c1c7 cells and all variants expressed comparable amounts of TNF receptor-1 and TRADD. However, no cell line expressed FADD, and consequently pro-caspase-8 was not activated. AhR content did not influence JNK and NF-κB activation. However, Bid and pro-caspase-9, -3, and -12 processing occurred only in AhR-containing cells. Analyses of cathepsin B and D activities in digitonin-permeabilized cultures and the monitoring of cathepsin B/D co-localization with Lamp-1 indicated that TNFα + CHX disrupted late endosomes/lysosomes in only AhR-containing cells. Stabilization of acidic organelles with 3-O-methylsphingomyelin inhibited TNFα + CHX-induced apoptosis. The cathepsin D inhibitor pepstatin A suppressed in vitro cleavage of Bid by 1c1c7 lysosomal extracts. It also delayed the induction of apoptosis and partially prevented Bid cleavage and the activation of pro-caspases-3/7 in cultures treated with TNFα + CHX. Similar suppressive effects occurred in cultures transfected with murine Bid antisense oligonucleotides. These studies showed that in cells where pro-caspase-8 is not activated, TNFα + CHX can initiate apoptosis through lysosomal disruption. Released proteases such as cathepsin D trigger the apoptotic program by activating Bid. Furthermore, in the absence of exogenous ligand, the AhR modulates lysosomal disruption/permeability.

The late endosomal/lysosomal network (referred to hereafter as “lysosomes”) consists of a series of dynamic and interactive acidic organelles. Lysosomes are involved in numerous intracellular processes, including plasma membrane and receptor recycling, cholesterol trafficking, antigen processing, autophagy, sphingolipid metabolism, and protein degradation (1Eskelinen E.-L.

The mechanism by which lysosomal proteases induce apoptosis is speculative. Papers have appeared suggesting that lysates of partially purified lysosomes are capable of directly activating pro-caspase-3 (22Ishisaka R. Utsumi T. Yabuki M. Kanno T. Furuno T. Inoue M. Utsumi K.

Given the ability of tBid, the cleavage product of Bid, to induce cytochrome c release, and the role of the latter in the activation of the apoptosome, Bid cleavage represents a viable mechanism by which lysosomal disruption could induce apoptosis. Indeed, in the case of TNFα, the pro-apoptotic effects of the cytokine are muted in cells treated with small molecule inhibitors of Bid (27Becattini B. Sareth S. Zhai D. Crowell K.J. Leone M. Reed J.C. Pellecchia M. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1107-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or having reduced Bid contents (19Werneburg N. Guicciardi M.E. Yin X.-M. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G436-G443Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, there is a confounder in most TNFα studies. Specifically, the cytokine generally activates pro-caspase-8, and caspase-8 also processes Bid to tBid. Hence, in principle, Bid could potentially be activated by TNFα exposure via multiple routes. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Over the past 3 decades the ligand-activated AhR has been documented to both positively and negatively regulate a variety of genes having dioxin-response elements in their promoters (28Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The products of such genes are involved in diverse functions such as phase I and II metabolism, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and development (28Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 29Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In addition, recent studies suggest that the AhR may have ligand-independent activities. Specifically, homologs of the mammalian AhR receptor lacking a ligand-binding domain have been implicated in the developmental regulation of lower eukaryotes (33Duncan D.M. Burgess E.A. Duncan I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1290-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Qin H. Powell-Coffman J.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, analyses of AhR-deficient cell lines suggest that AhR content, in the absence of exogenous ligands, regulates cell morphology (35Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol.

To date, only a handful of proteins have been implicated as regulators of lysosomal fragility (15Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J.

A. 2002; 99: 6286-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). One such protein may be the AhR. Specifically, we have demonstrated that the AhR-containing murine hepatoma cell line 1c1c7 undergoes apoptosis in photodynamic therapy (PDT) protocols employing the lysosomal sensitizer NPe6 (9Reiners Jr., J.J. Caruso J.A. Mathieu P. Chelladurai B. Yin X.-M. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 25Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Leeson B. Kessel D. Sloane B.F. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In PDT protocols, light-activated photosensitizers generate a pulse of singlet oxygen in the immediate vicinity of the sensitizer. In the case of 1c1c7 cells, NPe6 is exclusively sequestered in lysosomes (9Reiners Jr., J.J. Caruso J.A. Mathieu P. Chelladurai B. Yin X.-M. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Irradiation of NPe6-loaded cells causes lysosomal disruption and the chronologically ordered cleavage of Bid, release of cytochrome c, and activation of the apoptosome (9Reiners Jr., J.J. Caruso J.A. Mathieu P. Chelladurai B. Yin X.-M. Kessel D. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 934-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In contrast, although variants of the 1c1c7 line deficient in the AhR accumulated comparable levels of sensitizer in their acidic organelles, the latter were markedly resistant to lysosomal disruption following irradiation (25Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Leeson B. Kessel D. Sloane B.F. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because restoration of AhR expression restored susceptibility to PDT-induced acidic organelle disruption and apoptosis, it appeared that AhR content regulated lysosome fragility (25Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Leeson B. Kessel D. Sloane B.F. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study the effects of AhR content on TNFα-induced apoptosis were investigated in cells of the 1c1c7 lineage. In such cells AhR content regulated susceptibilities to both TNFα-induced apoptosis and acidic organelle disruption. Knock-down of cellular Bid contents with Bid antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated that the BH3 protein mediated a portion of the pro-apoptotic effects of TNFα. Most unexpectedly, pro-caspase-8 was not activated by TNFα because of the absence of the adapter protein FADD and did not contribute to Bid activation. Instead, lysosomally derived cathepsin D was partially responsible for Bid cleavage and a portion of the apoptotic program induced by TNFα. Lysosomal protease release also led to an activation of pro-caspase-12. Hence, the 1c1c7 model proved to be a unique system for investigating the contributions of non-caspase-8 pathways to TNFα-mediated Bid cleavage and apoptosis, and for identifying the AhR as a putative modifier of lysosomal permeability. Materials—The fluorescent molecule HO33342 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ac-DEVD-AMC was obtained from BD Biosciences. AMC, GW4869, pepstatin A, cathepsin D substrate MOCAc-GKPILFFRLK(2,4-dinitrophenol)-D-R-NH2, cathepsin B substrate Z-RR-AMC, and recombinant human TNFα were purchased from Calbiochem. Bicinchoninic acid, leupeptin, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. 3-O-Methylsphingomyelin was obtained from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cathepsin D inhibitors diazoacetyl-dl-2-aminohexanoic acid-methyl ester and acetyl pepstatin A were obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). CA-074, CA-074-Me, E-64, and E-64d were obtained from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Louisville, KY). Z-FA-fmk was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Recombinant murine Bid was from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Lipofectin was purchased from Invitrogen. HA14-1 was obtained from Ryan Scientific, Inc. (Isle of Palms, SC). Cell Culture and Viability Measurements—Murine hepatoma 1c1c7, Tao, TCMV, TAHR, WCMV, and WARV cells lines were obtained from J. Whitlock, Jr. (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The origins and characterizations of these cell lines have been described (Ref. 37Reiners Jr., J.J. Clift R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2502-2510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and references therein). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in α-minimal essential medium (αMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin. The TCMV, TAHR, WARV, and WCMV lines were maintained in medium that also contained 500 μg/ml geneticin. Viability was assessed by counting cells with a hemocytometer, and scoring both morphology and trypan blue permeability. In the TNFα and TNFα + CHX treatment groups, a small percentage of cells expressed apoptotic morphological features (i.e. shrunken, blebbed), at the time of analyses, without being trypan blue-permeable. These cells, if allowed additional time, eventually became trypan blue-permeable. Hence, they were scored as being nonviable. DEVDase Assay—Activations of procaspase-3 and -7 were analyzed by monitoring the generation of AMC from the caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC. The procedures used for the harvesting of cells and measurements of DEVDase activity have been described in detail (25Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Leeson B. Kessel D. Sloane B.F. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence over time were converted into picomoles of product by comparison to a standard curve made with AMC. DEVDase-specific activities are reported as nanomoles of product per min per mg of protein. The bicinchoninic acid assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard, was used to estimate protein concentrations. Western Blot Analyses—The reagents and procedures used for the preparation and processing of cell lysates, SDS-gel electrophoresis, and immunodetection of caspases-9 and -3 have been described in detail (25Caruso J.A. Mathieu P.A. Joiakim A. Leeson B. Kessel D. Sloane B.F. Reiners Jr., J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1016-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 was detected in a similar manner using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptide of murine caspase-12 as the primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). The pro- and processed forms of caspase-8 were detected with either a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 217-350 of human caspase-8 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 2-20 of human caspase-8 (Pharmingen). Immunofluorescence Detection of Lamp-1 and Cathepsins B and D— Cultures grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS solution for 30 min. Thereafter, the fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with methanol for 5 min on ice. After washing (three times with PBS), nonspecific autofluorescence was quenched with 100 mm glycine/PBS for 30 min. Subsequent washes were carried out three times with PBS, 0.1% saponin. The coverslips were washed and then incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.1% saponin for 1 h at 37 °C to block nonspecific immunoglobin binding. The coverslips were washed and incubated with a 1:20 dilution of rabbit anti-human cathepsin D antibody (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego), or a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse cathepsin B antibody (gift of Dr. B. Sloane, Wayne State University School of Medicine), and a 1:1000 dilution of the 1D4B rat anti-mouse Lamp-1 antibody (Development Studies Hybridoma Bank, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City) in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, secondary detection consisted of incubation with 1:200 dilutions of AlexaFluor 488 goat-anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 546 goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 500 nm HO33342/PBS. After a final wash, the coverslips were inverted onto a drop of SlowFade solution (Molecular Probes) on glass slides and sealed with acrylic nail polish. Digital images were captured using an Axioplan 2 Imaging Microscope equipped with an ApoTome optical sectioning device (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany). Quantitative analyses of fluorescent images were performed with MetaMorph software (version 6.3r2, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Within each experiment, time settings for every exposure were held constant, and contrast/brightness settings were unaltered. The images captured by Axio-vision were exported as TIFF format and then imported into MetaMorph as a dual channel image (i.e. channel A = red = Lamp-1 staining; channel B = green = cathepsin B/D staining). Individual cells were digitally isolated, and the inclusive threshold value was set at 50. Area measurements were used for co-localization analysis, which are expressed as percentage area of channel A above threshold that does not overlap channel B and vice versa. This measurement is independent of fluorescence intensity. For relative intensity measurements, the integrated value for channel A was divided by the integrated value for channel B. The integrated value represents the sum of all gray scale values for every pixel that is above threshold within a selected region. Digitonin Permeabilization—Cultures established in 35-mm dishes were fed with fresh medium 16-20 h prior to treatment. Cultures were treated with nothing, CHX, TNFα, or CHX + TNFα for 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 h at 37°C prior to being washed three times with release buffer (1 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 80 μm l-cysteine in Hanks' balanced salt solution). Washed cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 1 ml of release buffer with or without 0.1% Triton X-100 or varied concentrations of digitonin. After a 30-min incubation, culture fluids were removed and centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant fluids were removed and transferred to a new tube and stored on ice until used in enzymatic assays. Lactate Dehydrogenase and Cathepsin Assays—Supernatant fluids isolated from nontreated, digitonin-treated, and Triton X-100-treated cultures were diluted with release buffer, and triplicate 100 μl samples were dispensed into a 96-well plate. The lactate dehydrogenase assay was initiated by adding 100 μl of a buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.5 mm β-NADH. The oxidation of NADH was monitored for 20 min at 37 °C on a SpectraMAXPlus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) microplate reader at 340 nm. Supernatant fluids were diluted with release buffer to ensure linearity. For assay of cathepsin B/L activity, triplicate 100-μl samples were dispensed into a 96-well, black flat-bottomed, microfluor plate (Thermo Labsystems, Milford, MA). The assay was initiated by addition of 100 μl of a solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm Z-RR-AMC. The production of AMC was continuously monitored for 20 min at 37 °C on a SpectraMAX Gemini microplate reader employing excitation/emission wavelengths of 355/460 nm, respectively. Analyses performed in the presence of 5 μm CA-074 or 5 μm E-64 were used to estimate contributions of cathepsin B or cathepsins B + L, respectively, to Z-RR-AMC cleavage. Cathepsin B accounted for >95% of the released AMC. For assay of cathepsin D, triplicate 75-μl samples were dispensed into a 96-well, black flat-bottomed microfluor plate. The assay was initiated by addition of 25 μl of solution containing 160 mm sodium formate, pH 3.5, and 40 μm of the internally quenched substrate MOCAc-GKPILF-FRLK-(2,4-dinitrophenol)-D-R-NH2. Cleavage of the substrate Phe-Phe bond results in fluorescence that was monitored at 37 °C on a SpectraMAX Gemini microplate reader employing excitation/emission wavelengths of 328/393 nm, respectively. Analyses performed in the presence of 1 μm pepstatin A were used"
https://openalex.org/W2066741869,"A haploid genotype may be insufficient to support normal wild-type function. Such haplo-insufficiency has recently been documented for numerous tumour suppressor genes. p53 is a crucial tumour suppressor governing DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via its role as a stress-responsive transcription factor. p53 haplo-insufficiency has been observed in vivo with human familial cancer in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) and in mouse p53-knockout models of LFS. The increased tumorigenesis associated with loss of one p53 allele has been attributed to reduced p53-dependent stress responses. However, the underlying biochemical basis for such attenuated responses in p53+/- cells remains unclear. Here we have determined basal p53 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels, and compared the p53 stress response in p53+/+, p53+/- and p53-/- isogenic clones derived from HCT116 cells. Basal expression of p53 in p53+/- cells was 25% relative to p53+/+ cells, and this differential was maintained following oncogenic stress. This deficiency was manifested at both p53 mRNA and protein levels and resulted in attenuated p53 stress responses, in particular for p21waf1 upregulation and survivin downregulation, and reduced G1 arrest and apoptosis. These observations identify a molecular basis for wild-type p53 haplo-insufficiency, which may explain the attenuated tumour-suppressive phenotype observed in cells with a single wild-type p53 allele and in humans with LFS."
https://openalex.org/W2067219278,"Members of the platelet-derived growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (PDGF/VEGF) family have been implicated in a variety of functions in vertebrates, especially angiogenesis. Here we identify and characterize a PDGF/VEGF-like factor (named PVF-1) from the nematode C. elegans. We show that PVF-1 has biochemical properties similar to vertebrate PDGF/VEGF growth factors. More important, PVF-1 binds to the human receptors VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR) and is able to induce angiogenesis in two model systems derived from vertebrates. Our results highlight the widespread evolutionary conservation of this important class of growth factors and raise the possibility that C. elegans can provide a simple experimental system in which to investigate how these factors function."
https://openalex.org/W1989672793,"Some hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins, including core protein, deregulate the cell cycle of infected cells, thereby playing an important role in the viral pathogenesis of HCC. Thus far, there are only few studies that have deeply investigated in depth the effects of the HCV core protein expression on the progression through the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which the HCV core protein modulates cell proliferation, we have examined its effects on cell cycle in hepatocarcinoma cells. We show here that HCV core protein perturbs progression through both the G1/S and the G2/M phases, by modulating the expression and the activity of several cell cycle regulatory proteins. In particular, our data provided evidence that core-dependent deregulation of the G1/S phase and its related cyclin-CDK complexes depends upon the ERK1/2 pathway. On the other hand, the viral protein also increases the activity of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex via the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways. Moreover, we show that HCV core protein promotes nuclear import of cyclin B1, which is affected by the inhibition of both the p38 and the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) activities. The important role of p38 MAPK in regulating G2/M phase transition has been previously documented. It is becoming clear that PKR has an important role in regulating both the G1/S and the G2/M phase, in which it induces M phase arrest.

It is well known that patients with chronic disease have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1Bruix J. Boix L. Sala M. Llovet J.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 215-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Despite the research already done in this field, HCV-related mechanisms inducing cell transformation are still incompletely understood. Clinical observations indicate that the increased proliferation rate of hepatocytes is a major risk factor for the development of HCC (2Donato M.F. Arosio E. Del Ninno E. Ronchi G. Lampertico P. Morabito A. Balestrieri M.R. Colombo M. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Several in vivo studies on hepatic biopsies reported an imbalance between the G1 and the S phases of the cell cycle in liver cells obtained from chronic hepatitis C patients (3Werling K. Szentirmay Z. Szepesi A. Schaff Z. Szalay F. Szabo Z. Telegdy L. David K. Stotz G. Tulassay Z. Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 13: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Moreover, some studies revealed a G2/M dysfunction in hepatocarcinoma-derived cells (4Jeong S.J. Shin H.J. Kim S.J. Ha G.H. Cho B.I. Baek K.H. Kim C.M. Lee C.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8666-8673Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence has pointed to the possibility that HCV pathogenesis is due to virus-mediated disruption of several signal transduction pathways that normally regulate cell proliferation (5Tsuchihara K. Hijikata M. Fukuda K. Kurori T. Yamamoto N. Shimotohno K. Virology. 1999; 258: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Hayashi J. Aoki H. Kajino K. Moriyama M. Arakawa Y. Hino O.

However, the lack of appropriate cell culture systems and of suitable animal models that mimic viral propagation in humans has hampered the full understanding of HCV-dependent pathogenic mechanisms. The analysis of HCV gene product(s), responsible for the impairment of cell cycle regulation, has already suggested a main role of HCV core protein in regulating hepatocyte proliferation, making cells susceptible to cellular transformation (8Honda M. Kaneko S. Shimazaki T. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Ping L.H. Zhang H.C. Lemon S.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Cho J.W. Baek W.K. Suh S.I. Yang S.H.

Med. 2002; 196: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In fact, the ability of HCV core protein to accelerate the entry into S phase (8Honda M. Kaneko S. Shimazaki T. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Ping L.H. Zhang H.C. Lemon S.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and to up-regulate cyclin D1 and E expression has been reported in vitro (9Cho J.W. Baek W.K. Suh S.I. Yang S.H. Chang J. Sung Y.C. Suh M.H. Liver. 2001; 21: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell cycle progression is driven by the sequential activation of cyclin-CDK complexes (cyclin-dependent kinases, CDKs), which are in turn regulated by positive (cyclins) and negative (CDK inhibitory proteins) effectors (11Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Several cyclin complexes regulate transition through diverse phases of the cell cycle: cyclin D1, which is expressed in the early G1 phase and forms complexes with CDK4 or CDK6; cyclin E, which controls the G1/S transition and associates with CDK2; and the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, which instead predominantly directs DNA synthesis, whereas the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex activity regulates the entry and the exit from mitosis (13Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of CDKs are regulated by two classes of CDK inhibitory proteins: the INK4 proteins, which interact with CDK4 and CDK6 and act by preventing the formation of the cyclin-CDK dimers (14Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar), and the other class, which includes p21waf1/cip1, p27Kip1, and p57 of CDK inhibitors (15Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The regulation of cell cycle depends upon several factors such as growth factors, hormones, and cytokines. These induce the expression of cell cycle proteins, in turn leading to the activation of cascade of intracellular signaling molecules, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases involved in the regulation of a wide range of cellular responses such as cell proliferation (16Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Based on structural differences, they are divided into three multimer subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. It is well known that the activation of ERK1/2 as well as p38 and JNK pathways are involved in regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in several cell lines, including liver-derived cells (17Ito Y. Sasaki Y. Horimoto M. Wada S. Tanaka Y. Kasahara A. Ueki T. Hirano T. Yamamoto H. Fujimoto J. Okamoto E. Hayashi N. Hori M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 43107-43116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms by which MAPKs proteins induce hepatocyte proliferation (20Schwabe R.F. Bradham C.A. Uehara T. Hatano E. Bennett B.L. Schoonhoven R. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 824-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Huynh H. Do P.T. Nguyen T.H. Chow P. Tan P.H. Quach T.H. Van T. Soo K.C. Tran E. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 25: 1839-1847PubMed Google Scholar); however, their possible effects on all other cell cycle-related proteins are still under investigation. In an inducible expression system, the HCV core protein was shown to increase the activation of MAPK molecules (22Erhardt A. Hassan M. Heintges T. Haussinger D. Virology. 2002; 292: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, how and which of these MAPK enzymes is involved in HCV core-mediated deregulation of G1/S and/or G2/M progression is unknown. Interestingly enough, the protein kinase PKR has been implicated in the deregulation of mitosis driven by HCV core protein (23Alisi A. Mele R. Spaziani A. Tavolaro S. Palescandolo E. Balsano C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The best known activity of PKR is its relationship with the extent of viral infection and its association with double-stranded RNA activation, a property that has led to its designation as an “interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase.” By contrast, the molecular mechanisms by which PKR regulates cell cycle progression remain uncharacterized thus far. In this work, we have analyzed the changes in the pattern of cell cycle regulators in stable HCC cell lines expressing HCV core protein. Previously reported observations about HCV core protein effects on the cell cycle are incomplete and controversial (24Giambartolomei S. Covone F. Levrero M. Balsano C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We show here that in our model, the presence of the viral protein undoubtedly not only impairs the G1/S transition via ERK1/ERK2 but also increases the cyclin B1-CDK1 activity, causing a prolonged nuclear translocation of the mitotic complex in a p38 MAPK- and PKR-dependent manner. Cell Culture—The HepG2 cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Polyclonal cell lines were obtained by pooling individual clones of transfected and Geneticin-selected cells stable expressing the wild type genotype 1aWT core protein (23Alisi A. Mele R. Spaziani A. Tavolaro S. Palescandolo E. Balsano C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes to ∼90% confluence before being placed in 0.5% serum medium for 48 h. Serum-deprived cells were replated in complete medium containing 10% FBS and then cultured for different time points, as indicated in the figure legends. RNA Interference—The sequence of small interfering RNA (siRNA), selected for the sequence of HCV core cDNA (5′-GAUCGUUGGUGGAGUUUACUU-3′), purchased from MWG-Biotech, was transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Synthesis of DNA—For the DNA synthesis assay, cells were incubated with 10 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 82.4 Ci/mm) for 2 h, and then DNAs were precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, and finally, cells were lysed with 0.3 m NaOH for 1 h at the same temperature. Extracts were collected, and the measurement of thymidine incorporation by liquid scintillation spectrometry was performed. Data points were obtained in duplicate, and experiments were repeated at least three times. MAPK Inhibitor Treatment—Cells were pretreated with 10 μm SB203580 (Sigma), 30 μm PD98059 (Sigma), and 10 μm SP600125 (Sigma) for 30 min and restimulated with FBS at different times (0, 1, and 18 h). Then, cells were prepared for thymidine incorporation, for determining of CDK complex activity, and finally, for immunofluorescent staining. Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Cells were collected and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were measured using a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), treated with specific primary antibodies, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then, filters were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 and newly incubated with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sheets were visualized by ECL kits (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies directed against cell cycle proteins, p38, phospho-p38, and JNK were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-ERK1/2, anti-activated-ERK1/2, and anti-activated-JNK were purchased from Sigma. Determination of Cdk Complex Activity—All cell lysates were prepared using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. 500 μg of cell extract were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 6 μgof anti-cyclin D1, E, A, B1, CDK4, CDK2, or CDK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Agarose (Roche Applied Science) beads (26Alisi A. Leoni S. Piacentani A. Devirgiliis L. Conti Liver Int. 2003; 23: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The samples were resuspended in kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP, 3 μg of histone H1 (Roche Applied Science), or 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5-10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences 3,000 Ci/mm). After 25 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of Sample buffer, and the samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were plated onto coverslips, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 3 min. After the blocking reaction with 5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 25 °C, the cells were incubated with different primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal cyclin B1 antibody, rabbit polyclonal CDK1, and PKR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound primary antibodies were revealed due to the incubation period of 45 min at room temperature with two secondary antibodies (TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, Sigma). Finally, the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 1 min, washed three times, and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Statistical Analysis—Phosphorylated proteins were quantified by Phoretix 1D software. The values of the figures are means ± S.D. Data of cyclin-CDK complex activities were analyzed by Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. HCV Core Protein Up-regulates the Expression and the Activity of All Cyclin-CDK Complexes—To gather further insight into the growth properties of core-expressing cells, we have generated HepG2 polyclonal cell lines. These cells were used to characterize the expression and the activity of genes involved in regulating cell cycle progression. HepG2 polyclonal cells were synchronized by starvation for 48 h with 0.5% FBS, and a time course of DNA synthesis (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h) was performed. Cells expressing HCV core protein displayed a higher peak of DNA synthesis, between 12 and 18 h, when compared with the control (Fig. 1a). As can be seen, the extent of expression of HCV core protein, measured at 0, 18, and 30 h after serum starvation, was constant all along the study (Fig. 1b) in our experimental conditions. Rb or histone H1 kinase assays were next performed to directly analyze the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes involved in either G1/S or G2/M transitions at 0, 12, 18,and 24 h. Cell extracts were obtained from synchronized polyclonal HCV core and control cells. In our model, when HCV core protein was expressed, the activities of all cyclin-CDK complexes were increased but especially that of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, which peaked at 24 h (Fig. 1, c and d). Fig. 1d represents the data, expressed in -fold, and shows the data obtained by densitometric analysis of cyclin-CDK complexes in the presence of HCV core protein, expressed as -fold of activation. All this information, taken together, demonstrates that HCV core protein induces modifications of the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes and indicates that hepatoma cells, chronically expressing the HCV core protein, display a higher activity of all cyclin-CDK complexes. The ERK1/ERK2 Activity Correlates with HCV Core Protein Effects on Cell Growth—The three best characterized mammalian proteins are MAPKs, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK, all of which are known to play an important role in coordinating a variety of cellular processes including growth, differentiation, and in some cases, apoptosis. We then assessed whether the stable expression of HCV core protein is able to activate MAPK intracellular signaling pathways and whether this phenomenon correlates with the increased rate of DNA synthesis. Western blot analysis of activated forms of MAPKs demonstrated that their activity was increased, whereas their expression levels remained unchanged in HCV core-expressing cells (Fig. 2, a-c). To examine whether and which of the three different MAPK-dependent pathways is essential in promoting the HCV core-dependent pro-proliferative effects, we incubated the starved HCV core-expressing polyclones for 30 min with inhibitors of ERK1/2 (30 μm PD98059), of p38 MAPK (10 μm SB203580), or of JNK (10 μm SP600125). Furthermore, to establish that the effects on MAPKs were, indeed, HCV core protein-dependent, we transfected our polyclones with small inhibitor RNA specific for this protein (Fig. 2, a-c). MAPK inhibitor-pretreated cells and cells transfected with HCV core-specific small inhibitor RNA were restimulated with 10% FBS, and the incorporation of methyl-[3H]thymidine incorporation was then measured at different time points (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 h). As shown in Fig. 2, d and e, the pretreatment with the ERK1/ERK2 inhibitor caused an evident delay (from 12 to 24 h) in the rate of DNA synthesis rate, whereas no significant effect on HCV core-expressing cells was noted in the presence of p38 MAPK and JNK inhibitors. All of the inhibitory effects were lost after 18 h, probably due to a time-dependent decline in the activity of the MAPK inhibitors (Fig. 2, d and e). Finally, Fig. 2, d and e, show that the pro-proliferative effects were, indeed, due to the presence of the core protein. Our findings indicate that the effects of HCV core protein on DNA synthesis depend essentially on ERK1/ERK2. HCV Core Modulates G1/S and G2/M Transition via ERK1/ERK2 or p38 MAPK/JNK, Respectively—To better understand the functional role of each member of the MAPK family in HCV core-dependent cell cycle alterations, we investigated the impact of specific MAPK inhibition on the activity of cyclin-CDK complexes involved in the control of G1/S and G2/M transition. To this end, we performed Rb and histone H1 kinase assays in our HCV core-positive cells starved and pretreated with 30 μm PD98059, 10 μm SB203580, or 10 μm SP600125. The activity of cyclin-CDK complexes was examined 18 h after the serum replacement. As demonstrated by data shown in Fig. 3, the pretreatment of polyclones with PD98059 induced a significant down-regulation of the activity of the cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E/A-CDK2 complexes, which essentially regulate G1/S transition, whereas the activity of the mitotic complex cyclin B1-CDK1 was uninfluenced. Interestingly enough, the pretreatment with SB203580 and SP600125 does not influence the activity of the cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes but provokes a weak decrease of cyclin A-CDK2 and a significant down-regulation in the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex activities (Fig. 3, a and b). Our results confirm that Raf-1/MAPKs pathways could be necessary for HCV core protein induction of cell growth and highlight the fact that p38 MAPK and JNK pathways are relevant for HCV core-dependent effect on G2/M transition. HCV Core-dependent Cyclin B1-CDK1 Complex Delocalization Is Mediated by p38 MAPK—We further investigated whether HCV core could also affect the intracellular localization of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex. As shown in Fig. 4a, in the HCV core-expressing cells, 1 h after the serum replacement, the cyclin B1 expression was up-regulated and the protein was localized in the perinuclear region, whereas CDK1 was up-regulated and delocalized in the nucleus. After 18 h, a time at which cells accumulate in G2/M phase (data not shown; 15-20% of the HCV corepositive cells accumulated in G2/M phase at 18 h), HCV core induced a significant nuclear import of cyclin B1 as well. On the other hand, in the control cells, at the same time point (18 h), cyclin B1 and CDK1 were weakly visible in the perinuclear region. To understand whether MAPKs were involved in cyclin B1-CDK1 complex delocalization, we performed an immunofluorescent assay after pretreatment of cells with all the three MAPK inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4b, only the p38 inhibitor impairs nuclear import of cyclin B1 and CDK1. Finally, we asked whether this phenomenon could be related to a direct interaction between cyclin B1 and p38 MAPK in HCV corepositive HepG2 cells. With this aim, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay with an anti-cyclin B1 rabbit polyclonal antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were then blotted with an anti-p38 MAPK antibody. As shown in Fig. 4c, cyclin B1 was able to coimmunoprecipitate with p38. Finally, Fig. 4d shows the perinuclear co-localization of p38 and cyclin B1, demonstrated by confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent double labeling assay. Thus, our data suggest that HCV core protein could influence the correct exit from mitosis, inducing a significant and prolonged nuclear import of cyclin B1-CDK1 complex, which is directly p38 MAPK-related. P38 and PKR Cooperate to Induce Nuclear Import of cyclin B1-CDK1 Complex in HCV Core-positive Cells—It has been recently demonstrated that PKR interacts with and activates a member of the MAPKs family, p38 MAPK (27Silva A.M. Whitmore M. Xu Z. Li X. Jiang Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37670-37676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, we have already highlighted the role of PKR in determining a G2/M accumulation in cells stably expressing HCV core protein (23Alisi A. Mele R. Spaziani A. Tavolaro S. Palescandolo E. Balsano C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the potential role of PKR in HCV core-related nuclear import of cyclin B1 and the relationship of this kinase with p38 MAPK. With this aim, we have transfected a dominant-negative plasmid (pcDNA-K296R) of the catalytic domain of PKR (23Alisi A. Mele R. Spaziani A. Tavolaro S. Palescandolo E. Balsano C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) into our HCV core-positive cells, and the localization of cyclin B1 and CDK1 was examined by immunofluorescence. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the lack of the activity of PKR hampers the nuclear translocation of cyclin B1 and CDK1. These results clearly indicate that PKR plays an important role in regulating the cellular distribution of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex in the presence of HCV core protein. Considering that both PKR and p38 MAPK seem to be implicated in HCV corerelated nuclear localization of cyclin B1, two additional sets of experiments were performed. First, we investigated to see whether a relationship between p38 MAPK and PKR does exist. As shown in Fig. 6a, PKR strongly interacts with p38 MAPK in HCV core-expressing cells. Second, we asked whether cyclin B1 interacts with PKR, as well as with p38 MAPK (Fig. 4c). The analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained with an anti-cyclin B1 antibody clearly demonstrates the existence of a direct interaction between cyclin B1, PKR, and p38 MAPK in HCV core-positive cells (Fig. 6b). Interestingly enough, the activity of p38 MAPK seems to be necessary for this interaction, which disappeared when our polyclones were pretreated with an inhibitor of p38 activity (shown in Fig. 6b). The co-localization between cyclin B1 and PKR was demonstrated by confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 6c).FIGURE 6p38 MAPK, PKR, and cyclin B1 interaction in HCV core polyclones. a, the extracts of the control (HA) and core-expressing (Core) cells, after 18 h from the serum replacement, were immunoprecipitated (ip) with an anti-PKR rabbit polyclonal antibody and revealed with an anti-p38 MAPK antibody. α-Actin of the supernatants in the lower panel was used as control.

Fujie H. Shintani Y. Yotsuyanagi H. Tsutsumi T. Ishibashi K. Matsuura Y. Kimura S. Miyamura T. Koike K. Nat. Med. 1998; 9: 1065-1067Crossref Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been shown to induce hepatic adenomas in transgenic mice. These adenomas typically progress morphologically and biochemically to full malignant HCC (29Alisi A. Giambartolomei S. Cupelli F. Merlo P. Fontemaggi G. Spaziani A. Balsano C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this report, we evaluated the relationships between stable HCV core protein expression and its impact on the different cyclin-CDK complex activities involved in the control of cell growth. We show that HCV core protein expression deeply influences cell proliferation mainly by modulating MAPK pathways: ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK. First, we demonstrated that HCV core protein increases the number of cells that are engaged in DNA synthesis. In particular, the viral protein causes an increased activity of the cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes involved in the early S and G1/S transition phase. Moreover, it can also up-regulate the cyclin A-CDK2/CDK1 complex activity, which regulates both the late S and the G2/M phases. Finally, the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex activity was clearly increased in core-expressing HepG2 cells and, of most significance, the mitotic complex delocalized into the nucleus in presence of the viral protein. This leads to a deregulation of the mitotic phase; in fact, 15-20% of cells accumulate in G2/M phase (data not shown). To be protected from a variety of different types of stress, eukaryotic cells have developed a system of checkpoints that delay progression to the next phase of the cell cycle. A critical evolutionary conserved checkpoint exists at the boundary of the G2 phase of the cell cycle and mitosis. Chromosome instability is known as the most common form of genetic instability in human malignancies, which can be caused by aberrant chromosomal segregation during mitosis. Cells with persistent chromosomal instability may undergo cell death, but some of them could survive and become malignant clones bearing defective genomic information. These cells can be characterized by gains or losses of whole chromosomes along with eccentric cytologic alterations such as nuclear pleomorphism and multi-/giant-nucleated cells (30Bharadwaj R. Yu H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The formation of multinucleated cells was also found to occur in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I Tax-expressing cells (31Jin D.Y. Spencer F. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) as well as in Epstein-Barr virus EBNA3C-expressing cells (32Parker G.A. Touitou R. Allday M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these cells originate from viral interference with the mitotic checkpoint. Interestingly enough, E6 and E7 oncoproteins from the high risk type of human papillomavirus actively induce numerical and structural centrosome abnormalities, increasing the propensity for chromosome missegregation (33Duensing S. Munger K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7075-7082PubMed Google Scholar). Centrosome abnormalities, such as excess number or variability in shape and size, have been found in human cancer of multiple origins, including HCC (34D'Assoro A.B. Lingue W.L. Salisbury J.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6146-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Ezaki T. Yukaya H. Ogawa Y. Chang Y.C. Nagasue N. Cancer. 1988; 61: 1880-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All these observations suggest that chromosomal aberrations resulting from aberrant progression of mitosis might be an important step during multistage carcinogenesis. In our model, the deregulation of mitosis is linked to the phosphorylation state of PKR (23Alisi A. Mele R. Spaziani A. Tavolaro S. Palescandolo E. Balsano C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that, in turn, seems to be related to HCV core-dependent up-regulation of p38 MAPK activity. The presence of activated PKR in association with pathology is particularly intriguing since its activation is typically associated with HCV pathology (36Talloczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin H.I. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Originally described in the early cellular response to viral infection, PKR activation is now widely recognized as a component of stress-activated pathways that mobilize somatic cell death programs (37Iordanov M.S. Paranjape J.M. Zhou A. Wong J. Williams B.R. Meurs E.F. Silverman R.H. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). PKR is an interferon-induced serine-threonine protein kinase that is best known for its activation, by auto- or trans-phosphorylation, upon binding to double-stranded RNA. PKR is also activated by a number of other signals that induce cell stress, including tumor necrosis factor, heat shock, and trophic factor withdrawal via molecular mechanisms that are not yet clear. Once activated, PKR is known to phosphorylate the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 that leads to an inhibition of protein synthesis and eventually to cell death. PKR also mediates cell death programs triggered by upstream activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways (27Silva A.M. Whitmore M. Xu Z. Li X. Jiang Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37670-37676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), both of which have been implicated in the development of HCC in HCV-positive patients. Since PKR has been shown to promote and participate in cell-cycle arrest at G0/G1 and G2/M (38Cuddihy A.R. Wong A.H. Tam N.W. Li S. Koromilas A.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2690-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 39Dagon Y. Dovrat S. Vilchik S. Hacohen D. Shlomo G. Sredni B. Salzberg S. Nir U. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8045-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it can be argued that a relationship between p38 signal transduction, PKR activation, and cell cycle deregulation in HCC does exist. Accordingly, our findings clearly indicated that p38 MAPK, PKR, and cyclin B1 physically interact, and this interaction seems to be essential in determining the effect of HCV core protein in mitosis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HCV core protein expression deeply influences cell cycle progression, causing changes during both the S and the M phases. We have also discovered that the p38 MAPK/PKR-dependent pathway works as a downstream effector of HCV core protein and as a key mediator of its effects on mitosis. Although the role of the mitotic checkpoint and its deregulation during carcinogenesis in humans is only starting to emerge, the data presented here emphasize its importance in liver cancer development."

The objective of the present study was to characterize the electrophysiologic actions of P2X4 receptors in cardiac myocytes and to determine whether they are involved in mediating the effect of extracellular ATP. Membrane currents under voltage clamp were determined in myocytes from both wild-type (WT) and P2X4 receptor-overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. The P2X agonist 2-meSATP induced an inward current at -100 mV that was greater in magnitude (2-fold) in TG than in WT ventricular cells. In the presence of the P2X4 receptor-selective allosteric enhancer ivermectin (3 microM), the 2-meSATP-stimulated current increased significantly in both WT and TG ventricular cells, consistent with an important role of P2X4 receptors in mediating the ATP current not only in TG but also WT myocytes. That the current in both WT and TG cells showed similar voltage-dependence and reverse potential (approximately 0 mV) further suggests a role for this receptor in the normal electrophysiological action of ATP in WT murine cardiac myocytes. The P2X antagonist suramin was only able to block partially the 2-meSATP-stimulated current in WT cells, implying that both P2X4 receptor and another yet-to-be-identified P2X receptor mediate this current."

https://openalex.org/W2058125945,"The small GTPase Rab2 is required for membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex. Rab2 associates with pre-Golgi intermediates (also termed vesicular tubular clusters; VTCs) that sort cargo to the anterograde pathway from recycling proteins retrieved to the ER. Our previous studies have shown that Rab2 stimulates atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (aPKCι/λ) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) recruitment to VTCs. Both aPKCι/λ and GAPDH bind directly to Rab2 and aPKCι/λ and GAPDH interact. Based on the reports demonstrating aPKCι-Src interaction and Src activity in the retrograde pathway (Golgi-ER), studies were initiated to learn whether Rab2 also promoted Src recruitment to VTCs. Using a quantitative membrane binding assay, we found that Rab2-stimulated Src membrane association in a dose-dependent manner. The recruited Src binds to aPKCι/λ and GAPDH on the membrane; however, Src does not interact with Rab2. The membrane-associated Src tyrosine phosphorylates aPKCι/λ on the VTC. To determine the consequence of aPKCι/λ tyrosine phosphorylation, the membrane binding assay was supplemented with the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo(3,4-d)pyrimidine (PP2). Although Rab2, Src, and GAPDH recruitment was not affected, the Rab2-PP2-treated membranes contained a negligible amount of aPKCι/λ. Since Rab2 requires aPKCι/λ for the downstream recruitment of β-coat protein (β-COP) to VTCs, the Rab2-PP2-treated membranes were evaluated for the presence of β-COP. Like aPKCι/λ, the membranes contained a negligible amount of β-COP that was reflected by the drastic reduction in Rab2-dependent vesicle formation. These data suggest that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ facilitates aPKCι/λ association with Rab2-Src-GAPDH on VTCs, which is ultimately necessary for the downstream recruitment of β-COP and release of Rab2-mediated retrograde-directed vesicles.

Sci. 2004; 25: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the regulatory domain sequence of the aPKCs is divergent from the other PKC members, and this divergence has been exploited to identify unique aPKC-interacting molecules (16Poole A. Pula G. Hers I. Crosby D. Jones M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Diaz-Meco M. Lozano J. Munico M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L.

In that regard, activated Src has been reported to bind directly with aPKCι through the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and residues 98–114 in the aPKC regulatory domain (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Src is a ubiquitous member of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family that is involved in signal transduction events that regulate cell growth, survival, motility, and differentiation (21Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 12: 513-609Crossref Scopus (2128) Google Scholar, 22Roskoski R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 324: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylates aPKCι on multiple tyrosine residues located in both the regulatory and the catalytic domain, which influences aPKCι/λ association with specific binding proteins (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also implicated Src activity in facilitating KDEL-receptor recycling between the ER and Golgi complex and thereby suggest a potential role for Src in retrograde transport (23Bard F. Mazelin L. Pechoux-Longin C. Malhotra V. Jurdic P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46601-46606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fact that Rab2-aPKCι/λ directly interact and aPKCι associates with Src suggested the possibility that Src was a Rab2 downstream effector. We employed a quantitative binding assay that measures Rab2-dependent recruitment of soluble components to membranes and found that Rab2 promoted Src membrane association. Unlike aPKCι/λ and GAPDH, Src does not directly interact with Rab2. However, Src does bind to both aPKCι/λ and GAPDH. The Rab2-recruited Src is activated and tyrosine phosphorylates the membrane-associated aPKCι/λ. Importantly, Src-mediated phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ is essential for interaction with Rab2-GAPDH-Src on the VTC and for the downstream recruitment of β-COP. These combined results suggest that Src kinase activity is required for Rab2-mediated retrograde vesicle formation from the VTC. Quantitative Membrane Binding Assay—Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol and then broken with 10 passes through a cell homogenizer using a 7.992-mm tungsten carbide ball (8-μm clearance) (Isobiotech, Heidelberg, Germany). The broken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and recentrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall Discovery M120 ultracentrifuge. The membrane pellet was washed with 1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) for 15 min on ice to remove peripherally associated proteins and then recentrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol and employed in the binding reaction, as described previously (24Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture that contained 27.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.75 mm MgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. Preimmune serum, affinity-purified anti-Rab2 antibody, affinity column-purified recombinant His6-aPKCι/λ (100 ng), or Rab2 was added at the concentrations indicated under “Results,” and the reaction mix was incubated on ice for 10 min. Rat liver cytosol (50 μg of total protein) and 2.0 μm GTPγS were then added, and the reactions were shifted to 32 °C and incubated for 12 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain a pellet (P1). For some experiments, the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to recover released vesicles (P2). P1 and P2 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) that contained 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated with a monoclonal antibody to Src (GD11) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), a monoclonal antibody to aPKCι/λ (BD Biosciences), a polyclonal antibody to phospho-Src (Tyr-416) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100) (Cell Signaling), or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to β-COP (EAGE) (24Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody, developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences), and then quantified by densitometry. Immunoprecipitation—NRK cells (4 × 106) were incubated without or with 10 μm PP2 or 10 μm PP3 (EMB Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA) for 12 h, lysed in 50 mm TBS (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was precleared with protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 12 h at 4 °C with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody or with preimmune serum and protein G plus/protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, washed 3× with TBS, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm NaCl, boiled in sample buffer, and then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody to aPKCι/λ (BD Biosciences), a monoclonal antibody to Src (Upstate Biotechnology), and a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Chemicon), washed, further incubated with a HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse antibody, and then developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). His6-GST Pull-down—The transient expression of His6-PKCι/λ was performed as described (4Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 13Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The supernatant that contained overexpressed His6-tagged PKCι/λ was applied to a 2-ml column of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.8 mm imidazole). The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 8 mm imidazole. The tagged protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 80 mm imidazole. His6-aPKCι/λ (2.5 μg) was preincubated with 20 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 1 h at room temperature in buffer A, and then 1 μg of recombinant Src (Upstate Biotechnology) was added and the sample was incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed 4× with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The GST pull-down experiments were performed, as described previously (14Tisdale E.J. Kelly C. Artalejo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54046-54052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) that contained the recombinant plasmids GST-GAPDH, GST-Rab2, or GST-Rab1 were grown at 37 °C to 0.6 A600 nm units and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyrano-side for 3 h at 37°C. The liquid culture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in cold TBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and then the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of TBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione. The GST-tagged proteins (2.5 μg) were preincubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 μm GTPγS, and then 1 μg of recombinant Src (Upstate Biotechnology) was added alone or in combination with rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma), and His6PKCι/λ (1 μg) and then incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed 4× with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked as above, and the membrane was probed with the antibodies indicated previously, washed, and developed, as described above. Analysis of Transport in Vitro—NRK cells were infected for 4 h with the temperature-sensitive VSV strain ts045 and then biosynthetically radiolabeled with 100 μCi of Expre35S35S (specific activity, 1,175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) to maintain the VSV-G mutant protein in the ER. The cells were then perforated by swelling and scraping and employed in the ER to cis/medial Golgi transport assay, as described (25Beckers C.J. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1989; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Transport reactions were performed in a final volume of 40 μl in a buffer that contains 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 75 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-acetylglucosamine, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 IU of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase), and 5 μl of semi-intact cells (∼5 × 107 cells/ml, ∼25–30 μg of total protein) resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 90 mm KOAc (pH 7.2), and 5 μl of rat liver cytosol (20 mg/ml). The reactions were supplemented with the indicated concentration of affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody or preimmune serum for 20 min on ice and then incubated at 32 °C for a total of 60 min. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, solubilized in buffer, and digested with endoglycosidase H. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fraction of ts045 VSV-G protein was processed to the endoglycosidase H-resistant forms quantitated by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Src Kinase Assay—Purified recombinant human Src (100 ng) (Upstate Biotechnology) and was incubated with purified recombinant His6-aPKCι/λ (0.5 μg) (9Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 15 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of 5 μm PP2 or 5 μm PP3. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× sample buffer, and then the sample was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Rab2 Promotes Src Binding to NRK Membranes—Based on the observations that Rab2 directly interacts with aPKCι/λ (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and aPKCι/λ associates with c-Src in PC12 cells (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a quantitative membrane binding assay was employed to determine whether Rab2 also promoted Src membrane association. Salt-washed NRK cell membranes were incubated with rat liver cytosol and GTPγS, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of purified recombinant Rab2. The control membranes and membranes containing Rab2-recruited proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1, Rab2-stimulated Src binding to NRK cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner. The amount of membrane-bound Src increased ∼3-fold when incubated with 50 ng of Rab2. The membrane-associated Src is activated since the recruited form is detected on the Western blot by antibody specific to anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-416) (Fig. 1). The Rab2-dependent Src recruitment to membranes was prevented when the membrane binding assay was supplemented with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Rab2-dependent recruitment of aPKCι/λ and GAPDH to membranes was inhibited by the addition of the anti-Rab2 antibody to the assay (Fig. 2B). The Rab2 antibody is a potent inhibitor of VSV-G transport from the ER to the Golgi complex when introduced into an in vitro quantitative transport assay (Fig. 3A) and was previously reported to co-immunoprecipitate Rab2, aPKCι/λ, and GAPDH from HeLa cell detergent lysate (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Tisdale E.J. Kelly C. Artalejo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54046-54052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When the immunoprecipitation experiment was performed in this study, Src was found present in the immune complex with Rab2, GAPDH, and aPKCι/λ, whereas no interaction of these four proteins was detected with preimmune serum as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Src associates with aPKCι/λ and GAPDH. A, Ts045 VSV-infected semi-intact NRK cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody for 20 min on ice in a transport mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were transferred to 32 °C for a total of 60 min, placed on ice, and then processed as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The fraction of VSV-G processed to the endoglycosidase H (endo H)-resistant forms (% of Total) was determined after analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography and quantitation by densitometry. B, NRK cell lysate was incubated with preimmune serum (PI) or with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody (Ab) and protein G plus/protein A-agarose for 12 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The blot was probed with the indicated primary antibodies, washed, incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then developed with ECL. C, GST, GST-Rab2, GST-Rab1, GST-GAPDH, or His6-aPKCι/λ (2.5μg) were preincubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B or Ni2+-NTA-agarose for 1 h at room temperature, and then 1 μg of purified recombinant Src was added, and the sample was incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Additionally, GST-Rab2 was incubated with rabbit muscle GAPDH, His6-PKCι/λ, and Src as above. The beads were washed extensively as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The beads with bound proteins were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with the indicated primary antibodies, washed, incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further explore the potential interaction of Src with Rab2-aPKCι/λ-GAPDH, a His6/GST pull-down experiment was performed. The bacterial produced His6/GST-tagged fusion proteins shown in Fig. 3C were prebound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose 4B and then incubated with purified Src. As expected based on a previous report, Src bound to aPKCι/λ (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Src also interacted with GAPDH. In contrast, Src did not bind directly to Rab2. However, GST-Rab2 binds Src when co-incubated with His6-aPKCι/λ and rabbit muscle GAPDH (Fig. 3C). The interaction of Src with Rab2-aPKCι/λ-GAPDH is specific since there is no binding to Rab1. Like Rab2, Rab1 is required for membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway (4Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These combined results indicate that Src indirectly interacts with Rab2 through co-association with aPKCι/λ and GAPDH. Src-dependent aPKCι/λ Tyrosine Phosphorylation Is Required for aPKCι/λ Membrane Association—A variety of cellular proteins have been reported to be Src kinase substrates (26Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). In fact, PC12 cells treated with nerve growth factor results in Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of aPKCι (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of Src to phosphorylate purified recombinant His6-aPKCι/λ was confirmed in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4A). As we anticipated, His6-aPKCι/λ was efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated by Src, whereas the Src-dependent activity was inhibited when the assay was supplemented with the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the inactive form and negative control for Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP3 had no effect on Src-aPKCι/λ phosphorylation. After learning that His6-aPKCι/λ was a Src substrate, and therefore, the His tag did not influence Src modification of the recombinant protein, we then determined whether the membrane-associated His6-aPKCι/λ recruited in response to Rab2 in the binding assay was tyrosine phosphorylated. Rab2 promoted His6-aPKCι/λ recruitment to membrane, and the membrane-bound His6-aPKCι/λ was tyrosine phosphorylated as determined by probing the Western blot with a phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4B). A strong chemiluminescent signal was observed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody that aligned with anti-His6-aPKCι/λ. However, when the membrane binding assay was performed in the presence of 1.0 μm PP2, Rab2-stimulated His6-aPKCι/λ recruitment to membranes was reduced by ∼50%, whereas no effect was obtained in the presence of PP3 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PP2 addition to the assay had no effect on Rab2-stimulated Src and GAPDH membrane binding (Fig. 5A). Because aPKCι/λ is required for Rab2-mediated downstream β-COP recruitment to VTCs, the Western blot was probed with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to β-COP to assess the effect of PP2 on COPI binding. Fig. 5A shows that PP2 treatment caused a concomitant decrease in β-COP membrane association (Fig. 5A). Since these results were highly suggestive that tyrosine phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ was necessary to promote interaction with Rab2-GAPDH-Src in vitro, we assessed whether Src-dependent aPKCι/λ phosphorylation facilitated interaction with Rab2-GAPDH-Src in vivo. NRK cells were incubated with either 10 μm PP3 or 10 μm PP2 to inhibit endogenous Src kinase activity. The detergent cell lysate of these treated cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Analysis of the anti-Rab2 co-immunoprecipitated proteins from cells incubated with PP3 show the presence of Rab2, Src, GAPDH, and aPKCι/λ. In contrast, the immune complex obtained from PP2-treated cells contained Rab2, Src, and GAPDH but was devoid of aPKCι/λ. These in vivo results are supportive of the in vitro data indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ facilitates interaction with Rab2 and Rab2 effectors. The decrease in membrane-bound aPKCι/λ and β-COP when the binding assay is supplemented with PP2 was reflected in the degree of vesicle release from VTCs. In this case, the membrane binding assay was supplemented with 300 ng of Rab2, a concentration that effectively stimulates retrograde vesicle formation in the absence or presence of PP2 (11Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The membranes (P1) were collected after the reaction by centrifugation at 35,000 × g, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g to recover any released vesicles (P2). Western blot analysis of P1 and P2 obtained from the assay showed that Rab2 promoted the release of vesicles containing β-COP, whereas membranes incubated with PP2 resulted in a ∼76% decrease of the total β-COP signal in the vesicle fraction. It appears that Src activity at the VTC is essential for Rab2-dependent vesicle formation. The traditional view that diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine regulate PKC has been modified over the years due to numerous observations that demonstrate that PKC also associates with inositol phospholipids and with a variety of proteins. These interactions with phospholipids and proteins are necessary for the selective regulation of the different PKC isoforms. In that regard, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src was shown to interact directly with aPKCι, and this interaction resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple residues within the aPKCι catalytic and regulatory domains (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Seibenhener M.L. Roehm J. White W. Neidigh K. Vandenplas M. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. 1999; 2: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Like PKC, the Rab proteins associate with multiple effectors and accessory proteins to regulate compartment-specific transport events (1Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref Scopus (2653) Google Scholar, 3Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). aPKCι/λ is a specific downstream effector for Rab2, and Rab2 requires aPKCι/λ kinase activity to promote retrograde vesicle formation from a VTC subcompartment (9Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since Rab2 directly associates with aPKCι/λ and aPKCι binds to Src, it seemed reasonable to investigate whether Rab2 function at the VTC required Src tyrosine kinase activity. Indeed, we found that Rab2-stimulated Src recruitment to membranes in a quantitative binding assay and that the recruitment of Src as well as aPKCι/λ and GAPDH could be inhibited by a Rab2-specific antibody. This affinity-purified anti-Rab2 antibody has proved to be a powerful agent to dissect Rab2 function in the early secretory pathway; that is, the polyclonal antibody rapidly and specifically blocks ER to Golgi transport and immunoprecipitates Rab2 and associated molecules. To that end, we are currently pursuing the identification of additional polypeptides that co-precipitate with Rab2 by employing this reagent. Src does not directly bind to Rab2 but associates with aPKCι/λ and GAPDH that interact with the Rab2 amino terminus. Both Src and GAPDH bind to the aPKCι/λ regulatory domain (13Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The interaction between GAPDH and aPKCι/λ can be partly blocked in the presence of a peptide made to the unique aPKCι/λ pseudosubstrate region (13Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A similar decrease in membrane-associated Src is observed when the binding assay is supplemented with the aPKCι/λ pseudosubstrate peptide (data not shown). The pseudosubstrate domain is downstream but adjacent to the aPKCι/λ proline-rich motif located within residues 98–114 that binds to the Src-SH3 domain. Our results indicated that the interaction of Src with aPKCι/λ is not critical for Src association with Rab2 but that GAPDH interaction is necessary to stabilize Src association with Rab2 effectors on the VTC. The precise role of GAPDH in the early secretory pathway is unknown. Intriguingly, GAPDH catalytic activity is not required, and therefore, the enzyme is providing an activity necessary for membrane trafficking that is independent of ATP production, which could have been utilized by both Src and aPKCι/λ. In contrast, aPKCι/λ requires Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation for the kinase to associate with Rab2-Src-GAPDH in vitro and in vivo. The finding that the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 influences aPKCι/λ membrane association but not Rab2, Src, or GAPDH membrane association supports this interpretation. It has been proposed that the biological role of tyrosine phosphorylation is to promote protein-protein interaction (28Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported that Src-dependent aPKCι tyrosine phosphorylation is required for aPKCι association with the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA in PC12 cells (20Wooten M. Vandenplas M. Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Diaz-Meco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8414-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that Src phosphorylates multiple residues in aPKCι suggests that site-specific phosphorylation in aPKCι may regulate temporal and spatial interaction with Rab2 and Rab2 effectors as well as other unique binding proteins including λ-interacting protein (LIP) (18Diaz-Meco M. Munico M. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 105-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Par 4 (29Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J. Sanz L. Moscat J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The involvement of Src in regulation of membrane traffic has been confirmed by studies indicating that the adaptor protein Cbl that functions as a kinase inhibitor and as an E3 ubiquitin ligase was found on the Golgi complex tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Src (30Bard F. Patel U. Levy J. Horney W. Baron R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin results in dynamin association with caveolin-1 (31Shajahan A. Timblin B. Sandoval R. Tiruppathi C. Malik A. Minshall R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20392-20400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recently, Src involvement has been implicated in retrograde transport by influencing the rate of KDEL receptor recycling between the Golgi complex and the ER (23Bard F. Mazelin L. Pechoux-Longin C. Malhotra V. Jurdic P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46601-46606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Rab24 is phosphorylated by Src-related tyrosine kinases and that the modification might influence Rab24 interactions with effector molecules (32Ding J. Soule G. Overmeyer J. Maltese W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003; 312: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data showed that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of aPKCι/λ is a key signal in maintaining aPKCι/λ on the VTC in association with Rab2 and Rab2 effectors and for ensuring the downstream recruitment of β-COP. Indeed, we found that supplementing the binding assay with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 significantly inhibited Rab2-mediated vesicle formation. It may not be coincidental that three effectors we have identified for Rab2 influence microtubule dynamics since recent studies indicate that the cytoskeleton plays a central role in the organization and operation of the secretory pathway by providing tracks to direct vesicle movement. We propose that Rab2-Src-aPKCι/λ-GAPDH are components of a signaling complex that defines and regulates the site of vesicle budding from VTCs in association with microtubule-directed vesicle movement to the appropriate acceptor compartment. Studies are in progress to validate this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081527884,"MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2) and Kv3.4 subunits assemble in skeletal muscle to create subthreshold, voltage-gated potassium channels. MiRP2 acts on Kv3.4 to shift the voltage dependence of activation, speed recovery from inactivation, suppress cumulative inactivation and increase unitary conductance. We previously found an R83H missense mutation in MiRP2 that segregated with periodic paralysis in two families and diminished the effects of MiRP2 on Kv3.4. Here we show that MiRP2 has a single, functional PKC phosphorylation site at serine 82 and that normal MiRP2-Kv3.4 function requires phosphorylation of the site. The R83H variant does not prevent PKC phosphorylation of neighboring S82; rather, the change shifts the voltage dependence of activation and endows MiRP2-Kv3.4 channels with sensitivity to changes in intracellular pH across the physiological range. Thus, current passed by single R83H channels decreases as internal pH is lowered (pK(a) approximately 7.3, consistent with histidine protonation) whereas wild-type channels are largely insensitive. These findings identify a key regulatory domain in MiRP2 and suggest a mechanistic link between acidosis and episodes of periodic paralysis."
https://openalex.org/W2030732769,"Phosphorylation (P-) of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) by protein kinase A or mitogen-activated protein kinases was implicated in mediating the increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression after prolonged exposure to nicotine in vivo and in cell culture. We examined the time course and signaling pathways for phosphorylation of CREB and possible involvement of ATF-2. Treatment of PC12 cells with 200 μm nicotine triggered rapid but transient elevation of P-CREB followed by a second sustained rise after 2-5 h of continuous nicotine. In contrast, ERK1/2 was only phosphorylated with short term nicotine exposure. MEK inhibitor U0126 abolished nicotine-induced rise in P-ERK1/2, but not P-CREB, nor did it inhibit nicotine-evoked elevation in TH promoter activity, indicating that ERK1/2 was not needed for induction of TH gene expression by nicotine. In contrast, protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 or Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein kinase inhibitor KN-93 reduced the nicotine-triggered rise in P-CREB and TH promoter activity. There was a delayed elevation of P-ATF-2 after 1 h of nicotine treatment, accompanied by increased ATF-2 protein. Upstream kinase JNK, but not p38, was phosphorylated especially after 5 min to 2 h of nicotine exposure. To examine the requirement for CREB and ATF-2, cells were transfected with dominant negative forms of ATF-2 or CREB. Both reduced the basal TH promoter activity and the response to nicotine. Knockdown of ATF-2 or CREB with siRNA did not alter basal TH promoter activity or mRNA but greatly attenuated the response to nicotine. The results suggest that both ATF-2 and CREB mediate activation of TH gene transcription by nicotine.

The results suggest that both ATF-2 and CREB mediate activation of TH gene transcription by nicotine. Administration of nicotine in vivo and in cell culture triggers increased expression of a number of genes related to neurosecretion including the catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. These changes in gene expression may be involved in neurochemical and cardiovascular effects of smoking. Nicotine is a potent sympathomimetic agent, and its administration, in doses similar to those obtained in smoking, increases heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in humans and many animal species (for review, see Ref. 1Benowitz N.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These cardiovascular effects are largely attributed to the direct stimulation of release of catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, from the adrenal medulla and peripheral sympathetic nerve endings (2Haass M.

Olsson C.A. Lotfi-Miri M. Patton G.C. Williamson R. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transcriptional mechanisms are at least partially responsible for the nicotine triggered changes in TH gene expression. The response of TH to nicotine has been proposed to be mediated by CREB. Nicotine treatment both in vivo and in vitro induces phosphorylation of CREB (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakayama H. Numakawa T. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J.

The cAMP/calcium response element (CRE/CaRE) in the TH promoter is required for its transcriptional activation by nicotine in PC12 cells (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CREB is activated through the phosphorylation at its regulatory site on serine residue 133 (Ser-133) in response to cellular stimulations that result in increased [Ca2+]i and/or cAMP levels (9Montminy M.R. Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 184-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 10Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) bound to the CRE/CaRE on the promoter of a target gene facilitates its transcription, an event called stimulus-transcription coupling (10Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 12Silva A.J. Kogan J.H. Frankland P.W. Kida S. Annu. Rev.

The phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 can be mediated by several kinases including protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C, CaM kinase II/IV, or MAP kinases (14Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1211-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKA was implicated by the finding that nicotine failed to increase TH mRNA levels in PKA-deficient PC12 cells or in the presence of adenylyl cyclase inhibitors (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gueorguiev V.D. Zeman R.J. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Sabban E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C54-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of CREB in response to nicotine has been proposed to be mediated by MAP kinases (7Nakayama H. Numakawa T. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Tang K. Wu H. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the temporal characteristics of nicotine-triggered CREB phosphorylation are not well established. The effects of nicotine on phosphorylation of CREB were generally examined during short term treatments for up to 1 h (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakayama H. Numakawa T. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) but not during the long term exposure. CRE-mediated gene expression was found to correlate more with sustained, rather than transient, P-CREB elevation (10Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Although the long term response of P-CREB to nicotine was not yet examined, our previous findings suggest that long-rather than short term elevation of [Ca2+]i is more pertinent for the activation of TH gene transcription. The addition of the calcium chelator BAPTA to PC12 cells even 2 h after the addition of nicotine still prevented the elevation in TH mRNA levels. In addition to CREB, a number of other transcription factors such as CREM, ATF-1, and ATF-2 can also bind the CRE/CaRE element (17Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 18Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Their role in the regulation of TH gene expression in the response to nicotine has not been well studied. Use of various chimeras of transcription factors with Gal4 indicated that in conjunction with CREBbinding protein, they can mediate CRE-dependent transcriptional activation of the TH promoter (19Lim J. Yang C. Hong S.J. Kim K.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 212: 51-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lewis-Tuffin L.J. Quinn P.G. Chikaraishi D.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 536-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ATF-1 was only marginally effective in increasing TH promoter activity, suggesting that it does not play a major role in the regulation of TH gene expression. ATF-2 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation of TH during neural development (21Suzuki T. Yamakuni T. Hagiwara M. Ichinose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40768-40774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Its expression in human brain is neuronal, and cell bodies of catecholamine-synthesizing neurons, such as the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus, are among the regions with especially high levels of ATF-2 expression (22Pearson A.G. Curtis M.A. Waldvogel H.J. Faull R.L. Dragunow M. Neuroscience. 2005; 133: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATF-2 may play a role in the regulation of TH gene expression. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms and transcription factors mediating the induction of TH transcription by nicotine, we examined the temporal changes in phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-2 and the signaling pathways involved as well as their role in CRE/CaRE-mediated TH promoter. Our results suggest that both CREB and ATF-2 are required for nicotine-triggered elevation of TH transcription. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), streptomycin, and penicillin were obtained from Invitrogen. Tissue culture dishes were from Falcon (Lincoln Park, NJ). Fetal bovine serum and donor horse serum were from Gemini Bio-Products (Woodland, CA). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Th-202/Tyr-204), anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ATF-2, anti-ATF-2, anti-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and anti-phospho-JNK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). Anti-phospho-CREB, (Ser-133) and anti-CREB antibodies were from Upstate Group Inc. (Waltham, MA). The MEK inhibitor U0126 was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 was from Calbiochem, and CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 was from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The molecular mass markers and Laemmli sample buffer were supplied by Bio-Rad. The Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent kit, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Pierce. SuperFect™ and TransMessenger™ transfection reagents were from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Cy™3-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA, CREB, and ATF-2 siRNAs were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Dominant-negative (d/n) CREB expression plasmid pCMV-KCREB, containing mutations in DNA binding domain, was obtained from BD Biosciences; d/n ATF-2 was a generous gift from Dr. Phyllis LuValle (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated donor horse serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 IU/ml penicillin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 7% CO2 as described previously (15Gueorguiev V.D. Zeman R.J. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Sabban E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C54-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at a medium density (∼3 × 105/cm2). For nicotine treatment, nicotine ditartrate dissolved in sterile water was added to obtain the desired final concentration. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins from total cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad). Equal loading was ensured by Ponceau S staining. Membranes were blocked in phospho-buffered saline, 0.05% Triton X-100 containing 5% skim milk powder and were then probed overnight with specific primary antibodies (1:1000 phospho-CREB, 1:2000 phospho-ERK. or 1:1000 phospho-ATF-2). Antibodies were detected with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) detection reagents. Membranes were stripped with stripping buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 45 min at 60 °C and reprobed with the corresponding antibodies to total CREB, ERK1/2, ATF-2, or β-actin for loading control. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray films for various time intervals. The images were captured with a GS-800 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the ratio was quantified by densitometric analyses within the linear range of each captured signal. Plasmids and Transfections—The preparation of the constructs with the first 272 nucleotides of the rat TH promoter driving the expression of a firefly luciferase gene (p5′TH-Luc (-272/+27)) has been previously described (23Nakashima A. Ota A. Sabban E.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 112: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The corresponding plasmids were mixed with SuperFect™ in a ratio of 5 μg to 10 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen), and then the mixtures were added to PC12 cells grown on 6-well plates in 0.6 ml of serum-free DMEM. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixtures for 3 h at 37 °Cinan incubator with 5% CO2. The transfection mixtures were removed, and the cells were washed twice with phospho-buffered saline, which was then replaced with 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C in humidified air containing 7% CO2 and then treated with nicotine for another 16 h. The cells were harvested in 1 ml of phospho-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. Firefly luciferase activity was determined using luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. The PC12 cells were lysed with 40 μl of passive lysis buffer, and 4 μl of the lysate was added to 20 μl of the luciferase substrate. Luminescence was measured immediately with a Luminometer, model TD-20/20 (Turner, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity was normalized to a protein concentration of the samples determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay system using the Bradford method. At least three or four cell culture plates were used for each treatment. All experiments were performed at least twice. siRNA—We tested at least thee different annealing double-stranded siRNAs for CREB or ATF-2 genes to find the siRNA that has the strongest effect in reducing CREB or ATF-2 protein levels. The sense strand for siATF-2 was 5′-CCUUCUGUUGUAGAAACAAtt-3′, and the anti-sense strand was 5′-UUGUUUCUACAACAGAAGGtt-3′. The sense strand for siCREB was 5′-GGAGUCUGUGGAUAGUGUAtt-3′, and antisense strand was 5′-UACACUAUCCACAGACUCCtg-3′. Down-regulation of total CREB or ATF-2 proteins was evaluated by Western blot using specific antibodies as mentioned above. We followed the guidelines (Qiagen) for co-transfection of adherent cells with siRNA and plasmid DNA using TransMessenger™ transfection reagent. First we diluted 2.4 μl of Enhancer R in the appropriate volume of buffer EC-R followed by 0.1 μg of siRNA and 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 2.5 μl of TransMessenger transfection reagent was added to the siRNA-plasmid DNA-Enhancer R mixture. The mixture was incubated for 10 min and then added to PC12 cells grown on 24-well plates in 0.1 ml of serum-free DMEM. The cells were incubated with the transfection mixtures for 4 h at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO2. The transfection mixtures were removed, the cells were washed twice with phospho-buffered saline, which was then replaced with 0.4 ml of DMEM containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C and 7% CO2 and then treated with nicotine for another 16 h. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR—The levels of TH mRNA were determined by real-time RT-PCR as described before (24Cheng S.Y. Glazkova D. Serova L. Sabban E.L. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2005; 82: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Serova L.I. Maharjan S. Huang A. Sun D. Kaley G. Sabban E.L. Brain Res. 2004; 1015: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from quadruplicate cell cultures by using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-Test, Friendswoods, TX), and the concentration was quantified by using Ribo-Green fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). RNA (300 ng) was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Sigma) and 1 μm specific reverse transcription primer for the TH gene, 5′-TCAGGCTCCTCTGACAG-3′,in5 μl of RT mixture. RT was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h followed by 10 min on 85 °C. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Light Cycler System with SYBR Green buffer (Roche Applied Science) with the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GTGAACCAATTCCCCATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGTACACCGTGGAGAG-3′. The denaturation program (95 °C for 7 min) was followed by a four-segment amplification and quantification program repeated 37 times (95 °C for 3s; 59 °C for 3 s; 72 °C for 18 s; 85 °C for 0 s for a single fluorescence measurement) and a melting curve program (70 °C to 99 °C) and, finally, a cooling program down to 40 °C. The threshold cycle was determined using the Fit Points method to provide optimal standard curve values (0.98-1.0). For quantification assays, a standard curve was used, produced by amplification of several 10-fold dilutions of linearized plasmids constructs containing TH cDNA. The results of real-time PCR were normalized to the amount of total RNA used in the PCR reaction. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test for experiments with two groups or by performing an analysis of variance followed by the Fisher least significant difference test for experiments with more than two groups. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Temporal Effect of Nicotine on Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Long Term Activation of CREB—Our previous experiments indicated the importance of prolonged elevation of calcium for nicotine-induced changes in TH gene expression (15Gueorguiev V.D. Zeman R.J. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Sabban E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C54-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nicotine led to sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i for up to 6 h of constant exposure. Therefore, we examined the effect of prolonged exposure to 200 μm nicotine, a concentration leading to maximal induction of TH mRNA (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results shown in Fig. 1A reveal a sharp transient increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by 5 min followed by a decline to basal levels with no change in the level of phosphorylation afterward. In contrast, although the level of P-CREB was elevated after 5 and 30 min of nicotine treatment and declined to near basal levels by 1 h of treatment, P-CREB increased again at the 2-h time point and rose even further for up to 5 h of exposure to nicotine. Densitometry (Fig. 1B) indicated that there was about a 5-fold increase in P-CREB with transient as well as prolonged treatment with nicotine. The results suggest that long term elevation of P-CREB occurs without concomitant activation of ERK1/2. Exposure to lower concentrations of nicotine (10 and 50 μm) for up to 1 h also led to transient but weaker phosphorylation of CREB and ERK1/2 with similar kinetics (data not shown). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 Is Not Required for the Nicotine-triggered Regulation of TH Promoter Activity—The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was found to be very transient, whereas phosphorylation of CREB was sustained with prolonged treatment in PC12 cells. Previous studies implicated the involvement of MAP kinases in the short term nicotine-triggered elevation in P-CREB and TH gene expression (7Nakayama H. Numakawa T. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Brunzell D.H. Russell D.S. Picciotto M.R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined whether phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is also necessary for the nicotine-induced phosphorylation of CREB. Pretreatment for 15 min with 10 μm MEK inhibitor U0126 prevented the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 triggered by 200 μm nicotine as expected (Fig. 2A). However, under the same conditions this inhibitor did not prevent the phosphorylation of CREB in nicotine-treated cells. Because the phosphorylation of CREB is implicated in the nicotine-triggered activation of TH transcription, we investigated if nicotine can induce elevation of TH promoter-driven reporter activity in the presence of MEK inhibitor U0126. Cells were transfected with reporter constructs in which luciferase activity was controlled by the first 272 nucleotides of the rat TH promoter (p5′TH/Luc(-272/+27)). This promoter region contains several regulatory elements including an AP-1 like motif and the Egr1/Sp1 site as well as a perfect consensus CRE/CaRE (TGACGTCA, at -45 to -38), which is necessary for the response to nicotine (6Hiremagalur B.

As shown in Fig. 2B, after incubation with 200 μm nicotine, there was a 2.5-fold increase in TH promoter-driven luciferase activity. In the presence of 10 μm MEK inhibitor U0126, nicotine still was able to elevate TH promoter-driven luciferase activity. These results indicate that the MAP kinase pathway is not involved in the regulation of TH promoter activity in response to nicotine. PKA Inhibitor H-89 and CaMK Inhibitor KN-93 Attenuated the Phosphorylation of CREB and TH Promoter Activity—Because ERK1/2 is not involved in CREB and TH promoter activation and we have previously shown the importance of PKA in the regulation of TH gene expression (6Hiremagalur B. Nankova B. Nitahara J. Zeman R. Sabban E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23704-23711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gueorguiev V.D. Zeman R.J. Hiremagalur B. Menezes A. Sabban E.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C54-C65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the requirements for PKA and CaM kinase. PC12 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 μm H-89, a specific inhibitor for PKA, or 10 μm KN-93, a selective inhibitor of CaMKII. Inhibition of PKA decreased the level of P-CREB after3hof treatment with nicotine. The effect of CaMKII inhibitor was even more pronounced. There was no elevation of the level of P-CREB on the 5′ and no detectable P-CREB after3hofnicotine treatment (Fig. 3A). To further elucidate the role of PKA and CaMKII on TH transcription, we transfected PC12 cells with the TH promoter construct. The cells were pretreated with H-89 or KN-93 inhibitors for 30 min before nicotine was added, and respective luciferase activity was measured. Nicotine induced the TH promoter activity more than 2.5-fold compared with the untreated controls. However, both inhibitors prevented the effect of nicotine on TH promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Basal transcription levels were not changed with both inhibitors, suggesting that only the induction is affected. Nicotine Triggered Long Term Phosphorylation of ATF-2 as Well as JNK—Next, we examined the effect of nicotine on phosphorylation of ATF-2. For these experiments PC12 cells were treated for different time periods with 200 μm nicotine, and the levels of phosphorylation of ATF-2 were examined by Western blots using antibodies to P-ATF-2 (Th-71) and to total ATF-2 (Fig. 4). Short term incubation with nicotine (5-30 min) did not change the levels of P-ATF-2. However, both phosphorylation of ATF-2 and the protein levels were induced after 1 h of continual incubation with nicotine. They continued to increase and remained significantly elevated for up to 5 h (longest time examined) (Fig. 4A). Densitometry was used to estimate the level of induction, and the results are shown in Fig. 4B. The elevation of P-ATF-2 accompanied the rise in ATF-2 protein levels. Stress-activated kinases, such as p38 (28Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) and JNK (29Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar), are involved in the stimulation of ATF-2. Therefore, we used Western blotting to determine the level of phosphorylation of JNK with antibody against the P-JNK. We found an increase in the level of P-JNK, reaching maximal levels at 5 min and remaining high for 2 h, then slowly decreasing to the basal level at 5 h (Fig. 5A). The level of total JNK was not changed at any of the time points. Our experiments showed no change in the level of P-p38 (data not shown). Data from the densitometry of the changes in the levels of P-JNK and total JNK protein are shown (Fig. 5B). Attenuation of the Nicotine-triggered Activation of TH Promoter by Dominant Negative CREB or ATF-2—To analyze whether ATF-2 and CREB are directly involved in the regulation of TH gene expression in PC12 cells, the cells were co-transfected with p5′TH-Luc(-272/+27) and either expression plasmid for d/n ATF-2 or d/n CREB. Untreated controls and nicotine-treated cells were co-transfected with p5′TH-Luc(-272/+27) reporter construct and empty expression vector (pcDNA3). The results showed a marked decrease in TH promoter activity in cell cultures transfected with either of these dominant negative constructs (Fig. 6). The addition of nicotine increased TH promoter driven luciferase activity in control cells but did not elicit any significant change in the cells expressing d/n-ATF-2 or d/n CREB. Thus, both d/n-ATF-2 and d/n-CREB reduced the basal expression and prevented the response to nicotine. These results suggest that ATF-2 and CREB transcription factors are likely required for the nicotine-triggered regulation of TH gene promoter in PC12 cells. Knockdown of CREB or ATF-2 Inhibits the Basal and Nicotine-stimulated TH Promoter Activity and the Level of TH mRNA—To further study the requirement for CREB and ATF-2, we used siRNAs to selectively knock down these genes. First we used fluorescent dye-labeled siRNA to determine the efficiency of siRNA uptake by transfection. PC12 cells were transfected with Cy™3-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase siRNA. One day after transfection, 90% of the cells were labeled, demonstrating successful uptake of the siRNA (Fig. 7A). Additional preliminary experiments were performed to evaluate the ability of CREB or ATF-2 siRNAs to inhibit the levels of targeted proteins and to select the appropriate siRNA concentration and incubation time. PC12 cells were transfected with CREB or ATF-2 siRNAs or scrambled RNA, and levels of CREB or ATF-2 proteins were determined by Western blo"

To identify downstream mediators of RA signaling, we used retrovirus-mediated insertion mutagenesis in PLB985 leukemia cells and established the RA-resistant cell line WY-1. In PLB985, but not WY-1 cells, RA induced TRAIL and its DR4 and DR5 receptors. Knocking down TRAIL expression by RNA interference blocked RA-induced apoptosis. WY-1 cells are defective for RA-induced differentiation, G1 arrest and exhibit co-resistance to TRAIL. In WY-1 cells, a single virus copy is integrated into a novel RA-regulated gene termed RAM (retinoic acid modulator). RAM is expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage and extinguished by RA in PLB985, but not WY-1 cells. Whereas knocking down RAM expression by RNA interference promoted RA-induced differentiation and TRAIL-triggered apoptosis of PLB985 and WY-1 cells, overexpression of the predicted 109 amino-acid RAM open reading frame did not alter RA signaling in PLB985 cells. This indicates that, apart from encoding the putative RAM protein, RAM RNA may exert additional functions that are impaired by the retrovirus insertion. Our study demonstrates that RA induction of the TRAIL pathway is also operative in leukemia cells lacking an RARα oncofusion protein and identifies RAM as a novel RA-dependent modulator of myeloid differentiation and death."
https://openalex.org/W2070178130,"Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-4 inhibits proliferation and induces the apoptosis of myeloma cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of how BMP-4 executes this apoptosis. In this report, we investigated the roles of p53 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in BMP-4-induced apoptosis of mouse hybridoma HS-72 cells. We found that 3 ng/ml of BMP-4 is sufficient to induce the expression of proapoptotic proteins, puma and bax, in a p53-dependent mechanism, and facilitate Ca(2+) release from the ER to the cytosol, resulting in the activation of caspase-12 and ER dysfunction. Similarly to HS-72 cells, multiple myeloma cells with wild-type p53 genes show much higher sensitivity to BMP-4-induced apoptosis than cells without wild-type p53 genes, suggesting that wild-type p53 status is required for dysfunction of the ER during BMP-4-induced apoptosis in ER-enriched cells, such as hybridoma and myeloma cells. These findings demonstrate that the presence of wild-type p53 genes and enrichment of the ER determines the sensitivity to effective apoptosis by BMP-4, and suggest that ER stress-inducing agents would be valuable in the treatment of multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W2065284422,"Cytoplasmic dynein is the multisubunit protein complex responsible for many microtubule-based intracellular movements. Its cargo binding domain consists of dimers of five subunits: the intermediate chains, the light intermediate chains, and the Tctex1, Roadblock, and LC8 light chains. The intermediate chains have a key role in the dynein complex. They bind the three light chains and the heavy chains, which contain the motor domains, but little is known about how the two intermediate chains interact.

Therefore the formation of dynein complexes with different combinations of isoforms is not limited by interaction between the various intermediate chains. We further sought to identify the domain necessary for the dimerization of the intermediate chains.

Cytoplasmic dynein 1 2Cytoplasmic dynein 1 subunit nomenclature: There are two distinct cytoplasmic dynein complexes. The designations of three of the subunits of cytoplasmic dynein 1, the cytoplasmic dynein analyzed in this study, start with DYNC1. They are then grouped into families of related proteins, and an additional letter(s) was added to their names to describe their relative size as follows: DYNC1H, the heavy chain; DYNC1I, the intermediate chain family; and DYNC1LI, the light intermediate chain family. There are also three functionally distinct light chain families as follows: DYNLT, the Tctex1 family; DYNLRB, the Roadblock family; and DYNLL, the LC8 family. The light chains are not exclusive to cytoplasmic dynein 1, so they do not use the C1 designation. A dynein polypeptide subunit was identified at first mention with its formal name followed by the common name in parentheses, with most subsequent mentions using the common name: for example DYNC1LI, (light intermediate chain). The subunit families are encoded by two or more genes, and their products are distinguished by adding numbers to the name. Alternative splicing isoforms are referred to with letters, and for clarity, hyphens may be used; for example, DYNC1-I2C is the cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain 2, alternative splice isoform C.

Biochemical analyses showed that cytoplasmic dynein 1 can be fractionated into two complexes, one containing the heavy chains and the light intermediate chains and the second composed of the intermediate chains and three light chain families (25Gill S.R.

A role for the LC8 light chain as a molecular glue has been suggested by its presence in complexes unrelated to dynein (3King S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Supporting this hypothesis are the observations that an N-terminal fragment of the intermediate chain becomes more ordered upon binding of the LC8 or Tctex1 light chains (29Makokha M. Hare M. Li M.

Although the functional significance of these intermediate chain isoforms is unknown, there are data supporting the hypothesis that the isoforms of the light intermediate chains and isoforms of the light chain families contribute to the specificity of dynein cargo binding, reviewed in Refs. 1Pfister K.K.

It is known that the two light intermediate chain family members form only homo-oligomers producing two distinct cytoplasmic dynein complexes in cells (11Tynan S.H. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32769-32774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the two Tctex1 family members also only form homodimers (34Chuang J.Z. Milner T.A. Sung C.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5501-5512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, homo- and heterodimerization has been observed between the two members of the Roadblock light chain family (35Nikulina K. Patel-King R.S. Takebe S. Pfister K.K. King S.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 57: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Ilangovan U. Ding W. Zhong Y. Wilson C.L. Groppe J.C. Trbovich J.T. Zuniga J. Demeler B. Tang Q. Gao G. Mulder K.M.

Thus, it is of great interest to determine whether different intermediate chain isoforms are able to associate with each other. In this report, we investigated the functional basis for the interaction of the intermediate chains. We found that the six intermediate chain isoforms can interact in all combinations of homo- and heterodimers when expressed in cultured cells. In addition, the region of the intermediate chain necessary for dimerization is shown to be a previously uncharacterized region of 61 amino acids. This region is immediately N-terminal to the Roadblock binding region, and it does not overlap with the previously identified intermediate chain subdomains: the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, the C-terminal WD repeat domain, and the three distinct light chain binding domains. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of purified intermediate chain fragments confirmed that none of the light chains are necessary for intermediate chain dimerization. Plasmids—Mammalian expression constructs of the intermediate chain isoforms (intermediate chain 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C) were constructed using standard PCR and DNA ligation methods. Briefly, the full-length intermediate chain 1 isoforms were inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of both pCMV-HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; LC, light chain. and pCMV-Myc vectors (Clontech), whereas the full-length intermediate chain 2 isoforms were inserted into the KpnI/NotI sites of the pCMV-HA and pCMV-Myc vectors. Truncation and deletion constructs of intermediate chain 2C were also cloned into both pCMV-HA and pCMV-Myc vectors using standard recombinant DNA methods. Hexahistidine-tagged versions of the intermediate chain 2C truncations 1-150 and 151-250 were generated by cloning the coding region into the pET14b expression vector (Qiagen Inc.). The coding region for mouse roadblock-1 was obtained from expressed sequence tag using the PCR. A GST-tagged version of roadblock was generated by cloning the coding region into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the pGEX4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were sequenced to confirm gene sequence and correct reading frame. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Bacterial expression of recombinant proteins was carried out using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) as the host cells. To express GST-Roadblock-1, or GST, host cells containing the expression plasmid were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.8. Expression of the fusion proteins were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, to a final concentration of ∼0.25 mm. Protein expression continued for ∼3 h at 37°C before harvesting by centrifugation. The fusion proteins were expressed in soluble forms and purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified GST proteins on beads in phosphate-buffered saline including various protease inhibitors were directly used for binding assay experiments. Hexahistidine-fused intermediate chain 2C truncations were expressed in soluble form and purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Novagen) for proteins under native conditions. The 0.5 m imidazole buffer used for elution of the protein from the column was removed by dialysis prior to use. GST Pull-down Experiments—GST-Roadblock-1 or GST alone (∼10 μg each) prebound to GSH-Sepharose beads were mixed with 293T cell lysates (100 μg of total protein) containing Myc-tagged full-length intermediate chain 2C or Myc-tagged intermediate chain 2C deletion mutant in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The pelleted beads were washed with the binding buffer and subsequently boiled with PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide-Tris gels and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution containing 10% (w/v) skim milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with the membrane for 1-2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for a further hour at room temperature. Labeled bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Co-immunoprecipitations—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% calf serum (HyClone) at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfection, cells were plated on a 6-cm Petri dish to ∼70% confluence and transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of transfected proteins continued for 24-36 h. Transfected 293T cells were lysed into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated 3 h at 4°C with 10 μg of anti-HA antibody (12C5) prebound to Protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The beads were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody (9E10). Anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies were obtained from the Lymphocyte Culture Center, University of Virginia. Covalent Chemical Cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking of the bacterially expressed intermediate chain 2C truncations were performed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and incubated with 0.1 mm disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of gel sample buffer, and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. DSG was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the final N,N-dimethylformamide concentration in the cross-linking reaction mixture was 5% (v/v). Cross-linking of the mammalian expressed full-length 2C was performed in a similar manner except that the cross-linking buffer was 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, with protease inhibitors. Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—The homogeneity of the complexes formed by the truncated forms of intermediate chain 2C was determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences), which was calibrated with the following standard proteins (Sigma) with diffusion coefficients, D20,w, (×107): sweet potato β-amylase (5.77), bovine serum albumin (6.19), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (9.0), and horse heart cytochrome c (11.1) from the Handbook of Biochemistry (37Sober H.A. Handbook of Biochemistry. Second Ed. The Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH1970: C-10-C-25Google Scholar). Sequence Analysis—To compare the homology of the dimerization regions from various species, BLAST searches were used to obtain cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain sequences. The accession numbers of the species used are: human (Homo sapiens) IC-1 AAH22540, IC-2 AAC33445; mouse (Mus musculus) IC-1 AAC33445, IC-2 O88487; rat (Rattus norvegicus) IC-1A X66845, IC-2C U39046; red jungle fowl, (Gallus gallus) IC-1 XP_418672; dog (Canis familiaris), IC-2 XP_860043; African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) IC-2 AAK28507; zebrafish (Danio rerio) IC-1 XP_688516; fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) AAX33607; fungi (Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans JEC21) AAW45478; nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) AAC02580; filamentous fungi (Aspergillus nidulans) AAL67574; slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum) XP_640973. The Six Intermediate Chain Isoforms Form Homo-oligomers and Hetero-oligomers in Vivo—Initial cloning of the intermediate chains found in rat indicated that there were two alternative splicing sites in gene 2 and that there was one alternative splicing site in gene 1, which aligned with the second alternative splicing site of gene 2 isoforms (12Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Those data thus suggested that there were two intermediate chain 1 isoforms and three intermediate chain 2 isoforms. However, in a more recent PCR analysis of cDNAs obtained from rat brain mRNA, a second alternative splicing site was identified in intermediate chain gene 1, at a position that aligns with the first alternative splicing site of gene 2 (data not shown). Re-examination of the expression patterns of the intermediate chain 1 alternatively spliced mRNAs indicates that the brain intermediate chain isoforms originally identified as 1A and 1B (31Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman J.F. II I Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Torre E. Lye R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Pfister K.K.

Cell. 1996; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) actually correspond to the newly defined 1B and 1C isoforms, respectively (data not shown). The protein products of the two intermediate chain genes are closely related, with 79% similarity and 69% identity. The longest intermediate chains (the A isoforms) have no regions removed by splicing. There are also two genes for the cytoplasmic dynein 1 light intermediate chains in mammals. Co-overexpression and co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that their gene products only form homo-oligomers (33Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We therefore used a similar approach to test the ability of the six intermediate chain isoforms to form homo- or hetero-oligomers. Pairs of the intermediate chain isoforms tagged with the HA or Myc epitopes were co-expressed in cultured cells. The HA-tagged intermediate chain was then immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and blots of the co-immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-Myc antibody. The data presented in Fig. 1, A and B, demonstrate that both intermediate chain 1 and intermediate chain 2 isoforms can associate in all possible combinations of homo- and hetero-oligomers. In contrast, there were no detectable immunocomplexes when cells were singly transfected with Myc-tagged intermediate chains (Fig. 1C), demonstrating the specificity of the immunoprecipitating anti-HA antibody. Furthermore, no gross differences in the strength of interaction between homo-oligomers and the hetero-oligomers were observed. Region of the Intermediate Chain Involved in Oligomerization—To investigate the region of the intermediate chain necessary for oligomerization, we made intermediate chain 2C truncations tagged with the HA and Myc epitopes. The intermediate chain 2C isoform was chosen as the study protein because intermediate chain 2C is the ubiquitously expressed isoform (38Susalka S.J. Pfister K.K. J. Neurocytol. 2000; 29: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and to ensure that the analysis would not be complicated by the presence of regions that can be removed by alternative splicing. The co-immunoprecipitation assay was then used to identify the truncations of the intermediate chain that were able to oligomerize. The mapping data are summarized in Fig. 2A. A truncation containing only the predicted N-terminal coiled-coil domain, 1-65, did not oligomerize, whereas the complementary construct, 66-612, did oligomerize. A larger N-terminal truncation construct, 1-150, which includes the minimal p150 binding domain (12Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), also did not oligomerize. These data indicate that the N-terminal coiled-coil region is not required for oligomerization. An essential role for the seven WD repeat domains in oligomerization was excluded by the observations that truncation constructs 1-250, and 151-250 oligomerize in the co-immunoprecipitation assay. We next investigated the requirements for the light chain binding domains in intermediate chain dimerization. Oligomerization of the 151-282 and 151-250 truncations demonstrated that the Tctex1 and LC8 light chain binding regions are not required for oligomerization. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that the 1-150 and 66-150 truncations, both of which contain these two light chain binding domains, fail to oligomerize. Co-immunoprecipitation of the 1-211 truncation suggested that the Roadblock binding region was also not required for oligomerization. In earlier work, we defined a region of the intermediate chain 1A that binds to Roadblock light chains (24Susalka S.J. Nikulina K. Salata M.W. Vaughan P.S. King S.M. Vaughan K.T. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32939-32946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This region partially overlapped with the first WD repeat. However, it was proposed that a 39-residue fragment, corresponding to amino acid residues 211-250 of intermediate chain 2C, that excluded the portion of the first WD repeat was the actual roadblock binding domain (24Susalka S.J. Nikulina K. Salata M.W. Vaughan P.S. King S.M. Vaughan K.T. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32939-32946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to confirm this hypothesis so as to more precisely define the Roadblock light chain binding region. To accomplish this, we synthesized an intermediate chain 2C construct that contains a deletion of the 39-residue fragment (amino acids 211-250) fused to the Myc epitope (ΔRobl). Fig. 2B demonstrates that this deletion mutant did not bind to the Roadblock light chain. This confirms that the binding site for the Roadblock light chains resides in the stretch of 39 amino acids. As a positive control, it was found that Myc-tagged full-length intermediate chain 2C interacted with GST-Roadblock but not with GST alone. Our data, and recent structural data (24Susalka S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2122506676,"There is currently a great interest in delayed chromosomal and other damaging effects of low-dose exposure to a variety of pollutants which appear collectively to act through induction of stress-response pathways related to oxidative stress and ageing. These have been studied mostly in the radiation field but evidence is accumulating that the mechanisms can also be triggered by chemicals, especially heavy metals. Humans are exposed to metals, including chromium (Cr) (VI) and vanadium (V) (V), from the environment, industry and surgical implants. Thus, the impact of low-dose stress responses may be larger than expected from individual toxicity projections. In this study, a short (24 h) exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses of Cr (VI) and V (V) caused both acute chromosome damage and genomic instability in the progeny of exposed cells for at least 30 days after exposure. Acutely, Cr (VI) caused chromatid breaks without aneuploidy while V (V) caused aneuploidy without chromatid breaks. The longer-term genomic instability was similar but depended on hTERT positivity. In telomerase-negative hTERT- cells, Cr (VI) and V (V) caused a long lasting and transmissible induction of dicentric chromosomes, nucleoplasmic bridges, micronuclei and aneuploidy. There was also a long term and transmissible reduction of clonogenic survival, with an increased beta-galactosidase staining and apoptosis. This instability was not present in telomerase-positive hTERT+ cells. In contrast, in hTERT+ cells the metals caused a persistent induction of tetraploidy, which was not noted in hTERT- cells. The growth and survival of both metal-exposed hTERT+ and hTERT- cells differed if they were cultured at subconfluent levels or plated out as colonies. Genomic instability is considered to be a driving force towards cancer. This study suggests that the type of genomic instability in human cells may depend critically on whether they are telomerase-positive or -negative and that their sensitivities to metals could depend on whether they are clustered or diffuse."
https://openalex.org/W2150482577,"Ovarian cancers mostly derive from the monolayer epithelium that covers the ovary. There are currently very few molecular clues to the etiology of this cancer. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are required for follicular development and female fertility and are expressed in the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). We previously reported the expression of human chordin (CHRD), a BMP extracellular regulator, in the ovary. Here we show that CHRD is underexpressed in epithelium ovary cancer and epithelial cancer cell lines as compared with normal tissues and OSE, respectively. Besides, we detected BMP expression in all ovarian cell lines analyzed. To determine the functional relevance of the absence of CHRD mRNA in tumors and cancer cell lines, we studied the effects of CHRD on two cancer cell lines, BG1 and PEO14. Migratory and invasive properties were greatly reduced, whereas cell adhesion to the support was enhanced. In addition, we detected chordin (Chrd) expression in OSE of rat ovaries in a pattern similar to that of BMP4. Altogether, these results suggest that CHRD could participate in regulating BMP activity in normal OSE physiology, and that its mis-expression in OSE may facilitate cancer incidence and/or progression."
https://openalex.org/W2062898228,"Several investigators have highlighted a correlation between the basic features of the folding process of a protein and its topology, which dictates the folding pathway. Within this conceptual framework we proposed that different members of the cytochrome c (cyt c) family share the same folding mechanism, involving a consensus partially structured state.

Do proteins sharing similar tertiary structures fold via the same mechanism? During the last few years, attempts to provide an answer to this question have led to a number of studies which explored the folding mechanism of homologous proteins. Quantitative analysis of transition and intermediate state structures by means of the ϕ-value analysis (1Fersht A.R. Matouschek A. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) suggests that proteins with similar tertiary structure generally share the same folding pathway (2Gunasekaran K. Eyles S.J. Hagler A.T. Gierasch L.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Zarrine-Afsar A. Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the demonstration that appropriate mutagenesis may switch apparent two-state mechanisms to three-state mechanisms (4Gorski S.A. Capaldi A.P. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 849-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Friel C.T. Capaldi A.P. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), rather than arguing for dramatic changes in the folding mechanism, adds evidence to the relative robustness of the folding pathway to sequence variations. Altogether these observations are in agreement with a folding mechanism characterized by sequential transition states and obligatory high energy intermediates (6Sanchez I.E. Kiefhaber T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 867-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although alternative models have been proposed (7Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Within this scenario it should be possible to energetically tune the folding pathway of a protein by selectively (de)stabilizing intermediate and transition states; it is predicted that the stabilization of high energy intermediates, by changing solvent conditions or by appropriate mutagenesis, would be associated with their transient population. The folding mechanism of the c-type cytochromes has been extensively studied, with horse cytochrome c (cyt c) 2The abbreviations used are: cyt c, cytochrome c; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrocloride; wt, wild type; Pa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Ht, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus. representing a widely used model system (8Chan C.K.

We recently proposed a consensus folding mechanism for several cytochromes c, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, involving an on-pathway intermediate species with essentially conserved structural features, which may be either a low or a high energy state (14Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). More recently, quantitative analysis of the folding kinetics of the cyt c552 from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus (Ht cyt c552) allowed the identification of an intermediate state as predicted by the proposed consensus mechanism (15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D. Cutruzzola F. Bren K.L. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25729-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c551 from the mesophile bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa cyt c551) is a close structural homologue of Ht cyt c552 (root mean square deviation is 0.6 Å; sequence identity is 56%). Pa cyt c551 folds through a complex mechanism involving parallel pathways; a fraction of the molecules reaches the native state within 10 ms following a fast folding track, while the remaining portion folds via a sequential transition state mechanism in which the presence of a high energy intermediate was inferred from kinetic analysis in the ms time range (16Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In agreement with the proposed consensus mechanism, we show in this paper that the high energy intermediate state of Pa cyt c551 can be stabilized by a single critical mutation (Phe7 → Ala) and becomes kinetically detectable. Determination of the crystal structure of the F7A mutant allows us to propose a structural interpretation for the stabilization of the native state and of the consensus intermediate. Protein Expression and Purification—Pa cyt c551 wt was expressed and purified as described previously (17Cutruzzolà F. Ciabatti I. Rolli G. Falcinelli S. Arese M. Ranghino G. Anselmino A. Zennaro E. Silvestrini M.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mutant F7A was produced with the “Gene Taylor-site directed mutagenesis system” kit by Invitrogen and then expressed and purified as for wt Pa cyt c551. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The protein was crystallized using the sitting-drop method at 294 K; drops (2.0 μl) were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (6.5 mm) and crystallization solution consisting of 26-30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m zinc acetate, sodium acetate 0.1 m, pH 4.5, and allowed to equilibrate against 1.0 ml of the same reservoir solution. Crystals grew up in ∼3 days. They were cryoprotected with a solution made up of 34% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and sodium acetate 0.1 m, pH 4.5, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A complete data set at 1.86 Å resolution was collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Reflection intensities were integrated and scaled by using DENZO/SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the P65 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = 66.766, b = 66.766, c = 62.462. (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement method using the program Molrep (19Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar); the structure of cytochrome c551 from P. aeruginosa (Protein Data Bank code 351C) was used as a template. Two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit. The model was iteratively modified using COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and refined using Refmac5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar); the last few cycles were performed using tls (translation libration screw-motion) restrained refinement. Solvent molecules were added into the Fo - Fc density map, contoured at 3 σ, and visually inspected; only the ones that showed proper hydrogen bonding to the protein and displayed a B-factor less than 60 Å2 were kept in the structure. The model was refined to a R-factor of 17.8% and a Rfree value of 23.3%, and its geometrical quality was checked using the program PROCHECK (Ref. 22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 2EXV). Structural alignments were performed with CE (23Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

Samples (1 μm for fluorescence and 11 μm for CD measurements) were thermostated at 10 ± 0.1 °C. Kinetic Experiments—Single mixing kinetic experiments were carried out using a “Pi-star-180” instrument (Applied Photophysics, Leatherehead, UK). Folding and unfolding were initiated by an 11-fold dilution of the denatured or native protein in the appropriate GdnHCl solution. Fluorescence emission was collected above 320 nm using a cut-off filter (excitation was at 290 nm). Double mixing kinetic experiments were carried out with a “SX-18” stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics). In these experiments refolding or unfolding were initiated by an asymmetric mixing (1-to-10) of the denatured or native protein with buffer or denaturant, respectively, followed by a symmetric mixing with an unfolding or refolding solution. In all the kinetic experiments reported the temperature was set at 10 ± 0.1 °C. The program supplied by Applied Photophysics was used to determine the nonlinear least squares fit of the fluorescence kinetic data to monophasic, plus steady-state and biphasic decay equations. Data Analysis—Equilibrium fluorescence and far-UV CD measurements as a function of denaturant concentration were fitted according to a two-state model in which only the native and the fully denatured states are populated, using Equation 1. ΔGD-N=([GdnHCl]-[GdnHCl]1/2)×mD-N(Eq. 1) where [GdnHCl]½ is the GdnHCl concentration in which 50% of the protein is denatured and mD-N is the m-value. The free energy of denaturation in the absence of denaturant (ΔG0D-N) was calculated assuming a linear dependence of the free energy of unfolding on denaturant concentration. Structure of F7A—The three-dimensional structure of the F7A mutant of Pa cyt c551 in the oxidized form was determined by x-ray crystallography at 1.86 Å resolution (crystallographic parameters are listed in Table 1). As expected, the overall structure of the mutant is very similar to that of the wt (root mean square deviation calculated on Cα atoms between the two is 0.6 Å). Analysis reveals that in the N-terminal helix the H-bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Glu4 and the amide group of Lys8 is significantly shorter than in the wt (3.58 Å in the latter protein versus 3.13 or 3.18 Å in the former, depending on which monomer of the asymmetric unit is considered; see Fig. 1A). Interestingly in Ht cyt c552, where Ala is present at position 5, topologically equivalent to position 7 in Pa cyt c551, the same segment of the N-terminal helix is correctly stabilized by the expected H-bond network (e.g. the length of the H-bond between Leu2-CO and Lys6-NH, equivalent to Glu4-Lys8, is 2.96 Å; see Ref. 15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D. Cutruzzola F. Bren K.L. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25729-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover the three-dimensional structure of F7A reveals that the mutation produces near the residue 7 a cavity of ∼55 Å3 (the corresponding one in the wt being 24 Å3). This cavity, which is accessible to solvent in the F7A mutant (Fig. 1B) but not in the wt protein, displays a higher polar character, 30% of the lining residues being polar. In this cavity three water molecules are clearly detectable in the electron density map in both monomers of the asymmetric unit; they are H-bonded to each other and to the protein (His16-CO, Tyr27-OH, Glu4-Oϵ2, Val13-NH) and display low B-factors (average B-factor is 29 Å2), indicating that they are well ordered in the structure. Equilibrium Unfolding—Characterization of the GdnHCl-induced unfolding transition of F7A has been carried out with the ferric derivative and at pH 3.0 and 4.7, following the change in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence. We chose to study this protein at pH 4.7 to directly compare the results with those obtained on Ht cyt c552, the thermophilic counterpart of Pa cyt c551. In all conditions the equilibrium transition corresponds to a single reversible process with no evidence of intermediate states (Fig. 2). At pH 4.7 the single point mutation stabilizes the protein by about 2.2 kcal/mol (ΔGD-N = 7.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol; m = 2.9 ± 0.1 m-1) with respect to the wt (ΔGD-N = 5.5 ± 0.4 kcal/mol; m = 2.9 ± 0.2 m-1). This significant gain in stability is more than halfway toward that of Ht cyt c552, the thermophilic counterpart of Pa cyt c551 (ΔGD-N = 9.5 ± 1.5 kcal/mol, measured at the same pH and solvent conditions). Folding Kinetics—Contrary to the wt protein, the refolding time course of F7A mutant, measured at pH 4.7 and low GdnHCl concentration (≤1.75 m), is clearly biphasic and is satisfactorily fitted to a double exponential decay, although a third and much slower phase (k is approximately 0.03 s-1) with a small amplitude (<10%) was also observed. The latter has not been included in the analysis because interrupted unfolding experiments (data not shown) demonstrated that this slow phase reflects a minor fraction of molecules refolding along a pathway rate-limited by prolyl-peptide bond isomerization processes (25Kiefhaber T. Kohler H.H. Schmid F.X. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A semi-logarithmic plot of the folding and unfolding rate constants versus denaturant concentration (chevron plot) is reported in Fig. 3; interestingly, while the logarithm of the faster refolding rate constant linearly decreases with increasing [GdnHCl], the slower one displays a clear curvature (roll-over effect) at low denaturant concentrations (between 0.5 and 2.0 m GdnHCl). Both features, which are generally interpreted in terms of multistate folding (26Matouschek A. Kellis Jr., J.T. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 27Roder H. Colon W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), were not observed in the refolding of the wt protein from the GdnHCl denatured state (28Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F.

To exclude the possibility that the refolding rollover is caused by formation of transient aggregates (28Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Staniforth R.A. Brunori M. J. Mol.

All data points are from single mixing experiments with the exception of the fast unfolding limb (empty circles), which has been obtained by double-mixing experiments. Continuous and dashed lines represent the best global fit for the on- and off-pathway model, respectively (15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41136-41140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these experiments the completely denatured protein was allowed to renature by dilution with a refolding buffer (first mix); then, after a controlled delay time, the protein was challenged with a high denaturant in a second mix. Using this protocol the native protein is expected to unfold with a rate slower than any partially folded intermediate, being separated from the denatured state by the highest energy barrier. As can be seen from Fig. 4, while interrupted refolding experiments carried out at pH 4.7 with the wt protein do not reveal any additional process over-and-above the unfolding of N, in the case of the F7A mutant a fast unfolding species becomes evident using short delay times. Fitting the unfolding time course observed at 4.15 m GdnHCl to a double exponential decay yields a rate constant for the slow phase (0.20 s-1), which is virtually identical to that measured under the same conditions in single mix unfolding experiments (Fig. 3) and represents the unfolding of the native protein formed during the delay time. The additional fast phase (k = 34 s-1) observed only for the mutant indicates the existence of a population of partially structured molecules not observed in the case of the wt protein. At longer delay times the amplitude of the fast unfolding phase disappears progressively and at delay times >5 s, a single exponential process is observed, as expected if only the native state were present. The observation that a detectable amount of native state can be formed in the short time between the first and the second mixing (100 ms) suggested the presence of parallel refolding routes. To determine whether the native state is formed only in a sequential reaction, involving an obligatory on-pathway intermediate (U-I-N) or other mechanisms are operative (32Wildegger G. Kiefhaber T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we plotted the amplitudes obtained in the same interrupted refolding experiment as a function of the delay time. For the F7A mutant the amplitude dependence of the slow unfolding reaction on the delay time at pH 4.7 is well described by a double exponential process (Fig. 5), with no evidence of native protein formation at the shortest delay time (10 ms). The two phases have rate constants and relative amplitudes close to those measured in classical single mix dilution experiments, at the same pH and GdnHCl concentration (i.e. at 1 m GdnHCl: k1 = 27 s-1 versus 36 s-1, a1 = 85% versus 87%; k2 = 1.40 s-1 versus 1.45 s-1, a2 = 15% versus 11%; see also Fig. 3). This result clearly indicates that the two phases detected in single mix stopped-flow experiments both represent processes leading to the native state and imply a triangular folding mechanism characterized by parallel pathways, as depicted in Scheme 1. When the interrupted refolding experiments were carried out at pH 3.0 no fast unfolding species was detected (data not shown); moreover, a plot of the amplitudes against the delay time can be fitted to a single exponential (Fig. 5), yielding a rate consistent with that of the main phase observed in single mix dilution experiments under the same conditions (approximately 3 s-1). Both these observations suggest that at the lower pH the alternative refolding route is probably abolished and the intermediate state is no longer populated (see below for further discussion).SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A consensus folding mechanism involving the presence of a conserved intermediate state, populated in the ms time window, has been proposed to be common to all c-type cytochromes (14Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Brunori M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A subsequent kinetic study on Ht cyt c552 provided further evidence for the existence of such an intermediate (15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D. Cutruzzola F. Bren K.L. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25729-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The underlying hypothesis implies that the higher stability and the different distribution of the helical propensity of Ht cyt c552, compared with Pa cyt c551, stabilizes the folding intermediate sufficiently to be populated, detected, and to some extent kinetically characterized. Previous work on Pa cyt c551 showed that a selected set of five mutations can confer to this mesophilic cytochrome the stability characteristic of its termophilic homologue Ht cyt c552 (33Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To verify our hypothesis, we investigated in detail the kinetic folding mechanism of the Pa cyt c551 mutant F7A, which was selected among other multiple mutants as a promising combination of: a minor structural perturbation, an approximate 4-fold increase in the helical propensity of the N-terminal helix (calculated by AGADIR (34Munoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and increased thermodynamic stability (35Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover this substitution was particularly intriguing given that Phe7 is in a central position of the N-terminal helix, whose stability and docking to the C-terminal helix are considered key events in the folding process of the c-type cytochromes (12Colon W. Elove G.A. Wakem L.P. Sherman F. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5538-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 36Sauder J.M. MacKenzie N.E. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16852-16862Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Analysis of the F7A mutant folding kinetics at pH 4.7 shows that a double exponential decay is required to satisfactorily describe the refolding time courses at low [GdnHCl], at variance with the wild type protein, which is always described by a single exponential in the ms time range. Since the most probable interpretation is the accumulation of an intermediate state during refolding of F7A, we carried out double-mixing interrupted refolding experiments, which showed a fast unfolding phase, absent in the wt protein (Fig. 4). Thus we concluded that at pH 4.7 a partially folded species is populated during the short delay time between the two mixings. In addition, the interrupted refolding experiments indicate that the two refolding phases observed in single mixing experiments at pH 4.7 (Fig. 3) represent the formation of native protein (Fig. 5). This suggests the existence of parallel pathways. However, at pH 3.0 there was no evidence for this intermediate, and no fast unfolding species was observed, indicating that the native state formation occurs by a single process (Fig. 5). We believe that at pH 3.0, where the mutant F7A is considerably less stable (ΔGD-N = 4.9 kcal/mol) than at pH 4.7, the intermediate is likely to be high energy, probably because of the protonation of Glu70. This residue, indeed, forms a salt bridge with Lys10, an interaction shown to be important for the docking of the N- and C-terminal helices (28Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Bigotti M.G. Staniforth R.A. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3 were fitted with a three-state model, involving the presence of an intermediate state. Discrimination between the on- and the off-pathway model is unfortunately very difficult because of the limited number of points to describe the refolding roll-over and unfolding of the intermediate. The presence of a fast unfolding process may suggest a sequential mechanism involving an on-pathway intermediate (U-I-N). However, the biphasic character of the native state formation, as seen in the interrupted refolding experiments (Fig. 5), suggests that it is more plausible to reconcile the data with a triangular mechanism in which the native state is formed via two parallel reactions, i.e. a faster one directly from the denatured state and a slower one involving the transient population of an intermediate en route to the native state. Although an off-pathway mechanism cannot be ruled out, a triangular scheme (Scheme 1) seems more plausible, and it is consistent with evidence for parallel pathways in the wt protein (37Gianni S. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Brunori M. Shastry M.C. Roder H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the results obtained for Ht cyt c552 (which refolds through on-pathway intermediate; Ref. 15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D. Cutruzzola F. Bren K.L. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25729-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of ferric Pa cyt c551 (38Matsuura Y. Takano T. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 389-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) shows that the N-terminal helix, extending from Pro3 to Asn9, deviates from the canonical hydrogen bonding pattern of α-helices, showing a bending at Val5 and an unusually long H-bond between Glu4-CO and Lys8-NH (see Fig. 1A). On the contrary analysis of the Ht cyt c552 crystallographic structure (15Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Gianni S. Dubey V.K. Borgia A. Di Matteo A. Bonivento D. Cutruzzola F. Bren K.L. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25729-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where an Ala is present at the topological position corresponding to Phe7 in Pa cyt c551, shows that the distance between the carbonyl oxygen of Glu2 and the amide group of Lys6 is shorter, implying the formation of a stronger H-bond. We concluded that the distortion of the N-terminal helix in Pa cyt c551 is probably due to the unfavorable fit of the bulky side chain of Phe7 within the protein core. Thus, it is likely that replacement of the aromatic side chain with Ala removes steric constraints, allowing the main chain atoms to properly fit the complete H-bond network of the N-terminal helix, resulting in the stabilization of the protein. Before commenting on the structural data of the single F7A mutant illustrated above, we recall that Hasegawa et al. (33Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37533-37537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) proposed, on the basis of the solution NMR structure, that the increased thermodynamic stability of the double mutant F7A/V13M with respect to the wt should mainly be ascribed to a tighter packing of the new side chains in the protein core: the packing defect due to the replacement of Phe7 with Ala would be efficiently filled by the side chain of the Met13, resulting in a better compaction of the protein interior and, therefore, an increased stability. The F7A mutant x-ray crystal structure clearly shows that removal of the bulky Phe ring produces a cavity, which is twice as big as that in the wt and is considerably more polar. While the formation of a larger cavity in the mutant was predicted, it was surprising that such a notable packing defect exists in an overstabilized mutant like F7A (39Szilagyi A. Zavodszky P. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 40Diez J Diederichs K Greller G Horlacher R Welte W Boos W J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An explanation for this apparent contradiction may reside in the presence of three well ordered water molecules present in the cavity (average B-factor is 29 Å2). Indeed modeling and experimental studies indicate that polar cavities almost invariably host water molecules, which usually have a stabilizing effect (41Ernst J.A. Clubb R.T. Zhou H.X. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1813-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 42Buckle A.M. Cramer P. Fersht A.R.

It has been reported that intracavity water molecules compensate to a variable extent for the decrease in stability due to packing defects: on average this is estimated to be more than 50% (44Takano K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although in some cases it has been postulated that they could even fulfill a real structural role, resulting in a stabilization (45Chi Y.I. Huang L.S. Zhang Z. Fernandez-Velasco J.G. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7689-7701Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 46Griffin S. Vitello A. Wittung-Stafshede P. Arch Biochem.

This may indeed be the case for the F7A mutant of Pa cyt c551. The three buried water molecules (Fig. 1B) interact with each other and with the residues enclosing the cavity, forming a “bridging” H-bond network whose importance for the global energetic balance of the protein is likely to be relevant. We believe that the destabilization due to the considerable increase in the size of the cavity is counterbalanced and possibly overcompensated by the stabilizing effect of the water molecules, resulting in a net positive contribution and thereby an increased stability of F7A. Thus, we think it is plausible to propose that the observed stabilization of the intermediate and the native state in the mutant F7A is the result of different contributions, as seen from the structure. The replacement of the Phe ring with the methyl group of Ala leads to an ∼4-fold enhancement of the helical propensity of the N-terminal helix, and more importantly, it allows the strengthening of a main chain H-bond in the same helix. As a result, the N-terminal helix is more stable, increasing the probability for the intermediate state to be populated. Moreover, the packing defect resulting from the mutation is filled by an array of three water molecules representing the “core” of a H-bond network, which could concur with the stronger Glu4-Lys8 H-bond to the stabilization of the native state. In conclusion, we present kinetic and structural evidence that even a single rational mutation can remarkably change the shape of the energetic landscape characteristic of a protein folding process, resulting not only in striking stabilization of the native state but also in the unveiling of the consensus folding intermediate, otherwise energetically inaccessible.

https://openalex.org/W2090059791,"Inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding (Id) proteins comprise a class of helix–loop–helix transcription factors involved in proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. We have shown that while Id2 is induced by UVB in primary keratinocytes, Id3 is upregulated only in immortalized cells. We have now determined that the consequences of ectopic expression of Id3 protein are strikingly different between immortalized and primary keratinocytes. Overexpression of Id3 induces a significant increase in apoptotic cells as revealed by Annexin V positivity as well as proteolytic processing of caspase-3 in immortalized, but not in primary keratinocytes. Id3-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells exhibited a fivefold increase in apoptotic nuclear fragmentation compared to Id3-GFP-negative cells. These apoptotic responses were accompanied by activation of caspase-3, as shown by immunocytochemical staining with antibodies to active caspase-3. Immunostaining with antibodies to the active form of caspase-9 as well as to the active form of Bax further revealed that induction of apoptosis in Id3-overexpressing keratinocytes occurred via a mitochondrial-caspase-9-mediated pathway. Coexpression of dominant-negative caspase-9 with Id3 significantly suppressed apoptotic nuclear fragmentation, indicating that caspase-9 activation is essential for Id3-induced cell death. This response was also markedly attenuated by coexpression with the Bax antagonist antiapoptotic protein Bcl2, confirming a role for Bax activation in this apoptotic response. Id3-induced Bax activation may result from increased expression of Bax protein. Furthermore, reduction of Id3 expression by small interfering RNAs abrogated the UVB-induced proteolytic activation of caspase-3 in these cells. These data together suggest that UVB-induced apoptosis of immortalized keratinocytes is at least in part due to Id3 upregulation in these cells."

Although the role of GALE in galactose metabolism has been recognized for decades, the precise relationship between GALE activity and galactose sensitivity has remained unclear. Here we have explored this relationship by asking the following. 1) Is GALE rate-limiting for galactose metabolism in yeast? 2) What is the relationship between GALE activity and galactose-dependent growth arrest in yeast? 3) What is the relationship between GALE activity and the abnormal accumulation of galactose metabolites in yeast? To answer these questions we engineered a strain of yeast in which GALE was doxycycline-repressible and studied these cells under conditions of intermediate GALE expression. Our results demonstrated a smooth linear relationship between galactose metabolism and GALE activity over a range from 0 to ∼5% but a steep threshold relationship between growth rate in galactose and GALE activity over the same range. The relationship between abnormal accumulation of metabolites and GALE activity was also linear over the range from 0 to ∼5%, suggesting that if the abnormal accumulation of metabolites underlies galactose-dependent growth-arrest in GALE-impaired yeast, either the impact of individual metabolites must be synergistic and/or the threshold of sensitivity must be very steep.

Galactose is metabolized in species ranging from Escherichia coli to mammals via a series of reactions collectively known as the Leloir pathway. The three enzymes that catalyze these sequential reactions are galactokinase (EC 2.7.1.6), galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT 2The abbreviations used are: GALT, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; GALE, UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase; gal-1P, galactose 1-phosphate. , EC 2.7.7.12), and UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase (GALE, EC 5.1.3.2) (see Fig. 1 (1Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)). Deficiency of any one of these enzymes in humans results in a form of the inherited metabolic disorder, galactosemia (2Holton J.B. Walter J.H. Tyfield L.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly S.W. Valle D. Eds. A. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York2000: 1553-1587Google Scholar). The most common and clinically severe form of galactosemia is classic galactosemia (OMIM entry 230400), which affects about 1 in 30,000–60,000 live births and results from profound impairment of the GALT enzyme. Although typically asymptomatic at birth, patients with classic galactosemia develop escalating symptoms after exposure to a milk-based diet. In the absence of intervention these symptoms, which include vomiting, diarrhea, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and E. coli sepsis, can be lethal within the first few days to weeks of life. Although a dietary restriction of galactose, the current standard of care, relieves or prevents the acute and potentially lethal symptoms, many patients with classic galactosemia go on to develop long term complications. The most common complications include speech and/or learning disabilities in 30–50% of all patients and primary or premature ovarian failure in almost 85% of females (3Waggoner D.D. Buist N.R.M. Donnell G.N. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 802-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Perhaps the least well understood form of galactosemia is epimerase (GALE) deficiency galactosemia (OMIM entry 230350). As illustrated in Fig. 1, human GALE catalyzes not only the interconversion of UDP-galactose (UDP-gal) and UDP-glucose (UDP-glc) but also the intercon-version of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (e.g. Refs 4Piller F.

Originally described as a “peripheral” clinically benign condition in which GALE deficiency is restricted to the circulating red and white blood cells (6Gitzelmann R. Helv. Paediat.

Acta. 1976; 31: 441-452Google Scholar), GALE deficiency was later demonstrated to exist also in an extremely rare but clinically severe “generalized” form characterized by enzyme impairment in multiple tissues and symptoms reminiscent of classic galactosemia (9Holton J.B.

Most recently, GALE deficiency has been described as a continuous disorder, with a spectrum of enzyme impairment and corresponding metabolic compromise impacting a variety of tissues in affected individuals (12Schulpis K.H.

Despite decades of study, the underlying bases of pathophysiology in both classic and epimerase-deficiency galactosemia remain unknown (2Holton J.B. Walter J.H. Tyfield L.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L.

For example, although it is clear that patients with both disorders accumulate high levels of galactose 1-phosphate (gal-1P) on galactose-containing diets, whether gal-1P causes pathophysiology or simply correlates with pathophysiology remains unclear. In the absence of an animal model of galactosemia that recapitulates the human phenotype (18Leslie N.D. Yager K.L. McNamara P.D. Segal S. Biochem. Mol.

Metab. 2001; 72: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we and others have turned to the single celled yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a biochemically and genetically amenable model to explore the metabolic and cellular consequences of impaired GALT and GALE function in eukaryotes. Studies dating back more than 40 years (22Douglas H.C. Hawthorne D.C. Genetics. 1964; 49: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate that both GALT and GALE-null S. cerevisiae arrest their growth in response to even trace quantities (0.05%) of environmental galactose despite the presence of an alternate, metabolize-able carbon source (e.g. glycerol/ethanol). More recent studies by our group and others (23Mehta D.V. Kabir A. Bhat P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Kabir M.A. Khanday F.A.

Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have both confirmed and extended that result. For example, we found that GALE-null yeast arrest growth at galactose exposures 10-fold lower than do GALT-null yeast, although the GALT-null yeast accumulate levels of gal-1P greater than or equal to their GALE-null counterparts (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We also found that although GALT-null yeast remain at least marginally competent to deplete their medium of galactose, GALE-null yeast cannot do so, even after prolonged incubation (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Of note, this same observation was corroborated recently in mammalian and patient cells (17Openo K. Schulz J. Vargas C. Orton C. Epstein M. Schnur R. Scaglia F. Berry G. Gottesman G. Ficicioglu C. Slonim A. Shroer R. Yu C. Rangel V. Kenan J. Lamance K. Fridovich-Keil J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 89-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Schulz J. Ross K.

These data raise the possibility that although the acute phenotypes of profound GALT or GALE impairment may be similar in patients and in yeast, the mechanism(s) of pathophysiology of galactose sensitivity for GALT-versus GALE-impaired cells may be distinct. Previously we addressed the quantitative relationship between GALT impairment and galactose sensitivity by expressing each of 16 differentially impaired patient alleles of human GALT in a null-background strain of yeast (27Riehman K. Crews C. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10634-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and defining the galactose sensitivity of the resulting strains. Our results demonstrated a clear inverse relationship between the level of residual GALT activity and sensitivity of the corresponding strains to galactose. Furthermore, it appeared that human GALT alleles associated with greater than about 10% wild-type human GALT activity, corresponding to about 3% yeast GAL7 activity, were indistinguishable from wild-type cells. Here we have addressed the quantitative relationship between GALE impairment and galactose metabolism and sensitivity in yeast. Although conceptually parallel to our earlier work, the results of these studies demonstrate both important similarities and important contrasts to GALT. In particular, we have asked three questions. 1) Is GALE rate-limiting for galactose metabolism in otherwise Leloir wild-type yeast and, if so, over what range? 2) What is the relationship between GALE activity and galactose-dependent growth impairment in yeast? 3) What is the relationship between GALE activity and the abnormal accumulation of galactose metabolites in yeast? With this last question we are seeking to know if some galactose metabolites may correlate more closely with the degree of galactose sensitivity than do others, perhaps implicating a role for these compounds in the mechanism of sensitivity. To ask these questions we inserted a doxycycline-regulated promoter just upstream of the GAL10 open reading frame in otherwise Leloir wild-type yeast, rendering the encoded GALE enzyme doxycycline repressible. We then grew these cells under conditions of differential drug concentration and followed their growth and metabolic response to galactose exposure. GAL10 wild-type and gal10-null yeast served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the answer to the first question was, yes. There was a clear linear relationship between residual GALE activity and galactose metabolism in otherwise Leloir wild-type yeast over a range from 0 to about 5% wild-type GALE. Above about 5% GALE was no longer limiting. The answer to the second question was that although all of the yeast grew similarly in the absence of galactose, in the presence of galactose there was a clear step relationship between growth rate and GALE activity, with a threshold for growth at about 5% wild-type GALE. Finally, in answer to the third question, GALE showed an inverse, near linear relationship with accumulation of abnormal levels of gal-1P and UDP-gal, again up to a threshold of about 5% wild-type GALE. Above 6% GALE appeared to be in excess for all of the outcomes measured. Together, these data both quantify the role of GALE and define key similarities and distinctions between GALT and GALE as mediators of galactose metabolism and sensitivity in yeast. Yeast Strains and Manipulation—All yeast manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (30Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol.194. 1991: 1-863Google Scholar) using haploid strains derived from W303 (MATa ade2–1 his3–11,15 leu 2–3,112 ura3–1 trp1–1 can1–100 RAD5+), which was the kind gift of Dr. Rodney Rothstein, Columbia University, New York, NY. To enable the expression of endogenous yeast GAL genes in both the presence and absence of galactose, all strains were rendered gal80-null by one-step gene replacement, as described previously (31Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The negative control strain JFy4931 was also rendered gal10-null by the same method (31Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The dox.GAL10 yeast strain (JFy4828) was constructed by insertion of a cassette containing a doxycycline-repressible promoter (32Belli G. Gari E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Belli G. Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) just upstream of the endogenous GAL10 open reading frame. This manipulation was achieved by one-step gene replacement using a PCR-generated fragment (from plasmid CM225) amplified to carry flanking sequences homologous to the desired insertion site. To tighten regulatory control over the doxycycline-repressible promoter, a second cassette encoding a repressor moiety (from plasmid CM244) was also integrated into the LEU2 locus, as described elsewhere (32Belli G. Gari E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Belli G. Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). All integrations were confirmed by genomic PCR of the resulting strains. Yeast Culture Conditions—All yeast were cultured at 30 °C in yeastrich growth medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol (YPGE) unless otherwise indicated, as in Fig. 3 and Supplemental Fig. 2E, for which yeast were cultured in synthetic medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% ethanol (SGE). Cells were exposed to doxycycline as follows. On day 1, a given colony was inoculated into medium containing 3 μg/ml doxycycline to completely shut down expression of the dox.GAL10 allele. After growth overnight cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed 3 times with sterile water to remove residual drug, and resuspended to an OD600 ∼ 0.05 in medium containing the desired final concentration of doxycycline (e.g. 0–80 ng/ml). Cells were grown in this medium to an OD600 of ∼1.5, at which point they were diluted into fresh medium containing the same level of drug and allowed to grow for another approximately eight doublings under these conditions. Relevant doxycycline concentrations are indicated for each experiment. Leloir Enzyme Activity Assays from Soluble Yeast Lysates—Soluble yeast protein lysates were prepared as follows. Cell pellets were washed with water and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3 mg bovine serum albumin/ml) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete mini protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). Lysis was carried out by vigorous agitation with 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at high speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. To remove small metabolites, supernatants were passed through Bio-Spin 30 columns (Bio-Rad) before protein quantification. Protein concentration was then determined using the Bio-Rad protein reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples were stored at –85 °C until use. Galactokinase activity was evaluated in samples by measuring the conversion of galactose to gal-1P, essentially as described previously (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays were stopped by the addition of 450 μl of ice-cold water followed immediately by filtration through 0.2-μm nylon micro-spin columns (Corning) to remove proteins and particulates before high performance liquid chromatography analysis. GALT activity was evaluated by measuring the conversion of gal-1P into glucose 1-phosphate, essentially as described previously (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays were stopped by the addition of 450 μl of ice-cold water followed immediately by filtration as described above. GALE activity was evaluated in samples by monitoring the conversion of UDP-gal to UDP-glc, essentially as described previously (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays were stopped by the addition of 237.5 μl of ice-cold water followed immediately by filtration as described above. Yeast Growth Studies—Yeast cultures were monitored for growth in liquid medium as described previously (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, mid-log phase cells were diluted into fresh medium as indicated in the wells of a 96-well plate (NUNC), which was then maintained at 30 °C with constant agitation. OD600 measurements were recorded every 2 h using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Metabolite Analysis—Both consumption of external galactose and abundance of intracellular metabolites were measured as described previously (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Doxycycline-regulated Expression of GALE in Yeast—To explore the quantitative relationship between GALE activity and galactose metabolism and sensitivity in yeast, we generated a strain in which the expression of GAL10, encoding GALE, was regulated by doxycycline. In brief, we introduced a doxycycline-repressible promoter (32Belli G. Gari E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 33Belli G. Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) just upstream of the GAL10 coding sequence in a strain (JFy4763) that was otherwise wild type for all Leloir pathway enzymes and that was engineered to express the appropriate doxycycline-responsive transcriptional activator and repressor protein moieties. This strain was also gal80-null, enabling strong expression of the endogenous GAL genes despite the absence of galactose (34Pilauri V. Bewley M. Diep C. Hopper J. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The resulting dox.GAL10 strain of yeast was designated JFy4828. To confirm both the expression and regulation of GALE in JFy4828 as well as to ensure that galactokinase and GALT expression remained intact, we assessed all three Leloir enzyme activities in both the dox. GAL10 and parental strains cultured in both the presence and absence of 3 μg/ml doxycycline. Our results demonstrated that the levels of galactokinase and GALT activity in both the parental and dox.GAL10 strains were statistically indistinguishable regardless of the presence or absence of drug (Table 1). Similarly, GALE activity in the parental strain was unaffected by the presence or absence of drug. In contrast, GALE in the dox.GAL10 strain was expressed at about 26% that of the control level in the absence of drug and was undetectable in the presence of drug (Table 1). This ∼4-fold drug-independent drop of GALE activity in the dox.GAL10 strain relative to the wild-type strain presumably reflects the weaker basal strength of the doxycycline-regulated promoter compared with the endogenous GAL10 promoter.TABLE 1Galactokinase, GALT, and GALE enzyme activities in wild-type and dox.GAL10 yeast cultured in the presence and absence of doxycycline Values are the mean ± S.E., n = 3, except where indicated.EnzymeTreatmentWild-type straindox.GAL10 strainμmol/mg prot/minμmol/mg protein/minGalactokinaseNo drug2.66 ± 0.122.39; 2.34 (n = 2)3 μg/ml doxycycline1.49 ± 0.522.96 ± 0.17GALTNo drug1.60 ± 0.181.82 ± 0.493 μg/ml doxycycline1.25 ± 0.281.89 ± 0.16GALENo drug1.40 ± 0.110.358 ± 0.033 μg/ml doxycycline1.56 ± 0.040 ± 0.00aStatistical significance.a Statistical significance. Open table in a new tab As a test of the impact of regulated GALE expression in the dox.GAL10 strain, we followed the growth of wild-type, dox.GAL10, and gal10-null yeast cultured in the presence versus absence of 3 μg/ml doxycycline and also in the presence versus absence of 0.025% galactose (Fig. 2). We have previously demonstrated that although wild-type yeast grow well in SGE medium containing glycerol/ethanol as the carbon source regardless of the presence or absence of galactose, gal10-null yeast grow well in the absence of galactose but arrest growth completely in the presence of as little as 0.002% galactose (26Wohlers T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with that result, we observed here that in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2, left panel), both wild-type and dox.GAL10 yeast grew well in both the absence and presence of galactose. In the presence of 3 μg/ml doxycycline (Fig. 2, right panel), however, only the wild-type strain grew well in both the presence and absence of galactose; both the dox.GAL10 and gal10-null yeast completely arrested growth upon the addition of galactose to the medium. Together, these data corroborate the in vitro GALE activity assay results described above and further demonstrate that 26% wild-type GALE activity is sufficient to confer galactose resistance in yeast. Loss of Epimerase Activity, Not Mutarotase Activity, Mediates Galactose Sensitivity of gal10-null Yeast—Unlike human GALE, the protein product of the yeast GAL10 gene, Gal10p, is a fusion protein that exhibits both UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase activity and also galactose mutarotase activity (35Majumdar S. Ghatak J. Mukherji S. Bhattacharjee H. Bhaduri A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Deletion or repression of GAL10, therefore, results in the loss of both activities. To test whether the galactose-dependent growth arrest observed in gal10-null yeast reflected loss of epimerase, mutarotase, or both activities, we tested the galactose sensitivity of gal10-null yeast engineered to express human GALE, which complements the loss of epimerase activity but not the loss of mutarotase activity. As illustrated in Fig. 3, human GALE fully complemented the growth arrest of gal10-null yeast exposed to galactose, thereby demonstrating that it is loss of epimerase and not loss of mutarotase activity that underlies the galactose sensitivity of gal10-null yeast. Titration of GALE Activity in dox.GAL10 Yeast—To investigate the quantitative relationship between GALE and galactose sensitivity in yeast, we first defined the relationship between doxycycline exposure and GALE activity in our dox.GAL10 strain. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” initial cultures were exposed to 3 μg/ml doxycycline to completely repress GALE expression, after which point cells were diluted into fresh medium containing the desired level of drug (0–80 ng/ml). After ∼40 h of continuous culture at the desired level of doxycycline, at which point GALE activity levels had stabilized, yeast were harvested and assayed for GALE activity relative to a wild-type control. As illustrated in Fig. 4, there was a clear and reproducible inverse relationship between the level of drug exposure and the level of GALE activity in the dox.GAL10 yeast. In particular, cells cultured in the absence of drug demonstrated 26% GALE activity, cells cultured in the presence of 25 ng/ml demonstrated about 12% GALE, cells cultured in the presence of 35–50 ng/ml drug demonstrated <10% GALE, and cells cultured in >55 ng/ml drug demonstrated <5% GALE. Finally, as described above, cells cultured in 3 μg/ml drug demonstrated no detectable GALE activity. Relationship between GALE Activity and Galactose-dependent Growth Impairment in dox.GAL10 Yeast—Using doxycycline titration to achieve intermediate levels of GALE activity in yeast, we next tested the ability of each culture to grow in medium containing glycerol/ethanol supplemented with 0.025% galactose. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, there was a clear inverse relationship between galactose-dependent growth impairment and GALE activity. In particular, cultures exhibiting less than 3.7% GALE activity completely arrested growth, whereas cultures exhibiting between 4.7 and 5.2% GALE activity were partially growth-impaired, and cultures exhibiting greater than 6.4% GALE activity grew indistinguishably from cells cultured in the absence of drug. Wild-type cultures exposed to comparable levels of doxycycline showed no impact on growth, confirming that the growth impairment observed in the dox.GAL10 cultures resulted from GALE repression and not from some unexpected side effect of drug treatment (data not shown). An alternate view of the results from Fig. 5A is presented in Fig. 5B, which plots the slopes of individual growth curves in the interval from 15–17 h as a function of GALE activity. In the absence of galactose, the relationship is essentially flat (left panel), but in the presence of 0.025% galactose there is a sharp “step” from no or low growth at ≤5% GALE activity to essentially wild-type growth at greater than ∼6% GALE activity (right panel). Relationship between GALE Activity and Galactose Metabolism in dox.GAL10 Yeast—As a first step to explore the quantitative relationship between GALE activity and galactose metabolism in vivo, we tested the ability of dox.GAL10 yeast to deplete their medium of galactose in the presence versus absence of 3 μg/ml doxycycline. Wild-type and gal10-null strains were analyzed in parallel as positive and negative controls, respectively. Previously, we have demonstrated that gal10-null yeast are unable to deplete galactose from their medium and that upon exposure to galactose these cells accumulate abnormally high intracellular levels of galactose, gal-1P, and UDP-gal and abnormally low levels of UDP-glc (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1, in the absence of doxycycline (shaded bars), the dox.GAL10 strain depleted external galactose and accumulated internal metabolites to levels indistinguishable from the wild-type strain. In the presence of 3 μg/ml doxycycline, however, this same dox.GAL10 strain failed to deplete external galactose and accumulated internal metabolites to levels indistinguishable from the gal10-null strain. In the absence of added galactose, abnormal levels of UDP-gal were detected only in the gal10-null strain and in the dox.GAL10 strain treated with drug, and these levels were transient, returning almost to background within 16 h of continuous culture in the same medium (Supplemental Fig. 2, panel C). Previously, we reported an abnormal accumulation of UDP-gal in gal10-null yeast only upon the addition of galactose to the medium (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To uncover the basis for this apparent discrepancy, we tested the possibility that culture medium could account for the difference; rich medium (YPGE) was used for the studies reported here, whereas the earlier studies were performed using synthetic medium (SGE). As illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 2, panel E, the difference in medium indeed accounted for the discrepancy; the dox.GAL10 and gal10-null strains both accumulated abnormally high levels of UDP-gal only in the YPGE medium and not in the SGE medium. This difference presumably reflects the presence of hidden sources of galactose in the rich medium. It is also interesting to note that although UDP-gal levels in the gal10-null and dox.GAL10 yeast were sensitive to this cryptic galactose, gal-1P levels were not (Supplemental Fig. 2, panel B). To define the quantitative relationship between GALE activity and galactose metabolism in yeast, we next studied dox.GAL10 cells cultured in levels of drug selected to repress GALE into a closely spaced range from 0 to 26% of wild-type activity. As illustrated in Fig. 6, panel A, cells demonstrating 5% or less of wild-type GALE activity were significantly impaired with regard to their ability to deplete external galactose, especially at the 6-h time point, whereas cells exhibiting >6% GALE activity were only marginally impaired, if at all. Indeed, by the 16-h time point there appeared to be a near-linear relationship (r2 = 0.89) between the percentage of external galactose remaining in the culture medium and GALE activity, up to a threshold of ∼6% wild-type GALE, above which all cultures fully depleted their medium of galactose. Internal metabolites followed a similar pattern, such that elevated levels of intracellular galactose, gal-1P, and UDP-gal also demonstrated a near-linear inverse relationship with GALE activity (r2 = 0.70, 0.79, and 0.55, respectively), up to a threshold of about 5–6% wild-type GALE, above which point metabolites essentially normalized. Finally, abnormal depletion of UDP-glc in the presence of galactose was reproducibly seen only at the very lowest levels of GALE activity (e.g. gal10-null strain and dox.GAL10 strain in the presence of drug). We have addressed three fundamental questions regarding the role of GALE in galactose metabolism and sensitivity in yeast. We have asked the following. 1) Is GALE rate-limiting for galactose metabolism in otherwise Leloir-wild-type yeast and, if so, over what range of activity? 2) What is the relationship between GALE activity and yeast growth rate in the presence of galactose? 3) What is the relationship between GALE activity and the abnormal accumulation of galactose metabolites in yeast? In answering these questions we have both delineated the role of GALE in galactose sensitivity in yeast and also contrasted this role with that of GALT. In addition, we have further set the stage for future studies in mammalian cells aimed at exploring the role of GALE as a mediator of pathophysiology and patient outcome in patients with galactosemia. Role of GALE in Galactose Metabolism in Yeast—We found that the ability of yeast to deplete their medium of galactose was rate-limited by GALE over a range from 0–5% wild-type activity, and this relationship was remarkably linear (r2 = 0.89). Yeast expressing GALE activity levels above 6% depleted environmental galactose as quickly and completely as did their wild-type counterparts. Although the precise threshold is likely a function of the amount of galactose added, among other factors, the important conclusion is that, like GALT (27Riehman K. Crews C. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10634-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), GALE is expressed in marked excess of Leloir requirements in normal yeast. Relationship between GALE Activity and Growth Impairment in Yeast—A comparison of strains cultured in YPGE medium spiked with 0.025% galactose and different levels of doxycycline demonstrated an inverse step function relationship between growth rate and GALE activity. At less than 4% GALE, growth rates were almost 0; between 4 and 5% GALE, cultures demonstrated a long lag, after which some growth became evident; above 6% GALE, growth rates were normal. It is interesting to note that the lag in growth of the 4–5% GALE cultures corresponded precisely with the time frame of external galactose depletion for these cells. These data suggest that whereas galactose metabolism may be a linear function of GALE activity within a limiting range (0 to 5%), the growth response of yeast to that metabolic block is not linear. These data are strikingly similar, at least in qualitative terms, to our earlier data with GALT (27Riehman K. Crews C. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10634-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In particular, we previously observed that yeast expressing <1% human GALT activity, corresponding to <0.3% yeast GALT activity, could not grow in the presence of galactose, whereas yeast expressing <5% human GALT, corresponding to <2% yeast GALT activity, demonstrated a long lag followed by some growth, and finally that yeast expressing >10% human GALT activity, corresponding to >3% yeast GALT activity, grew indistinguishably from the wild-type control. Especially considering that the level of galactose used in the GALT experiments (0.05%) was twice the level used here (0.025%), these data suggest that whereas the patterns may be qualitatively similar, yeast are quantitatively hypersensitive to the loss of GALE relative to the loss of GALT. These data are fully consistent with our earlier results demonstrating that GALE-null yeast growth arrest upon exposure to galactose levels 10-fold lower than do their GALT-null counterparts (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One important factor that may contribute to this apparent discrepancy between GALT and GALE requirements is that whereas GALE is unique in its ability to interconvert UDP-gal and UDP-glc, GALT is not unique in its ability to “convert” gal-1P into UDP-gal. The enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP1) provides an inefficient albeit effective alternate route for this reaction (23Mehta D.V. Kabir A. Bhat P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Lai K. Elsas L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Leslie N. Yager C. Reynolds R. Segal S. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells may, therefore, be able to manage with less GALT activity because UGP1 carries part of the load. Relationship between GALE Activity and Abnormal Galactose Metabolite Levels—One obvious result of impaired GALE activity in yeast exposed to environmental galactose is the accumulation of abnormal levels of intracellular galactose metabolites, including galactose, gal-1P, and UDP-gal (28Ross K.L. Davis C.N. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We explored the possibility that one or more of these metabolites might correlate with the step-function growth restriction of GALE-impaired yeast but found that within the key range of 0–5% enzyme activity, each measured metabolite demonstrated a clear linear inverse relationship with GALE. Furthermore, only yeast with very low GALE activity levels (<1%) showed a decreased abundance of UDP-glc in the presence of galactose. These data suggest that if abnormal accumulation of the metabolites measured indeed underlies the galactose-dependent growth restriction observed, either the impact of individual metabolites must be synergistic, producing an apparent step function in growth, or else the sensitivity must follow a steep threshold such that even the slightest accumulation of gal-1P or UDP-gal results in growth arrest. Future experiments that manipulate the accumulation of individual metabolites independently will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.

The fluorides likely mimic the phosphoryl group/Pi in the respective ground, transition, and product states of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis (Danko, S., Yamasaki, K., Daiho, T., and Suzuki, H. (2004) J.

Mutations of Asn706 and Glu183 have in common that they dramatically impede the function of the enzyme in E2 states, but have little effect in E1. Contrary to the Glu183 mutant, in which E2P slowly accumulates (Clausen, J. D., Vilsen, B., McIntosh, D. B., Einholm, A. P., and Andersen, J. P. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 2776–2781), E2P formation was not detectable with the Asn706 mutants. Differential sensitivities of the mutants to inhibition by AlF, MgF, and BeF made it possible to distinguish different roles of Asn706 and Glu183. Hence, Asn706 is less important than Glu183 for gaining the transition state during E2P hydrolysis but plays critical roles in stabilization of E2P ground and E2·Pi product states and in the major conformational changes associated with the Ca2E1P → E2P and E2 → Ca2E1 transitions, which seem to be facilitated by interaction of Asn706 with domain A.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (1Hasselbach W. Makinose M. Biochem. Z. 1961; 333: 518-528PubMed Google Scholar) is an energy-transducing enzyme of the P-type that couples hydrolysis of ATP to translocation of Ca2+ from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum. In this control of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, the Ca2+-ATPase plays a vital role in cellular activation events, such as muscle contraction, hormone secretion, immune responses, cell migration, and protein synthesis. Ca2+ transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis by a reaction cycle (Scheme 1), in which the enzyme is transiently phosphorylated at a conserved aspartic acid residue and undergoes major conformational changes (2Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3de Meis L. Vianna A.l. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In recent years, several high resolution crystal structures of the Ca2+-ATPase, each thought to represent a particular intermediate state in the pump cycle, have been solved (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 5Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

The Ca2+-ATPase consists of a membrane-spanning domain of ten helical segments and a large cytoplasmic head piece, comprising three distinct domains, named “N” (nucleotide binding), “P” (phosphorylation), and “A” (actuator). By combining crystallographic data with functional changes in site-specific mutants, an increasingly detailed picture of the mechanisms of energy interconversion and ion translocation in the Ca2+-ATPase is emerging. Thus, the catalytic function in E1 (autokinase activity) and E2 forms (autophosphatase activity), the movement of Ca2+ ions across the membrane, as well as the major rate-limiting conformational changes of the cycle, i.e. E2 → E1 and E1P → E2P, can all be understood on the basis of the sequential gathering and displacement of certain conserved amino acid motifs in domains N and A relative to the catalytic site in domain P and the coupling of these events to rearrangements of the transmembrane helices containing the high affinity Ca2+ sites. In the present study, we address the role of Asn706 at the catalytic site of Ca2+-ATPase and revisit a previously examined mutant, E183A (10Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Asn706 and Glu183 reside in the conserved 701TGDGVND707 (domain P) and 181TGES184 (domain A) motifs, respectively, and both residues are found in all known P-type ATPases (11Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In fact, Asn706 is highly conserved even in the superfamily of phosphohydrolases and phospho-transferases (the HAD superfamily), which, given the similarities in reaction mechanism, protein sequence, and structural architecture of the catalytic site, are believed to share a common evolutionary ancestor with the phosphorylation domain of the P-type ATPases (12Aravind L.

Biol. 2002; 319: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The side chains of Asn706 and Glu183 are both centrally located at the catalytic site in the E2 forms of Ca2+-ATPase, close to the phosphorylated aspartate, Asp351 (6Olesen C. Sørensen T.L. Nielsen R.C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T.

In E1 conformations, Glu183 has departed the phosphorylation site, whereas Asn706 retains its close proximity to Asp351 (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 5Sørensen T.L. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 7Toyoshima C.

In our previous study of Glu183 (10Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that substitution of the glutamate with alanine leads to a much reduced rate of both E2P hydrolysis and of the reverse phosphorylation of E2 with Pi, suggesting that Glu183 is critical for E2P transition state stabilization and catalysis. This proved to correlate well with the subsequently published E2·AlF 2The abbreviations used are: AlF, complex of Al3+ and fluoride; BeF, complex of Be2+ and fluoride; EPPS, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid; K0.5, ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; MgF, complex of Mg2+ and fluoride; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; TMAH, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide; TNP-8N3-ATP, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: AlF, complex of Al3+ and fluoride; BeF, complex of Be2+ and fluoride; EPPS, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid; K0.5, ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; MgF, complex of Mg2+ and fluoride; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; TMAH, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide; TNP-8N3-ATP, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-8-azidoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. crystal structure, in which Glu183 seems to coordinate and likely activates the attacking water molecule in the transition state complex (6Olesen C. Sørensen T.L. Nielsen R.C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 306: 2251-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Here we show that Asn706 likewise plays a crucial role in phosphorylation of E2 with Pi, as well as in the major protein conformational changes involved in phosphoenzyme and dephosphoenzyme processing. We describe here, for the first time, measurements of the apparent binding affinities of mutants for the phosphoryl analogs AlF and MgF recently used for crystallization, as well as BeF, assumed to be an analog of phosphate in the E2P ground state (15Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14991-14998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These measurements suggest different roles for Asn706 and Glu183 during catalysis of the E2P ↔ E2 reaction. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Assays of the Overall Reaction—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast-twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) was carried out as described previously (16Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the Ca2+-ATPase mutant E183A was the same as that applied in two previous studies (10Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. McIntosh D.B. Einholm A.P. Andersen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2776-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression, the wild-type or mutant cDNA, inserted in the pMT2 vector (18Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), was introduced into COS-1 cells (19Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) by transfection using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (21Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The concentration of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22Leberer E. Pette D. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport of 45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of Pi liberated in the presence of ionophore A23187 to prevent inhibition caused by rebinding of Ca2+ to the luminally facing Ca2+ sites (24Sørensen T.

Chem. 1967; 13: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi—Manual mixing experiments at various buffer and temperature conditions (detailed in the figure legends) were carried out according to the principles described previously (16Vilsen B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed using a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5, as described (27Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Acid quenching of phosphorylated enzyme was performed with 0.5–2 volumes of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mm H3PO4. The acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0 (26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging, using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. Background phosphorylation levels were subtracted from all data points. The background was determined in parallel experiments, either with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells or by adding an excess of EGTA (in ATP-phosphorylation experiments) before initiating the phosphorylation. In some experiments, the constant phosphorylation level reached after an exponential decay was taken as background (usually ∼5% of the initial phosphorylation). Assays for Binding of Vanadate and Fluorides—We used the previously described assay for vanadate binding (29Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2585-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and this assay, which is based on the inability of the inhibitor-bound Ca2+-ATPase to be phosphorylated by ATP, was modified to study also the binding of AlF, BeF, MgF, and ADP·AlF to wild-type and mutant Ca2+-pumps. Microsomes were pre-equilibrated at 25 °C and pH 7, either in the absence of Ca2+ to allow accumulation of the E2 state or in the presence of Ca2+ for accumulation of Ca2E1. The reaction with inhibitor was then initiated by addition of varying concentrations of AlCl3, BeSO4, or MgCl2 at a fixed concentration of NaF with or without ADP. In experiments involving AlF, BeF, or ADP·AlF, the concentration of Mg2+ (a cofactor of the reaction with the inhibitor (30Murphy A.J. Coll R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Troullier A. Girardet J.L. Dupont Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23307-23310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was kept as low as 200 μm during the inhibition step to avoid formation of MgF. Following incubation with the inhibitor for 30 min at 25 °C and subsequent cooling for 10 min at 0 °C, the amount of inhibitor-free enzyme was determined by phosphorylation for 10 s at 0 °Cwith5 μm [γ-32P]ATP. In the experiments where inhibition was carried out with enzyme pre-equilibrated in the absence of Ca2+, excess Ca2+ was added prior to the phosphorylation step (∼5 s before the addition of ATP). The data presented in the supplemental material (Figs. SI and SII) validate the above described method. Fig. SI shows the time course of inhibitor binding for vanadate, AlF, BeF, MgF, and ADP·AlF. Fig. SII shows the time course of the dissociation of the enzyme·inhibitor complexes upon addition of Ca2+. Note in Fig. SII that dissociation of the complexes of Ca2+-ATPase with vanadate, AlF, BeF, and MgF is very slow at 0 °C, demonstrating that the 5-s incubation with Ca2+ prior to phosphorylation does not cause significant dissociation of enzyme·inhibitor complex. However, because the enzyme·BeF complex was more Ca2+-sensitive than the complexes with AlF and MgF, we used a free Ca2+ concentration of only 100 μm for activation of phosphorylation in the experiments with BeF, whereas the Ca2+ concentration was 500 μm in the experiments with AlF and MgF. Assays for Nucleotide Binding—The synthesis of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP, the photolabeling of COS-1 cell microsomes containing wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase, the inhibition of photolabeling by ATP, and the quantification of labeled bands by radioimaging following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (33McIntosh D.B.

Calculations and Data Analysis—Experiments were conducted at least twice, and the complete set of data was analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.) or by computation using the SimZyme program (27Sørensen T.L.

The analysis of ligand concentration dependences was based on the Hill equation, EP = EPmax·[L]n/(Kn0.5 + [L]n), or, for the concentration dependences of inhibitory ligands, on the Hill equation for inhibition, EP = EPmax·(1 - [L]n/(Kn0.5 + [L]n)). The “true” dissociation constant for ATP binding in [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling experiments was calculated using the validated equation for competitive inhibition (33McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G.

Expression, Overall Activity, and Phosphorylation of Ca2+ Pumps with Alterations to Asn706—Asn706 of the Ca2+-ATPase was replaced by either alanine, cysteine, or serine, these mutations being chosen to either completely remove the side-chain carboxamide function (alanine) or remove the nitrogen, while retaining an oxygen in the side chain (serine), or introduce minimal negative charge (cysteine, the ionized fraction depending on the pK and pH), in all cases with only minor changes of the volume of the side chain. The mutant proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells, and the expression level of the mutants was similar to that obtained with wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, as evaluated by their immunoreactivity in a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). To obtain an initial overview of the functional consequences of the mutations, we measured the overall rates of 45Ca2+ transport into the microsomal vesicles and ATP hydrolysis at 37 °C and saturating substrate conditions. In either assay, the three mutants displayed no significant activity above the background level obtained with control microsomes harvested from mock-transfected COS-1 cells. For N706A, the lack of ATPase activity confirms a previously published result (37Inesi G. Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31629-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We then proceeded to test the phosphorylation of the mutants, from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Ca2+, as well as from 32Pi without Ca2+ in the backward direction of the normal reaction cycle (Scheme 1). The steady-state level of phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP at 0 °C was wild-type-like for all three mutants (Fig. 1, upper gel). However, no significant phosphoenzyme was formed in the mutants in the presence of 500 μm 32Pi (Fig. 1, lower gel), under conditions where E2P accumulates for wild type (25 °C, presence of Me2SO, absence of Ca2+, and incubation for 10 min). Under these conditions, the concentration of Pi giving half-maximal phosphorylation of wild-type enzyme is ∼10 μm, and with 500 μm Pi the reaction reaches steady-state within ∼10 s (10Clausen J.D.

Thus, it is clear from Fig. 1 that the replacement of Asn706 affects the ability to form the E2P state dramatically. It should be noted that this finding is at variance with a recent study (38Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8090-8100Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reporting that mutant N706A phosphorylates with Pi to ∼50% of the extent seen for wild-type Ca2+-ATPase. The latter study (38Ma H. Lewis D. Xu C. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8090-8100Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also reported 19% phosphorylation with Pi of another mutant (T353A), which we previously found unable to phosphorylate from Pi (39Clausen J.D. McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35741-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have no explanation of this apparent discrepancy. Our results were reproducible in several independent experiments carried out with different microsome preparations, and our background phosphorylation level was always rather low for mutants as well as wild-type (<5% of the maximum phosphorylation level obtained with ATP). Ca2+ and MgATP Dependence of Phosphorylation from ATP—The ability of the mutants to form a phosphoenzyme from ATP allowed us to further study the partial reactions of the pump cycle in phosphorylation experiments. First, we tested the Ca2+ concentration dependence of steady-state phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2A). Small, but significant, deviations from the wild-type enzyme were found with the mutants, with the activation curve of N706S being slightly left-shifted relative to wild type and that of N706C being right-shifted. Similar effects were seen for the MgATP dependence of phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), corresponding to a 3-fold increase of affinity for N706S and a 4-fold reduction for N706C, relative to wild type. The observed changes of apparent affinity for Ca2+ as well as MgATP seem to be kinetic effects, resulting from a reduced rate of phosphoenzyme turnover in combination with various degrees of slowing of the phosphorylation rate (see below and “Discussion”). Nucleotide Binding—In a recent mutagenesis study (35McIntosh D.B. Clausen J.D. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32515-32523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) we investigated the importance of several other conserved domain P residues for the nucleotide binding properties of the Ca2+-ATPase by studying the nucleotide concentration dependence of TNP-8N3-[γ-32P]ATP photo-labeling and ATP/MgATP competitive inhibition thereof. Asp703 and Asp707, which are close to Asn706 both in the primary and the three-dimensional structure, proved of importance for ATP/MgATP binding. Thus, charge-removal from the side chains of these aspartates enhanced ATP binding up to 14-fold in the absence of Mg2+, and inhibited ATP binding up to 8-fold in the presence of Mg2+. Table 1 shows the results of similar experiments carried out with the Asn706 mutants. It is clear that Asn706 is not a critical residue for TNP-8N3-ATP or ATP binding, neither in the absence nor presence of Mg2+, as the reduction of affinity was maximally 2-fold relative to wild type. It is noteworthy, however, that the largest reduction of affinity was seen in the presence of Mg2+ and for N706C, which also showed a significant reduction of apparent MgATP affinity in the titration of steady-state phosphorylation described above.TABLE 1Binding affinities for ATP and MgATP determined by inhibition of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP photolabelingEDTAaMedium: 25 mm EPPS/TMAH (pH 8.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTAMg2+/EGTAbMedium: 25 mm EPPS/TMAH (pH 8.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTAK0.5 (TNP-8N3-ATP)KD (ATP)cThe “true” KD calculated from the measured K0.5 values under the assumption of competitive inhibition as described previously (33).

Compared with wild type, the phosphorylation rate was significantly reduced for N706A (1.8-fold) and N706C (4.4-fold) but unaltered for N706S (Fig. 3A). Because a subsaturating ATP concentration was used, the measured phosphorylation rate depends not only on the rate constant for transfer of theγ-phosphate of ATP to Asp351 at the catalytic site but also on the affinity of the catalytic site for ATP. Hence, at least for N706C, the slight reduction in MgATP affinity described above could contribute to determine the observed reduction of phosphorylation rate. Rate of the Ca2+-binding Transition in the Presence or Absence of ATP—Fig. 3B shows the time course of phosphorylation determined under conditions similar to those corresponding to Fig. 3A, except that the enzyme was pre-equilibrated in the absence of Ca2+ (presence of EGTA), and phosphorylation was initiated by mixing with a buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP and excess Ca2+. For wild type, the rate obtained under these conditions is 1.8-fold lower than that obtained following pre-equilibration with Ca2+, reflecting the rate-limiting nature of the Ca2+ binding transition (i.e. E2 → E1 conformational change and accompanying Ca2+ binding) preceding the phosphorylation reaction (27Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The three mutants displayed 4- to 6-fold lower rates of phosphorylation when starting from Ca2+-deprived enzyme as compared with Ca2+-pre-equilibrated enzyme (Fig. 3, compare A and B). Relative to wild type, the Ca2+ binding transition was 4.4-, 7.4-, and 3.2-fold slowed in N706A, N706C, and N706S, respectively (Fig. 3B). In the experiment corresponding to Fig. 3B, 5 μm MgATP was present during the course of the Ca2+ binding transition. Because even micromolar concentrations of ATP accelerate E2 → E1 (40Guillain F. Champeil P. Lacapere J.J. Gingold M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6140-6147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated whether the inhibition of the Ca2+ binding transition in the Asn706 mutants could result from defective ATP modulation of E2 → E1. We therefore examined the rate of the Ca2+ binding transition using an assay in which MgATP is absent during Ca2+ binding (Fig. 4A). Enzyme pre-equilibrated with EGTA was mixed with an excess amount of Ca2+ and incubated for varying time intervals (t in the mixing protocol at the top of Fig. 4A). The amount of phosphorylatable Ca2E1 accumulated during the Ca2+ incubation step was then determined for each time interval by a further 34-ms incubation with 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 5 mm Mg2+, followed by acid quenching. Because the temperature and buffer conditions during the Ca2+ binding transition in this assay were identical to those applied in the experiment corresponding to Fig. 3B,"

https://openalex.org/W2083534091,"Bub1 is a component of the mitotic spindle checkpoint apparatus. Abnormality of this apparatus is known to cause multinuclei formation, a hallmark of chromosomal instability (CIN). A549, aneuploid cell line, aberrantly passed through the mitotic phase and became multinuclei morphology in the presence of nocodazole. Time-lapse videomicroscopy showed unreported bizarre morphology, which we named 'mitotic lobulation' in A549 cells just before the exit from mitosis and multinuclei formation. External expression of wild-type Bub1-EGFP clearly suppressed the multinuclei formation by retaining A549 cells at the mitotic phase during 48 h of time-lapse observation. This suppressive effect on mitotic aberrancy should not be mere restoration of normal Bub1 function, because A549 cells express proper amount of Bub1, which distributed cytoplasm during interphase and concentrated at kinetochore in metaphase. Furthermore, external expression of wild-type Bub1-EGFP suppressed multinuclei formation induced by Tax both in A549 and HeLa cells. Tax is known to induce mitotic abnormality by binding and inactivating Mad1. These observations, therefore, suggest functional redundancy between Bub1 and other mitotic checkpoint protein(s) and a possibility of correction of mitotic aberrancy by external Bub1 expression."
