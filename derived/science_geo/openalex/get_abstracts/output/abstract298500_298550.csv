https://openalex.org/W2072234220,"Designing efficient policies to slow global warming requires an approach that combines economic tools with relations from the natural sciences. The dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) model presented here, an intertemporal general-equilibrium model of economic growth and climate change, can be used to investigate alternative approaches to slowing climate change. Evaluation of five policies suggests that a modest carbon tax would be an efficient approach to slow global warming, whereas rigid emissions- or climate-stabilization approaches would impose significant net economic costs."
https://openalex.org/W2041572279,"The 28 June Landers earthquake brought the San Andreas fault significantly closer to failure near San Bernardino, a site that has not sustained a large shock since 1812. Stress also increased on the San Jacinto fault near San Bernardino and on the San Andreas fault southeast of Palm Springs. Unless creep or moderate earthquakes relieve these stress changes, the next great earthquake on the southern San Andreas fault is likely to be advanced by one to two decades. In contrast, stress on the San Andreas north of Los Angeles dropped, potentially delaying the next great earthquake there by 2 to 10 years."
https://openalex.org/W1967683961,"In a field experiment where the presence or absence of piscivorous pike (Esox lucius) in ponds was manipulated, the morphology of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) diverged, such that individuals became deeper bodied in pond sections with pike. A laboratory experiment confirmed that the presence of this predator induced a change in body morphology in the carp. Estimation of prey vulnerability to predation by pike, a gape-limited predator, revealed that this increase in body depth resulted in crucian carp reaching a size that provided refuge from predation. However, this change in morphology incurs a cost through an increase in drag when the carp are swimming. Because crucian carp are limited by resources in the absence of piscivores and by the substantial cost of the defensive morph in their presence, phenotypic plasticity should be the optimal strategy for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2041613480,"The frequency-dependent shear response of an ultrathin polymer melt (polyphenylmethylsiloxane) confined between adsorbing surfaces (parallel plates of mica) is described. The sinusoidal deformations were sufficiently small to give linear response, implying that measurement did not perturb the film structure. A remarkable transition was observed with decreasing thickness. When the film thickness was less than five to six times the unperturbed radius of gyration, there emerged a strong rubber-like elasticity that was not characteristic of the bulk samples. This result indicates enhanced entanglement interactions in thin polymer films and offers a mechanism to explain the slow mobility of polymers at surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2092555654,"X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra of the manganese (Mn) cluster in physiologically native intermediate states of photosynthetic water oxidation induced by short laser flash were measured with a compact heat-insulated chamber equipped with an x-ray detector near the sample surface. The half-height energy of the Mn Kedge showed a period-four oscillation dependent on cycling of the Joliot-Kok's oxygen clock. The flash number-dependent shift in the Mn K-edge suggests that the Mn cluster is oxidized by one electron upon the S(0)-to-S(1), S(1)-to-S(2), and S(2)-to-S(3) transitions and then reduced upon the S(3)-to-S(0) transition that releases molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2016155473,"The April to June 1992 Landers earthquake sequence in southern California modified the state of stress along nearby segments of the San Andreas fault, causing a 50-kilometer segment of the fault to move significantly closer to failure where it passes through a compressional bend near San Gorgonio Pass. The decrease in compressive normal stress may also have reduced fluid pressures along that fault segment. As pressures are reequilibrated by diffusion, that fault segment should move closer to failure with time. That fault segment and another to the southeast probably have not ruptured in a great earthquake in about 300 years."
https://openalex.org/W2010930916,"The relation between the accumulation of barite (BaSO4) microcrystals in suspended matter from the mesopelagic depth region (100 to 600 meters) and the type of production in the euphotic layer (new versus recycled) was studied for different Southern Ocean environments. Considerable subsurface barite accumulated in waters characterized by maintained new production and limited grazing pressure during the growth season. On the other hand, little if any barite accumulated in areas where relatively large amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon were transferred to the microheterotrophic community and where recycled production became predominant."
https://openalex.org/W1970864945,"Nickel metal catalysts composed of nanometer by micrometer strips have been produced with solid-state microfabrication techniques. The strips are actually the edges of nickelcatalyst thin films, which are sandwiched between separating support layers, which are also nanometers thick. These linear nanostructures constitute well-defined and well-controlled catalytic entities that reproduce the size of traditional supported metal clusters in one dimension, thus separating size from total number of atoms in the catalyst. Examination of their catalytic activity showed that they duplicate the behavior of conventional supported clusters. A specific rate maximum was observed for the hydrogenolysis of ethane at a nanoscale dimension similar to the cluster size at which the rate is maximum in the case of the supported cluster studies, whereas the hydrogenation of ethylene shows no such size dependency. The results suggest that the surface-to-volume ratio or the number of atoms in the catalytic entity cannot be the source of these size effects and that either support effects or nonequilibrium surface structures are the determining factors."
https://openalex.org/W1989914723,"Chlorine nitrate photolysis has been investigated with the use of a molecular beam technique. Excitation at both 248 and 193 nanometers led to photodissociation by two pathways, ClONO2 → ClO + NO2 and ClONO2 → Cl + NO3, with comparable yields. This experiment provides a direct measurement of the ClO product channel and consequently raises the possibility of an analogous channel in ClO dimer photolysis. Photodissociation of the ClO dimer is a critical step in the catalytic cycle that is presumed to dominate polar stratospheric ozone destruction. A substantial yield of ClO would reduce the efficiency of this cycle."
