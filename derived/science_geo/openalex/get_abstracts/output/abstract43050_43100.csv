https://openalex.org/W2058744360,"Cell lines stably transfected with metal inducible, MT-fos chimeric genes were used to study the ability of the c-fos gene product, Fos, to act as a transcriptional trans-activator. In 3T3MTfos cells, induction of Fos expression led to specific trans-activation of an AP-1 responsive reporter gene. Induction of Fos expression in F9MTfos cells, however, did not lead to trans-activation. Since, unlike NIH3T3 cells, F9 cells do not contain detectable levels of AP-1, we examined whether a expression vector can restore the trans-activating effect of Fos in F9MTfos cells. Transfection with a functional vector restored the specific trans-activating effect of Fos on AP-1 responsive constructs. When incubated with nondenatured cell extracts, anti-cFos antisera precipitated a protein complex composed of Fos and several Fos associated proteins (FAP). One of these, FAP p39, is structurally identical to . These results suggest that Fos is a trans-acting factor that is capable of stimulating gene expression not by direct binding to DNA but by interaction with the sequence-specific transcription factor AP-1. Therefore recognition of specific cis-elements by AP-1 is a prerequisite for Fos-mediated stimulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2113262250,"The adult male accessory glands of D. melanogaster synthesize and secrete a peptide that represses female sexual receptivity and stimulates oviposition. Normally, this peptide is transferred to females during copulation; however, the peptide shows the same biological activity after purification and subsequent injection into the abdominal cavity of female virgins. Amino acid sequencing of the purified peptide and oligonucleotide-directed cDNA cloning established that the peptide consists of 36 amino acids. It appears to be synthesized as a precursor with a hydrophobic signal sequence of 19 residues at its N-terminal end. The precursor peptide is encoded by a short mRNA that accumulates exclusively in the male accessory gland. The gene has been localized by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes at 70A."
https://openalex.org/W1985278934,"In 1979, a mass poisoning occurred in Taiwan from cooking oil contaminated by thermally degraded polychlorinated biphenyls. Because these chemicals persist in human tissue, children born to female patients after the outbreak were exposed in utero. In 1985, 117 children born to affected women and 108 unexposed controls were examined and evaluated. The exposed children were shorter and lighter than controls; they had abnormalities of gingiva, skin, nails, teeth, and lungs more frequently than did controls. The exposed children showed delay of developmental milestones, deficits on formal developmental testing, and abnormalities on behavioral assessment. These findings are most consistent with a generalized disorder of ectodermal tissue. This syndrome is one of very few documented to result from transplacental exposure to pollutant chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W2069584591,"Proto-oncogene fos encodes a nuclear protein that appears to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of some genes. fos protein (p55fos) is associated with other nuclear proteins in complexes that bind to regulatory regions containing TPA-responsive promoter elements (TREs). The enhancer-binding activator protein 1 (AP-1), which is the specific binding factor of a TRE, is the product of the nuclear proto-oncogene jun. We show that one of the fos-associated proteins, p39, is immunologically and structurally related to nuclear factor AP-1. The sequence TGACTCA, which is the consensus minimal binding site of AP-1, is also recognized by gel-purified p39. In HeLa cell extracts p55fos and p39jun are associated in a nucleoprotein complex that interacts with a TRE. Cooperation between nuclear oncoproteins fos and jun is required for full activation of transcription from a TPA-responsive promoter element in transfected mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2015176049,"The interaction between receptors and guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins leads to G protein activation and subsequent regulation of effector enzymes. The molecular basis of receptor-G protein interaction has been examined by using the ability of the G protein from rods (transducin) to cause a conformational change in rhodopsin as an assay. Synthetic peptides corresponding to two regions near the carboxyl terminus of the G protein alpha subunit, Glu311-Val328 and Ile340-Phe350, compete with G protein for interaction with rhodopsin. Amino acid substitution studies show that Cys321 is required for this effect. Ile340-Phe350 and a modified peptide, acetyl-Glu311-Lys329-amide, mimic G protein effects on rhodopsin conformation, showing that these peptides bind to and stabilize the activated conformation of rhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W1597778600,"The action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in releasing intracellular Ca2+ is shown to be competitively and potently antagonized by the glycosaminoglycan, heparin. Using either permeabilized cells of the DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cell line, or an isolated microsomal membrane fraction derived from intact cells, heparin (4-6 kDa) at 10 micrograms/ml was observed to completely block the action of InsP3 in releasing Ca2+ accumulated via the ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump. In permeabilized cells, heparin had no effect on Ca2+ pump activity or on passive Ca2+ fluxes contributing to equilibrium Ca2+ accumulation. Heparin up to 100 micrograms/ml had no effect on the GTP-activated Ca2+ translocation process previously characterized in this cell line. Half-maximal inhibition of Ca2+ release activated by 10 microM InsP3 occurred with heparin at approximately 0.6 and 0.2 microgram/ml in permeabilized cells and isolated microsomes, respectively. Using microsomes, InsP3 dose-response curves in the presence and absence of 0.2 microgram/ml heparin (approximately 40 nM) revealed a 10-fold increase in apparent Km for InsP3 (0.31 microM in the absence of heparin) with no change in Vmax, indicating a competitive action of heparin. The results revealed a very high apparent affinity of heparin for the InsP3 active site, with a calculated Ki value of 2.7 nM. Heparin was shown to rapidly (within 20 s) reverse prior full activation of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release returning the Ca2+ equilibrium back to that observed without InsP3. This reversal occurs even after prolonged (6 min) InsP3 activation. These results indicate a specific, high affinity, and competitive antagonism of the InsP3 active site by heparin. The rapidly induced reversal of InsP3-activated Ca2+ release by heparin strongly suggests that InsP3 directly activates a channel which remains open only while InsP3 is associated and closes immediately upon InsP3 dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1528246310,"An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (CenA) and an exo-beta-1,4-glucanase (Cex) were prepared from Escherichia coli expressing recombinant DNA of the cellulolytic bacterium Cellulomonas fimi. Purification was facilitated by the high affinities of these enzymes for cellulose. An extracellular C. fimi protease cleaved both enzymes in vivo in a highly specific manner. The affinity of the parent enzyme for cellulose was contained independently in an amino-terminal fragment (p20) of CenA and a carboxyl-terminal fragment (p8) of Cex. These fragments contained homologous amino acid sequences which were proposed to comprise cellulose binding domains. Corresponding fragments, p30 from CenA and p35 from Cex, which were unable to bind to cellulose, contained catalytic domains. In both enzymes, the two functional domains were joined by a hinge region consisting solely of prolyl and threonyl residues. The binding domain was excised from CenA by proteolytic cleavage immediately adjacent to the carboxyl terminus of this hinge. Cex was cleaved at an exactly analogous site. p30 and p35 retained several of the catalytic functions of their parent enzymes. However, p30 was less active than intact CenA against microcrystalline cellulose implying a critical role for the binding domain of CenA in the hydrolysis of crystalline substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2000110243,"Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed precursor B lymphocytes from sci (severe combined immunodeficient) mice, like A-MuLV transformants from normal mice, actively rearrange segments of their lg heavy chain variable region gene locus during growth in culture. Targeting of recombination to appropriate segments appears normal in these lines as evidenced by initial rearrangement of sequences from within the D and JH locus to from aberrant “DJH” rearrangements and secondary rearrangement of sequences from within the VH locus to the aberrant “DJH” intermediates. A detailed analysis of the joints in these rearrangements indicates that the VDJ recombinase in scid pre-B cells can correctly recognize heptamer-nonamer signal sequences and perform precise endonucleolytic scissions at these sequences. We propose that the scid defect involves the inability of scid precursor lymphocytes to join correctly the cleaved ends of the coding strands of variable region gene segments."
https://openalex.org/W1509307264,"Challenge of human peripheral blood leukocytes with ionophore A23187 resulted in leukotriene (LT) synthesis, a decrease in total cellular 5-lipoxygenase activity, and a change in the subcellular localization of the enzyme. In homogenates from control cells, greater than 90% of the 5-lipoxygenase activity and protein was localized in the cytosol (100,000 X g supernatant). Ionophore challenge (2 microM) resulted in a loss of approximately 55% of the enzymatic activity and 35% of the enzyme protein from the cytosol. Concomitantly, there was an accumulation of inactive 5-lipoxygenase in the membrane (100,000 X g pellets) which accounted for at least 45% of the lost cytosolic protein. There was a good correlation between the quantities of LT synthesized and 5-lipoxygenase recovered in the membrane over an ionophore concentration range of 0.1-6 microM. The time course of the membrane association was similar to that of LT synthesis. Furthermore, although the pellet-associated enzyme recovered from ionophore-treated leukocytes was inactive, an irreversible, Ca2+-dependent membrane association of active 5-lipoxygenase could be demonstrated in cell-free systems. To determine whether ionophore treatment induced proteolytic degradation of 5-lipoxygenase, the total activity and protein content of 10,000 X g supernatants from control and ionophore-treated cells were examined. These supernatants, which included both cytosolic and membrane-associated enzyme, showed a 35% loss of 5-lipoxygenase activity but only an 8% loss of enzyme protein as a result of ionophore challenge (2 microM). Therefore, the majority of the loss of 5-lipoxygenase activity was most likely due to suicide inactivation during the LT synthesis, rather than to proteolytic degradation. Together these results are consistent with the hypothesis that ionophore treatment results in a Ca2+-dependent translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to a membrane-bound site, that the membrane-associated enzyme is preferentially utilized for LT synthesis, and that it is consequently inactivated. Thus, membrane translocation of 5-lipoxygenase may be an important initial step in the chain of events leading to full activation of this enzyme in the intact leukocyte."

https://openalex.org/W1481197108,"We have purified a novel GTP-binding protein (G protein) with a Mr of about 24,000 to homogeneity from bovine brain membranes (Kikuchi, A., Yamashita, T., Kawata, M., Yamamoto, K., Ikeda, K., Tanimoto, T., and Takai, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2897-2904). In the present studies, we have isolated and sequenced the cDNA of this G protein from a bovine brain cDNA library using oligonucleotide probes designed from the partial amino acid sequences. The cDNA of the G protein has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 220 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 24,954. This G protein is designated as the smg-25A protein (smg p25A). The amino acid sequence deduced from the smg-25A cDNA contains the consensus sequences of GTP-binding and GTPase domains. smg p25A shares about 28 and 44% amino acid homology with the ras and ypt1 proteins, respectively. In addition to this cDNA, we have isolated two other homologous cDNAs encoding G proteins of 219 and 227 amino acids with calculated Mr values of 24,766 and 25,975, respectively. These G proteins are designated as the smg-25B and smg-25C proteins (smg p25B and smg p25C), respectively. The amino acid sequences deduced from the three smg-25 cDNAs are highly homologous with one another in the overall sequences except for C-terminal 32 amino acids. Moreover, three smg p25s have a consensus C-terminal sequence, Cys-X-Cys, which is different from the known C-terminal consensus sequences of the ras and ypt1 proteins, Cys-X-X-X and Cys-Cys, respectively. These results together with the biochemical properties of smg p25A described previously indicate that three smg p25s constitute a novel G protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1539663343,"Coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) is isolated from porcine blood as a set of three heterodimers because of proteolytic cleavages in the middle, or B region, of the parent single-chain molecule. A single 80-kDa COOH-terminal fragment, the light chain (fVIIILC), is associated with one of three forms of heavy chain (fVIIIHCs) by a calcium-dependent linkage. The purified heterodimers were dissociated using EDTA and fVIIILC, and fVIIIHCs were isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. The association of fVIII, fVIIILC, and fVIIIHCs with multimeric human von Willebrand factor (vWF) was studied using analytical velocity sedimentation. A previous study using this method with an intact, single heterodimeric species of fVIII has shown that one molecule of fVIII can bind to each subunit of vWF (Lollar, P., and Parker, C.G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17572-17576). fVIIILC bound vWF as judged by the increase in the plateau height and sedimentation coefficient of the fVIIILC.vWF complex compared to vWF at 42,000 x g and by the decrease in the plateau height of the 4.8 S fVIIILC boundary sedimenting at 240,000 x g. Titration of a fixed concentration of fVIIILC with vWF yielded a stoichiometry of one fVIIILC molecule per subunit of vWF. Proteolytic cleavage by thrombin to remove an acidic 41-residue NH2-terminal peptide from fVIIILC completely abolished its binding to vWF. In contrast, no binding of fVIIIHCs to vWF was observed. Additionally, intact fVIII bound to vWF was completely dissociated after proteolysis by thrombin. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a critical step in blood coagulation is the release of all regions of fVIII from vWF following a single proteolytic cleavage of fVIIILC."
https://openalex.org/W2084057118,"The weakest pulse of light a human can detect sends about 100 photons through the pupil and produces 10-20 rhodopsin isomerizations in a small retinal area. It has been postulated that we cannot see single photons because of a retinal noise arising from randomly occurring thermal isomerizations. Direct recordings have since demonstrated the existence of electrical 'dark' rod events indistinguishable from photoisomerization signals. Their mean rate of occurrence is roughly consistent with the 'dark light' in psychophysical threshold experiments, and their thermal parameters justify an identification with thermal isomerizations. In the retina of amphibians, a small proportion of sensitive ganglion cells have a performance-limiting noise that is low enough to be well accounted for by these events. Here we study the performance of dark-adapted toads and frogs and show that the performance limit of visually guided behaviour is also set by thermal isomerizations. As visual sensitivity limited by thermal events should rise when the temperature falls, poikilothermous vertebrates living at low temperatures should then reach light sensitivities unattainable by mammals and birds with optical factors equal. Comparison of different species at different temperatures shows a correlation between absolute threshold intensities and estimated thermal isomerization rates in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1574150827,"We have isolated overlapping cDNA clones representing the full length (4038 base pairs) transcript for murine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase. The coding sequence predicts a membrane-bound glycoprotein with three distinct structural features, a large COOH-terminal domain (355 amino acids), a single transmembrane domain (20 amino acids), and a short NH2-terminal domain. Primer extension analysis, S1 protection analysis, and RNA blotting demonstrate the presence of two sets of mRNA transcripts which differ in length by about 200 base pairs. The 5' boundary of the long transcripts maps upstream of two in-frame ATGs. The 5' boundary of the short transcripts maps between these two ATGs. These results predict that two related forms of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase of 399 and 386 amino acids are synthesized as a consequence of alternative translation initiation. The long form (399 amino acids) has an NH2-terminal extension of 13 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1562570231,"The plasma fraction (referred to as plasma-CPB) of silkworm hemolymph, from which a protein with affinity to beta-1,3-glucan was specifically removed according to Yoshida et al. (Yoshida, H., Ochiai, M., and Ashida, M. (1986), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 141, 1177-1184), was used to develop a method for quantitating the beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein of the prophenoloxidase activating system. In principle, a sample was judged to contain beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein when that sample could restore the ability of the system in plasma-CPB to be triggered by beta-1,3-glucan. Purification procedures for the recognition protein from silkworm hemolymph consisted of fractionation with ammonium sulfate, chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl, Affi-Gel-heparin, and Mono Q and Superose 12 on the fast protein liquid chromatography system of Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. About 2.03 mg of beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein was obtained from 300 ml of hemolymph. The purified beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. beta-1,3-Glucan recognition protein had a molecular mass of 62 kDa composed of a single polypeptide and an isoelectric point of pH 4.3. It bound to curdlan beads (composed of beta-1,3-glucan with average particle size of 80 micron) in the absence of divalent cation, whereas its binding to glucans with beta(1—-4)- or alpha(1—-6)-glycosidic linkages was not detected under the experimental conditions. Elution of the beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein bound to curdlan beads could be achieved under strongly denaturing conditions (after incubation of the beads with sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol in boiling water for 5 min), but elution at room temperature was poor. Since beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein is the only protein in silkworm plasma with strong affinity to beta-1,3-glucan and endows the prophenoloxidase activating system in plasma-CPB with the ability to be triggered by beta-1,3-glucan, it was concluded that binding of the purified beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein with beta-1,3-glucan causes the triggering of the prophenol-oxidase activating system in silkworm plasma. However, the nature of the activity that is generated as the result of binding is not yet known. The purified beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein bound to beta-1,3-glucan did not hydrolyze appreciably any of the 26 commercially available peptidyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarins, substrates for various proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1596387343,"A cDNA clone has been isolated from mRNA derived from the monocytic cell line U937, which detects an mRNA that is present and inducible by gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) in cells of the hematopoietic lineage and absent but inducible in non-hematopoietic cells. Following recombinant IFN gamma (rIFN gamma) treatment, mRNA accumulation can be detected within 30 min, plateaus at 24 h, and remains elevated for several days. This mRNA accumulation is due, at least in part, to increased transcription and is not inhibited by cycloheximide, although cycloheximide alone induces both mRNA accumulation and transcription of this gene. rIFN gamma is a more potent inducing agent than either rIFN alpha or rIFN beta. Polyclonal monospecific antiserum raised to the longest open reading frame expressed in Escherichia coli immunoprecipitates multiple polypeptides that are inducible by rIFN gamma in human monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes. In pulse-chase experiments analyzed under reducing conditions, a 30-kDa polypeptide (referred to as IP-30) is either secreted or converted intracellularly into a 25-kDa protein; when analyzed under nonreducing conditions, the two intracellular forms have apparent molecular masses of 25 and 20 kDa, and the extracellular protein is found in two forms of apparent molecular mass 50 and 25 kDa. These data suggest that the intracellular form contains intrachain disulfide bonds, and the extracellular form is involved in both intrachain and interchain disulfide bonding. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy reveals a punctate fluorescence pattern in monocytes consistent with a vesicular subcellular location. These data are consistent with IP-30 being a novel IFN gamma-inducible protein which may be lysosomal in location."

To explore the possibility that these events might involve a receptor-mediated pathway, receptors for serotonin or acetylcholine (M1 muscarinic) were expressed in the Xenopus egg; serotonin or acetylcholine then could initiate a series of responses similar to those normally initiated by sperm. Thus, there may be an endogenous receptor in the egg membrane that is activated by sperm, and the serotonin or M1 muscarinic receptor may replace the sperm receptor in this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1532237356,"Nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated glycopeptides containing the entire carbohydrate sequence of the glycosaminoglycan-specific linkage region were isolated after exhaustive enzymatic digestions of Swarm rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycans with chondroitinase ABC, papain, and Pronase. Their structures were examined by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The nonsulfated compound has the following structure with trace amounts of a few additional amino acids: delta 4,5-GlcA beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Xyl beta 1-O-Ser. The monosulfated compound has an ester sulfate on C-4 of the GalNAc residue and the disulfated compound has an additional hitherto unrecognized ester sulfate on C-4 of the second galactose residue which is remote from the innermost xylose. This new structure was confirmed by two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy. The molar ratio of the isolated nonsulfated, monosulfated, and disulfated compounds was 53:37:10 based on the serine contents. Biological significance of the newly found sulfated linkage structure is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1586717843,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) extracted from the deep rough mutant of Escherichia coli D31m4 was disaggregated with 0.1 M EDTA, pH 7.0, and fractionated on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column to yield the biphosphate form of LPS. After methylation, the derivative was purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18-bonded silica cartridge. A linear gradient of 50-100% isopropyl alcohol/water (93:7, v/v) in acetonitrile/water (93:7, v/v) was used over a period of 60 min. The derivatized LPS showed a single major peak by high performance liquid chromatography, and this hexamethyl hexaacyl LPS was recovered and subjected to chemical analysis, plasma desorption mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Chemical analysis of the purified hexamethyl LPS quantitated certain key chemical compositions. Plasma desorption mass spectrometry showed a molecular ion (M + CH2 + Na)+ at m/z 2360, which established the molecular formula and Mr to be C116H214N2O39P2 and 2323, respectively. Thus, it contained two each of glucosamine, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate, and phosphate; four beta-hydroxymyristates; one laurate; and one myristate. NMR spectroscopy confirmed the locations of the four ester-linked fatty acyl groups. Based on these results and the known structure of free lipid A, the complete structure of the deep-rough chemotype LPS from E. coli can now be presented with confidence. This is the first report of a successful purification to homogeneity and the characterization of the simplest of the LPS at the intact level. This study shows that the natural distribution of the lipid A moiety of LPS from E. coli D31m4 is hexaacyl/pentaacyl in a molar ratio of greater than 90:less than 10. Acid hydrolysis of LPS causes the formation of the lower homologues of the free lipid A."
https://openalex.org/W1572438023,"Abstract Subcellular fractions were prepared from human neutrophils by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and analyzed for Gi-like proteins by pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation and by immunoblotting with rabbit antiserum AS/6 which recognizes purified transducin and Gi, but not Gs or Go alpha-subunits. In resting cells, approximately equal to 60% of pertussis toxin substrate retrieved from the sucrose density gradient localized to the plasma membrane-enriched fraction, approximately equal to 35% to the specific granule-enriched fraction, and approximately equal to 5% to cytosol. The azurophil granule-enriched fraction did not contain pertussis toxin substrate. In contrast to plasma membrane, the specific granule-enriched fraction demonstrated increased AS/6 immunoreactivity of a approximately equal to 41-kDa protein relative to a approximately equal to 40-kDa protein. Within the specific granule-enriched fraction, the peak of pertussis toxin substrate detected immunochemically or by [32P]ADP-ribosylation sedimented at a lighter density (rho = 1.6 g/ml) than did lactoferrin (rho = 1.19 g/ml), suggesting that the intracellular compartment bearing pertussis toxin substrate may not be the lactoferrin containing specific granule, per se. Furthermore, in neutrophils exposed to 10(-8) M N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, a weak degranulating stimulus (7% lactoferrin degranulation), there was a 31-42% decline in pertussus toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of approximately equal to 40-41-kDa proteins in the specific granule-enriched fraction accompanied by a near-quantitative increase in labeling of plasma membrane. The pool of intracellular formyl peptide receptors localized to the specific granule-enriched fraction appeared functionally coupled to a cosedimenting G-protein in experiments demonstrating modulation of high affinity N-formylmethionylleucyl[3H]phenylalanine binding by guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate or pertussis toxin. The data indicate that neutrophils contain a surface translocatable pool of intracellular G-protein sedimenting in the specific granule-enriched fraction and support the view that mobilization of intracellular G-protein represents a mechanism by which cells can regulate receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2044465687,"We have aligned the molecular map of the North locus to the cytological features of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of D. melanogaster in order to determine the interphase chromatin structure of this gene. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization and computer-aided optical microscope data collection and image analysis, we have determined that the coding portions and introns of the Notch gene, which is not expressed in this tissue, are all contained within the polytene chromosome band 3C7. The portion of the Notch gene that resides 5′ to the start of transcription lies in an open chromatin conformation, the interband between bands 3C6 and 3C7. Our data are most consistent with condensation of the chromosomal DNA into 30 nm fibers in this polytene band."
https://openalex.org/W1797689684,"Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs widely employed as anxiolytics and anticonvulsants, can induce impairments of learning and memory. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), could enhance learning and memory. Pretraining injection of flumazenil (2.5 to 40.0 mg/kg) was found to enhance both learning and memory in a test requiring young mice to discriminate the correct arm of a T-maze to escape mild electric shock. In a second test, which required mice to passively avoid a dark chamber after shock, flumazenil pretreatment prevented the occurrence of amnesia induced by the cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine. It is hypothesized that flumazenil may facilitate learning or memory processes by reversing a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2402354430,"The transport of the apolipoprotein (apo) constituents of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) through the secretory pathway was investigated with estrogen-induced chick hepatocytes in primary culture. Cell monolayers were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine and, after differing periods of chase with unlabeled leucine, were subjected to subcellular fractionation for 3H-apoprotein analysis. The first-order rate constants for transit of apoB, apoA-I, and apoII through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi were estimated using a three-compartment (ER, Golgi, and extracellular medium) kinetic analysis. The results indicate that apoB resides in the ER (t1/2 = 26 min) for a shorter period of time than in the Golgi (t1/2 = 43 min). For apoII, the t1/2 for transport through the ER and Golgi are 43 and 49 min, respectively. ApoA-I transits the ER at a rate (t1/2 = 6 min) much faster than apoB, apoII, and virtually all other secretory proteins. Upon reaching the Golgi, the rate of movement of apoA-I is markedly reduced (t1/2 = 28 min). Thus, in contrast to current models of protein secretion, the rate-limiting step in the secretion of VLDL apoproteins from the cell is transport through the Golgi, not the ER. Examination of the steady-state distribution of the apoproteins in the ER and Golgi support this conclusion. To characterize the intracellular transport process further, the distribution of apoproteins between the lumenal contents of the ER and Golgi and the membranes which delineate these compartments was determined after steady-state labeling with [3H]leucine. Approximately 50% of the apoB in the ER and in a dense, early Golgi fraction was membrane-associated, whereas in a less dense or late Golgi compartment, only 20% was bound to membranes. ApoII was also associated with the membranes of the ER and Golgi to a significant extent. In contrast, apoA-I was primarily localized lumenally throughout the secretory pathway. The occurrence of membrane-associated apoproteins in the Golgi, coupled with their slow rate of transit through this compartment suggests a major role for the Golgi in the assembly of the constituents of VLDL, and suggests that interaction of apoproteins (apoB) with the membranes of the Golgi is required for the maturation of VLDL."

https://openalex.org/W14392721,The effect of DNA upstream of the -35 region on promoter function was examined using two promoters isolated from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SP82. The affinity of RNA polymerase for the two promoters in vitro differed significantly. For each promoter the nucleotide sequence of the upstream DNA was characterized by the presence of successive runs of adenines with a 10-11-base pair periodicity. DNA fragments with the polyadenine-containing upstream DNA displayed aberrant electrophoretic mobilities when analyzed on polyacrylamide gels indicative of curved DNA. A series of mutant promoters in which the upstream DNA was deleted or altered was constructed. The curved DNA upstream of the -35 region was required for efficient RNA polymerase binding. Decreased in vitro transcription observed when the upstream DNA was deleted could be partially restored if the template was negatively supercoiled. Measurements of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity from B. subtilis strains carrying transcriptional fusions indicate that the curved upstream DNA stimulated transcription from the promoter with the weaker affinity for RNA polymerase. The curved DNA reduced the in vivo activity of the promoter with the strong affinity for RNA polymerase. One function of the curved upstream DNA may be to provide RNA polymerase-promoter interactions that facilitate open complex formation.
https://openalex.org/W1536505229,"In Escherichia coli biotin biosynthesis is repressed by high concentrations of exogenous biotin. This paper reports that upon high level production of the apo form of a biotinated protein, biotin operon expression was derepressed by 8-10-fold. The biotinated protein studied was the 1.3 S subunit of Propionibacterium shermanii, and transcarboxylase derepression was assayed by beta-galactosidase production in strains which carry a lacZ gene altered such that it is transcribed from biotin operon promoters. Depression of beta-galactosidase synthesis upon production of the apo 1.3 S protein was observed over a several hundred-fold range of biotin concentrations and also resulted in an increased level of biotin operon expression at maximally repressing biotin concentrations. Biotin operon derepression by apobiotin protein production seems a direct consequence of the properties of the biotin repressor protein which also functions as the ligase catalyzing the covalent attachment of biotin to apoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574765020,"Abstract The regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity by the polyamine derivatives N1,N8-bis(ethyl)-spermidine and N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine was studied using a line of L1210 cells resistant to alpha-difluoromethylornithine (D-R cells), which contain very high levels of ODC, and a synthetic mRNA prepared from a plasmid containing an insert corresponding to ODC mRNA adjacent to an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. Studies in which ODC protein was labeled in the D-R cells by exposure to [35S]methionine indicated that the polyamine derivatives and their physiological counterparts led to an increased rate of degradation of ODC and to a rapid reduction in ODC synthesis without affecting the content of ODC mRNA. Direct evidence that the polyamine derivatives act by inhibiting the translation of the ODC mRNA was obtained by studying their effects on the translation of ODC mRNA in reticulocyte lysates. This translation was strongly inhibited by the addition of N1,N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine, spermidine, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine, or spermine but was not affected much by putrescine. The inhibition of the translation of ODC mRNA by either of the bis(ethyl) polyamine derivatives occurred at concentrations which stimulated total protein synthesis showing the selectivity of the reduction in ODC. The effects of polyamine derivatives and polyamines on translation of the plasmid-derived ODC mRNA were identical with those found with the D-R L1210 cell mRNA. This synthetic ODC mRNA lacks 261 bases of the 5'-leader sequences and 200 bases plus the poly(A) section from the 3'-nontranslated sequence. Therefore, these regions appear not to influence sensitivity of the ODC mRNA to inhibition of translation by polyamine derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1503947753,"The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains two citrate synthase isoenzymes, mitochondrial (CS1) and cytosolic (CS2). In this study, we have examined the metabolic consequences of the absence of CS1, CS2, and both isoenzymes in the respective mutant strains CS1-, CS2-, and CS1-CS2-. No significant differences were found in the growth rates of the parental, CS1-, or CS2- strains when grown in the single carbon sources galactose, glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, or glutamate. However, in nonfermentable carbon sources, the lag period in growth of CS1- was approximately 4 times that of the parental strain and the CS2- mutant. This difference was found even in glutamate. The CS1- mutant failed to grow on acetate in either complete or minimal liquid medium. Total cellular citrate concentration in the CS1- compared to the parental strain was higher when the cells were grown in lactate or pyruvate. On these same substrates, the malate concentration was 2-fold higher in the CS1-mutant when compared to the parental or CS2- strains. The production of 14CO2 by CS1- from [1-14C]acetate was 36% and that from [2-14C]acetate was 9.2% of the amount from the parental or CS2- strains. The 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glutamate was 28% and 20% in CS1- and CS1-CS2-, respectively, compared to the parental strain. Since these results are not easily explained solely by the absence of mitochondrial citrate synthase enzyme, we also determined the activity of some other enzymes of the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. We found decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and aconitase, while the rest of the citric acid cycle enzymes and oxidative enzymes did not change significantly. The same changes in enzyme activities were found in two different yeast strains carrying the same citrate synthase mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1493943284,"The hepatic metabolism of 1,omega-dodecanedioic acid, a physiologically relevant representative of the medium-chain dicarboxylic acid family, has been studied by a combination of in vivo and in vitro 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques. Rats in different nutritional or hormonal situations were infused with [1,12-13C2]- or [1,2,11,12-13C4]dodecanedioic acid, and the kinetics of 13C label appearance as well as the final relative concentrations of metabolic products were measured noninvasively in the liver of the intact rat by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Perchloric acid and chloroform/methanol extracts of liver biopsies obtained at the end of the infusion period were further analyzed by high resolution 13C NMR and one-dimensional and two-dimensional COSY and J-resolved 1H NMR. [1-13C]- and [1,2-13C2]adipic acids were the main end products of the in vivo metabolism of [1,12-13C2]- or [1,2,11,12-13C4]dodecanedioic acids, respectively, indicating that the beta-oxidation pathway of medium-chain dicarboxylic acids proceeds in situ monodirectionally. [1-13C]Adipic acid, the main product of peroxisomal beta-oxidation, could also be detected in situ. This finding, together with the in vivo and in vitro absence of signals characteristic of intramitochondrial oxidation of [1-13C]acetyl-coenzyme A, provide a strong evidence supporting a predominant contribution of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system to the overall oxidation of these compounds in vivo. Homonuclear two-dimensional COSY 1H NMR spectra of acid extracts from rat liver provided a convenient method of analyzing the metabolic repercussions of dicarboxylic acid accumulation, revealing a decrease in the hepatic concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate and an accumulation of adipic acid and the amino acid L-lysine."
https://openalex.org/W147446370,"Enzymatic heme oxygenase activity has been partially purified from extracts of the unicellular red alga Cyanidium caldarium, and the macromolecular components have been separated into three protein fractions, referred to as Fractions I, II, and III, by serial column chromatography through DEAE-cellulose and Reactive Blue 2-Sepharose. Fraction I is retained by DEAE-cellulose at low salt concentration and eluted by 1 M NaCl. Fraction II is retained by Blue Sepharose at low salt concentration and eluted by 1 M NaCl. Fraction III is retained on 2′,5′-ADP-agarose and eluted by 1 mM NADPH, while Fraction II is not retained on ADP-agarose. Fractions I-III, have Mr values of 22,000, 38,000, and 37,000, respectively (all +/- 2,000), as determined by Sephadex gel filtration chromatography. In vitro heme oxygenase activity requires the presence of all three fractions, plus substrate, O2, reduced pyridine nucleotide, and another reductant. Ascorbate, isoascorbate, and phenylenediamine serve equally well as the second reductant, but hydroquinone can also be used, with lower activity resulting. Fractions I-III are heat sensitive and inactive by Pronase digestion. Fraction I has a visible absorption spectrum similar to that of ferredoxin and is bleached by dithionite reduction or incubation with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Fraction I can be replaced by commercially available ferredoxin derived from the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis, and to a smaller extent, by spinach ferredoxin. Fraction III contains ferredoxin-linked cytochrome c reductase activity and can be partially replaced by spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase. Reconstituted heme oxygenase and ferredoxin-linked cytochrome c reductase activities are both abolished if Fraction I or III is preincubated with 0.1 mM p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, but heme oxygenase activity is only slightly affected if Fraction II is preincubated with p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Preincubation of Fraction II with 0.5 mM diethylpyrocarbonate inactivates heme oxygenase in the reconstituted system, and 10 microM mesohemin partially protects this Fraction against diethylpyrocarbonate inactivation. Algal heme oxygenase is inhibited 80% by 2 microM Sn-protoporphyrin even in the presence of 20 microM mesohemin. Fraction II is rate limiting in unfractionated and reconstituted incubation mixtures. None of the three cell fractions could be replaced by bovine spleen microsomal heme oxygenase or NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1528206681,"A 50-kDa protein was recognized in rat embryo fibroblast 3Y1 cells with an affinity-purified antibody against rat brain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). When the cytosolic extract from quiescent 3Y1 cells was immunoprecipitated with the antibody, the 50-kDa protein in the immunoprecipitate became phosphorylated in a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent manner following exposure to [gamma-32P]ATP. Moreover, the reaction proceeded through an intramolecular mechanism. These results suggest that the 50-kDa protein is a subunit of CaM kinase II in rat 3Y1 cells. The addition of 10% fetal calf serum to quiescent 3Y1 cells caused a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of the 50-kDa protein, which was immunoprecipitated with the affinity-purified anti-CaM kinase II antibody. The phosphorylation of CaM kinase II was detected as early as 20 s after the addition of serum, reached the maximal level at 2 min, and decreased to the basal level within 60 min. Platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor also elicited the phosphorylation of the 50-kDa protein in quiescent 3Y1 cells, while neither insulin nor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did. Calcium ionophores, A23187 and ionomycin, also caused the phosphorylation of the protein in 3Y1 cells. Moreover, phosphopeptide mappings of the phosphorylated 50-kDa subunit generated in response to serum, EGF, and A23187 yielded patterns similar to that generated from the immunoprecipitated 50-kDa subunit phosphorylated in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated subunit demonstrated that serine residue was the major amino acid labeled under any condition. These results suggest that CaM kinase II undergoes phosphorylation in response to various stimuli that can increase the free Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm of quiescent fibroblast cells and therefore probably mediates at least some of the biological actions of growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1556741602,"Using radiation inactivation we determined that p21 ras proteins exhibit an oligomeric target size when assayed both structurally and functionally. Similar target sizes of p21 in ras-transformed cells and in purified preparations of the protein suggested that its structure is homo-oligomeric. p21 monomers were destroyed by radiation with the same target size as the GTP binding activity, indicating the occurrence of a tight association allowing energy transfer between the monomers. Irradiation in the presence of GTP, dithiothreitol, or EDTA did not change the target size. Normal (Gly12) and transforming (Lys12) forms of the protein exhibited similar target sizes. The homo-oligomeric structure suggests that p21 ras proteins do not conform to the structure of monomeric alpha subunits in classical G proteins (alpha beta gamma heterotrimers) and establishes similarities with other homo-oligomeric proteins (such as Escherichia coli CRP) which acquire the active conformation through subunit reorientation upon nucleotide binding."
https://openalex.org/W1551884923,"Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase was inhibited by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and irreversibly inactivated after sodium borohydride reduction of the enzyme-pyridoxal-P complex. The irreversible inactivation by pyridoxal-P was opposed by the presence of the substrate UDP-glucose. With [3H]pyridoxal-P, covalent incorporation of 3H label into the enzyme could be monitored. UDP-glucose protected against 3H incorporation, whereas glucose-6-P was ineffective. Peptide mapping of tryptic digests indicated that two distinct peptides were specifically modified by pyridoxal-P. One of these peptides contained the NH2-terminal sequence of the glycogen synthase subunit. Chymotrypsin cleavage of this peptide resulted in a single-labeled fragment with the sequence: Glu-Val-Ala-Asn-(Pyridoxal-P-Lys)-Val-Gly-Gly-Ile-Tyr. This sequence is identical to that previously reported (Tagaya, M., Nakano, K., and Fukui, T. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260. 6670-6676) for a peptide specifically modified by a substrate analogue and inferred to form part of the active site of the enzyme. Sequence analysis revealed that the modified lysine was located at residue 38 from the NH2 terminus of the rabbit muscle glycogen synthase subunit. An analogous tryptic peptide obtained from the rabbit liver isozyme displayed a high degree of sequence homology in the vicinity of the modified lysine. We propose that the extreme NH2 terminus of the glycogen synthase subunit forms part of the catalytic site, in close proximity to one of the phosphorylated regions of the enzyme (site 2, serine 7). In addition, the work extends the known NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of both the liver and muscle glycogen synthase isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1536594497,"Abstract Mature alpha-amylase of Bacillus subtilis is known to be formed from its precursor by removal of the NH2-terminal 41-amino acid sequence. To study the mechanism of this processing, the extracellular forms of alpha-amylase were analyzed for B. subtilis N7 alpha-amylase cloned and expressed in B. subtilis. The major form (form N34) isolated from log phase cultures in L-broth had an NH2 terminus corresponding to position 34 from the initiator Met but appeared to be microheterogeneous, as judged by native gel electrophoresis. The major forms from stationary phase cultures had NH2 termini at positions 40 (form N40) or 42 (form N42) and were homogeneous. The conversion of the larger to smaller forms could be achieved in culture supernatants or partially purified samples. The process N34----N40 was inhibited by EDTA; N40----N42 was facilitated by Ca2+. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the former but not the latter process. These results suggest that the signal peptidase cleavage site 30 decreases 35 is -Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Ala-Glu-Thr- (arrow or further upstream) and that proteolytic maturation occurs after secretion, which involves at least two different processing enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1536921551,"Abstract Transcription of the Bacillus subtilis pur operon is regulated independently by adenine and guanine nucleotides (Ebbole, D. J., and Zalkin, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8274-8287). Guanine nucleotides regulate transcription by a termination-antitermination mechanism in a 242-nucleotide, 5'-untranslated mRNA leader region. We have identified an apparently intact, terminated transcript of approximately 200 nucleotides in length, having a half-life of about 0.7 min. The terminated transcript is degraded in a series of discrete steps resulting in the accumulation of stable intermediates in vivo. We have used Northern blot analysis, primer extension, and nuclease S1 mapping to align the degradation intermediates with the nucleotide sequence and assign secondary structures that may contribute to the stability of the intermediates. Degradation is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the approximately 200-nucleotide terminated transcript generating approximately 93- and approximately 97-nucleotide 5' and 3' moieties, respectively. The approximately 93-nucleotide 5' and approximately 97-nucleotide 3' intermediates are further degraded to approximately 88 and approximately 58 nucleotides, respectively. The 5'-end of pur operon mRNA and the attenuated transcript are degraded by different pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2123947712,"Abstract We have recently shown that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase forms poly(ADP-ribose) by adding ADP-ribose residues to the polymerase-proximal end of an enzyme-bound nascent chain. In this light we have reexamined the mode of hydrolysis of enzyme-bound poly(ADP-ribose) by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase. When the substrate has been labeled by a pulse-chase protocol, soluble glycohydrolase releases a significant amount of labeled oligomer which can only come from the enzyme-distal (2') end of the polymer. This constitutes additional evidence for the proximal growth of chains. Oligomer is infrequently released from the proximal (1) end of enzyme-bound chains. Rather, the bulk of the poly(ADP-ribose) is digested directly to ADP-ribose monomers. We conclude that poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase starts digestion with an endonucleolytic incision and then removes ADP-ribose residues processively in the 2'----1 direction. Therefore, in contrast to earlier models of polymer growth and hydrolysis, a single poly(ADP-ribose) chain may be extended at one end and simultaneously degraded at the other end. The balance between synthesis and degradation may control the quantity and distribution of polymer around the DNA break which occasions its synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1546993802,"We have examined a defect in complement activation in a mutant trinitrophenyl-binding pentameric murine monoclonal IgM which has serine replacing the proline normally found at position 436 in the protein. The mutant protein showed equivalent hapten binding but a 100-fold decreased ability to initiate complement-dependent lysis of trinitrophenyl-coupled erythrocytes at physiological ionic strength (mu = 0.15). C4b deposition mediated by the mutant protein was impaired to a similar degree. C1 bound by the mutant protein showed C1s to C1-s conversion, suggesting normal activation. When measured at reduced ionic strength (mu = 0.06), the C1 and C1q binding affinity of the mutant protein was approximately one-half that of the wild type. However, the C1 binding affinity of the mutant protein showed a greater dependence upon ionic strength such that at physiological ionic strength we estimate a 50-fold lower C1 binding affinity for the mutant molecule. Kinetic studies suggested that this difference in affinity was largely attributable to differences in association rates. In addition, a fixed proportion of the mutant molecules showed no C1 binding. We conclude that the defect in complement activation occurs at the level of C1 binding. Our data support a role for the C mu 3 domain (residues 340-440) in C1 binding by IgM."
https://openalex.org/W1557874345,"We examined collagens of both normal and vitamin D-deficient chick epiphyseal growth cartilage. Special emphasis was placed on the study of Type X collagen, a recently described product of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Scanning electron microscopy of the epiphyseal growth cartilage of vitamin D-deficient chickens showed an enlarged growth cartilage with a disorganized extracellular matrix. The cartilage collagens were solubilized by proteolytic digestion and disulfide bond reduction of both normal and rachitic growth tissues. Sequential extraction with neutral salt and acetic acid buffers followed by pepsin digestion at 4 degrees C solubilized about 12% of normal tissues and about 7% of collagen from rachitic growth cartilage. Treatment of the pepsin-resistant collagens with neutral salt-dithiothreitol buffer under nondenaturing conditions and a subsequent pepsin digestion increased the yield of solubilized collagen to greater than 95% of the total tissue collagen. Results of the biochemical studies showed a marked increase in the relative proportion of Type X collagen (from 5.6 to 27.9%), a corresponding decrease in the proportions of Types II and IX collagens, and a moderate increase in Type XI collagen in rachitic cartilage. Amino acid analysis indicated that there were no differences in the Types II and X collagens of normal and rachitic cartilage. However, an abnormality in the relative proportions of the CNBr peptides of Type X collagen was detected in the rachitic cartilage. We suggest that the increase in collagen in the rachitic state may reflect increased levels of Type X collagen synthesis by cells in the hypertrophic region. It is likely that in rickets the overproduction of Type X collagen may be a compensatory mechanism by which the hypertrophic chondrocyte attempts to provide a maximum area of calcifiable matrix for the calcium-depleted serum."
https://openalex.org/W1552813563,The 3'-end of the RNA genome of turnip yellow mosaic virus can form a pseudoknotted tRNA-like structure that can be recognized by several tRNA-specific enzymes. We have found that the catalytic RNA component of Bacillus subtilis RNase P can cleave this structure in unusually low ionic strength buffers at a site analogous to the 5'-end of an aminoacyl stem of a tRNA. Most other precursors can only be processed under low ionic strength conditions if the RNase P holoenzyme is used; processing by the catalytic RNA component alone requires a higher ionic strength buffer. The cleavage of the turnip yellow mosaic virus tRNA-like structure demonstrates the importance of the substrate in determining the optimal buffer conditions for this reaction and also shows that high ionic strength buffers are not always necessary for cleavage by the catalytic RNA.
https://openalex.org/W1532126977,"Abstract This paper describes characterization of the reaction of calmodulin with a series of nitrosoureas which are capable of releasing amine-reactive isocyanates of varying hydrophobic character. The site of calcium-dependent carbamoylation on calmodulin by the antineoplastic agent 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea (methyl CCNU) was determined to be Lys-75 as demonstrated using [ring-14C]methyl CCNU and sequence analysis of the sole labeled peptide obtained from tryptic digestion of reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified radiolabeled calmodulin. CCNU, the 4-desmethylcyclohexyl derivative of methyl CCNU, and its reactive hydrolysis product, cyclohexyl isocyanate, were also determined to modify calmodulin in a similar manner and at the same site, as demonstrated by specific blockade of modification by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium. Nitrosoureas which release the less hydrophobic 4-hydroxy- and 4-carboxycyclohexyl isocyanates are unable to modify calmodulin at 25-fold higher concentrations than those required for modification with methyl CCNU, CCNU, or cyclohexyl isocyanate. With this monomodified Lys-75 derivative, purified to homogeneity by HPLC, differential effects of modification on the activation of bovine brain 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (phosphodiesterase) and human erythrocyte Ca2+,Mg2+-ATPase were observed. Compared to the amounts of native calmodulin needed, phosphodiesterase required 7-fold higher amounts of this derivative to reach maximal activation, whereas the activation of the ATPase was unaffected. Clearly, different regions of calmodulin are responsible for the activation of phosphodiesterase and the ATPase. We conclude that Lys-75 is not essential for the function of calmodulin but is in a region of the molecule involved in interaction with phosphodiesterase as well as the binding of certain hydrophobic calmodulin antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1584481364,"Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) is known to phosphorylate the epidermal growth factor receptor and reduce its affinity for epidermal growth factor. Transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts by the oncogenic tyrosine kinase pp60v-src is accompanied by an elevation of cellular diacylglycerol and partial activation of protein kinase C (Wolfman, A., Wingrove, T. G., Blackshear, P. J., and Macara, I. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16546-16552). We therefore asked whether pp60v-src can down-modulate the epidermal growth factor receptor. We report that within 15 min of activating temperature-sensitive pp60v-src, binding of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor to 3T3 cells falls at least 50%. Two distinct processes control the down-modulation by pp60v-src. The first is rapid and transient, while the second requires protein synthesis and persists long after inactivation of pp60v-src. Surprisingly, both mechanisms seem to be protein kinase C-independent. Both operate by decreasing the affinity of the epidermal growth factor receptor for its ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1495622039,"Prohistidine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a normally autoactivates by cleavage of the Ser-81-Ser-82 peptide bond, converting Ser-82 to a pyruvoyl moiety which serves as the enzymatic cofactor. We have used site-directed methods to make two conservative mutations, converting Ser-82 to cysteine (S82C) and threonine (S82T). Both mutant proteins autoactivate, although dramatically (20- to 80-fold), more slowly than wild type. Roughly 55% of the mutant protein in each case undergoes a nonproductive chain cleavage which does not result in cofactor production. This finding suggests that an important feature in the enzyme's evolution has been development of an activation scheme which minimizes nonproductive side reactions. Catalytic constants are also affected by the mutations, particularly kcat which drops 8-fold in S82C and 450-fold in S82T. In addition, the S82T protein activates to produce a novel alpha-ketobutyroyl cofactor."

The present paper reports solid-state 13C NMR experiments on lyophilized intact inactivated enzyme which are free from problems due to Pronase digestion. These experiments combine conventional cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning with selective irradiation of resonances arising from a 13C double label in the steroid. Magnetization transfer between neighboring 13C nuclei is used to simplify the spectra and to identify peaks due to label. The formation of cysteine and lysine Michael adducts of the enzyme is established by comparisons with chemical shifts of solid model adducts."
https://openalex.org/W1602884627,"The reaction mechanism for glycogen synthetase from rabbit muscle was examined by alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effects and positional exchange experiments. Incubation of glycogen synthetase with [beta-18O2,alpha beta-18O]UDP-Glc did not result in any detectable positional isotope exchange from the beta-nonbridge position to the anomeric oxygen of the glucose moiety. Glucono-1,5-lactone was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor versus UDP-Glc. The kinetic constants, K(is) and K(ii), were found to be 91 +/- 4 microM and 0.70 +/- 0.09 mM, respectively. Deoxynojirimycin was a nonlinear inhibitor at pH 7.5. The alpha-secondary deuterium isotope effects were measured with [1-2H]UDP-Glc by the direct comparison method. The isotope effects on Vmax and Vmax/K were found to be 1.23 +/- 0.04 and 1.09 +/- 0.06, respectively. The inhibitory effects by glucono-lactone and deoxynojirimycon plus the large alpha-secondary isotope effect on Vmax have been interpreted to show that an oxocarbonium ion is an intermediate in this reaction mechanism. The lack of a detectable positional isotope exchange reaction in the absence of glycogen suggests the formation of a rigid tight ion pair between UDP and the oxocarbonium ion intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1509636319,"[3H]Fucose, intravenously injected into androgen-treated mice, was incorporated at high rates into the immunopurified kidney lysosomal enzymes beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase. Initially, label was incorporated into high molecular weight proenzyme forms. Processing of fucose-labeled proenzyme forms to lower molecular weight mature forms was very rapid, being detectable at 30 min, and complete by 90 min, compared with the several hours required for processing of lysosomal enzymes labeled with amino acids. This result is consistent with addition of fucose residues within the Golgi apparatus just before transfer of lysosomal proenzyme forms to the lysosome where maturation is thought to occur. The combination of the high rates of incorporation of [3H]fucose and the known metabolic stability of this precursor sugar suggests that the mouse kidney system is advantageous for studies of the synthesis, processing, and degradation of fucose-containing complex oligosaccharides of lysosomal enzymes and, by extension, of other kidney glycoproteins."
