https://openalex.org/W2063720274,"From the first millennium B.C. through the 9th-century A.D. Classic Maya collapse, nonurban populations grew exponentially, doubling every 408 years, in the twin-lake (Yaxha-Sacnab) basin that contained the Classic urban center of Yaxha. Pollen data show that forests were essentially cleared by Early Classic time. Sharply accelerated slopewash and colluviation, amplified in the Yaxha subbasin by urban construction, transferred nutrients plus calcareous, silty clay to both lakes. Except for the urban silt, colluvium appearing as lake sediments has a mean total phosphorus concentration close to that of basin soils. From this fact, from abundance and distribution of soil phosphorus, and from continuing post-Maya influxes (80 to 86 milligrams of phosphorus per square meter each year), which have no other apparent source, we conclude that riparian soils are anthrosols and that the mechanism of long-term phosphorus loading in lakes is mass transport of soil. Per capita deliveries of phosphorus match physiological outputs, approximately 0.5 kilogram of phosphorus per capita per year. Smaller apparent deliveries reflect the nonphosphatic composition of urban silt; larger societal outputs, expressing excess phosphorus from deforestation and from food waste and mortuary disposal, are probable but cannot be evaluated from our data. Eutrophication is not demonstrable and was probably impeded, even in less-impacted lakes, by suspended Maya silt. Environmental strain, the product of accelerating agroengineering demand and sequestering of nutrients in colluvium, developed too slowly to act as a servomechanism, damping population growth, at least until Late Classic time."
https://openalex.org/W2016189023,"The sorption rate and metabolic fate of nitrogen dioxide, a major air pollutant, have been determined for Phaseolus vulgaris (L.). Sorption was determined kinetically by chemiluminescent monitoring of 15NO2 removal from the test atmosphere and directly by mass spectrometric analysis of nitrogen derived from the plant tissue. Sorptive processes were first order with respect to 15NO2 concentration. Virtually all of the 15NO2 taken up was metabolized."

ThCe blockage was relieved by topical application of jtivenile hormonoe. Cancellation of the anti-juvenile hormnone jJects of precocene 2 and the reestablishment of oogenesis (and oviposition in one specimen) bv a naturally occurring insect juvenile hormone argues strongly for a physiological role of juvenile hormone in acarine reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2006189486,"An assembly of stone slabs on an isolated butte in New Mexico collimates sunlight onto spiral petroglyphs carved on a cliff face. The light illuminates the spirals in a changing pattern throughout the year and marks the solstices and equinoxes with particular images. The assembly can also be used to observe lunar phenomena. It is unique in archeoastronomy in utilizing the changing height of the midday sun throughout the year rather than its rising and setting points. The construct appears to be the result of deliberate work of the Anasazi Indians, the builders of the great pueblos in the area."

Nebraska The plant fossils, thought to be food residues, help clarify, the enigmatic paleobiological role, of Teleocears, which had hippotamus-like porportions but very high-crowned teeth. Telecoceras was probably amphbious, but siliceous grasses formed a significant portion of its diet."
https://openalex.org/W2093306755,Amino acids have been found in aqueous extracts of a C2 carbonaceous chondrite recovered from Antarctica. The composition of the amino acids strongly suggests that they have a meteoritic origin. Comparison of these results with those obtained with other C2 chondrites supports the view that Antarctic meteorites have not been significantly altered by terrestrial processes since their fall.
https://openalex.org/W2056721097,The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of aluminum has been measured with a nanosecond pulse of soft x-rays generated by a laser-produced plasma. This technique provides a practical alternative to synchrotorn radiation for the acquisition of EXAFS data. It also provides a unique capability for the analysis of molecular structure in highly transient chemical species.

https://openalex.org/W2001975524,"A separation of odd atomic weight isotopes based on the slight magnetic moment of the isotope is reported. Photolysis of dibenzyl ketone (DBK) in a micelle yields the expected pair of free radicals; but the radicals cannot separate nearly as rapidly as in organic solvents, and conversion of the radical from the triplet to the singlet state will have time to occur before the radicals diffuse apart. Radicals having a carbon-12 carbonyl will undergo the conversion much more slowly and will eventually diffuse into the squeous phase where they will be scavenged. This results in a carbon-13 carbonyl enrichment in the organic phase that depends on the length of time the reaction is conducted and the extent of photolysis. The method has been demonstrated for a 1000% enrichment of carbon-13 with DBK and with less efficiency for enrichment of oxygen-17 with 9, 10-diphenylanthracene endoperoxide. If an appropriate chemical reaction is found, the method shoud be applicable to enrichment of uranium-235. (BLM)"
