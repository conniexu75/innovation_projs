https://openalex.org/W3118018179,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic triggered vast governmental lockdowns. The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. Methods The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. Results Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. Conclusions These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown. Interventions that promote psychological flexibility may mitigate the impact of the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3110976643,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of over one million people worldwide. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses. This human coronavirus host factor compendium represents a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3117411710,"Mental health problems in students are considered a public health challenge. We assessed the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) with the DASS-21, as well as associated factors, among university students in Bangladesh early in the COVID-19 outbreak. We hypothesized high levels of DAS and their associations with previously reported factors (e.g., poor sleep, lack of exercise, heavy internet use) and those linked to disadvantage (e.g., low monthly family income). We also enquired about participants’ satisfaction with their pursuit of their academic studies while living under COVID-19 restrictions. An internet-based survey was conducted during the month of April 2020, involving 3,122 Bangladeshi university students aged 18 to 29 years (59.5% males; mean age 21.4±2 years). Prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety and stress were, respectively, 76.1%, 71.5% and 70.1% for at least mild symptoms, 62.9%, 63.6% and 58.6% for at least moderate symptoms, 35.2%, 40.3%, and 37.7% for at least severe symptoms and 19.7%, 27.5% and 16.5% for at least very severe symptoms. The present estimates of DAS were more prevalent than in previous pre-COVID-19 studies among Bangladeshi university students. Regression analyses with DASS-21-score as a dependent variable revealed associations with factors mostly as hypothesized. The largest effect size on DAS symptoms was related to students’ satisfaction with their academic studies during the pandemic. As this survey used cross-sectional and self-reported methods, causality cannot be inferred. Mental health monitoring of students attempting to cope with the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak may be useful and feasible."

https://openalex.org/W3114911023,"Background The course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be aggravated by air pollution, and some industrial chemicals, such as the perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs), are immunotoxic and may contribute to an association with disease severity. Methods From Danish biobanks, we obtained plasma samples from 323 subjects aged 30–70 years with known SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PFAS concentrations measured at the background exposures included five PFASs known to be immunotoxic. Register data was obtained to classify disease status, other health information, and demographic variables. We used ordered logistic regression analyses to determine associations between PFAS concentrations and disease outcome. Results Plasma-PFAS concentrations were higher in males, in subjects with Western European background, and tended to increase with age, but were not associated with the presence of chronic disease. Of the study population, 108 (33%) had not been hospitalized, and of those hospitalized, 53 (16%) had been in intensive care or were deceased. Among the five PFASs considered, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) showed an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.19 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.39–3.46) for increasing severities of the disease. Among those hospitalized, the fully adjusted OR for getting into intensive care or expiring was 5.18 (1.29, 20.72) when based on plasma samples obtained at the time of diagnosis or up to one week before. Conclusions Measures of individual exposures to immunotoxic PFASs included short-chain PFBA known to accumulate in the lungs. Elevated plasma-PFBA concentrations were associated with an increased risk of a more severe course of COVID-19. Given the low background exposure levels in this study, the role of exposure to PFASs in COVID-19 needs to be ascertained in populations with elevated exposures."
https://openalex.org/W3116529701,"Introduction Maternal mortality is an issue of global public health concern with over 300,000 women dying globally each year. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), these deaths mainly occur around childbirth and the first 24hours after delivery. The place of delivery is, therefore, important in reducing maternal deaths and accelerating progress towards attaining the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) related to maternal health. In this study, we examined the prevalence and determinants of the place of delivery among reproductive age women in SSA. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study among women in their reproductive age using data from the most recent demographic and health surveys of 28 SSA countries. Frequency, percentage, chi-square, and logistic regression were used in analysing the data. All analyses were done using STATA. Results The overall prevalence of health facility delivery was 66%. This ranged from 23% in Chad to 94% in Gabon. More than half of the countries recorded a less than 70% prevalence of health facility delivery. The adjusted odds of health facility delivery were lowest in Chad. The probability of giving birth at a health facility also declined with increasing age but increased with the level of education and wealth status. Women from rural areas had a lower likelihood (AOR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.57–0.61) of delivering at a health facility compared with urban women. Conclusions Our findings point to the inability of many SSA countries to meet the SDG targets concerning reductions in maternal mortality and improving the health of reproductive age women. The findings thus justify the need for peer learning among SSA countries for the adaption and integration into local contexts, of interventions that have proven to be successful in improving health facility delivery among reproductive age women."
https://openalex.org/W3115622467,"SARS-CoV-2 testing is crucial to controlling the spread of this virus, yet shortages of nucleic acid extraction supplies and other key reagents have hindered the response to COVID-19 in the US. Several groups have described loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for SARS-CoV-2, including testing directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and eliminating the need for reagents in short supply. Frequent surveillance of individuals attending work or school is currently unavailable to most people but will likely be necessary to reduce the ~50% of transmission that occurs when individuals are nonsymptomatic. Here we describe a fluorescence-based RT-LAMP test using direct nasopharyngeal swab samples and show consistent detection in clinically confirmed primary samples with a limit of detection (LOD) of ~625 copies/μl, approximately 100-fold lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR. While less sensitive than extraction-based molecular methods, RT-LAMP without RNA extraction is fast and inexpensive. Here we also demonstrate that adding a lysis buffer directly into the RT-LAMP reaction improves the sensitivity of some samples by approximately 10-fold. Furthermore, purified RNA in this assay achieves a similar LOD to qRT-PCR. These results indicate that high-throughput RT-LAMP testing could augment qRT-PCR in SARS-CoV-2 surveillance programs, especially while the availability of qRT-PCR testing and RNA extraction reagents is constrained."

https://openalex.org/W3116446032,"Background In response to the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7, 2020. Six days earlier, the Japan Surgical Society had recommended postponing elective surgical procedures. Along with the growing public fear of COVID-19, hospital visits in Japan decreased. Methods Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, considered to be from March to May 2020, on case volume and claimed hospital charges in acute care hospitals during this period. To make year-over-year comparisons, we considered cases from July 2018 to June 2020. Results A total of 2,739,878 inpatient and 53,479,658 outpatient cases from 195 hospitals were included. In the year-over-year comparisons, total claimed hospital charges decreased in April, May, June 2020 by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. Our results also showed that per-case hospital charges increased during this period, possibly to compensate for the reduced case volumes. Regression results indicated that the hospital charges in April and May 2020 decreased by 6.3% for hospitals without COVID-19 patients. For hospitals with COVID-19 patients, there was an additional decrease in proportion with the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients including suspected cases. The mean additional decrease per COVID-19 patient was estimated to 5.5 million JPY. Conclusion It is suggested that the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients were negatively incentivized."
https://openalex.org/W3117063516,"Background The diagnosis of gastric cancer mainly relies on endoscopy, which is invasive and costly. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model for the diagnosis of gastric cancer based on noninvasive characteristics. Aims To construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of gastric cancer with high accuracy based on noninvasive characteristics. Methods A retrospective study of 709 patients at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital was conducted. Variables of age, gender, blood cell count, liver function, kidney function, blood lipids, tumor markers and pathological results were analyzed. We used gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), a type of machine learning method, to construct a predictive model for the diagnosis of gastric cancer and evaluate the accuracy of the model. Results Of the 709 patients, 398 were diagnosed with gastric cancer; 311 were health people or diagnosed with benign gastric disease. Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, albumin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199) were independent characteristics associated with gastric cancer. We constructed a predictive model using GBDT, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the model was 91%. For the test dataset, sensitivity was 87.0% and specificity 84.1% at the optimal threshold value of 0.56. The overall accuracy was 83.0%. Positive and negative predictive values were 83.0% and 87.8%, respectively. Conclusion We construct a predictive model to diagnose gastric cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. The model is noninvasive and may reduce the medical cost."
https://openalex.org/W3117903921,"Markers of systemic inflammation are associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, but it is unclear if they are associated with a faster rate of cognitive decline and whether this relationship differs by race. Our objective was to examine the association of baseline C-reaction protein (CRP) with cognitive decline among a large racially diverse cohort of older adults. Participants included 21,782 adults aged 45 and older (36% were Black, Mean age at baseline 64) from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. CRP was measured at baseline and used as a continuous variable or a dichotomous grouping based on race-specific 90 th percentile cutoffs. Cognitive measures of memory and verbal fluency were administered every 2 years for up to 12 years. Latent growth curve models evaluated the association of CRP on cognitive trajectories, adjusting for relevant demographic and health factors. We found that higher CRP was associated with worse memory (B = -.039, 95% CI [-.065,-.014]) and verbal fluency at baseline (B = -.195, 95% CI [-.219,-.170]), but not with rate of cognitive decline. After covariate adjustment, the association of CRP on memory was attenuated (B = -.005, 95% CI [-.031,-.021]). The association with verbal fluency at baseline, but not over time, remained (B = -.042, 95% CI [-.067,-.017]). Race did not modify the association between CRP and cognition. Findings suggest that levels of CRP at age 45+, are a marker of cognitive impairment but may not be suitable for risk prediction for cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W3116681155,"Tiny membrane-enclosed cellular fragments that can mediate interactions between cells and organisms have recently become a subject of increasing attention. In this work the mechanism of formation of cell membrane nanovesicles (CNVs) was studied experimentally and theoretically. CNVs were isolated by centrifugation and washing of blood cells and observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The shape of the biological membrane in the budding process, as observed in phospholipid vesicles, in erythrocytes and in CNVs, was described by an unifying model. Taking the mean curvature h and the curvature deviator d of the membrane surface as the relevant parameters, the shape and the distribution of membrane constituents were determined theoretically by minimization of membrane free energy. Considering these results and previous results on vesiculation of red blood cells it was interpreted that the budding processes may lead to formation of different types of CNVs as regards the compartment (exo/endovesicles), shape (spherical/tubular/torocytic) and composition (enriched/depleted in particular kinds of molecules). It was concluded that the specificity of pinched off nanovesicles derives from the shape of the membrane constituents and not primarily from their chemical identity, which explains evidences on great heterogeneity of isolated extracellular vesicles with respect to composition."
https://openalex.org/W3118103490,"Objective We sought to identify novel biomarkers in the amniotic fluid (AF) related to imminent spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD) (≤ 14 days after sampling) in women with early preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), using a protein microarray. Method This was a retrospective cohort study of a total of 88 singleton pregnant women with PPROM (23+0 to 30+6 weeks) who underwent amniocentesis. A nested case-control study for biomarker discovery was conducted using pooled AF samples from controls (non-imminent delivery, n = 15) and cases (imminent SPTD, n = 15), which were analyzed using an antibody microarray. Quantitative validation of four candidate proteins was performed, using ELISA, in the total cohort (n = 88). IL-8, MMP-9, and Fas levels were additionally measured for the comparison and to examine association of SPTD with the etiologic factors of PPROM. Results Of all the proteins studied in the protein microarray, four showed significant intergroup differences. Analyses of the total cohort by ELISA confirmed the significantly elevated concentrations of AF lipocalin-2, MMP-9, and S100 A8/A9, but not of endostatin and Fas, in women who delivered within 14 days of sampling. For inflammatory proteins showing a significant association, the odds of SPTD within 14 days increased significantly with an increase in baseline AF levels of the proteins (P for trend &lt;0.05 for each) in each quartile, especially in the 3rd and 4th quartile. Conclusions We identified several potential novel biomarkers (i.e., lipocalin-2, MMP-9, and S100 A8/A9) related to SPTD within 14 days of sampling, all of which are inflammation-related molecules. Furthermore, the SPTD risk increased with increasing quartiles of each of these inflammatory proteins, especially the 3rd and 4th quartile of each protein. The present findings may highlight the importance of inflammatory mechanisms and the degree of activated inflammatory response in developing SPTD in early PPROM."
https://openalex.org/W3113451780,"Drug resistance (DR) remains a major challenge for tuberculosis (TB) control. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides the highest genetic resolution for genotypic drug-susceptibility tests (DST). We compared DST profiles of 60 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates which were drug resistant according to agar proportion tests (one poly DR-TB, 34 multidrug-resistant TB and 25 extensively drug-resistant TB). We additionally performed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests using Sensititre MYCOTBI plates (MYCOTB) and a WGS-based DST. Agreement between WGS-based DST and MYCOTB was high for all drugs except ethambutol (65%) and ethionamide (62%). Isolates harboring the -15 c/t inhA promoter mutation had a significantly lower MIC for isoniazid than did isolates with the katG Ser315Thr mutation (p &lt; 0.001). Similar patterns were seen for ethambutol ( embB Gly406Asp vs. embB Met306Ile), streptomycin ( gid Gly73Ala vs. rpsL Lys43Arg), moxifloxacin ( gyrA Ala90Val vs. gyrA Asp94Gly) and rifabutin ( rpoB Asp435Phe/Tyr/Val vs. rpoB Ser450Leu). For genotypic heteroresistance, isolates with lower proportion of mapped read tended to has lower MIC of anti-TB drugs than those with higher proportion. These results emphasize the high applicability of WGS for determination of DR-TB and the association of particular mutations with MIC levels."
https://openalex.org/W3114431351,"Refugee patients with severe traumatic experiences may need mental health treatment, but treatment results vary, and there is scarcity of studies demonstrating refugees’ long-term health and well-being after treatment. In a 10-year naturalistic and longitudinal study, 54 multi-origin traumatized adult refugee patients, with a background of war and persecution, and with a mean stay in Norway of 10.5 years, were recruited as they entered psychological treatment in mental health specialist services. The participants were interviewed face-to-face with multiple methods at admittance, and at varying points in time during and after psychotherapy. The aim was to study the participants’ trajectories of symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression, four aspects of quality of life, and two aspects of exile life functioning. Linear mixed effects analyses included all symptoms and quality of life measures obtained at different times and intervals for the participants. Changes in exile life functioning was investigated by exact McNemar tests. Participants responded to the quantitative assessments up to eight times. Length of therapy varied, with a mean of 61.3 sessions ( SD = 74.5). The participants improved significantly in symptoms, quality of life, and exile life functioning. Improvement in symptoms of posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depression yielded small effect sizes ( r = .05 to .13), while improvement in quality of psychological and physical health yielded medium effect sizes ( r = .38 and .32). Thus, long-time improvement after psychological therapy in these severely traumatized and mostly chronified refugee patients, was more notable in quality of life and exile life functioning than in symptom reduction. The results imply that major symptom reduction may not be attainable, and may not be the most important indication of long-term improvement among refugees with long-standing trauma-related suffering. Other indications of beneficial effects should be applied as well."

https://openalex.org/W3118130701,"Background While it is well established that skin disease places significant psychosocial burden on a patient’s wellbeing, its effects have rarely been examined in Asian populations. Objective Evaluate the psychosocial burden of skin disease among community-dwelling adults in Singapore. Methods This cross-sectional study included 1510 participants interviewed on their history of thirteen skin diseases. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions- 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) were used as measures for depressive symptoms, social isolation, loneliness and quality of life respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association of skin diseases with each of the four measured outcomes. Results Participants with skin diseases reported significantly higher PHQ-9 and UCLA Loneliness scale scores, and lower LSNS-6 and EQ-5D-5L scores when compared to their healthy counterparts. The presence of skin disease was positively associated with depressive symptoms (B = 0.40, SE = 0.11), and negatively associated with quality of life (B = -0.03, SE = 0.01). As disease severity was not evaluated in this study, we were unable to ascertain the associations between disease severity and measured outcomes. Conclusion Participants with skin diseases were more likely to have depressive symptoms, social isolation, loneliness and lower quality of life. Unemployed, single and elderly patients were at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms. More emphasis should be placed on the psychosocial aspect of care to reduce the burden of skin disease. Some considerations include monitoring patients for mood-related changes and implementing early psychosocial interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3118200987,"Utilization of metal-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has generated substantial recent research interest in this area. Among these NPs, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have demonstrated promising results in improving oil recovery due to their prominent thermal properties. These nanoparticles can also be polarized by electromagnetic (EM) field, which offers a unique Nano-EOR approach called EM-assisted Nano-EOR. However, the impact of NPs concentrations on oil recovery mechanism under EM field has not been well established. For this purpose, ZnO nanofluids (ZnO-NFs) of two different particle sizes (55.7 and 117.1 nm) were formed by dispersing NPs between 0.01 wt.% to 0.1 wt.% in a basefluid of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and NaCl to study their effect on oil recovery mechanism under the electromagnetic field. This mechanism involved parameters, including mobility ratio, interfacial tension (IFT) and wettability. The displacement tests were conducted in water-wet sandpacks at 95˚C, by employing crude oil from Tapis. Three tertiary recovery scenarios have been performed, including (i) SDBS surfactant flooding as a reference, (ii) ZnO-NFs flooding, and (iii) EM-assisted ZnO-NFs flooding. Compare with incremental oil recovery from surfactant flooding (2.1% original oil in place/OOIP), nanofluid flooding reaches up to 10.2% of OOIP at optimal 0.1 wt.% ZnO (55.7 nm). Meanwhile, EM-assisted nanofluid flooding at 0.1 wt.% ZnO provides a maximum oil recovery of 10.39% and 13.08% of OOIP under EM frequency of 18.8 and 167 MHz, respectively. By assessing the IFT/contact angle and mobility ratio, the optimal NPs concentration to achieve a favorable ER effect and interfacial disturbance is determined, correlated to smaller hydrodynamic-sized nanoparticles that cause strong electrostatic repulsion between particles."
https://openalex.org/W3114633859,"Social distancing measures have been implemented in many countries to limit the spread of COVID-19. Emerging literature reveals that fear of acquiring COVID-19 has detrimental psychological ramifications. However, it seems likely that social distancing will have a further negative impact on well-being. The focus of this study was therefore to investigate whether changes in behaviour as a result of social distancing would predict changes in well-being. Participants (n = 95) rated their level of well-being as it was both during social distancing and retrospectively one month before beginning social distancing. Participants also indicated how much time they spent engaged in various activities both during social distancing and one month before social distancing and nominated how important each of these activities was for them. These measures employed scales created specifically for the present study. In addition, participants completed the Big Five Inventory–2 Extra-Short Form and the nine-item version of the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale. We found that affectivity–both positive and negative–decreased with increased engagement in meaningful activities and that affectivity increased with increased activity in general. While both sorts of activity appear to improve some aspects of well-being, it appears that meaningful activity regulates psychological homeostasis while busyness in general does not."
https://openalex.org/W3114904427,"Grassroots have received more attention than the traditional method as soil reinforcement materials, especially the use of vetiver and other vegetation protection methods to treat expansive soil slope, have been tried and applied. To study the influence of grassroots on the strength properties of expansive soil, the laws of vetiver root growth over time and its vertical distribution of root content( δ ) were firstly investigated by the experiment of planting vetiver. Then different δ and depth of planted soil were obtained. Simultaneously different δ and water content( ω ) of grafted soil were made. With the direct shear test, the shear strength parameters of root-soil with different δ were analyzed. The shear test on root-soil composites with different δ was carried out to compare the strength characteristics of planted and grafted soil. The results showed that the δ of vetiver decreased with the increase of depth, and the δ of each layer increased with the growth period. The δ of 180d was 70.5% higher than that of 90d. The cohesion( c ) of root-soil can be increased by more than 97%, and internal friction angle( φ ) can be increased by more than 15.4% after 180 days. The c of 90 d vetiver root system can be increased by more than 18%, and the φ can be increased by more than 1.5%. At each depth, the c and φ of composite soil increases with the increase of δ , and the increment of cohesion (Δ c ) and the increment of internal friction angle (Δ φ ) increase with the increment of δ . But the increase in the ω will weaken the shear strength parameters of root-soil. Under the condition of the planted root system and grafted root system, the influence degree of δ on strength parameter of root-soil is different, and the law of strength parameters versus δ of grafted soil of 365d is similar to that of planted soil of 90d. And the root reinforcement of grafted soil is weaker than planted soil. Hence the grafted soil can´t accurately reflect the root-soil interaction of the existing root system."
https://openalex.org/W3113726320,"Bats are among the most diverse, widespread, and abundant mammals. In Argentina, 67 species of bats have been recorded, belonging to 5 families and 29 genera. These high levels of biodiversity are likely to complicate identification at fieldwork, especially between closely related species, where external morphology-based approaches are the only immediate means for a priori species assignment. The use of molecular markers can enhance species identification, and acquires particular relevance in capture-release studies. In this study, we discuss the extent of the use of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene for species identification, comparing external morphology identification with a molecular phylogenetic classification based on this marker, under the light of current bat systematics. We analyzed 33 samples collected in an eco-epidemiological survey in the province of Santa Fe (Argentina). We further sequenced 27 museum vouchers to test the accuracy of cytochrome b -based phylogenies in taxonomic identification of bats occurring in the Pampean/Chacoan regions of Argentina. The cytochrome b gene was successfully amplified in all Molossid and Vespertilionid species except for Eptesicus , for which we designed a new reverse primer. The resulting Bayesian phylogeny was congruent with current systematics. Cytochrome b proved useful for species-level delimitation in non-conflicting genera ( Eumops , Dasypterus , Molossops ) and has infrageneric resolution in more complex lineages ( Eptesicus , Myotis , Molossus ). We discuss four sources of incongruence that may act separately or in combination: 1) molecular processes, 2) biology, 3) limitations in identification, and 4) errors in the current taxonomy. The present study confirms the general applicability of cytochrome b -based phylogenies in eco-epidemiological studies, but its resolution and reliability depend mainly, but not solely, on the level of genetic differentiation within each bat genus."
https://openalex.org/W3114956058,"Protein domains often recognize short linear protein motifs composed of a core conserved consensus sequence surrounded by less critical, modulatory positions. PTEN, a lipid phosphatase involved in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, contains such a short motif located at the extreme C-terminus capable to recognize PDZ domains. It has been shown that the acetylation of this motif could modulate the interaction with several PDZ domains. Here we used an accurate experimental approach combining high-throughput holdup chromatographic assay and competitive fluorescence polarization technique to measure quantitative binding affinity profiles of the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of PTEN. We substantially extended the previous knowledge towards the 266 known human PDZ domains, generating the full PDZome-binding profile of the PTEN PBM. We confirmed that inclusion of N-terminal flanking residues, acetylation or mutation of a lysine at a modulatory position significantly altered the PDZome-binding profile. A numerical specificity index is also introduced as an attempt to quantify the specificity of a given PBM over the complete PDZome. Our results highlight the impact of modulatory residues and post-translational modifications on PBM interactomes and their specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3115655966,"Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV and has the potential to significantly impact the HIV epidemic. Given limited resources for HIV prevention, identifying PrEP provision strategies that maximize impact is critical. Methods We used a stochastic individual-based network model to evaluate the direct (infections prevented among PrEP users) and indirect (infections prevented among non-PrEP users as a result of PrEP) benefits of PrEP, the person-years of PrEP required to prevent one HIV infection, and the community-level impact of providing PrEP to populations defined by gender and age in western Kenya and South Africa. We examined sensitivity of results to scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) by comparing two scenarios: maintaining current coverage (“status quo”) and rapid scale-up to meet programmatic targets (“fast-track”). Results The community-level impact of PrEP was greatest among women aged 15–24 due to high incidence, while PrEP use among men aged 15–24 yielded the highest proportion of indirect infections prevented in the community. These indirect infections prevented continue to increase over time (western Kenya: 0.4–5.5 (status quo); 0.4–4.9 (fast-track); South Africa: 0.5–1.8 (status quo); 0.5–3.0 (fast-track)) relative to direct infections prevented among PrEP users. The number of person-years of PrEP needed to prevent one HIV infection was lower (59 western Kenya and 69 in South Africa in the status quo scenario; 201 western Kenya and 87 in South Africa in the fast-track scenario) when PrEP was provided only to women compared with only to men over time horizons of up to 5 years, as the indirect benefits of providing PrEP to men accrue in later years. Conclusions Providing PrEP to women aged 15–24 prevents the greatest number of HIV infections per person-year of PrEP, but PrEP provision for young men also provides indirect benefits to women and to the community overall. This finding supports existing policies that prioritize PrEP use for young women, while also illuminating the community-level benefits of PrEP availability for men when resources permit."
https://openalex.org/W3114328653,"Since the beginning of the 20 th century, electroencephalography (EEG) has been used in a wide variety of applications, both for medical needs and for the study of various cerebral processes. With the rapid development of the technique, more and more precise and advanced tools have emerged for research purposes. However, the main constraints of these devices have often been the high price and, for some devices the low transportability and the long set-up time. Nevertheless, a broad range of wireless EEG devices have emerged on the market without these constraints, but with a lower signal quality. The development of EEG recording on multiple participants simultaneously, and new technological solutions provides further possibilities to understand the cerebral emotional dynamics of a group. A great number of studies have compared and tested many mobile devices, but have provided contradictory results. It is therefore important to test the reliability of specific wireless devices in a specific research context before developing a large-scale study. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability of two wireless devices (g.tech Nautilus SAHARA electrodes and Emotiv™ Epoc +) for the detection of musical emotions, in comparison with a gold standard EEG device. Sixteen participants reported feeling emotional pleasure (from low pleasure up to musical chills) when listening to their favorite chill-inducing musical excerpts. In terms of emotion detection, our results show statistically significant concordance between Epoc + and the gold standard device in the left prefrontal and left temporal areas in the alpha frequency band. We validated the use of the Emotiv™ Epoc + for research into musical emotion. We did not find any significant concordance between g.tech and the gold standard. This suggests that Emotiv Epoc is more appropriate for musical emotion investigations in natural settings."
https://openalex.org/W3114685126,"A putative male-produced pheromone has recently been described for the global pest of pines, Sirex noctilio , but field-activity has not been demonstrated. This study aimed to investigate the pheromone biology of S . noctilio in more detail. Specifically, we i) analysed effluvia and extracts for additional compounds by gas chromatography coupled with electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD), mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and two dimensional time of flight mass spectrometry (GC X GC TOF MS), ii) conducted dose-response experiments for putative pheromone components, iii) determined the site of synthesis/ storage of the putative pheromone and iv) determined the release rate of the putative pheromone from males and three types of lures. A blend of four compounds was identified, including the previously described ( Z )-3-decenol and ( Z )-4-decenol, and two new compounds ( Z )-3-octenol and ( Z )-3-dodecenol. All compounds elicited a response from both male and female antennae, but the strength of the response varied according to sex, compound and dose tested. ( Z )-3-Decenol and ( Z )-3-octenol at lower and higher doses, respectively, elicited larger responses in males and females than the other two compounds. ( Z )-3-Octenol and ( Z )-4-decenol generally elicited larger female than male antennal responses. The site of synthesis and/or storage in males was determined to be the hind legs, likely in the leg-tendon gland. The relative release rate of the major compound by male wasps was shown to be 90 ± 12.4 ng/min, which is between 4 and 15 times greater than that observed from typical lures used previously. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that these compounds may mediate lek formation in S . noctilio males and lek location in females."
https://openalex.org/W3116174706,"We examined clinical stage distribution and proportion of screen-detected cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, female breast and cervical cancer by sex and age group using Osaka Cancer Registry data from 2000–2014. The proportion of local or in situ stage cancer had increased for all age groups in all sites, except stomach cancer in the 0–49 years group and female breast cancer in the 80 years and older group. The proportion of screen-detected cases had increased during the study period for all age groups in all cancer sites. While the proportion increased noticeably in the younger groups, there was only a slight increase in the older groups. Regarding stomach, colorectal and lung cancers, the proportion of local and in situ stage had similarly increased in the 65–79 years and 80 years and older age groups compared with younger groups, despite lower exposure to cancer screening. Regarding breast and cervical cancers, the increases in local and in situ cancer paralleled the increase in screen-detected cases. These findings suggest that the increases in early stage stomach, colorectal and lung cancers might be due not only to the expansion of screening programs but also the development of clinical diagnostic imaging or other reasons. The increases in local and in situ stage breast and cervical cancers seemed to be due to the expansion of screening. Continued monitoring of trends in cancer incidence by clinical stage may be helpful for estimating the effectiveness of screening."
https://openalex.org/W3117712062,"Background and objectives Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the USA, and our objective was to determine their waitlist mortality rates, liver transplantation (LT) rates and post-LT outcomes. Methods All adults listed for LT with the UNOS from 2002 to 2018 were included. Competing risk analysis was performed to assess the association between ethnic group with waitlist removal due to death/deterioration and transplantation. For sensitivity analysis, Hispanics were matched 1:1 to Non-Hispanics using propensity scores, and outcomes of interest were compared in matched cohort. Results During this period, total of 154,818 patients who listed for liver transplant were involved in this study, of them 23,223 (15%) were Hispanics, 109,653 (71%) were Whites, 13,020 (8%) were Blacks, 6,980 (5%) were Asians and 1,942 (1%) were others. After adjusting for differences in clinical characteristics, compared to Whites, Hispanics had higher waitlist removal due to death or deterioration (adjusted cause-specific Hazard Ratio: 1.034, p = 0.01) and lower transplantation rates (adjusted cause-specific Hazard Ratio: 0.90, p&lt;0.001). If Hispanics received liver transplant, they had better patient and graft survival than Non-Hispanics (p&lt;0.001). Compared to Whites, adjusted hazard ratio for Hispanics were 0.88 (95% CI 0.84, 0.92, p&lt;0.001) for patient survival and 0.90 (95% CI 0.86, 0.94, p&lt;0.001) for graft survival. Our analysis in matched cohort showed the consistent results. Conclusions This study showed that Hispanics had higher probability to be removed from the waitlist due to death, and lower probability to be transplanted, however they had better post-LT outcomes when compared to whites."
https://openalex.org/W3113734469,"Introduction Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is recommended for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes. However, in people with sickle cell disease (SCD), sickle cell trait (SCT), α-thalassemia or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, HbA1c may underestimate the prevalence of diabetes. There are no data on the extent of this problem in sub-Saharan Africa despite having high prevalence of these red blood cell disorders. Methods Blood samples from 431 adults in northwestern Tanzania, randomly selected from the prospective cohort study, Chronic Infections, Comorbidities and Diabetes in Africa (CICADA), were analysed for SCT/SCD, α-thalassemia and G6PD deficiency and tested for associations with the combined prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes (PD/DM) by HbA1c, using the HemoCue 501 HbA1c instrument, and by 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Results The mean age of the participants was 40.5 (SD11.6) years; 61% were females and 71% were HIV-infected. Among 431 participants, 110 (25.5%) had SCT and none had SCD. Heterozygous α-thalassemia (heterozygous α+ AT) was present in 186 (43%) of the participants, while 52 participants (12%) had homozygous α-thalassemia (homozygous α+ AT). Furthermore, 40 (9.3%) participants, all females, had heterozygous G6PD deficiency while 24 (5.6%) males and 4 (0.9%) females had hemizygous and homozygous G6PD deficiency, respectively. In adjusted analysis, participants with SCT were 85% less likely to be diagnosed with PD/DM by HbA1c compared to those without SCT (OR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.26, P &lt; 0.001). When using OGTT, in adjusted analysis, SCT was not associated with diagnosis of PD/DM while participants with homozygous α + AT and hemizygous G6PD deficiency were more likely to be diagnosed with PD/DM. Conclusions HbA1c underestimates the prevalence of PD/DM among Tanzanian adults with SCT. Further research using other HbA1c instruments is needed to optimize HbA1c use among populations with high prevalence of hemoglobinopathies or G6PD deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3114557308,"Background Despite the high prevalence of chronic otitis media (COM) in low to middle-income countries, there are few studies regarding its associated factors, health-related quality of life, and treatment costs. This study aimed to identify associated factors of COM, assess its impact on the quality of life as well as estimate the patients’ reported costs of COM treatment in Colombia. Methods Cross-sectional study. Two otology-referral centers in Bogotá (Colombia) were included. Questionnaires focusing on sociodemographic and clinical associated factors, quality of life, and patients’ reported costs were administered to 200 adults with COM diagnosis and 144 control adults. Otoscopic evaluation and audiometric data were collected. Results The mean age was 42.2 years (SD: 14.44). The median length of COM was 26.13 years (SD: 17.06), and 79.5% of the COM patients reported otorrhea during childhood (P-value: 0.01). The most frequently reported allergic disease among our study population was allergic rhinitis (26.5%). COM was less frequent in patients with a medium-high socioeconomic status (PR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39–0.72), and more frequent in patients who reported increased ear discharge due to upper respiratory tract infections (PR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.68–1.70). The global score of the “Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media Questionnaire-12” showed a difference of 9 points between patients with active and inactive COM (P &lt; 0.001). Patients spent between 12.07% to 60.37% of their household income on expenses related to COM. Conclusions Associated factors found in this study are consistent with previous reports. COM has a significant financial impact and affects patients’ quality of life. Worldwide research addressing these issues in poor-resource countries is scarce, further studies are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3118031754,"Background With the emergence of new health information technologies, health information can be shared across networks, with or without patients’ awareness and/or their consent. It is often argued that there can be an ethical obligation to participate in biomedical research, motivated by altruism, particularly when risks are low. In this study, we explore whether altruism contributes to the belief that there is an ethical obligation to share information about one’s health as well as how other health care experiences, perceptions, and concerns might be related to belief in such an obligation. Methods We conducted an online survey using the National Opinion Research Center’s (NORC) probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Our final analytic sample included complete responses from 2069 participants. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine how altruism, together with other knowledge, attitudes, and experiences contribute to the belief in an ethical obligation to allow health information to be used for research. Results We find in multivariable regression that general altruism is associated with a higher likelihood of belief in an ethical obligation to allow one’s health information to be used for research (OR = 1.22, SE = 0.14, p = 0.078). Trust in the health system and in care providers are both associated with a significantly higher likelihood of believing there is an ethical obligation to allow health information to be used (OR = 1.48, SE = 0.76, p&lt;0.001; OR = 1.58, SE = 0.26, p&lt;0.01, respectively). Conclusions Belief that there is an ethical obligation to allow one’s health information to be used for research is shaped by altruism and by one’s experience with, and perceptions of, health care and by general concerns about the use of personal information. Altruism cannot be assumed and researchers must recognize the ways encounters with the health care system influence (un)willingness to share one’s health information."
https://openalex.org/W3114087150,"Objective Previous studies on diagnostic accuracy of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase (LE) and nitrite to diagnose urinary tract infection (UTI) had used urine culture, which is an imperfect gold standard. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy obtained using the classical gold standard framework might not reflect the true diagnostic accuracy of dipstick tests. Methods We used the dataset from a prospective, observational study conducted in the emergency department of a teaching hospital in southern India. Patients with a clinical suspicion of UTI underwent dipstick testing for LE and nitrite, urine microscopy, and urine culture. Based on the results of urine microscopy and culture, UTI was classified into definite, probable, and possible. Patients with microscopic pyuria and a positive urine culture were adjudicated as definite UTI. Unequivocal imaging evidence of emphysematous pyelonephritis or perinephric collections was also considered definite UTI. We estimated the diagnostic accuracy of LE and nitrite tests using the classical analysis (assuming definite UTI as gold standard) and two different Bayesian latent class models (LCMs; 3-tests in 1-population and 2-tests in 2-populations models). Results We studied 149 patients. Overall, 64 (43%) patients had definite, 76 (51%) had probable, and 2 (1.3%) had possible UTI; 7 (4.6%) had alternate diagnoses. In classical analysis, LE was more sensitive than nitrite (87.5% versus 70.5%), while nitrite was more specific (24% versus 58%). The 3-tests in 1-population Bayesian LCM indicated a substantially better sensitivity and specificity for LE (98.1% and 47.6%) and nitrite (88.2% and 97.7%). True sensitivity and specificity of urine culture as estimated by the model was 48.7% and 73.0%. Estimates of the 2-tests in 2-populations model were in agreement with the 3-tests in 1-population model. Conclusions Bayesian LCMs indicate a clinically important improvement in the true diagnostic accuracy of urine dipstick testing for LE and nitrite. Given this, a negative dipstick LE would rule-out UTI, while a positive dipstick nitrite would rule-in UTI in our study setting. True diagnostic accuracy of urine dipstick testing for UTI in various practice settings needs reevaluation using Bayesian LCMs."
https://openalex.org/W3114716461,"This study aimed to examine the predictive validity of two internationally well-known instruments, the Modified Home Falls and Accidents Screening Tool (Modified HOME FAST) and the Modified Home Falls and Accidents Screening Tool-Self Report (Modified HOME FAST-SR), and the newly developed Thai Home Falls Hazard Assessment Tool (Thai-HFHAT) (69 items) in predicting falls among older Thai adults. It also aimed to examine the predictive validity of the two abbreviated versions (44 and 27 items) of the Thai-HFHAT, which were developed post hoc to accommodate older adults’ limited literacy and poor vision and to facilitate the identification of high-impact home fall hazards that are prevalent in the Thailand context. A prospective cohort study was conducted among 450 participants aged 60 years and above who were assessed by the aforementioned tools at baseline, for which data on fall incidence were then collected during the one-year follow-up. The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs); then, Harrell’s C-statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to identify the best cutoff point, sensitivity and specificity for each instrument. The results showed that the fall hazard rate was 2.04 times per 1,000 person-days. Taking into account both the predictive validity and applicability, the Thai-HFHAT (44 items) was found to be the most suitable screening tool due to its highest sensitivity and specificity (93% and 72%) at the cutoff score of 18. In conclusion, our study showed that these internationally validated home fall hazard assessment tools were quite applicable for Thailand, but further tailoring the tools into a specific local context yielded even more highly valid tools in predicting fall risk among older Thai adults. Although these findings were well reproducible by inferring from the internal validation results, further external validation in the independent population is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3114897506,"Corynebacteriales are Actinobacteria that possess an atypical didermic cell envelope. One of the principal features of this cell envelope is the presence of a large complex made up of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan and mycolic acids. This covalent complex constitutes the backbone of the cell wall and supports an outer membrane, called mycomembrane in reference to the mycolic acids that are its major component. The biosynthesis of the cell envelope of Corynebacteriales has been extensively studied, in particular because it is crucial for the survival of important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is therefore a key target for anti-tuberculosis drugs. In this study, we explore the biogenesis of the cell envelope of Corynebacterium glutamicum , a non-pathogenic Corynebacteriales , which can tolerate dramatic modifications of its cell envelope as important as the loss of its mycomembrane. For this purpose, we used a genetic approach based on genome-wide transposon mutagenesis. We developed a highly effective immunological test based on the use of anti-cell wall antibodies that allowed us to rapidly identify bacteria exhibiting an altered cell envelope. A very large number (10,073) of insertional mutants were screened by means of this test, and 80 were finally selected, representing 55 different loci. Bioinformatics analyses of these loci showed that approximately 60% corresponded to genes already characterized, 63% of which are known to be directly involved in cell wall processes, and more specifically in the biosynthesis of the mycoloyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex. We identified 22 new loci potentially involved in cell envelope biogenesis, 76% of which encode putative cell envelope proteins. A mutant of particular interest was further characterized and revealed a new player in mycolic acid metabolism. Because a large proportion of the genes identified by our study is conserved in Corynebacteriales , the library described here provides a new resource of genes whose characterization could lead to a better understanding of the biosynthesis of the envelope components of these bacteria."

Litchi fruit contains a toxin, methylene cyclopropyl-glycine (MCPG), which is known to be fatal by causing encephalitis-related deaths. This is especially harmful when consumed by malnourished children. The first case of litchi toxicity was reported in Bihar in 2011. A similar event was recorded in 2014 among children admitted to the Muzaffarpur government hospital, Bihar. Litchi samples sent to ICMR-NIN were analyzed and MCPG was found to be present in both the pulp and seed of the fruit. Diethyl phosphate (DEP) metabolites were found in the urine samples of children who had consumed litchi fruit from this area indicating exposure to pesticide. The presence of both MCPG in litchi and DEP metabolites in urine samples highlights the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation that examines all factors of toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3114134470,"Background Currently, less aggressive treatment or even active surveillance of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is widely accepted and recommended as a therapeutic management option. However, there are some concerns about these approaches. We investigated whether there are any demographic, clinical and ultrasound characteristics of PTMC patients that are easy to obtain and clinically available before surgery to help clinicians make proper therapeutic decisions. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of 5,021 patients with thyroid tumors surgically treated in one center in 2008–2018. Finally, 182 (3.62%) PTMC patients were selected (158 (86.8%) females and 24 (13.2%) males, mean age 48.8±15.4 years). We analyzed the disease-free survival (DFS) time of the PTMC patients according to demographic and histopathological parameters. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the relationships of demographic, clinical and ultrasound characteristics with aggressive histopathological features. Results Age ≥55 years, hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular tumor shape, smooth margins and high vascularity significantly increased the risk for minimal extrathyroidal extension (minETE), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and capsular and vascular invasion (p&lt;0.0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated a statistically significant risk of LNM (OR = 5.98, 95% CI: 2.32–15.38, p = 0.0002) and trends toward significantly higher rates of minETE and capsular and vascular invasion (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 0.97–5.19, p = 0.056) in patients ≥55 years than in their younger counterparts. The DFS time was significantly shorter in patients ≥55 years (p = 0.015), patients with minETE and capsular and vascular invasion (p = 0.001 for all), patients with tumor size &gt;5 mm (p = 0.021), and patients with LNM (p = 0.002). Conclusions The absence of microcalcifications, irregular tumor shape, blunt margins, hypoechogenicity and high vascularity in PTMC patients below 55 years and with tumor diameters below 5 mm may allow clinicians to select individuals with a low risk of local recurrence so that they can receive less aggressive management."
https://openalex.org/W3116601145,"Ageing and chronic diseases lead to muscle loss and impair the regeneration of skeletal muscle. Thus, it’s crucial to seek for effective intervention to improve the muscle regeneration. Tid1, a mitochondrial co-chaperone, is important to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis. Previously, we demonstrated that mice with skeletal muscular specific Tid1 deficiency displayed muscular dystrophy and postnatal lethality. Tid1 can interact with STAT3 protein, which also plays an important role during myogenesis. In this study, we used GMI, immunomodulatory protein of Ganoderma microsporum , as an inducer in C2C12 myoblast differentiation. We observed that GMI pretreatment promoted the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. We also showed that the upregulation of mitochondria protein Tid1 with the GMI pre-treatment promoted myogenic differentiation ability of C2C12 cells. Strikingly, we observed the concomitant elevation of STAT3 acetylation (Ac-STAT3) during C2C12 myogenesis. Our study suggests that GMI promotes the myogenic differentiation through the activation of Tid1 and Ac-STAT3."
https://openalex.org/W3117291792,"Blood coagulation is central to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury. Studies on the light elicited circadian rhythm protein Period 2 (PER2) using whole body Per2 -/- mice found deficient platelet function and reduced clotting which would be expected to protect from myocardial IR-injury. In contrast, intense light induction of PER2 protected from myocardial IR-injury while Per2 deficiency was detrimental. Based on these conflicting data, we sought to evaluate the role of platelet specific PER2 in coagulation and myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. We demonstrated that platelets from mice with tissue-specific deletion of Per2 in the megakaryocyte lineage ( Per2 loxP/loxP -PF4-CRE) significantly clot faster than platelets from control mice. We further found increases in infarct sizes or plasma troponin levels in Per2 loxP/loxP -PF4-CRE mice when compared to controls. As intense light increases PER2 protein in human tissues, we also performed translational studies and tested the effects of intense light therapy on coagulation in healthy human subjects. Our human studies revealed that intense light therapy repressed procoagulant pathways in human plasma samples and significantly reduced the clot rate. Based on these results we conclude that intense light elicited PER2 has an inhibitory function on platelet aggregation in mice. Further, we suggest intense light as a novel therapy to prevent or treat clotting in a clinical setting."

However, Synergetic development can be promising to enhance the participation of social organizations and to improve social welfare. This study introduces a conceptual model to explore relationships between five determinants and synergetic development of social organizations participating in HECS. A structural equation model (SEM) based on questionnaire survey is used as a test methodology.

This study provides effective strategies and directions for the improvement of home-based elderly care services."
https://openalex.org/W3116586671,"Background The duration of an opioid prescribed at hospital discharge does not intrinsically account for opioid needs during a hospitalization. This discrepancy may lead to patients receiving much larger supplies of opioids on discharge than they truly require. Objective Assess a novel discharge opioid supply metric that adjusts for opioid use during hospitalization, compared to the conventional discharge prescription signature. Design, setting, &amp; participants Retrospective study using electronic health record data from June 2012 to November 2018 of adults who received opioids while hospitalized and after discharge from a single academic medical center. Measures &amp; analysis We ascertained inpatient opioids received and milligrams of opioids supplied after discharge, then determined days of opioids supplied after discharge by the conventional prescription signature opioid-days (“conventional days”) and novel hospital-adjusted opioid-days (“adjusted days”) metrics. We calculated descriptive statistics, within-subject difference between measurements, and fold difference between measures. We used multiple linear regression to determine patient-level predictors associated with high difference in days prescribed between measures. Results The adjusted days metric demonstrates a 2.4 day median increase in prescription duration as compared to the conventional days metric (9.4 vs. 7.0 days; P &lt;0.001). 95% of all adjusted days measurements fall within a 0.19 to 6.90-fold difference as compared to conventional days measurements, with a maximum absolute difference of 640 days. Receiving a liquid opioid prescription accounted for an increased prescription duration of 135.6% by the adjusted days metric (95% CI 39.1–299.0%; P = 0.001). Of patients who were not on opioids prior to admission and required opioids during hospitalization but not in the last 24 hours, 325 (8.6%) were discharged with an opioid prescription. Conclusions The adjusted days metric, based on inpatient opioid use, demonstrates that patients are often prescribed a supply lasting longer than the prescription signature suggests, though with marked variability for some patients that suggests potential under-prescribing as well. Adjusted days is more patient-centered, reflecting the reality of how patients will take their prescription rather than providers’ intended prescription duration."

The aim was to search for biomarker peaks that could rapidly detect biofilm production in S . maltophilia clinical isolates obtained from two tertiary care hospitals in Mexico. Isolates were screened for the presence of biofilm-associated genes, in which the fsnR gene was associated with biofilm production ( p = 0.047), whereas the rmlA + genotype was associated with the rpfF - genotype ( p = 0.017). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra comparison yielded three potential biomarker peaks (4661, 6074, and 6102 m/z ) of biofilm-producing rmlA + and rpfF - genotypes with &gt;90% sensitivity ( p &lt;0.001). MALDI-TOF MS analyses showed a correlation between the relative abundance of 50S ribosomal proteins (L30 and L33) and the presence of the fnsR , rmlA and rpfF -2 genes, suggested to play a role in biofilm formation. Isolates obtained in the intensive care unit showed low clonality, suggesting no transmission within the hospital ward. The detection of biomarkers peaks by MALDI-TOF MS could potentially be used to early recognize and discriminate biofilm-producing S . maltophilia strains and aid in establishing appropriate antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3117701078,"Introduction The Korean National Health Insurance revised its reimbursement criteria to expand coverage for anti-osteoporotic drug treatments in 2011 (expanding diagnostic criteria and the coverage period for anti-osteoporotic therapy) and 2015 (including osteoporotic fracture patients regardless of bone mineral density). We examined whether the two revisions contributed to an increase in the prescription rates of anti-osteoporotic drugs in Korea. Methods We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Patient Sample data from 2010 through 2016. A segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series was performed to assess changes in the monthly prescription rates of anti-osteoporotic drugs among women aged 50 or older, defined as the proportion of elderly women prescribed with anti-osteoporotic drugs. Results Both the levels (i.e., abrupt jump or drop) and the trends (i.e., slope) of the prescription rates of anti-osteoporotic drugs in the general population, osteoporotic patients, and osteoporotic fracture patients showed no significant changes after the first revision. However, there was a significant increase in the trends in the general population (β = 0.0166, p = 0.0173) and in osteoporotic patients (β = 0.1128, p = 0.0157) after the second revision. Women aged 65 to 79 years were the most significantly increased group in terms of the treatment proportion after the second revision because the trend was significant after the second revision in all three study populations (β = 0.0300, 0.1212, 0.1392, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Although the two revisions expanded reimbursement coverage, only the second revision on reimbursing based on osteoporotic fracture regardless of bone mineral density was associated with increasing the proportion of post-menopausal women being treated with anti-osteoporotic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3113698502,"Background Sepsis is a growing concern for health systems, but the epidemiology of sepsis is poorly characterised. We evaluated sepsis recording across primary care electronic records, hospital episodes and mortality registrations. Methods and findings Cohort study including 378 general practices in England from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from 2002–2017 with 36,209,676 patient-years of follow-up with linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality registrations. Incident sepsis episodes were identified for each source. Concurrent records from different sources were identified and age-standardised and age-specific incidence rates compared. Logistic regression analysis evaluated associations of gender, age-group, fifth of deprivation and period of diagnosis with concurrent sepsis recording. There were 20,206 first episodes of sepsis from primary care, 20,278 from HES and 13,972 from ONS. There were 4,117 (20%) first HES sepsis events and 2,438 (17%) mortality records concurrent with incident primary care sepsis records within 30 days. Concurrent HES and primary care records of sepsis within 30 days before or after first diagnosis were higher at younger or older ages and for patients with the most recent period of diagnosis. Those diagnosed during 2007:2011 were less likely to have a concurrent HES record given CPRD compared to those diagnosed during 2012–2017 (odd ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.60–0.70). At age 85 and older, primary care incidence was 5.22 per 1,000 patient years (95% CI 1.75–11.97) in men and 3.55 (0.87–9.58) in women which increased to 10.09 (4.86–18.51) for men and 7.22 (2.96–14.72) for women after inclusion of all three sources. Conclusion Explicit recording of ‘sepsis’ is inconsistent across healthcare sectors with a high proportion of non-concurrent records. Incidence estimates are higher when linked data are analysed."
https://openalex.org/W3114083349,"Background Saponins are secondary metabolites from plants added to shampoos and beverages to make them foam, and the sapogenins released from them upon acid hydrolysis are commonly used as starting materials for steroidal drugs. However, current methods embed the saponin in a thick “gum” material consisting of multiple impurities. This gum limits access to the saponin, reducing the efficiency of hydrolysis and requiring large amounts of heat, organic solvents and effort to recover the sapogenin. For centuries, herbalists have been making tinctures by soaking plant materials at room temperature, in mixtures of alcohol and water. Many herbal tinctures contain saponins floating freely in solution, gum free. The saponin from sarsaparilla ( Smilax spp), sarsasaponin, yields the sapogenin, sarsasapogenin, upon acid hydrolysis. The retail price of sarsasapogenin is very high but would be lower if the “gum problem” could be avoided. Materials and methods We incubated sarsaparilla tincture under different conditions of temperature, acidity and duration then used quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) to measure the amount of sarsasapogenin produced by hydrolysis as well as the amount of its epimer, smilagenin. Results and discussion Most, if not all the sarsasaponin in sarsaparilla root powder is extracted into a solution of 45% ethanol (55% water) at room temperature and stays suspended without formation of any particles (gum). Acid hydrolysis of the saponin in this solution is very efficient, approaching 100%. The sarsasapogenin released by hydrolysis and the smilagenin produced by its epimerisation, migrate into the chloroform phase. Conclusion Sarsaparilla saponin diffuses into and disperses in a solution of alcohol:water (45:55) at room temperature. Hydrolysis of saponins in tincture provides a simple, inexpensive and environmentally friendly alternative."

These species are L . paivai sp. nov. , L . blakei sp. nov. and L . lesliae sp. nov. Members of L . paivai sp. nov. are recognized by the presence of nine pairs of well-developed and heavily ciliated branchiae, those of L . blakei sp. nov. are characterized by the presence of three pairs of small branchiae, and those of L . lesliae sp. nov. , by the absence of branchiae and presence of notopodial transitional chaetae. These new species are described herein and compared to the most similar congeners. These are the first new species of Levinsenia described from off the Brazilian coast."
https://openalex.org/W3115487359,"Enhancer redundancy has been postulated to provide a buffer for gene expression against genetic and environmental perturbations. While work in Drosophila has identified functionally overlapping enhancers, work in mammalian models has been limited. Recently, we have identified two partially redundant enhancers, nPE1 and nPE2, that drive proopiomelanocortin gene expression in the hypothalamus. Here we demonstrate that deletion of nPE1 produces mild obesity while knockout of nPE2 has no discernible metabolic phenotypes. Additionally, we show that acute leptin administration has significant effects on nPE1 knockout mice, with food intake and body weight change significantly impacted by peripheral leptin treatment. nPE1 knockout mice became less responsive to leptin treatment over time as percent body weight change increased over 2 week exposure to peripheral leptin. Both Pomc and Agrp mRNA were not differentially affected by chronic leptin treatment however we did see a decrease in Pomc and Agrp mRNA in both nPE1 and nPE2 knockout calorie restricted mice as compared to calorie restricted PBS-treated WT mice. Collectively, these data suggest dynamic regulation of Pomc by nPE1 such that mice with nPE1 knockout become less responsive to the anorectic effects of leptin treatment over time. Our results also support our earlier findings in which nPE2 may only be critical in adult mice that lack nPE1, indicating that these neural enhancers work synergistically to influence metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3115953311,"Ribonucleoside triphosphates are often incorporated into genomic DNA during DNA replication. The accumulation of unrepaired ribonucleotides is associated with genomic instability, which is mediated by DNA topoisomerase 1 (Top1) processing of embedded ribonucleotides. The cleavage initiated by Top1 at the site of a ribonucleotide leads to the formation of a Top1-DNA cleavage complex (Top1cc), occasionally resulting in a DNA double-strand break (DSB). In humans, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDPs) are essential repair enzymes that resolve the trapped Top1cc followed by downstream repair factors. However, there is limited cellular evidence of the involvement of TDPs in the processing of incorporated ribonucleotides in mammals. We assessed the role of TDPs in mutagenesis induced by a single ribonucleotide embedded into DNA. A supF shuttle vector site-specifically containing a single riboguanosine (rG) was introduced into the human lymphoblastoid TK6 cell line and its TDP1 -, TDP2 -, and TDP1 / TDP2 -deficient derivatives. TDP1 and TDP2 insufficiency remarkably decreased the mutant frequency caused by an embedded rG. The ratio of large deletion mutations induced by rG was also substantially lower in TDP1 / TDP2 -deficient cells than wild-type cells. Furthermore, the disruption of TDPs reduced the length of rG-mediated large deletion mutations. The recovery ratio of the propagated plasmid was also increased in TDP1 / TDP2 -deficient cells after the transfection of the shuttle vector containing rG. The results suggest that TDPs-mediated ribonucleotide processing cascade leads to unfavorable consequences, whereas in the absence of these repair factors, a more error-free processing pathway might function to suppress the ribonucleotide-induced mutagenesis. Furthermore, base substitution mutations at sites outside the position of rG were detected in the supF gene via a TDPs-independent mechanism. Overall, we provide new insights into the mechanism of mutagenesis induced by an embedded ribonucleotide in mammalian cells, which may lead to the fatal phenotype in the ribonucleotide excision repair deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3116170222,"The economic contribution of insect pollinators is evident as they contribute to higher crop yield quantity and quality. The management of bee species is key to crop production, especially where wild and domesticated bees are in low abundance. Several bee species have been identified as possible candidates for replacing, or at least supplementing, the decreasing number of honey bees. Our research seeks to address the location problem as regards nesting aids for Osmia cornuta bees in orchards using mathematical programming models for determining the optimal location of nesting aids and optimizing the management of solitary bees. A differential evolution algorithm is used to solve a location model of Osmia cornuta nesting aids for optimum pollination. Instead of a random ad hoc location of nesting aids in an orchard, or at the edge of an orchard, we utilize an effective optimization tool to determine locations which will optimize pollination by alternative pollinators, and increase the economic output of an agricultural business. The importance of this proposed model is likely to increase with agricultural intensification, and the decrease of the numbers of wild pollinators."
https://openalex.org/W3116852250,"Imbalances in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), and the underlying mechanism is partly in alignment with that of lead exposure causing MetS. Many studies have reported the association between lead exposure and MetS, but no study has considered the possibility of TSH mediating lead's effect on MetS. Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between lead exposure and MetS considering TSH as a partial mediator. The data of 1,688 adults (age ≥19 years) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013 were analyzed. The prevalence of MetS in the Korean population was 21.9%, and the geometric mean of blood lead and serum TSH levels were 1.96 μg/dL and 2.17 μIU/mL, respectively. The associations between blood lead levels, serum TSH levels, and MetS were determined through a multiple logistic regression analysis. Blood lead levels were positively associated with high TSH levels (upper 25%) with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.79 (1.24, 2.58) per doubled lead levels. The increase in blood lead and serum TSH levels both positively increased the odds of developing MetS. The OR of MetS per doubling of blood lead level was 1.53 (1.00, 2.35), and was not attenuated after adjusting for TSH levels. These findings suggest that higher levels of blood lead are positively associated with serum TSH levels and MetS. By exploring the role of TSH as a partial mediator between lead and MetS, we verified that lead exposure has an independent relationship with MetS, regardless of TSH levels."
https://openalex.org/W3117445901,"Protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma infect a broad diversity of vertebrates and several species cause significant illness in humans. However, understanding of the phylogenetic diversity, host associations, and infection dynamics of Trypanosoma species in naturally infected animals is incomplete. This study investigated the presence of Trypanosoma spp. in wild rodents and lagomorphs in northern New Mexico, United States, as well as phylogenetic relationships among these parasites. A total of 458 samples from 13 rodent and one lagomorph species collected between November 2002 and July 2004 were tested by nested PCR targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA). Trypanosoma DNA was detected in 25.1% of all samples, with the highest rates of 50% in Sylvilagus audubonii , 33.1% in Neotoma micropus , and 32% in Peromyscus leucopus . Phylogenetic analysis of Trypanosoma sequences revealed five haplotypes within the subgenus Herpetosoma ( T . lewisi clade). Focused analysis on the large number of samples from N . micropus showed that Trypanosoma infection varied by age class and that the same Trypanosoma haplotype could be detected in recaptured individuals over multiple months. This is the first report of Trypanosoma infections in Dipodomys ordii and Otospermophilus variegatus , and the first detection of a haplotype phylogenetically related to T . nabiasi in North America in S . audubonii . This study lends important new insight into the diversity of Trypanosoma species, their geographic ranges and host associations, and the dynamics of infection in natural populations."
