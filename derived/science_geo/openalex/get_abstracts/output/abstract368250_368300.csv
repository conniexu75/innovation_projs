Marcus Altfeld and his colleagues show that, after adjusting for viral load, HIV-1–infected women have higher levels of immune activation, and the authors provide a potential mechanism to account for this difference between the sexes. Manifestations of viral infections can differ between women and men1, and marked sex differences have been described in the course of HIV-1 disease. HIV-1–infected women tend to have lower viral loads early in HIV-1 infection but progress faster to AIDS for a given viral load than men2,3,4,5,6,7. Here we show substantial sex differences in the response of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to HIV-1. pDCs derived from women produce markedly more interferon-α (IFN-α) in response to HIV-1–encoded Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) ligands than pDCs derived from men, resulting in stronger secondary activation of CD8+ T cells. In line with these in vitro studies, treatment-naive women chronically infected with HIV-1 had considerably higher levels of CD8+ T cell activation than men after adjusting for viral load. These data show that sex differences in TLR-mediated activation of pDCs may account for higher immune activation in women compared to men at a given HIV-1 viral load and provide a mechanism by which the same level of viral replication might result in faster HIV-1 disease progression in women compared to men. Modulation of the TLR7 pathway in pDCs may therefore represent a new approach to reduce HIV-1–associated pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2001244523,"The role of endogenous inducers of inflammation is poorly understood. To produce the proinflammatory master cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β, macrophages need double stimulation with ligands to both Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for IL-1β gene transcription and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors for activation of the inflammasome. It is particularly intriguing to define how this complex regulation is mediated in the absence of an infectious trigger. Biglycan, a ubiquitous leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix, interacts with TLR2/4 on macrophages. The objective of this study was to define the role of biglycan in the synthesis and activation of IL-1β. Here we show that in macrophages, soluble biglycan induces the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome, activating caspase-1 and releasing mature IL-1β without the need for additional costimulatory factors. This is brought about by the interaction of biglycan with TLR2/4 and purinergic P2X4/P2X7 receptors, which induces receptor cooperativity. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species formation is involved in biglycan-mediated activation of the inflammasome. By signaling through TLR2/4, biglycan stimulates the expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β mRNA. Both in a model of non-infectious inflammatory renal injury (unilateral ureteral obstruction) and in lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis, biglycan-deficient mice displayed lower levels of active caspase-1 and mature IL-1β in the kidney, lung, and circulation. Our results provide evidence for direct activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by biglycan and describe a fundamental paradigm of how tissue stress or injury is monitored by innate immune receptors detecting the release of the extracellular matrix components and turning such a signal into a robust inflammatory response.

The activity of IL-1β is regulated sequentially by synthesis of the 31-kDa precursor pro-IL-1β, intracellular proteolytic conversion into active IL-1β (17 kDa) by the cysteine protease caspase-1, also known as IL-1-converting enzyme (1.Martinon F.

The synthesis of pro-IL-1β is initiated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, whereas ATP stimulates cleavage and maturation of IL-1β (4.Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl.

Activation of caspase-1 requires the assembly and activity of a cytosolic multiprotein complex known as the inflammasome, consisting of nucleotide-binding oligomerization-like receptor family members (NLRs; NLRPs (NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3), NAIP (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory protein), and NLRC4 (NLR family caspase recruitment domain-containing 4)) (6.Ting J.P.

NLRP3, the best characterized member of NLRs, recruits caspase-1 to the inflammasome via the adapter molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing caspase activation and recruitment domain), thereby activating the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP (11.Pétrilli V.

Macromolecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are commonly thought to function as purely structural components. However, there is growing evidence that the ECM exerts much more complex functions than being a mere scaffold for cells to attach to, including direct regulation of the inflammatory response reaction (18.Okamura Y.

Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Biglycan is a stationary component of the ECM and can be found in most tissues. It is a member of the family of small proteoglycans and has LRR motifs, similar to TLRs and NLRs (20.Schaefer L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21305-21309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 26.Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). However, when biglycan is released from the ECM during tissue injury or after secretion from activated macrophages, biglycan becomes available in its soluble form. Similar to PAMPs, soluble biglycan is an endogenous ligand for TLR4 and TLR2 in macrophages (27.Schaefer L. Babelova A. Kiss E. Hausser H.J. Baliova M. Krzyzankova M. Marsche G. Young M.F. Mihalik D. Götte M. Malle E. Schaefer R.M. Gröne H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to define the role of biglycan in the regulation of IL-1β secretion by macrophages and its in vivo relevance, in order to better understand how tissue stress or injury is recognized and acted upon by the innate immune system. Here we show that soluble biglycan organizes a multireceptor complex consisting of Toll-like and purinergic P2X receptors on the cell surface of macrophages. Thereby, biglycan regulates (i) the expression of NLRP3- and pro-IL-1β mRNA in a TLR2- and TLR4-dependent manner, (ii) the activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome by interacting with purinergic receptors, and (iii) caspase-1 activation and the release of mature IL-1β. Importantly, both in a model of non-infectious inflammatory renal injury (unilateral ureteral obstruction) and in a prototypical innate immune process, such as LPS-induced sepsis, biglycan-deficient mice displayed lower levels of active caspase-1 and mature IL-1β, resulting in reduced infiltration of mononuclear cells and less damage to target organs. Thus, we propose that soluble biglycan acts as a critical danger and stress signal, which can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing caspase-1-dependent processing and release of IL-1β. The present study shows that by interacting with Toll-like and purinergic P2X receptors on the cell surface of macrophages, soluble biglycan activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and triggers a robust inflammatory response. Male Bgn−/0 and Bgn+/0 mice (C57BL/6) (since the biglycan gene is located on the X chromosome, male animals are hemizygous, having only one allele) have been described previously (28.Xu T. Bianco P.

After 2 h, cells were washed, and only adherent cells were used for the experiments. P2X4R short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmid (sc42570SH), negative controls (control shRNA plasmid B, which encodes a scrambled shRNA sequence (sc108065), and control shRNA plasmid C, which is an alternate negative scrambled shRNA sequence control (sc108066)), transfection medium, and reagents were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the protocol for transfection recommended by the manufacturer was followed. Protein P2X4R expression was verified by Western blots using an anti-P2X4R antibody (Alomone Laboratories). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed, serum-free RPMI 1640 medium was added, and cells were stimulated with biglycan (40 μg/ml) for 16 h. For silencing NLRC4 gene expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the siGENOME SMARTpool (M-055000-01, Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. siGENOME non-targeting siRNA 2 (D-001210-02-05; Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific) served as a negative control.

IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 were measured in plasma and in culture media by mouse-specific ELISAs (R&D Systems). Results were normalized by protein content and cell number. All assays were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was carried out at least three times. The ATP content in supernatants from Bgn−/0 thioglycollate-elicited PMΦs incubated with biglycan (4 μg/ml) for 10 s to 240 min was quantified with the adenosine-5′-triphosphate bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma) in the TEKAN Infinite M200 luminometer (Crailsheim, Germany), using alamethicin (50 μg/ml; Sigma) as a positive control (34.Mathew M.K.

For the measurement of mature IL-1β buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 was used. Lysates were then centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and supernatants were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C. Equal amounts of protein were used for each sample. The activity of caspase-1 was measured using the caspase-1 activity assay kit (R&D Systems) as instructed by the manufacturer and was expressed as the percentage of increase of activity in ligated in relation to contralateral control kidneys.

Through a genome-wide survey of 114 subjects with TOF and their unaffected parents, we identified 11 de novo copy number variants (CNVs) that were absent or extremely rare (<0.1%) in 2,265 controls. We then examined a second, independent TOF cohort (n = 398) for additional CNVs at these loci. We identified CNVs at chromosome 1q21.1 in 1% (5/512, P = 0.0002, OR = 22.3) of nonsyndromic sporadic TOF cases. We also identified recurrent CNVs at 3p25.1, 7p21.3 and 22q11.2. CNVs in a single subject with TOF occurred at six loci, two that encode known (NOTCH1, JAG1) disease-associated genes. Our findings predict that at least 10% (4.5-15.5%, 95% confidence interval) of sporadic nonsyndromic TOF cases result from de novo CNVs and suggest that mutations within these loci might be etiologic in other cases of TOF."
https://openalex.org/W2108417458,"Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA species that play critical roles throughout cellular development and regulation. miRNA expression patterns taken from various tissue types often point to the cellular lineage of an individual tissue type, thereby being a more invariant hallmark of tissue type. Recent work has shown that these miRNA expression patterns can be used to classify tumor cells, and that this classification can be more accurate than the classification achieved by using messenger RNA gene expression patterns. One aspect of miRNA biogenesis that makes them particularly attractive as a biomarker is the fact that they are maintained in a protected state in serum and plasma, thus allowing the detection of miRNA expression patterns directly from serum. This study is focused on the evaluation of miRNA expression patterns in human serum for five types of human cancer, prostate, colon, ovarian, breast and lung, using a pan-human microRNA, high density microarray. This microarray platform enables the simultaneous analysis of all human microRNAs by either fluorescent or electrochemical signals, and can be easily redesigned to include newly identified miRNAs. We show that sufficient miRNAs are present in one milliliter of serum to detect miRNA expression patterns, without the need for amplification techniques. In addition, we are able to use these expression patterns to correctly discriminate between normal and cancer patient samples."

The objective of this study was to determine whether hypertension specifically affects the plasma lipidome independently and differently from the effects induced by obesity and insulin resistance.We screened the plasma lipidome of 19 men with hypertension and 51 normotensive male controls by top-down shotgun profiling on a LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer. The analysis encompassed 95 lipid species of 10 major lipid classes. Obesity resulted in generally higher lipid load in blood plasma, while the content of tri- and diacylglycerols increased dramatically. Insulin resistance, defined by HOMA-IR >3.5 and controlled for BMI, had little effect on the plasma lipidome. Importantly, we observed that in blood plasma of hypertensive individuals the overall content of ether lipids decreased. Ether phosphatidylcholines and ether phosphatidylethanolamines, that comprise arachidonic (20:4) and docosapentaenoic (22:5) fatty acid moieties, were specifically diminished. The content of free cholesterol also decreased, although conventional clinical lipid homeostasis indices remained unaffected.Top-down shotgun lipidomics demonstrated that hypertension is accompanied by specific reduction of the content of ether lipids and free cholesterol that occurred independently of lipidomic alterations induced by obesity and insulin resistance. These results may form the basis for novel preventive and dietary strategies alleviating the severity of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1999891600,"Caspases are intracellular proteases and key initiators and effectors of apoptosis. Here the authors describe fluorescently labeled activity-based probes that allow the noninvasive in vivo monitoring of the kinetics of caspase activity. Approaches to optimize the probes to enhance their specificity and increase uptake into apoptotic cells are outlined, and their use in tracking the early stages of apoptosis in two mouse models (dexamethasone and the monoclonal antibody Apomab) is demonstrated. Imaging agents that enable direct visualization and quantification of apoptosis in vivo have great potential value for monitoring chemotherapeutic response as well as for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. We describe here the development of fluorescently labeled activity-based probes (ABPs) that covalently label active caspases in vivo. We used these probes to monitor apoptosis in the thymi of mice treated with dexamethasone as well as in tumor-bearing mice treated with the apoptosis-inducing monoclonal antibody Apomab (Genentech). Caspase ABPs provided direct readouts of the kinetics of apoptosis in live mice, whole organs and tissue extracts. The probes produced a maximum fluorescent signal that could be monitored noninvasively and that coincided with the peak in caspase activity, as measured by gel analysis. Overall, these studies demonstrate that caspase-specific ABPs have the potential to be used for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis in both preclinical and clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2144688932,"Background Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. S. suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America, but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans and pigs are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings The sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs, and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly, ∼40% of the ∼2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three ∼90 kb regions, present in the two isolates from humans, composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition, small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors. Conclusions/Significance The genomic inventories of genetically related S. suis strains, isolated from distinct hosts and diseases, exhibit high levels of conservation. However, the genomes provide evidence that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution of drug resistance."

We propose a model in which the statistical properties of sensory signals and their transformations determine how these signals are used. This model incorporates the patterns of gaze-dependent errors that we found in our human psychophysics experiment when the sensory signals available for reach planning were varied. These results challenge the widely held ideas that error patterns directly reflect the reference frame of the underlying neural representation and that it is preferable to use a single common reference frame for movement planning. We found that gaze-dependent error patterns, often cited as evidence for retinotopic reach planning, can be explained by a transformation bias and are not exclusively linked to retinotopic representations. Furthermore, the presence of multiple reference frames allows for optimal use of available sensory information and explains task-dependent reweighting of sensory signals."
https://openalex.org/W2146040535,"CD8(+) T-cells specific for MART-1-(26-35), a dominant melanoma epitope restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201, are exceptionally common in the naive T-cell repertoire. Remarkably, the TRAV12-2 gene is used to encode the T-cell receptor alpha (TCRalpha) chain in >87% of these T-cells. Here, the molecular basis for this genetic bias is revealed from the structural and thermodynamic properties of an archetypal TRAV12-2-encoded TCR complexed to the clinically relevant heteroclitic peptide, ELAGIGILTV, bound to HLA-A*0201 (A2-ELA). Unusually, the TRAV12-2 germ line-encoded regions of the TCR dominate the major atomic contacts with the peptide at the TCR/A2-ELA interface. This ""innate"" pattern of antigen recognition probably explains the unique characteristics and extraordinary frequencies of CD8(+) T-cell responses to this epitope."
https://openalex.org/W1985461389,"Background Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may provide an invaluable resource for regenerative medicine. To move hESCs towards the clinic it is important that cells with therapeutic potential be reproducibly generated under completely defined conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a four-step scalable process that is readily transferable to a Good Manufacture Practice (GMP) facility for the production of functional dopaminergic neurons from hESCs for potential clinical uses. We show that each of the steps (propagation of ESC→generation of neural stem cells (NSC)→induction of dopaminergic precursors→maturation of dopaminergic neurons) could utilize xeno-free defined media and substrate, and that cells could be stored at intermediate stages in the process without losing their functional ability. Neurons generated by this process expressed midbrain and A9 dopaminergic markers and could be transplanted at an appropriate time point in development to survive after transplant. Conclusions/Significance hESCs and NSCs can be maintained in xeno-free defined media for a prolonged period of time while retaining their ability to differentiate into authentic dopaminergic neurons. Our defined medium system provides a path to a scalable GMP-applicable process of generation of dopaminergic neurons from hESCs for therapeutic applications, and a ready source of large numbers of neurons for potential screening applications."

Tagged colonies on Florida Keys and Bahamian (i.e., Exuma Cays) reefs were sampled from 2003-2005 and their Symbiodinium diversity assessed via internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and three Symbiodinium Clade B-specific microsatellite loci. Generally, the majority of host individuals at a site harbored an identical Symbiodinium ITS2 ""type"" B1 microsatellite genotype. Notably, symbiont genotypes were largely reef endemic, suggesting a near absence of dispersal between populations. Relative to the Bahamas, sympatric M. faveolata and M. annularis in the Florida Keys harbored unique Symbiodinium populations, implying regional host specificity in these relationships. Furthermore, within-colony Symbiodinium population structure remained stable through time and environmental perturbation, including a prolonged bleaching event in 2005.Taken together, the population-level endemism, specificity and stability exhibited by Symbiodinium raises concerns about the long-term adaptive capacity and persistence of these symbioses in an uncertain future of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2124370053,"Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) is an exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani that causes paralytic death to hundreds of thousands of humans annually. TeNT cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein-2, which inhibits neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system to elicit spastic paralysis, but the molecular basis for TeNT entry into neurons remains unclear. TeNT is a approximately 150-kDa protein that has AB structure-function properties; the A domain is a zinc metalloprotease, and the B domain encodes a translocation domain and C-terminal receptor-binding domain (HCR/T). Earlier studies showed that HCR/T bound gangliosides via two carbohydrate-binding sites, termed the lactose-binding site (the ""W"" pocket) and the sialic acid-binding site (the ""R"" pocket). Here we report that TeNT high affinity binding to neurons is mediated solely by gangliosides. Glycan array and solid phase binding analyses identified gangliosides that bound exclusively to either the W pocket or the R pocket of TeNT; GM1a bound to the W pocket, and GD3 bound to the R pocket. Using these gangliosides and mutated forms of HCR/T that lacked one or both carbohydrate-binding pocket, gangliosides binding to both of the W and R pockets were shown to be necessary for high affinity binding to neuronal and non-neuronal cells. The crystal structure of a ternary complex of HCR/T with sugar components of two gangliosides bound to the W and R supported the binding of gangliosides to both carbohydrate pockets. These data show that gangliosides are functional dual receptors for TeNT."

Here we present evidence that hSSB2, a homolog of hSSB1, plays a role similar to hSSB1 in DNA damage-response pathways. This was evidenced by findings that hSSB2-depleted cells resemble hSSB1-depleted cells in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents, reduced efficiency in HR-dependent repair of DSBs, and defective ATM-dependent phosphorylation. Notably, hSSB1 and hSSB2 form separate complexes with two identical proteins, INTS3 and hSSBIP1 (C9ORF80). Cells depleted of INTS3 and hSSBIP1 also exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA damage reagents, chromosomal instability, and reduced ATM-dependent phosphorylation. hSSBIP1 was rapidly recruited to laser-induced DSBs, a feature also similar to that reported for hSSB1. Depletion of INTS3 decreased the stability of hSSB1 and hSSBIP1, suggesting that INTS3 may provide a scaffold to allow proper assembly of the hSSB complexes. Thus, our data demonstrate that hSSB1 and hSSB2 form two separate complexes with similar structures, and both are required for efficient HR-dependent repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1989379056,"We have developed a system to reconstitute all of the proposed steps of Okazaki fragment processing using purified yeast proteins and model substrates. DNA polymerase delta was shown to extend an upstream fragment to displace a downstream fragment into a flap. In most cases, the flap was removed by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), in a reaction required to remove initiator RNA in vivo. The nick left after flap removal could be sealed by DNA ligase I to complete fragment joining. An alternative pathway involving FEN1 and the nuclease/helicase Dna2 has been proposed for flaps that become long enough to bind replication protein A (RPA). RPA binding can inhibit FEN1, but Dna2 can shorten RPA-bound flaps so that RPA dissociates. Recent reconstitution results indicated that Pif1 helicase, a known component of fragment processing, accelerated flap displacement, allowing the inhibitory action of RPA. In results presented here, Pif1 promoted DNA polymerase delta to displace strands that achieve a length to bind RPA, but also to be Dna2 substrates. Significantly, RPA binding to long flaps inhibited the formation of the final ligation products in the reconstituted system without Dna2. However, Dna2 reversed that inhibition to restore efficient ligation. These results suggest that the two-nuclease pathway is employed in cells to process long flap intermediates promoted by Pif1."
https://openalex.org/W2014704394,"CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (T regs) play a major role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and immune suppression, although the mechanisms controlling T reg development and suppressor function remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide evidence that Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10/TIEG1) constitutes an important regulator of T regulatory cell suppressor function and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell activation through distinct mechanisms involving transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and Foxp3. KLF10 overexpressing CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells induced both TGF-beta1 and Foxp3 expression, an effect associated with reduced T-Bet (Th1 marker) and Gata3 (Th2 marker) mRNA expression. Consistently, KLF10(-/-) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells have enhanced differentiation along both Th1 and Th2 pathways and elaborate higher levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, KLF10(-/-) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell effectors cannot be appropriately suppressed by wild-type T regs. Surprisingly, KLF10(-/-) T reg cells have reduced suppressor function, independent of Foxp3 expression, with decreased expression and elaboration of TGF-beta1, an effect completely rescued by exogenous treatment with TGF-beta1. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that in response to TGF-beta1, KLF10 can transactivate both TGF-beta1 and Foxp3 promoters, implicating KLF10 in a positive feedback loop that may promote cell-intrinsic control of T cell activation. Finally, KLF10(-/-) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells promoted atherosclerosis by approximately 2-fold in ApoE(-/-)/scid/scid mice with increased leukocyte accumulation and peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, KLF10 is a critical regulator in the transcriptional network controlling TGF-beta1 in both CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and T regs and plays an important role in regulating atherosclerotic lesion formation in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2105013839,"Background Although useful for probing bacterial pathogenesis and physiology, current random mutagenesis systems suffer limitations for studying the toxin-producing bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Methodology/Principal Findings An EZ-Tn5-based random mutagenesis approach was developed for use in C. perfringens. This mutagenesis system identified a new regulatory locus controlling toxin production by strain 13, a C. perfringens type A strain. The novel locus, encoding proteins with homology to the AgrB and AgrD components of the Agr quorum sensing system of Staphylococcus aureus and two hypothetical proteins, was found to regulate early production of both alpha toxin and perfringolysin O (PFO) by strain 13. PFO production by the strain 13 ΔagrB mutant could be restored by genetic complementation or by physical complementation, i.e. by co-culture of the strain 13 ΔagrB mutant with a pfoA mutant of either strain 13 or C. perfringens type C CN3685. A similar AgrB- and AgrD-encoding locus is identifiable in all sequenced C. perfringens strains, including type B, C, D, and E isolates, suggesting this regulatory locus contributes to toxin regulation by most C. perfringens strains. In strain 13, the agrB and agrD genes were found to be co-transcribed in an operon with two upstream genes encoding hypothetical proteins. Conclusions/Significance The new Tn5-based random mutagenesis system developed in this study is more efficient and random than previously reported C. perfringens random mutagenesis approaches. It allowed identification of a novel C. perfringens toxin regulatory locus with homology to the Agr system of S. aureus and which functions as expected of an Agr-like quorum sensing system. Since previous studies have shown that alpha toxin and perfringolysin O are responsible for strain 13-induced clostridial myonecrosis in the mouse model, the new agr regulatory locus may have importance for strain 13 virulence."

Here we report an activator-dependent interaction of transcription initiation and termination factors during gene looping in budding yeast. Chromatin analysis revealed that MET16, INO1, and GAL1p-BUD3 are in a stable looped configuration during activated transcription. Looping was nearly abolished in the absence of transcription activators Met28, Ino2, and Gal4 of MET16, INO1, and GAL1p-BUD3 genes, respectively. The activator-independent increase in transcription was not accompanied by loop formation, thereby suggesting an essential role for activators in gene looping. The activators did not facilitate loop formation directly because they did not exhibit an interaction with the 3' end of the genes. Instead, activators physically interacted with the general transcription factor TFIIB when the genes were activated and in a looped configuration. TFIIB cross-linked to both the promoter and the terminator regions during the transcriptionally activated state of a gene. The presence of TFIIB on the terminator was dependent on the Rna15 component of CF1 3' end processing complex. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed a physical interaction of Rna15 with TFIIB. We propose that the activators facilitate gene looping through their interaction with TFIIB during transcriptional activation of genes."

Practical difficulties associated with overexpression, purification, and crystallization of ion channels have thus far stymied investigation of the structural and energetic bases underlying anesthetic recognition. However, general anesthetics also bind specifically to sites in soluble proteins, including firefly luciferase, human serum albumin (HSA), and horse spleen apoferritin (HSAF) (12.Franks N.P.

In particular, HSAF is an attractive model for studying anesthetic-protein interactions because it has the highest affinity for anesthetics of any protein studied to date, has a unique anesthetic binding site, and is a multimer of 4-helix bundles, much like the putative anesthetic binding regions in ligand-gated channels. In addition, apoferritin is commercially available and crystallizes readily. Most importantly, however, the affinity of HSAF for a broad range of general anesthetics is highly correlated with anesthetic potency, confirming the utility and relevance of this model system (17.Butts C.A. Xi J. Brannigan G. Saad A.A. Venkatachalan S.P. Pearce R.A. Klein M.L. Eckenhoff R.G. Dmochowski I.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6501-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Ferritin is a 24-mer iron-binding protein. It sequesters free iron ions, thereby helping to maintain non-toxic levels of iron in the cell and functioning as a cellular iron reservoir (18.Theil E.C. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester2001Google Scholar, 19.Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Each subunit has a molecular mass of ∼20 kDa and adopts a 4-helix bundle fold. The 24-mer forms a hollow, roughly spherical particle with 432 symmetry. Two ferritin isoforms are found in mammals, heavy (H) and light (L), and 24-mers can contain all H chains, all L chains, or mixtures of varying stoichiometry; the biological significance of the H/L ratio is not yet clear (20.Arosio P. Levi S. Ferritins: Structural and Functional Aspects. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2002Crossref Google Scholar).In addition to the large central cavity, the apoferritin 24-mer contains additional, smaller cavities at the dimer interfaces; these smaller cavities are of an appropriate size to accommodate anesthetics. X-ray crystallography has confirmed that this interfacial cavity is the binding site for the inhalational anesthetics halothane and isoflurane, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements have shown that this interfacial site has a relatively high affinity for these anesthetics (Ka values ∼105m−1) (14.Liu R. Loll P.J. Eckenhoff R.G. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).General anesthetics fall into at least two broad classes, inhalational and injectable. Whereas both classes of drugs can induce the amnesia, immobility, and hypnosis associated with anesthesia, molecules in the two classes differ substantially in their chemical and physical properties. Prior to this work, only one crystal structure has been available for an injectable general anesthetic complexed with a protein-propofol, bound to HSA (16.Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). This structure revealed that the propofol binding sites on this protein do not, by and large, overlap with the binding sites for inhalational anesthetics. This raises the question of whether the two types of drug invariably bind to separate sets of targets, or whether they could possibly transduce their effects by binding to a single protein site. To address this question we assessed whether propofol binds to the apoferritin site that had been previously identified as the binding site for inhalational anesthetics. Using x-ray crystallography, calorimetry, and molecular modeling, we show that the two types of anesthetics do indeed share a common binding site. We also investigated structure-binding relationships for a homologous series of propofol-like compounds and found that, remarkably, the energetics of binding to apoferritin precisely match the compound's abilities to potentiate GABA effects at GABAA receptors, suggesting that similar structural and physicochemical factors mediate anesthetic recognition by both apoferritin and ligand-gated ion channels. This argues for the possibility that anesthetic binding might trigger structural and dynamic alterations in GABAA receptors similar to those observed in apoferritin, and that these changes underlie anesthetic effects.DiscussionPropofol is now the most widely used of the injectable general anesthetics. It provides rapid induction of unconsciousness, swift emergence and few of the problems associated with other drugs, such as delirium and nausea (32.Kotani Y. Shimazawa M. Yoshimura S. Iwama T. Hara H. CNS Neurosci. Ther. 2008; 14: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Its desired effects are thought to arise from potentiation of GABAergic transmission. Structure-activity relationships have been probed for various propofol analogs (33.Krasowski M.D. Jenkins A. Flood P. Kung A.Y. Hopfinger A.J. Harrison N.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 338-351PubMed Google Scholar), but the atomic details of the structure-binding relationship, necessary to guide further drug design, have not been reported. To elucidate such details for the anesthetic-binding protein apoferritin, we examined a homologous series of compounds that all share the same phenolic skeleton, but differ in the size of the aliphatic substituents at the 2- and 6-positions.The apoferritin system provides a clear example in which polar interactions are not required for specific, high-affinity recognition of propofol and related molecules. Apart from phenol, none of the compounds studied participate in direct polar interactions with the protein, even though multiple polar residues are available within the apoferritin cavity, and despite the fact that all of the compounds are capable of participating in hydrogen bonds and polar interactions involving their pi electrons. The molecular dynamics simulations show that the ligands prefer to form hydrogen bonds to water molecules in the cavity, rather than to their protein target. It is surprising that hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions do not play key roles in propofol recognition, given that the hydroxyl group has been considered an essential component of the propofol pharmacophore (34.Sewell J.C. Sear J.W. Br. J. Anaesth. 2004; 92: 45-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35.Krasowski M.D. Hong X. Hopfinger A.J. Harrison N.L. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3210-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, our results strongly suggest that the hydroxyl may serve primarily to enhance water solubility, rather than to mediate protein recognition.In the absence of strong polar interactions such as hydrogen bonds, affinity should be governed by enthalpic contributions from relatively weak van der Waals forces and entropic contributions from dehydration of the ligand and cavity upon binding. We estimated the free energy contribution from the latter effect using a value of 20 cal/mol per Å2 of hydrophobic surface area (36.Reynolds J.A. Gilbert D.B. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 2925-2927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found excellent agreement with experimental values, indicating that the hydrophobic effect is the principal force driving anesthetic recognition by apoferritin (Fig. 5).Of the ligands studied, only the largest compound, 2, departs from this trend, with a measured binding affinity that is markedly lower than predicted by the hydrophobic effect. This discrepancy probably reflects the entropic cost of immobilizing a large ligand in the absence of strong offsetting enthalpic contributions, and is entirely consistent with the results from our molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest that “optimal” ligands still exhibit a considerable degree of mobility within the cavity.A similar enthalpy-entropy calculus governs the recognition of guest molecules by encapsulating hosts, which is also controlled by weak forces (37.Mecozzi S. Rebek Jr., J. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 1016-1022Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and suggests that optimal affinity corresponds to a packing density of guests within the host of about 0.55, similar to the packing density of most organic liquids. Looser packing fails to fully exploit favorable enthalpic contacts between host and guest, while too-tight packing restricts guest motion and exacts too great an entropic cost. Packing densities for our apoferritin-ligand complexes range from 0.35 to ∼0.52, with binding affinity peaking at a packing density of 0.48 and decreasing for higher values. Considering that apoferritin cavity volume calculations include nooks inaccessible to ligand, these values likely underestimate the true packing density and are therefore in remarkable agreement with the predictions of the host-guest model (37.Mecozzi S. Rebek Jr., J. Chem. Eur. J. 1998; 4: 1016-1022Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, larger ligands with higher predicted packing densities are only sparingly soluble in water, complicating experimental confirmation of this relationship.To test generality of this relationship in another anesthetic-binding protein, we examined the packing density and binding affinity of propofol for HSA (13.Liu R. Meng Q. Xi J. Yang J. Ha C.E. Bhagavan N.V. Eckenhoff R.G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16.Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Propofol binds two distinct sites in HSA; an average Ka of 15, 300 m−1 has been estimated for the two sites (13.Liu R. Meng Q. Xi J. Yang J. Ha C.E. Bhagavan N.V. Eckenhoff R.G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is more than 10-fold weaker than the apoferritin affinity for propofol. Only one of the two HSA sites is a buried cavity and therefore permits volume determination (16.Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar); packing densities fall in the range 0.50–0.55. This is higher than the “optimal” value found for the apoferritin-ligand complexes, suggesting that the HSA lower affinity for propofol may stem in part from a too-small binding cavity. However, examination of other HSA-ligand complexes reveals that this cavity is capable of enlargement; the fact that it adopts the volume that it does in the HSA-propofol complex may signal that the free energy gained from a hydrogen bond formed between propofol and HSA partially compensates for the entropic cost of immobilizing the ligand.Careful analysis of both the structure and the dynamics of the apoferritin model target reveal a complex interplay between anesthetic and protein. The crystal structures clearly show that the protein cavity is able to expand, at least to a limited degree, to accommodate larger ligands (induced fit), implying that models wherein anesthetics simply bind to preformed cavities may be overly simplistic. The molecular dynamics simulations complement this structural analysis, providing an explanation for the unexpectedly large cavity volume observed for the phenol-apoferritin complex. Given that the cavity occurs at a subunit interface, it is not difficult to hypothesize that expansions of similar cavities in the transmembrane regions of multisubunit ion channels could influence the energetics of conductance or gating.The utility of complementing structural analyses with dynamics simulations is further demonstrated by the pronounced effects of anesthetic binding on residue and strand dynamics, observed even for the lowest affinity ligand. While crystallography does not identify significant global differences (other than cavity size) between unliganded and liganded apoferritin, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the local effects of anesthetic binding translate into substantial global effects on protein dynamics, even at loci distant from the binding site (e.g. the crossover strand connecting helices 2 and 3). It is easy to envision how similar allosteric effects, triggered by anesthetic binding to LGIC targets, might modulate agonist affinity or channel function.Because apoferritin is itself unlikely to transduce anesthesia, its utility as a model system lies in its ability to predict pharmacologically relevant anesthetic effects. Structure-function data for propofol and related compounds reveal a good correlation between anesthetic potency (as measured by loss of righting reflex in Xenopus laevis tadpoles) and the ability to potentiate GABA responses at GABAA receptors (33.Krasowski M.D. Jenkins A. Flood P. Kung A.Y. Hopfinger A.J. Harrison N.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 338-351PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a GABAergic mechanism for propofol-like molecules. It is therefore interesting to note that in the propofol series, binding affinity for apoferritin is strongly correlated with potentiation of GABA responses (Fig. 6). Further, this correlation approximates the line of identity, implying that occupancy of an apoferritin-like site in the GABAA receptor complex is sufficient for potentiation. A significant correlation is also observed between apoferritin binding affinity and anesthetic potency in tadpoles, although not as strong as with GABA potentiation. This is not surprising, given that systems level responses such as the loss of righting reflex almost certainly reflect contributions from multiple targets.FIGURE 6Correlation between apoferritin binding affinity and the EC50 for potentiation of GABA responses at GABAA receptors (units are mol/liter). Binding affinity was measured by ITC and is expressed as the dissociation constant Kd; GABA potentiation data are taken from Ref. (33.Krasowski M.D. Jenkins A. Flood P. Kung A.Y. Hopfinger A.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11599-11605Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), have established that the anesthetic binding site of the GABAA receptor lies within its transmembrane region, at or near the interface between subunit 4-helix bundles. Similarly, the apoferritin anesthetic binding site is found in an interfacial location, sandwiched between two four-helix bundles. Obviously, the structural homology cannot extend to the atomic level, because there is no primary sequence homology between apoferritin and the GABAA receptor, nor is the 2-fold symmetry axis found in apoferritin consistent with what we know of the architecture of the transmembrane domains of ligand-gated ion channels. Nonetheless, apoferritin displays a striking level of mimicry at the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structural levels.In conclusion, apoferritin binding affinity recapitulates anesthetic potency in a propofol-based homologous series. Recognition of these molecules, based almost entirely on van der Waals forces and the hydrophobic effect, occurs at the same binding site previously shown to bind inhalational general anesthetics such as halothane and isoflurane. When taken together with the structural mimicry described above, these results argue strongly that the apoferritin anesthetic binding site bears a high degree of physicochemical and architectural similarity to sites that exist in the GABAA receptor and other clinically relevant targets. Our results will allow the development of specific structural and dynamical hypotheses to explain anesthetic mechanisms within pharmacologically relevant ion channel targets. Most general anesthetics alter the activity of ligand-gated ion channels, and electrophysiology, photolabeling, and transgenic animal experiments imply that this effect contributes to the mechanism of anesthesia (1.Mascia M.P.

GUN4 (GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4) stimulates chlorophyll biosynthesis by activating Mg-chelatase, the enzyme that commits porphyrins to the chlorophyll branch. GUN4 stimulates Mg-chelatase by a mechanism that involves binding the ChlH subunit of Mg-chelatase, as well as a substrate (protoporphyrin IX) and product (Mg-protoporphyrin IX) of Mg-chelatase. We chose to test whether GUN4 might also affect interactions between Mg-chelatase and chloroplast membranes, the site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. To test this idea, we induced chlorophyll precursor levels in purified pea chloroplasts by feeding these chloroplasts with 5-aminolevulinic acid, determined the relative levels of GUN4 and Mg-chelatase subunits in soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from these chloroplasts, and quantitated Mg-chelatase activity in membranes isolated from these chloroplasts. We also monitored GUN4 levels in the soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from chloroplasts fed with various porphyrins. Our results indicate that 5-aminolevulinic acid feeding stimulates Mg-chelatase activity in chloroplast membranes and that the porphyrin-bound forms of GUN4 and possibly ChlH associate most stably with chloroplast membranes. These findings are consistent with GUN4 stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by activating Mg-chelatase but also by promoting interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes. In plants, chlorophylls and other tetrapyrroles are synthesized from a branched pathway that is located within chloroplasts.

GUN4 stimulates Mg-chelatase by a mechanism that involves binding the ChlH subunit of Mg-chelatase, as well as a substrate (protoporphyrin IX) and product (Mg-protoporphyrin IX) of Mg-chelatase. We chose to test whether GUN4 might also affect interactions between Mg-chelatase and chloroplast membranes, the site of chlorophyll biosynthesis. To test this idea, we induced chlorophyll precursor levels in purified pea chloroplasts by feeding these chloroplasts with 5-aminolevulinic acid, determined the relative levels of GUN4 and Mg-chelatase subunits in soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from these chloroplasts, and quantitated Mg-chelatase activity in membranes isolated from these chloroplasts. We also monitored GUN4 levels in the soluble and membrane-containing fractions derived from chloroplasts fed with various porphyrins. Our results indicate that 5-aminolevulinic acid feeding stimulates Mg-chelatase activity in chloroplast membranes and that the porphyrin-bound forms of GUN4 and possibly ChlH associate most stably with chloroplast membranes. These findings are consistent with GUN4 stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis not only by activating Mg-chelatase but also by promoting interactions between ChlH and chloroplast membranes. Chlorophylls are produced from a branched pathway located within plastids that also produces heme, siroheme, and phytochromobilin. In photosynthetic organisms, the universal tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 3The abbreviations used are:ALA5-aminolevulinic acidDPIXdeuteroporphyrin IXLHCPlight-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferase, GUN4, GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4Mg-DPIXMg-deuteroporphyrin IXMg-PPIXMg-protoporphyrin IXMg-PPIX MTMg-PPIX methyl transferaseORFopen reading framePOprotoporphyrinogen IX oxidasePPIXprotoporphyrin IXSSthe small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseTic40Translocon at the inner envelope 40Ni-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidDTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMg-PPIX MEMg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester. is derived from glutamyl-tRNA and subsequently converted into protoporphyrinogen IX in the chloroplast stroma. Protoporphyrinogen IX is converted to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) and then ultimately to chlorophylls on plastid membranes. Almost all the genes encoding chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes have been identified. Transcriptional control provides coarse regulation of this pathway, and the regulation of enzyme activities provides fine regulation (1Stephenson P.G. Terry M.J. Photochem. Photobiol.

Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In Synechocystis, one of the GUN4 relatives, sll0558 (hereafter referred to as SynGUN4), was subsequently shown also to be required for the accumulation of chlorophyll (6Wilde A. Mikolajczyk S.

The 140-kDa subunit of Mg-chelatase copurifies with the 22-kDa GUN4 from solubilized Arabidopsis thylakoid membranes (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J.

Mg-chelatase catalyzes the insertion of Mg2+ into PPIX, yielding Mg-protoporphyrin IX (Mg-PPIX). This reaction diverts PPIX from heme biosynthesis and commits this porphyrin to chlorophyll biosynthesis. Mg-chelatase requires three subunits in vitro and in vivo. These three subunits are conserved from prokaryotes to plants and are commonly referred to as BchH or ChlH, BchD or ChlD, and BchI or ChlI. In Arabidopsis, these subunits are 140, 79, and 40 kDa, respectively. ChlH is the porphyrin-binding subunit and is likely the Mg2+-binding subunit of Mg-chelatase. ChlI and ChlD are related to AAA-type ATPases and form two associating hexameric rings that interact with ChlH and drive the ATP-dependent metalation of PPIX (8Masuda T. Photosynth.

Crystal structures of SynGUN4 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus GUN4 indicate a novel fold that resembles a “cupped hand” that binds DPIX and Mg-DPIX (10Verdecia M.A. Larkin R.M. Ferrer J.L. Riek R.

Preincubation experiments indicate that a SynGUN4-DPIX complex stimulates Mg-chelatase more potently than SynGUN4 (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). SynGUN4 was found to lower the KmDPIX of Synechocystis Mg-chelatase (10Verdecia M.A. Larkin R.M. Ferrer J.L. Riek R. Chory J. Noel J.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and to cause a striking increase in the apparent first-order rate constant for DPIX-Mg-chelatase interactions, an effect that is particularly striking at low Mg2+ concentrations (11Davison P.A. Schubert H.L. Reid J.D. Iorg C.D. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7603-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Mg-DPIX binding activity of SynGUN4 was also found to be essential for stimulating Mg-chelatase (10Verdecia M.A. Larkin R.M. Ferrer J.L. Riek R. Chory J. Noel J.P. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GUN4 and Mg-chelatase subunits have been found in both soluble and membrane-containing fractions of purified chloroplasts (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J.

In contrast, protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PO) and Mg-PPIX methyltransferase (Mg-PPIX MT), which function immediately upstream and downstream of Mg-chelatase in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, are found only in the membrane-containing fractions and not in stromal fractions when purified chloroplasts are lysed and fractionated (16van Lis R.

PPIX and Mg-PPIX accumulate in chloroplast membranes rather than soluble fractions, which provides more evidence that these chlorophyll precursors are synthesized on chloroplast membranes (21Mohapatra A. Tripathy B.C. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 94: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). If GUN4 promotes chlorophyll biosynthesis by not only stimulating Mg-chelatase activity but also promoting the formation of enzyme complexes that channel porphyrins into chlorophyll biosynthesis, GUN4 would be expected to more stably associate with chloroplast membranes by interacting with chloroplast membrane lipids or chlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes after binding porphyrins. In the following, we provide experimental evidence supporting this model. For in vitro transcription/translation experiments, the entire GUN4 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from bacterial artificial chromosome clone T1G3 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Ohio State University, Columbus) using CGGGATCCTATCTTCCCCTGACGTGAC, AACTGCAGAAAGACATCAGAAGCTGTAATTTG, and PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCMX-PL1 (22Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) between BamHI and PstI. In vitro transcription and translation of the control protein translocon at the inner envelope 40 (Tic40), the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (SS), and a light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) were as described previously (23Tripp J. Inoue K. Keegstra K. Froehlich J.E. Plant J. 2007; 52: 824-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Olsen L.J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged GUN4 deletion mutant that lacks the predicted 69-residue transit peptide (GST-GUN4 Δ1–69) was used for the expression and purification of GUN4 from Escherichia coli, as described previously (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on each of these plasmids using the QuickChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and oligonucleotides that were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (supplemental Table 1). All mutations were confirmed by sequencing at the Research Technology Support Facility (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 6- to 8-day-old pea seedlings and purified over a Percoll gradient as described previously (25Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.B. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1994: J1:1-15Google Scholar). Intact pea chloroplasts were reisolated and resuspended in import buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0) at a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml. Protein import was performed as described previously (25Bruce B.D. Perry S. Froehlich J. Keegstra K. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.B. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1994: J1:1-15Google Scholar). All precursor proteins used in this study were either radiolabeled with [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine and translated with the TnT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Large scale import assays contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol, 4 mm Mg-ATP, 100 μl of chloroplasts with a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml, and labeled precursor protein at a final volume of 300 μl. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature under white light provided by broad spectrum fluorescent tube lamps at 75 μmol m−2 s−1, the import assay was divided into two 150-μl aliquots. One aliquot was not further treated. For this aliquot, intact chloroplasts were directly recovered by centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion. The remaining aliquot was incubated with trypsin for 30 min on ice as described previously (26Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16583-16588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After stopping the protease treatment with trypsin inhibitor as described previously (26Jackson D.T. Froehlich J.E. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16583-16588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we again recovered chloroplasts by centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion. Recovered intact chloroplasts were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then fractionated into a soluble and membrane-containing pellet fraction by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet fraction contains the outer envelope, inner envelope, and thylakoid membranes. All fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and subjected to fluorography. Fluorograms were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–7 days. Import assays were quantitated by scanning developed films with the VersaDoc 4000 MP Imaging System and Quantity One software, as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Prior to import, intact chloroplasts were incubated in import buffer (330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0) that contained or lacked 10 mm ALA (Sigma) for 15 min at 26 °C in the dark, unless indicated otherwise. PPIX, Mg-PPIX, uroporphyrin III, coproporphyrin III, hemin, and pheophorbide a were all purchased from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT). These porphyrins were first dissolved in DMSO, and their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (27Eichwurzel I. Stiel H. Röder B. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2000; 54: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Rebeiz C.A. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll, and Bilins.

J. 1969; 115: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These stock solutions were diluted with import buffer, giving final porphyrin concentrations of 20 μm and final DMSO concentrations of 1–2%. Intact chloroplasts were incubated in these solutions exactly as described for ALA. Fractionation of chloroplasts was performed as described previously (31Keegstra K. Yousif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), with modifications. First, large scale import assays were performed with (+) or without (−) an ALA pretreatment as described above. After import, intact chloroplasts were recovered by centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion. The intact chloroplasts were then resuspended in 0.6 m sucrose containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EDTA. The suspension was placed on ice for 20 min and then placed at −20 °C overnight. Subsequently, the suspension was thawed at room temperature, gently mixed, and then diluted with 2 volumes of dilution buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 8 mm EDTA). This suspension was then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet predominantly contained the thylakoid fraction and was diluted 2-fold with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The remaining supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet fraction predominantly contained envelopes and was diluted 2-fold in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Cold acetone was added to the supernatant fraction to a final concentration of 80%, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The precipitated soluble protein fraction was resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PPIX and Mg-PPIX levels in purified chloroplasts were quantitated following ALA feeding and mock protein import. 0.1-ml aliquots of chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1,900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C through a 40% Percoll cushion. Recovered chloroplasts were lysed by resuspension in 700 μl of acetone, 0.1 m NH4OH (9:1, v/v). These lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Chlorophyll was removed from the resulting supernatants by hexane extraction as described previously (28Rebeiz C.A. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll, and Bilins. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar). We quantitated the amount of PPIX and Mg-PPIX in these hexane-extracted supernatants using fluorescence spectroscopy with a QuantaMasterTM spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., London Ontario) as described previously (28Rebeiz C.A. Smith A.G. Witty M. Heme, Chlorophyll, and Bilins. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar). PPIX and Mg-PPIX, purchased from Frontier Scientific, were used to construct standard curves. GUN4 Δ1–69 and versions of GUN4 Δ1–69 that contain amino acid substitutions were expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Binding constants were measured by quantitating the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in GUN4 Δ1–69 by bound porphyrins essentially as described for the cyanobacterial relatives of GUN4 (5Larkin R.M. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Chory J. Science. 2003; 299: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Verdecia M.A. Larkin R.M. Ferrer J.L. Riek R. Chory J. Noel J.P.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7603-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm glycerol and contained 200 nm GUN4 Δ1–69 or GUN4 Δ1–69 with the indicated single amino acid changes and variable concentrations of DPIX and Mg-DPIX (Frontier Scientific). We determined binding constants for PPIX, Mg-PPIX, and Mg-PPIX ME, uroporphyrin III, coproporphyrin III, hemin, and pheophorbide a using the same conditions except that binding reactions also contained 1% DMSO. Stock solutions of DPIX and Mg-DPIX were prepared as described previously (33Karger G.A. Reid J.D. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9291-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of all other porphyrins were prepared as described under “ALA and Porphyrin Feeding.” We calculated binding constants using DYNAFIT (34Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Karger G.A. Reid J.D. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9291-9299Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data fit best with a model that predicts a single binding site. Chloroplasts were purified from pea and subjected to hypotonic lysis as described above, except that lysis buffer also contained 1 mm DTT and 2 mm Pefabloc (Sigma). Supernatants were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. We assayed pellet fractions for Mg-chelatase activity immediately by resuspending them in a Mg-chelatase assay buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 9 mm MgCl2, 4 mm MgATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, 60 mm phosphocreatine, 4 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) and incubating the resuspended pellets for 30 min at 30 °C as recommended previously (14Guo R. Luo M. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 605-615Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 35Walker C.J. Weinstein J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PPIX dissolved in DMSO was added to particular reactions as indicated in the text. The final concentrations of PPIX and DMSO were 1.5 μm and 2%, respectively, as recommended previously (36Walker C.J. Weinstein J.D. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 8 μl were removed at 5-min intervals during a 30-min incubation, diluted into 200 μl of acetone, 0.1 m NH4OH (9:1, v/v), and vortexed to terminate the reaction. The terminated reactions were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. Mg-PPIX in the resulting supernatants was quantitated as described under “Quantitative Analysis of Porphyrin Binding.” We subtracted the amount of Mg-PPIX in the membranes before the reactions were initiated from the amount of Mg-PPIX at the end of each time point. Three replicates were analyzed for each time point. Mg-PPIX accumulated linearly for the entire 30-min assay. To assay supernatants for Mg-chelatase activity, supernatants were rapidly thawed, clarified at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and then concentrated nearly 5-fold using an Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device with a nominal molecular weight limit of 10,000 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated supernatants were diluted into a concentrated Mg-chelatase assay buffer yielding the same assay conditions described for pellets. Reactions were initiated by adding 1.5 μm PPIX. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0 ecotype) using the Absolutely mRNA kit (Stratagene). We prepared first-strand cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen). A cDNA encoding a 62-kDa fragment of ChlH that lacks the first 823 amino acid residues (ChlH Δ1–823) was amplified from this first-strand cDNA as described for GUN4 Δ1–69, except that CCGGAATTCGCTGTGGCCACACTGGTCAAC and TCGCGTCGACTTATCGATCGATCCCTTCGATCTTGTC were used. To express ChlH Δ1–823 as a His-tagged protein in E. coli, this PCR product was ligated into pHIS8-3 (37Jez J.M. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) between EcoRI and SalI. The resulting plasmid was sequenced at the Research Technology Support Facility (Michigan State University) to confirm that no mutations were introduced during PCR. The His-tagged ChlH Δ1–823 protein was expressed from the resulting plasmid in the E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus® (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) at 18 °C in Terrific Broth (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). We induced expression by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) when the A600 was 0.8. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C, unless indicated otherwise. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 500 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) per g of bacterial pellet. Cells were lysed by sonication. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was batch-bound to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated in buffer A. Bound proteins were batch-washed twice with buffer A and twice with buffer A lacking Triton X-100. Ni-NTA-agarose was poured into an Econo-Pac column (Bio-Rad), and proteins were step-eluted using buffer B (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 500 mm potassium acetate, 250 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol), digested with thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature, and applied to the aforementioned Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins in the flow-through fraction were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol), applied to a HiPrepTM 16/10 Q FF column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated in buffer D at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient to buffer E (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 1000 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol) also at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions of 2.5 ml containing ChlH Δ1–823 were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a nominal molecular weight limit of 30,000 (Millipore), dialyzed against storage buffer (50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol), flash-frozen with liquid N2, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. For polyclonal antibody development, purified ChlH Δ1–823 was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), and used to develop anti-ChlH Δ1–823 polyclonal antisera in New Zealand White rabbits at Strategic Diagnostics, Inc. (Newark DE). IgGs were purified from these antisera using Affi-Gel protein A (Bio-Rad) as recommended by Harlow and Lane (38Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 70-80Google Scholar). Anti-ChlH Δ1–823 antibodies were affinity-purified from total IgGs on ChlH Δ1–823 columns that were constructed by linking purified ChlH Δ1–823 to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) at ∼15 mg/ml. Antibodies were eluted from the ChlH Δ1–823 columns in buffer F (100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 50% ethylene glycol) and immediately mixed with 1:10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as recommended by Harlow and Lane (38Harlow E.

The interaction blocks formin actin nucleation activity and enhances the Spire activity. Analogous to Spire and Cappuccino, the mammalian homologs Spir-1 and formin-2 show a regulatory interaction. To get an understanding of the nature of the Spir-formin cooperation, we have analyzed the interaction biochemically and biophysically. Our data shows that the association of Spir-1 and formin-2 is not significantly mediated by binding of the Spir-1-KIND domain to the formin FH2 core domain. Instead, a short sequence motif C-terminal adjacent to the formin-2-FH2 domain could be characterized that mediates the interaction and is conserved among the members of the Fmn subgroup of formins. In line with this, we found that both mammalian Spir proteins, Spir-1 and Spir-2, interact with mammalian Fmn subgroup proteins formin-1 and formin-2.

Basic cell biological functions such as proliferation, migration, division, and vesicle transport rely on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The initiation of actin polymerization from free actin monomers is regulated by actin nucleation factors (NF), 2The abbreviations used are:NFnucleation factorFSIformin Spir interactioneFSIextended FSIFCSfetal calf serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateDADdiaphanous autoregulatory domainDIDdiaphanous inhibitory domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteineGFPenhanced GFPTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which help to overcome the kinetic barrier of spontaneous G-actin nucleation and, thus, catalyze the formation of filamentous actin structures and networks (1Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). To date, three different classes of NFs are described, the ARP2/3 complex, FH2 domain containing NFs of the formin superfamily, and NFs containing one or multiple WH2 domains (Spire/Cordon-bleu/Leiomodin) (2Chesarone M.A. Goode B.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The formin superfamily is subdivided into seven subfamilies (Dia, FRL, DAAM, Delphilin, INF, FHOD, Fmn) (3Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of actin nucleation as well as the regulation of the NFs vary significantly between the three classes (and also show variances in between the distinct superfamilies). Spire and Cappuccino are NFs that belong to the Spire subfamily of WH2 containing nucleators and to the Fmn subfamily of the FH2 domain containing formins, respectively. In contrast to the Arp2/3 complex that nucleates branched filaments, Spire and the formin Cappuccino nucleate unbranched actin filaments (4Quinlan M.E. Heuser J.E. Kerkhoff E. Mullins R.D. Nature. 2005; 433: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Almost two decades ago it was found that mutants of the two Drosophila NFs (Spire/Cappuccino) have an identical phenotype in early Drosophila oogenesis, i.e. both induce premature ooplasmic streaming (5Manseau L.J. Schüpbach T. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Theurkauf W.E. Science. 1994; 265: 2093-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Later it was shown that both proteins cooperate in the generation of a dynamic actin mesh in the oocyte that prevents premature ooplasmic streaming (7Dahlgaard K. Raposo A.A. Niccoli T. St Johnston D. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 539-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Spire and Cappuccino do not solely have the same mutant phenotype; the proteins also physically interact and cross-regulate each other. The Cappuccino C-terminal half, encoding the FH2 domain and flanking sequences, enhances the nucleation activity of Spire, whereas the nucleation activity of Cappuccino is decreased in the presence of the Spire-KIND domain (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Cappuccino belongs to the Fmn subgroup of formins (3Higgs H.N.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2482-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In mammals, two Fmn subgroup members (formin-1, formin-2) and two Spir proteins (Spir-1, Spir-2) exist (3Higgs H.N. Peterson K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Schumacher N. Borawski J.M. Leberfinger C.B. Gessler M. Kerkhoff E. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The formin-2 and spir-1 genes are coexpressed in the developing and adult nervous system, and the proteins interact analogous to their Drosophila counterparts Spire and Cappuccino (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Schumacher N. Borawski J.M. Leberfinger C.B. Gessler M. Kerkhoff E. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several reports showed the importance of formin-2 in mouse oogenesis and here especially in the positioning of the meiotic spindle (11Azoury J. Lee K.W. Georget V. Rassinier P. Leader B. Verlhac M.H. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1514-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Dumont J. Million K. Sunderland K. Rassinier P. Lim H. Leader B. Verlhac M.H. Dev.

Recently it was found that a dynamic actin mesh, as during Drosophila oogenesis, is also required for mouse oogenesis (11Azoury J. Lee K.W. Georget V. Rassinier P. Leader B. Verlhac M.H. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1514-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 14Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1986-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The correct localization of the meiotic spindle during mouse oogenesis and the resulting asymmetric division depends on an actin mesh that is built up by formin-2. Myosin-2 generates the pulling forces required for spindle movement (14Schuh M. Ellenberg J. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1986-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Beside the evolutionary conserved roles for the formins Cappuccino and formin-2, Spire family proteins also seem to be evolutionary conserved regulators of oocyte development. Spire genes of the African clawed frog Xenopus (pEg6) and the sea squirt Ciona savignyi (Pem-5) have been identified as maternal genes in the oocyte in analogy to its Drosophila homolog and are proposed to function in polarity during early embryogenesis (15Le Goff C. Laurent V. Le Bon K. Tanguy G. Couturier A. Le Goff X. Le Guellec R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Satou Y. Satoh N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In an initial characterization it was found that the KIND domains of Spir-1/dSpire interact with the C-terminal sequences of formin-2/Cappuccino, which encode the FH2 domains and flanking sequences (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To gain a further understanding of the interaction and cross-regulation of the two proteins, we investigated this interaction in detail. The objective of the study was the dissection of the formin-2/Spir-1 interaction and the determination of the structural elements that are responsible for the binding. The dissection revealed a high affinity Spir-1 interaction site of formin-2, which could be mapped to the very C terminus of formin-2 adjacent to its core FH2 domain (formin Spir interaction (FSI) sequence). The FSI sequence is conserved among the members of the Fmn subgroup. Consistently we found that all mammalian members of the two distinct nucleator families, Spir-1/2 and Fmn-1/2, interact with each other.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and PurificationAll Spir and formin constructs were generated by standard cloning techniques using Pfu DNA polymerase from Promega® and restriction enzymes and T4-DNA ligase from New England Biolabs® according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Expression vectors were from GE Healthcare® (pGEX), Invitrogen (pProExHTb, pcDNA3), QIAgen® (pQE80L), and Takara/Clontech® (pEGFP-C1, pAcGFP-C1). The Spir and formin proteins correspond to Swiss-Prot entry numbers Q08AE8–2 (hs Spir-1 (II)), Q8WWL2 (hs Spir-2), Q05860 (mm formin-1 (IV)), and Q9JL04 (mm formin-2). Supplemental Table S1 summarizes constructs, a brief description, fragment boundaries, purification scheme, and their purpose in this study (supplemental Table S1). For prokaryotic expression of proteins, Escherchia coli Rosetta pLysS bacteria were transformed with plasmids encoding for glutathione S-transferase (GST) and His6-tagged Spir and formin proteins, respectively. Bacteria were grown in LB (+100 mg/liter ampicillin and 30 mg/liter chloramphenicol) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was initiated by induction with 100–300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to proceed at 20 °C for 12–18 h. Bacteria were lysed by ultrasonication, and soluble proteins were purified with an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity (Ni-NTA HP, GE Healthcare), GSH affinity (GSH-Sepharose FF, GE Healthcare), cation exchange (SP-Sepharose XL, GE Healthcare), and size exclusion (Sephadex G200, GE Healthcare) chromatography according to the manufacturers' recommendations. His and GST tags were cleaved where indicated by tobacco etch virus protease. Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 ultracentrifugation devices with molecular mass cut offs of 3,000, 10,000, and 30,000 Da (Millipore®). The final purity of the constructs was estimated by SDS-Tris-PAGE and SDS-Tricine-PAGE using Image J gel analysis software (rsb.info.nih.gov) (supplemental Fig. S4).Fluorophore LabelingFor anisotropy measurements, proteins and peptides were labeled on cysteines with the thiol-reactive maleimidocaproyl-linked BodipyFLTM-fluorophore (Probes®). Proteins were buffer-exchanged into labeling buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) using Nap10 columns (GE Healthcare). A 2-fold molar excess of dye was coupled with the protein (1–5 g/liter) for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Excess non-reacted dye was quenched with 20 mm dithioerythritol and subsequently removed using Nap10 columns. The degree of labeling was ∼ 0.2–0.25 for the Fmn peptides and ∼0.75 for the KIND domain.Cell Culture and TransfectionHeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HiClone®), 2 mm l-glutamate (Glu), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Cells were transfected with LipofectamineTM/Lipofectamine 2000TM according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly cells were seeded in DMEM supplemented with FCS but without Glu and penicillin/streptomycin 24 h before transfection. At the day of transfection, cells reached a confluency of 80–90%. For HeLa cells (∼8 × 105 cells) 6 μl of Lipofectamine were incubated with 1.4 μg of DNA in DMEM for 20 min; HEK293 and HeLa cells (∼8 × 105 cells) were transfected alternatively with 7.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/4 μg of DNA in DMEM). After 5 h the medium was changed to DMEM containing FCS, penicillin/streptomycin, and Glu. Cells were allowed to express proteins for 24–36 h.GST Pulldown AssayFor GST Pulldown experiments with the GST-KIND domains and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged formin proteins, ∼50 μg of purified GST/GST fusion proteins bound to 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) were used. Cell lysates were prepared by lysing ∼3 × 106 HEK293 cells in 900 μl of pulldown buffer 1 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. 50 μg of GSH-Sepharose 4B-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with the high speed supernatant of the cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5 times with pulldown buffer 1 and analyzed by PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis. GFP-tagged proteins were detected with a rabbit A.V-living colors antibody (1 μg/ml; Takara/Clontech), a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000; GE Healthcare), and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from GE Healthcare.Analytical Gel FiltrationAnalytical Gel filtration experiments were done in analytical gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithioerythritol) using a computer-controlled ÄKTATM purifier high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a Sephadex G200 15/30 column (∼23-ml volume) at 6–8 °C. The injection volume of the proteins was 100 μl with concentrations ranging from ∼2 g/liter for the Spir-KIND domains, ∼3.5 g/liter for the formin FH2 domains, and ∼0.6 or 2 g/liter for the formin peptides. The flow rate was kept constant at 0.4 ml/min. Eluted proteins were collected in 1-ml fractions and analyze by PAGE to verify the identity of the proteins in the distinct peak fractions. Data analysis and processing were done with the Unicorn evaluation software (GE Healthcare) and Sigma Plot 9.0 (Systat Software®). Molecular weight calibration of the analytical gel filtration column was done using the Sigma gel filtration molecular mass standard kit 12,000–200,000 Da (cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; b-amylase, 200 kDa). The observed molecular masses for the individual proteins and protein complexes can be found in Table 1.TABLE 1Observed masses of Spir/formin constructs and complexes from the analytical gel filtrationProteinTheoretical massObserved massOligomer state/stoichiometryDaDaSpir-1-KIND25.840.4MonomerSpir-2-KIND21.243.3MonomerFmn-2-FH2-FSI52.7123.8/239.5Dimer/tetramerFmn-2-FH251.2113.4/262.3Dimer/tetramerFmn-2-eFSI7.116.6DimerFmn-2-FSI3.88.0DimerFmn-1-FH250.8100.4DimerSpir-1-KIND and Fmn-2-FH2-FSI157.0 (164.2)164.51:2Spir-1-KIND and Fmn-2-eFSI32.9 (57.0)47.41:2Spir-2-KIND and Fmn-2-eFSI28.3 (59.9)51.91:2Spir-1-KIND and Fmn-2-FSI29.6 (48.4)39.01:2 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence AnisotropyFluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in a Horriba Jobin Yvon® Fluoromax-4 spectrophotometer in anisotropy buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) at 20 °C. The BodipyFLTM fluorophore was excited at 495 nm, and emission was collected at 510 nm, with an integration time of 2 s for the BodipyFLTM-labeled formin peptides (∼100 nm) and 4 s for the BodipyFLTM-labeled Spir-1-KIND domain (∼100 nm). The slit width of the emission and excitation monochromators was set to 2 nm for the BodipyFLTM-labeled formin peptides and 3 nm for the labeled Spir-1-KIND domain, respectively. Each data point of the binding curve is the mean of at least eight collected polarization signals. Data analysis and processing was done with Sigma Plot 9.0 (Systat Software).Equilibrium binding data were fitted according to the equationy=a⋅xb+x(Eq. 1) with a representing the maximum amplitude (Bmax), and b representing the equilibrium constant (Kd). Competition binding experiments were performed as described by Vinson et al. (17Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Competition binding curve was fitted according to the equationr=rf+rb−rfKd⋅C+Kd2Kd2⋅R0(Eq. 2) where is the anisotropy, rb if the anisotropy of the Spir-1-KIND·Bodipy-Fmn-2-eFSI complex, rf is the anisotropy of the free Bodipy-labeled eFSI, [C] is the concentration of the unlabeled eFSI, [R0] is the concentration of the free Spir-1-KIND when [C] = 0, Kd is the dissociation constant for the binding of the Bodipy-labeled eFSI to Spir-1-KIND, and Kd2 is the dissociation constant for the binding of the unlabeled eFSI to Spir-1-KIND.Immunostaining and Fluorescence MicroscopyLipofectamineTM- transfected HeLa cells seeded on 13-mm round glass slides were fixed with 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3.5 min at 20–22 °C. Immunostaining was done by incubating the cells with the mouse anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz®) at a concentration of 4 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% (v/v) FCS at room temperature for 60 min. TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dianova®, 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline + 1% (v/v) FCS) was allowed to react with the primary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Stained cells were mounted in moviol solution (15% (w/v) moviol, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.25% (w/v) N-propyl gallate in phosphate-buffered saline) and analyzed with a Leica® AF6000LX imaging system equipped with a Leica® HCX PL APO 63×/1.30 glycerol objective and a Leica® DFC350FX camera. Images were deconvoluted (blind) with the deconvolution software from Leica® (Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence) and further processed with Adobe® Photoshop CS.Native Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisNative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was performed with a Laemmli native PAGE system. 20 μm Spir-KIND was incubated for 20 min in the presence or absence of increasing amounts of formin-2 peptides (0–45 μm Fmn-2-eFSI; 0–80 μm Fmn-2-FSI) in anisotropy buffer at 20–22 °C. Subsequent gel electrophoresis was conducted at 150 V for 20 min followed by a 300-V step for 50 min for Spir-1-KIND. Gel electrophoresis for Spir-2-KIND was performed as for Spir-1 except that the second voltage step lasts only 30 min due to the higher negative charge of the Spir-2-KIND domain.RESULTSThe Spir-1-KIND Domain Binds to the Extreme C Terminus of Formin-2The Spir-1 and formin-2 proteins interact directly with each other (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Spir-1-KIND domain and the C-terminal part of the formin-2 protein encoding the FH2 domain and flanking the C-terminal sequences mediate the interaction. Formin-2 actin nucleation activity is blocked by the interaction of the formin with the Spir-KIND domain (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To gain more insights into the interaction between the Spir-1-KIND domain and the formin-2 C-terminal half encoding the actin nucleating FH2 domain and flanking sequences, we have investigated this interaction structurally and biochemically.Purified bacterially expressed recombinant proteins have been employed in analytical gel filtration experiments to analyze the complex formation and dissect the sequences necessary for the interaction. In agreement with previous findings (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we found that the KIND domain of Spir-1 (Fig. 1B, KIND short) does not adopt a globular shape, as it migrates on the analytical gel filtration faster than expected from its molecular mass (Fig. 2A, black curve, peak 1, Table 1). The purified formin-2 C-terminal part encoding the FH2 domain and flanking C-terminal sequences (Fig. 1A, Fmn-2-FH2-FSI) eluted in fractions corresponding to dimeric and tetrameric proteins as judged by the elution volumes of marker proteins (Fig. 2A, red curve, 1 and 2, Table 1). Mixing the two proteins resulted in a complex formation, which is nicely documented by a shift of the lower molecular mass form in peak 2 in the elution profile toward higher molecular masses (Fig. 2A, green curve, peak 1) and a co-elution of the Spir-1-KIND domain and the Fmn-2-FH2-FSI protein (Fig. 2A, inset, corresponding to green peak 1). Mixing of the two proteins was also accompanied by partial precipitation of the complex, explaining the decreased signal intensity of the peak fraction containing the complex.FIGURE 2.Analytical gel filtration analysis of Spir-1-KIND and formin-2 C-terminal constructs. The Spir-1-KIND domain interacts with formin-2-FH2-FSI (A) but not with a formin-2-FH2 construct lacking the FSI (B). The last 55 amino acids of the C terminus of formin-2 (eFSI) comprising the last predicted α-helix of the FH2 domain and the FSI bind to the KIND domain of Spir-1 (C). Even the last 29 amino acids of the C terminus outside the core FH2 domain of formin-2 (FSI) still bind to the KIND domain of Spir-1 (D). Insets show the presence of Spir- and formin proteins in the peak fractions (depending on the width of the peak 2 or 3 peak fractions, respectively) of the complexes (insets A, C, and D) and no Spir-1-KIND when mixing Spir-1-KIND and Fmn-2-FH2 lacking the conserved FSI (inset B, green curve, peak 2).

Because the interaction of Spir-1-KIND and the formin-2 protein blocks the actin nucleation activity of the formin, we next tested if the Spir-1-KIND domain binds the formin-2-FH2 core domain (Fig. 1A, Fmn-2-FH2). In contrast to the Fmn-2-FH2-FSI protein that formed a complex with the Spir-1-KIND domain, we could not detect a stable complex formation of the formin-2-FH2 core domain with the Spir-1-KIND domain in our gel filtration experiments (Fig. 2B), which is most likely because of a significant decrease in affinity. The elution profile of the mixed proteins was identical with that of the two individual proteins (Fig. 2B, red, black, and green curves). No Spir-1-KIND protein was shifted into the fraction of Fmn-2-FH2 (Fig. 2B, inset, corresponding to green peak 2).This suggests that flanking sequences of the FH2 core domain mediate the interaction. As no stable complex formation of the Spir-1-KIND domain and the core FH2 domain of formin-2 could be detected on the analytical gel filtration, an interaction sequence of the C terminus of formin-2 outside the core FH2 domain was assumed. To test this, we expressed and purified a peptide comprising the last 56 amino acids of formin-2 (Fmn-2-eFSI). This peptide coeluted with the Spir-1-KIND domain on the analytical gel filtration column, indicating the formation of a complex of the Spir-1-KIND domain and the formin-2 C terminus (Fig. 2C, inset corresponding to green peak 1). An even shorter peptide comprising the last 29 amino acids of the C terminus of formin-2 (Fmn-2-FSI) also coeluted with the core KIND domain of Spir-1 in the analytical gel filtration, indicating that the last 29 amino acids provide the main binding site for the Spir-1-KIND domain (Fig. 2D, inset corresponding to green peak 1). One should note that in the case of the small FSI peptide, no shift of the KIND domain to a higher molecular mass could be observed. This indicates that the core binding motif of Fmn-2 either fills a cavity in the KIND domain or tightly wraps around the KIND domain. This assumption is supported by the fact that the complex of the KIND domain and the Fmn-2-eFSI also elutes at lower molecular weights than expected from the cumulative observed masses for the two proteins (see Table 1). In contrast to the results of Quinlan et al. (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), who deduced from their analytical ultracentrifugation studies a 2:2 stoichiometry of the Spir-formin complex, our analytical gel filtration analysis along with the densitometric analysis of the peak complex fractions on the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2; insets) suggest a 1:2 stoichiometry of the KIND-formin complex (see Table 1). The discrepancy between the work done by Quinlan et al. (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and our work concerning the stoichiometry of the complex may be because of the different methods used and subsequent data interpretation.It is interesting to note that alignments of the very C-terminal sequences of Fmn subgroup proteins from flies, fish, birds, and mammals show a conserved sequence motif within the C-terminal region which we have mapped as an FSI sequence (Fig. 1C). The conserved sequence is unique for Fmn subgroup proteins and could not be detected in other formins. This suggests that next to Drosophila Cappuccino and vertebrate formin-2, the third member of this protein subgroup, the formin-1 protein, also may interact with Spir proteins (see below).To further analyze the interaction of the C terminus of formin-2 with the KIND domain of Spir-1, colocalization studies in HeLa cells were performed in which Spir-1-KIND and formin-2-eFSI were transiently overexpressed (Fig. 3). Analogous to the assays by Quinlan et al. (8Quinlan M.E. Hilgert S. Bedrossian A. Mullins R.D. Kerkhoff E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), a membrane-targeted Myc-tagged Spir-1-KIND domain (Myc-Spir-1-KIND-CAAX) was used to relocate a green fluorescence protein-tagged formin-2 C-terminal peptide (pAcGFP-Fmn2-eFSI) to the membrane in HeLa cells. When expressed alone, the GFP-fused Fmn-2-eFSI construct was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). Coexpression of AcGFP-Fmn-2-eFSI and the membrane-targeted KIND domain results in a relocalization of the GFP-tagged formin-2 peptide to the plasma membrane, indicating an interaction of the proteins.FIGURE 3.Colocalization of membrane-targeted Myc-Spir-1-KIND and AcGFP-Fmn-2-eFSI in HeLa cells.

When expressed alone, AcGFP-Fmn-2-eFSI (green) is distributed evenly in the cytoplasm. Coexpression of AcGFP-Fmn-2-eFSI (green) and a membrane-targeted version of the KIND domain of Spir-1 (Myc-Spir-1-KIND-CAAX (red)) translocates AcGFP-Fmn-2-eFSI to the membrane.

As we cannot exclude from our gel filtration experiments that the FH2 core domain does not contribute to the overall binding of the KIND domain, we have analyzed the interaction of the Spir-1-KIND domain with the various C-terminal formin constructs. Using a fluorescent BodipyFl-labeled version of the core Spir-1-KIND domain, the interaction of the KIND domain with the core FH2 domain of formin-2 and the FH2 domain plus its C-terminal extension (Fmn-2-FH2, Fmn-2-FH2-FSI) was probed (Fig. 4, A and B). To monitor the interaction of the C terminus of formin-2 (Fmn-2-eFSI, Fmn-2-FSI) and the Spir-1 KIND domain, BodipyFl-labeled C-terminal peptides of formin-2 were used (Fig. 4, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W2111472676,"Epigenetic reprogramming plays a central role in the development of cloned embryos generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and it is believed that aberrant reprogramming leads to the abnormal development of most cloned embryos. Recent studies show that trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) contributes to the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency because the differentiation genes are always occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at H3K27, which represses gene expression. Here, we provide evidence that differential H3K27me3 modification exists between normal fertilization-produced blastocysts and somatic cell nuclear transfer cloned blastocysts; H3K27me3 was specifically found in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of normal blastocysts, whereas there was no modification of H3K27me3 in the ICM of cloned blastocysts. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the differentiation-related genes, which are marked by H3K27me3 in embryonic stem cells, were expressed at significantly higher levels in cloned embryos than in normal embryos. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component genes (Eed, Ezh2, and Suz12), which are responsible for the generation of H3K27me3, were expressed at lower levels in the cloned embryos. Our results suggest that reduced expression of PRC2 component genes in cloned embryos results in defective modification of H3K27me3 to the differentiation-related genes in pluripotent ICM cells. This results in premature expression of developmental genes and death of somatic cloned embryos shortly after implantation. Taken together, these studies suggest that H3K27me3 might be an important epigenetic marker with which to evaluate the developmental potential of cloned embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2051572996,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in cardiac contractility and heart disease. However, the specific role of alternatively spliced variants of CaMKII in cardiac disease and apoptosis remains poorly explored. Here we report that the δB subunit of CaMKII (CaMKIIδB), which is the predominant nuclear isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in heart muscle, acts as an anti-apoptotic factor and is a novel target of the antineoplastic and cardiomyopathic drug doxorubicin (Dox (adriamycin)). Hearts of rats that develop cardiomyopathy following chronic treatment with Dox also show down-regulation of CaMKIIδB mRNA, which correlates with decreased cardiac function <i>in vivo</i>, reduced expression of sarcomeric proteins, and increased tissue damage associated with Dox cardiotoxicity. Overexpression of CaMKIIδB in primary cardiac cells inhibits Dox-mediated apoptosis and prevents the loss of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Specific silencing of CaMKIIδB by small interfering RNA prevents the formation of organized sarcomeres and decreases the expression of Bcl-2, which all mimic the effect of Dox. CaMKIIδB is required for GATA-4-mediated co-activation and binding to the <i>Bcl-2</i> promoter. These results reveal that CaMKIIδB plays an essential role in cardiomyocyte survival and provide a mechanism for the protective role of CaMKIIδB. These results suggest that selective targeting of CaMKII in the nuclear compartment might represent a strategy to regulate cardiac apoptosis and to reduce Dox-mediated cardiotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1972572560,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a tightly regulated anaplerotic enzyme situated at a major branch point of the plant C metabolism. Two distinct oligomeric classes of PEPC occur in the triglyceride-rich endosperm of developing castor oil seeds (COS). Class-1 PEPC is a typical homotetramer composed of identical 107-kDa plant-type PEPC (PTPC) subunits (encoded by RcPpc3), whereas the novel Class-2 PEPC 910-kDa hetero-octameric complex arises from a tight interaction between Class-1 PEPC and distantly related 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPC (BTPC) polypeptides (encoded by RcPpc4). Here, COS BTPC was expressed from full-length RcPpc4 cDNA in Escherichia coli as an active PEPC that exhibited unusual properties relative to PTPCs, including a tendency to form large aggregates, enhanced thermal stability, a high K(m)((PEP)), and insensitivity to metabolite effectors. A chimeric 900-kDa Class-2 PEPC hetero-octamer having a 1:1 stoichiometry of BTPC:PTPC subunits was isolated from a mixture of clarified extracts containing recombinant RcPPC4 and an Arabidopsis thaliana Class-1 PEPC (the PTPC, AtPPC3). The purified Class-2 PEPC exhibited biphasic PEP saturation kinetics with high and low affinity sites attributed to its AtPPC3 and RcPPC4 subunits, respectively. The RcPPC4 subunits: (i) catalyzed the majority of the Class-2 PEPC V(max), particularly in the presence of the inhibitor l-malate, and (ii) also functioned as Class-2 PEPC regulatory subunits by modulating PEP binding and catalytic potential of its AtPPC3 subunits. BTPCs appear to associate with PTPCs to form stable Class-2 PEPC complexes in vivo that are hypothesized to maintain high flux from PEP under physiological conditions that would otherwise inhibit Class-1 PEPCs."
https://openalex.org/W1977564323,"The perceived emotional value of stimuli and, as a consequence the subjective emotional experience with them, can be affected by context-dependent styles of processing. Therefore, the investigation of the neural correlates of emotional experience requires accounting for such a variable, a matter of an experimental challenge. Closing the eyes affects the style of attending to auditory stimuli by modifying the perceptual relationship with the environment without changing the stimulus itself. In the current study, we used fMRI to characterize the neural mediators of such modification on the experience of emotionality in music. We assumed that closed eyes position will reveal interplay between different levels of neural processing of emotions. More specifically, we focused on the amygdala as a central node of the limbic system and on its co-activation with the Locus Ceruleus (LC) and Ventral Prefrontal Cortex (VPFC); regions involved in processing of, respectively, 'low', visceral-, and 'high', cognitive-related, values of emotional stimuli. Fifteen healthy subjects listened to negative and neutral music excerpts with eyes closed or open. As expected, behavioral results showed that closing the eyes while listening to emotional music resulted in enhanced rating of emotionality, specifically of negative music. In correspondence, fMRI results showed greater activation in the amygdala when subjects listened to the emotional music with eyes closed relative to eyes open. More so, by using voxel-based correlation and a dynamic causal model analyses we demonstrated that increased amygdala activation to negative music with eyes closed led to increased activations in the LC and VPFC. This finding supports a system-based model of perceived emotionality in which the amygdala has a central role in mediating the effect of context-based processing style by recruiting neural operations involved in both visceral (i.e. 'low') and cognitive (i.e. 'high') related processes of emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2067087310,"FACT is a heterodimer of SPT16 and SSRP1, which each contain several conserved regions in the primary structure. The interaction of FACT with nucleosomes induces chromatin remodeling through the combinatorial action of its distinct functional protein regions. However, there is little mechanistic insight into how these regions cooperatively contribute to FACT functions, particularly regarding the recognition of nucleosomal DNA. Here, we report the identification of novel phosphorylation sites of Drosophila melanogaster FACT (dFACT) expressed in Sf9 cells. These sites are densely concentrated in the acidic intrinsically disordered (ID) region of the SSRP1 subunit and control nucleosomal DNA binding by dFACT. This region and the adjacent segment of the HMG domain form weak electrostatic intramolecular interactions, which is reinforced by the phosphorylation, thereby blocking DNA binding competitively. Importantly, this control mechanism appears to support rapid chromatin transactions during early embryogenesis through the dephosphorylation of some sites in the maternally transmitted dSSRP1."
https://openalex.org/W2068545892,"Homologous recombination represents an important means for the error-free elimination of DNA double-strand breaks and other deleterious DNA lesions from chromosomes. The Rad51 recombinase, a member of the RAD52 group of recombination proteins, catalyzes the homologous recombination reaction in the context of a helical protein polymer assembled on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is derived from the nucleolytic processing of a primary lesion. The assembly of the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament, often referred to as the presynaptic filament, is prone to interference by the single-strand DNA-binding factor replication protein A (RPA). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad52 protein facilitates presynaptic filament assembly by helping to mediate the displacement of RPA from ssDNA. On the other hand, disruption of the presynaptic filament by the Srs2 helicase leads to a net exchange of Rad51 for RPA. To understand the significance of protein-protein interactions in the control of Rad52- or Srs2-mediated presynaptic filament assembly or disassembly, we have examined two rad51 mutants, rad51 Y388H and rad51 G393D, that are simultaneously ablated for Rad52 and Srs2 interactions and one, rad51 A320V, that is differentially inactivated for Rad52 binding for their biochemical properties and also for functional interactions with Rad52 or Srs2. We show that these mutant rad51 proteins are impervious to the mediator activity of Rad52 or the disruptive function of Srs2 in concordance with their protein interaction defects. Our results thus provide insights into the functional significance of the Rad51-Rad52 and Rad51-Srs2 complexes in the control of presynaptic filament assembly and disassembly. Moreover, our biochemical studies have helped identify A320V as a separation-of-function mutation in Rad51 with regards to a differential ablation of Rad52 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1967394342,"Background The lack of axonal regeneration in the central nervous system is attributed among other factors to the formation of a glial scar. This cellular structure is mainly composed of reactive astrocytes that overexpress two intermediate filament proteins, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin. Indeed, in vitro, astrocytes lacking GFAP or both GFAP and vimentin were shown to be the substrate for increased neuronal plasticity. Moreover, double knockout mice lacking both GFAP and vimentin presented lower levels of glial reactivity in vivo, significant axonal regrowth and improved functional recovery in comparison with wild-type mice after spinal cord hemisection. From these results, our objective was to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for axonal regeneration, based on the targeted suppression of astroglial reactivity and scarring by lentiviral-mediated RNA-interference (RNAi). Methods and Findings In this study, we constructed two lentiviral vectors, Lv-shGFAP and Lv-shVIM, which allow efficient and stable RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous GFAP or vimentin in vitro. In cultured cortical and spinal reactive astrocytes, the use of these vectors resulted in a specific, stable and highly significant decrease in the corresponding protein levels. In a second model — scratched primary cultured astrocytes — Lv-shGFAP, alone or associated with Lv-shVIM, decreased astrocytic reactivity and glial scarring. Finally, in a heterotopic coculture model, cortical neurons displayed higher survival rates and increased neurite growth when cultured with astrocytes in which GFAP and vimentin had been invalidated by lentiviral-mediated RNAi. Conclusions Lentiviral-mediated knockdown of GFAP and vimentin in astrocytes show that GFAP is a key target for modulating reactive gliosis and monitoring neuron/glia interactions. Thus, manipulation of reactive astrocytes with the Lv-shGFAP vector constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for increasing glial permissiveness and permitting axonal regeneration after central nervous system lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1975697750,"The formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones requires highly coordinated restructuring of endothelial cells (EC) and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Directed EC migration is a central step in this process and depends on cellular signaling cascades that initiate and control the structural rearrangements. On the basis of earlier findings that ERK5 deficiency in mouse EC results in massive defects in vessel architecture, we focused on the impact of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway on EC migration. Using a retroviral gene transfer approach, we found that constitutive activation of MEK5/ERK5 signaling strongly inhibits EC migration and results in massive morphological changes. The area covered by spread EC was dramatically enlarged, accompanied by an increase in focal contacts and altered organization of actin filaments. Consequently, cells were more rigid and show reduced motility. This phenotype was most likely based on decreased focal contact turnover caused by reduced expression of p130Cas, a key player in directed cell migration. We demonstrate for the first time that ERK5 signaling not only is involved in EC survival and stress response but also controls migration and morphology of EC."
https://openalex.org/W1988163448,"Background Biogenic amines are implicated in reinforcing associative learning. Octopamine (OA) is considered the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline and several studies in insects converge on the idea that OA mediates the reward in appetitive conditioning. However, it is possible to assume that OA could have a different role in an aversive conditioning. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we pharmacologically studied the participation of OA in two learning processes in the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus, one appetitive and one aversive. It is shown that the aversive memory is impaired by an OA injection applied immediately or 30 minutes after the last training trial. By contrast, the appetitive memory is blocked by OA antagonists epinastine and mianserine, but enhanced by OA when injected together with the supply of a minimum amount of reinforcement. Finally, double-learning experiments in which crabs are given the aversive and the appetitive learning either successively or simultaneously allow us to study the interaction between both types of learning and analyze the presumed action of OA. We found that the appetitive training offered immediately, but not one hour, after an aversive training has an amnesic effect on the aversive memory, mimicking the effect and the kinetic of an OA injection. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that the role of OA is divergent in two memory processes of opposite signs: on the one hand it would mediate the reinforcement in appetitive learning, and on the other hand it has a deleterious effect over aversive memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2029243839,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis P450 enzymes are of interest for their pharmacological development potential, as evidenced by their susceptibility to inhibition by antifungal azole drugs that normally target sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51). Although antifungal azoles show promise, direct screening of compounds against M. tuberculosis P450 enzymes may identify novel, more potent, and selective inhibitory scaffolds. Here we report that CYP130 from M. tuberculosis has a natural propensity to bind primary arylamines with particular chemical architectures. These compounds were identified via a high throughput screen of CYP130 with a library of synthetic organic molecules. As revealed by subsequent x-ray structure analysis, selected compounds bind in the active site by Fe-coordination and hydrogen bonding of the arylamine group to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly(243). As evidenced by the binding of structural analogs, the primary arylamine group is indispensable, but synergism due to hydrophobic contacts between the rest of the molecule and protein amino acid residues is responsible for a binding affinity comparable with that of the antifungal azole drugs. The topology of the CYP130 active site favors angular coordination of the arylamine group over the orthogonal coordination of azoles. Upon substitution of Gly(243) by an alanine, the binding mode of azoles and some arylamines reverted from type II to type I because of hydrophobic and steric interactions with the alanine side chain. We suggest a role for the conserved Ala(Gly)(243)-Gly(244) motif in the I-helix in modulating both the binding affinity of the axial water ligand and the ligand selectivity of cytochrome P450 enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2045490695,"Sequence similarity to characterized proteins provides testable functional hypotheses for less than 50% of the proteins identified by genome sequencing projects. With structural genomics it is believed that structural similarities may give functional hypotheses for many of the remaining proteins.We provide a systematic analysis of the structure-function relationship in proteins using the novel concept of local descriptors of protein structure. A local descriptor is a small substructure of a protein which includes both short- and long-range interactions. We employ a library of commonly reoccurring local descriptors general enough to assemble most existing protein structures. We then model the relationship between these local shapes and Gene Ontology using rule-based learning. Our IF-THEN rule model offers legible, high resolution descriptions that combine local substructures and is able to discriminate functions even for functionally versatile folds such as the frequently occurring TIM barrel and Rossmann fold. By evaluating the predictive performance of the model, we provide a comprehensive quantification of the structure-function relationship based only on local structure similarity. Our findings are, among others, that conserved structure is a stronger prerequisite for enzymatic activity than for binding specificity, and that structure-based predictions complement sequence-based predictions. The model is capable of generating correct hypotheses, as confirmed by a literature study, even when no significant sequence similarity to characterized proteins exists.Our approach offers a new and complete description and quantification of the structure-function relationship in proteins. By demonstrating how our predictions offer higher sensitivity than using global structure, and complement the use of sequence, we show that the presented ideas could advance the development of meta-servers in function prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2089507709,"The Mcm10 protein is essential for chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. We purified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mcm10 (ScMcm10) and characterized its DNA binding properties. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that ScMcm10 binds stably to both double strand (ds) DNA and single strand (ss) DNA. On short DNA templates of 25 or 50 bp, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed a approximately 1:1 stoichiometry of ScMcm10 to dsDNA. On longer dsDNA templates, however, multiple copies of ScMcm10 cooperated in the rapid assembly of a large, stable nucleoprotein complex. The amount of protein bound was directly proportional to the length of the DNA, with an average occupancy spacing of 21-24 bp. This tight spacing is consistent with a nucleoprotein structure in which ScMcm10 is aligned along the helical axis of the dsDNA. In contrast, the stoichiometry of ScMcm10 bound to ssDNA of 20-50 nucleotides was approximately 3:1 suggesting that interaction with ssDNA induces the assembly of a multisubunit ScMcm10 complex composed of at least three subunits. The tight packing of ScMcm10 on dsDNA and the assembly of a multisubunit complex on ssDNA suggests that, in addition to protein-DNA, protein-protein interactions may be involved in forming the nucleoprotein complex. We propose that these DNA binding properties have an important role in (i) initiation of DNA replication and (ii) formation and maintenance of a stable replication fork during the elongation phase of chromosomal DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2021016119,"Background The development and course of Crohn's disease (CD) is related to both genetic and environmental factors. Smoking has been found to exacerbate the course of CD by increasing the risk of developing fistulas and strictures as well as the need for surgery, possibly because of an interaction between smoking or nicotine on macrophage function and the intestinal microvasculature. Several genes are involved in the pathogenesis of CD, and in this study the gene expression differences of the descending colonic mucosa were investigated in CD (smokers or never smokers) and controls (smokers or never smokers). Aim To identify any difference in gene expression of the descending colonic mucosa between smoking and never-smoking CD patients (and controls) by determining genetic expression profiles from microarray analysis. Methods Fifty-seven specimens were obtained by routine colonoscopy from the included material: CD smokers (n = 28) or never-smokers (n = 14) as compared to fifteen healthy controls (8 smokers and 7 never-smokers). RNA was isolated and gene expression assessed with Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0. Data were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), Wilcoxon rank sum test and multiple linear regressions. Real-time (RT) PCR was subsequently applied to verify microarray results. Results The PCA analysis showed no intrinsic clustering of smokers versus never-smokers. However, when Wilcoxon rank sum test corrected with Q values were performed, six known genes were significantly expressed differently in the inflamed CD smokers as compared to the inflamed CD never-smokers: ring finger protein 138 (RNF138), metalothionein 2A (MT2A) and six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3), SA hypertension-associated homolog, PGM2L1 and KCNJ2. The subsequent RT-PCR-analyses verified, however, that only RNF138, MT2A and STEAP3 were significantly up-regulated in CD smokers in specimens with inflammatory activity of the descending colon. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that the genes, RNF138, MT2A, and STEAP3 are differently expressed in the inflamed descending colon of smoking versus never-smoking CD patients, which might be of relevance for the poorer clinical course among CD smokers. Many gastroenterologists are still not totally aware of the benefits of smoking cessation in relation to CD, and do not put much effort into getting the patients to quit, therefore more information on the negative effects of smoking, seems warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2061289602,"We conducted a case-control study of renal cancer (987 cases and 1298 controls) in Central and Eastern Europe and analyzed genomic DNA for 319 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 21 genes involved in cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis using an Illumina Oligo Pool All (OPA). A haplotype-based method (sliding window analysis of consecutive SNPs) was used to identify chromosome regions of interest that remained significant at a false discovery rate of 10%. Subsequently, risk estimates were generated for regions with a high level of signal and individual SNPs by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender and study center. Three regions containing genes associated with renal cancer were identified: caspase 1/5/4/12(CASP 1/5/4/12), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3). We observed that individuals with CASP1/5/4/12 haplotype (spanning area upstream of CASP1 through exon 2 of CASP5) GGGCTCAGT were at higher risk of renal cancer compared to individuals with the most common haplotype (OR:1.40, 95% CI:1.10–1.78, p-value = 0.007). Analysis of EGFR revealed three strong signals within intron 1, particularly a region centered around rs759158 with a global p = 0.006 (GGG: OR:1.26, 95% CI:1.04–1.53 and ATG: OR:1.55, 95% CI:1.14–2.11). A region in IGFBP3 was also associated with increased risk (global p = 0.04). In addition, the number of statistically significant (p-value<0.05) SNP associations observed within these three genes was higher than would be expected by chance on a gene level. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate these genes in relation to renal cancer and there is need to replicate and extend our findings. The specific regions associated with risk may have particular relevance for gene function and/or carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our evaluation has identified common genetic variants in CASP1, CASP5, EGFR, and IGFBP3 that could be associated with renal cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2111334080,"The conformational dynamics of cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP2B1) were investigated through the introduction of a disulfide bond to link the I- and K-helices by generation of a double Cys variant, Y309C/S360C. The consequences of the disulfide bonding were examined both experimentally and in silico by molecular dynamics simulations. Under high hydrostatic pressures, the partial inactivation volume for the Y309C/S360C variant was determined to be -21 cm3mol(-1), which is more than twice as much as those of the wild type (WT) and single Cys variants (Y309C, S360C). This result indicates that the engineered disulfide bond has substantially reduced the protein plasticity of the Y309C/S360C variant. Under steady-state turnover conditions, the S360C variant catalyzed the N-demethylation of benzphetamine and O-deethylation of 7-ethoxy-trifluoromethylcoumarin as the WT did, whereas the Y309C variant retained only 39% of the N-demethylation activity and 66% of the O-deethylation activity compared with the WT. Interestingly, the Y309C/S360C variant restored the N-demethylation activity to the same level as that of the WT but decreased the O-deethylation activity to only 19% of the WT. Furthermore, the Y309C/S360C variant showed increased substrate specificity for testosterone over androstenedione. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the engineered disulfide bond altered substrate access channels. Taken together, these results suggest that protein dynamics play an important role in regulating substrate entry and recognition."

The mechanisms behind this plasticity were explored using rat platelets in vitro, specifically to determine the relative contributions made by desensitization of NO receptors, which couple to cGMP formation, and by phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5), which is activated by cGMP and also hydrolyzes it. Repeated delivery of brief NO pulses (50 nm peak) at 1-min intervals resulted in a progressive loss of the associated cGMP responses, which was the combined consequence of receptor desensitization and PDE5 activation, with the former dominating. Delivery of pulses of differing amplitude showed that NO stimulated and desensitized receptors with similar potency (EC50 = 10–20 nm). PDE5 activation was highly sensitive to NO, with a single pulse peaking at 2 nm being sufficient to evoke a 50% loss of response to a subsequent near-maximal NO pulse. However, the activated state of the PDE subsided quickly after removal of NO, the half-time for recovery being 25 s. In contrast, receptor desensitization reverted much more slowly, the half-time being 16 min.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an intercellular messenger molecule in most tissues of the body and exerts physiological effects by binding to receptors possessing intrinsic guanylyl cyclase (GC) 4The abbreviations used are: GCguanylyl cyclasePDEphosphodiesteraseCPTIO2–4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxideVASPvasodilator-stimulated phosphoproteinHEKhuman embryonic kidney. activity. The receptor proteins are known by various names, including the homogenate-based one, soluble guanylyl cyclase, but here we simply call them NO receptors because this terminology is conceptually more informative in a cellular context. Synthesis of cGMP from GTP that follows receptor activation can engage a number of downstream targets, including cGMP-dependent protein kinase, to bring about alterations in cell function, such as smooth muscle relaxation and neural transmission (1Garthwaite J.

In common with other hormone or transmitter signaling pathways, the sensitivity of the NO-cGMP pathway is subject to short term and long term regulation. Enduring exposure of cells to NO (hours or more) leads to a loss of NO responsiveness that in the cardiovascular system contributes to the clinical problem of tolerance to nitrovasodilator therapy (4Axelsson K.L. Andersson R.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 88: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Ujiie K. Hogarth L. Danziger R. Drewett J.G. Yuen P.S. Pang I.H. Star R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

One mechanism here is a gradual loss of the NO receptor mRNA and protein (7Scott W.S. Nakayama D.K. J. Surg. Res. 1998; 79: 66-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Filippov G. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conversely, a chronic lack of NO leads to supersensitivity that has been attributed to increased NO receptor activity (9Hussain M.B. Hobbs A.J. MacAllister R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1082-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Brandes R.P. Kim D. Schmitz-Winnenthal F.H. Amidi M. Gödecke A. Mülsch A. Busse R. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 231-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Short term regulatory mechanisms serve to shape acute cellular cGMP responses to NO and may involve NO receptor desensitization, reducing the rate of cGMP formation (11Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Goodwin D.A. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), activation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that consume cGMP (12Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Thompson W.J. Liu L. Koesling D. Friebe A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or combinations of the two (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These short term mechanisms may also be quite sustained. For example, relatively brief (5 min) exposures of cells to NO can reduce responsiveness to NO an hour later, a phenomenon that correlated with increased activity of PDE5 (15Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Feil R. Thompson W.J. Hofmann F. Koesling D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This PDE isoform, which is inhibited by drugs like sildenafil (Viagra) used to treat erectile dysfunction, contains a non-catalytic cGMP binding site whose occupation stimulates catalytic activity (16Okada D. Asakawa S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9672-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, shortly after removing the endothelial source of NO, blood vessels develop a supersensitivity to NO-induced relaxation, an effect that was speculated to reflect increased NO receptor responsiveness (18Moncada S. Rees D.D. Schulz R. Palmer R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2166-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Addressing directly the relative contributions of NO receptors and PDEs to the regulation of NO-cGMP signaling is problematic in complex tissues because it is very difficult to measure their activities accurately. Rat platelets maintained in vitro, on the other hand, have merit as an experimental model for these purposes because they are physiological NO targets, homogenous, and are also extremely small (about 1 μm in diameter), minimizing problems of compartmentation of the signaling proteins and of diffusion delays in access of applied agents to the cell interior. In addition, they exist naturally in suspension, which is ideal for kinetic studies, they have an abundance of NO receptors of just one type (α1β1), and the only detectable PDE that hydrolyzes NO-evoked cGMP signals is PDE5 (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exposure of these cells to persistent NO generates only very transient cGMP responses, mostly terminating within 10 s of NO application; this profile has been explained by a combination of receptor desensitization and PDE5 enhancement (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The questions addressed here are whether or not these adaptations persist beyond the period of NO application to influence subsequent cellular responsiveness and, if so, for how long, and what are their relative contributions to the plasticity? Central to the feasibility of obtaining answers was our recent development of a method for delivering repeated NO pulses of known amplitude and duration (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), allowing controlled conditioning NO exposures to be followed by test exposures after selected time intervals in NO-free solution. Proline-NONOate, diethylenetriamine-NONOate, spermine NONOate, and 2–4-carboxyphenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (CPTIO) were obtained from Axxora Ltd. (Nottingham, UK); sildenafil was supplied by the Chemistry Division of the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research (London, UK). Other special chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line expressing bovine α1β1-GC and human PDE5A1 (HEK-GC/PDE5 cells (19Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Friebe A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) and the phospho-PDE5 antibody were kindly supplied by Professor Doris Koesling (Univ. of Bochum, Germany). These were prepared from rat blood using methods described previously (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C in a solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.55 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Tris, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.3 mm urate, and 0.1 mm l-nitroarginine supplemented with superoxide dismutase (1000 units/ml), pH 7.4. The platelets were maintained at 0.5 mg of protein/ml or, for investigating PDE5 phosphorylation, at twice this concentration. Calibrated pulses of NO were administered using a combination of a fast NO releaser, proline-NONOate (half-life = 1.8 s), and a slow NO-consumer, CPTIO (50 μm), as described in detail (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As before, calibration was carried out by directly measuring the NO concentration attained by standard mixtures. Stock proline-NONOate solutions were then prepared to give the desired final peak NO concentrations (which are proportional to the donor concentration) when diluted 1:100 into the platelet suspension containing CPTIO. The pulses illustrated in the figures are simulations based on the kinetics of the reaction and closely resemble the recorded NO profiles, except that the recorded profiles are artificially slowed by the electrode response time (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Clamped NO concentrations were achieved with a mixture of CPTIO (50 μm) and one of the slower NO releasers, spermine-NONOate (half-life = 39 min) or diethylenetriamine NONOate (half-life = 20 h), depending on the duration of the experiment (20Griffiths C. Wykes V. Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Aliquots of platelets were inactivated in boiling buffer, and the amounts of cGMP and protein were measured as before (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In many of the experiments, rapid (2-s) exposures to NO in the presence or absence of sildenafil were made to measure the initial rate of cGMP accumulation as precisely as possible. Sampling was done by rapidly dispensing an aliquot of platelets (50 μl) preincubated with CPTIO onto a 0.5-μl bead of NO donor (and a separate 0.5-μl bead of sildenafil, when used) deposited immediately beforehand in the bottom of a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube prewarmed to 37 °C (time 0) and then quickly withdrawing the aliquot back into the pipette before inactivating it (time = 2 s). Based on measurements using 0.5-μl beads of India ink, mixing was complete 72 ± 10 ms (mean ± S.E.; n = 5) after the initial addition of the platelets (see supplemental Fig. S1). At the applied concentration (100 μm), maximally effective concentrations of sildenafil are expected intracellularly almost instantaneously; from the molecular weight (494) and polar surface area (109 Å2), the membrane permeability coefficient of sildenafil is expected to be about 1.3 × 10−6 cm/s (21Clark D.E. J. Pharm. Sci. 1999; 88: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), which predicts an intracellular concentration of 0.1 μm after 14 ms in a platelet (assumed to be a sphere of radius = 0.5 μm). The effect of 0.1 μm sildenafil on the early rise in cGMP would be indistinguishable from maximum PDE5 inhibition, as determined from the kinetics of inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil at steady state in rat platelets (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In each experiment there were 3–4 independent runs of each condition; results are presented as the means ± S.E. Except where impractical, extracellular/bound cGMP sustained through prior NO exposure was measured by inactivating an aliquot of platelets immediately before re-exposure. In agreement with prior detailed studies (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the values ranged from 5 to 25 pmol/mg protein depending on conditions. Unless indicated otherwise (Fig. 3), results are given after subtraction of this pool of cGMP. After incubation and treatment, aliquots of platelets (0.1 ml) were inactivated with 25 μl of a Laemmli-type buffer, giving a final concentration of 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. HEK-GC/PDE5 cells were grown in 48-well plates and were then incubated and exposed to S-nitrosoglutathione as described (19Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Friebe A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After treatment, the medium was aspirated and replaced with the above Laemmli-type buffer. All samples were kept on ice until the end of the experiment when they were frozen at −80 °C until needed. Electrophoresis was carried out in 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were equilibrated for 30 min in transfer buffer (50 mm Tris base, 384 mm glycine, 5% methanol) with the addition of 0.05% Triton X-100 and 1/1000 (v/v) antioxidant solution (2 m sodium bisulfite in 10% dimethylformamide). Proteins were transferred to hydrated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immun-Blot, Bio-Rad) in a submerged blotting apparatus (TE22, Hoefer Inc., Holliston, MA) using a current of 0.38 A for 90 min in transfer buffer plus 0.01% SDS, after which the blots were allowed to dry completely at room temperature before being stored at 4 °C until required. Blots were submerged in methanol for ∼10 s, equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min, and then blocked for 1 h in 3% skimmed milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20. Anti-phospho-PDE5 antibody was diluted 1/1000 into blocking buffer for overnight incubation at 4 °C with agitation. Blots were washed 3 times (5 min each) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (goat anti-rabbit, Pierce) was applied at 10 ng/ml in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature with agitation. After washing (as before), blots were developed in chemiluminescence substrate (Supersignal West Pico, Pierce) and exposed to Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare). Images from autoradiographs were captured in GeneSnap (Syngene, Cambridge, UK), and the relative intensity of bands was quantified with GeneTools (Syngene). Phosphorylated VASP in platelets was detected by immunoblotting as described previously (22Roy B. Mo E. Vernon J. Garthwaite J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Equations encapsulating the scheme presented under “Results” were solved in Mathcad 14 (Adept Scientific, Letchworth, Herts, UK). The NO pulse input was as described before (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The results of the calculations were in molar units (concentrations or rates), which were converted into the experimental units (pmol/mg protein) by assuming 1 mg of protein is equivalent to 2.5 μl (23Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrügge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the first experiment pulses of NO peaking at a concentration of 50 nm after 2 s and declining to 0 after 15–20 s were delivered at 1-min intervals. This pulse height gives near-maximal NO receptor activation (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The apparent GC activity was recorded during each pulse by measuring cGMP accumulation over a 2-s period in the presence of sildenafil in high enough concentration (100 μm) to effectively abolish PDE5 activity (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). From a control activity of around 230 pmol/mg of protein/2 s, a single preceding NO pulse caused the activity to fall by 45%. With succeeding pulses, further reductions occurred until a steady 78% desensitization was reached after 5–6 pulses (Fig. 1A). To gauge concomitant alterations in PDE5 activity, cGMP accumulation during the first 2 s of each pulse was measured in the same experiments in the absence of sildenafil. To begin with, the control responses were not much smaller than with sildenafil present (180 pmol/mg of protein/2 s), signifying a low initial activity of PDE5, but 1 min after the first NO pulse the response was down to about a third of its initial amplitude. Additional pulses elicited further reductions until, after 4–6 pulses, the response amplitude became relatively constant at about 15 pmol/mg of protein/2 s, which was less than 10% that of the starting value (Fig. 1A). Conceivably, some of the fade taking place in the presence of sildenafil under these conditions could be caused by the appearance of PDE activity other than that of PDE5. To examine this possibility, PDE activity in the presence of sildenafil was measured after the same sequence of pulses. This was carried out by adding sildenafil just before the final (sixth) pulse and then charting the decline in platelet cGMP levels once the NO pulse had decayed. The outcome (Fig. 1C) showed a very slow rate of loss of cGMP that was quantitatively the same as predicted from the measured kinetics of inhibition by sildenafil under steady-state conditions in rat platelets (broken line, Fig. 1C). This result shows that there was no unsuspected PDE activity and also attests to the expected very rapid penetration of sildenafil into the platelets (see “Experimental Procedures”). These findings demonstrate that brief periods of NO exposure induce a progressive reduction of subsequent responsiveness (tachyphylaxis) and that the tachyphylaxis is caused by a mixture of receptor desensitization and PDE5 activation, with the former dominating under the conditions of this experiment. Moreover, the alterations in both components must be quite enduring; otherwise, summation with repeated pulses would not have occurred. The evolution of the desensitized state was examined by measuring the apparent GC activity (2-s exposure to a 50 nm pulse in the presence of sildenafil) at various times after delivering a single NO pulse (50 nm peak amplitude). There was an initial fall in apparent GC activity, bottoming near the end of the NO pulse (15–20 s), and then a partial recovery to a steady desensitized level (Fig. 2A). A persistence of the desensitized state for more than a minute explains the summation observed in Fig. 1A. The concentration-response curve for NO-induced desensitization was examined by giving three identical pulses of NO (1 per min) of differing peak amplitude (0.1–100 nm) and, a minute later, measuring the apparent GC activity (2-s exposure) generated in response to a fixed 50 nm pulse. The results showed that 50% desensitization was achieved with a pulse height of about 20 nm NO (Fig. 2B). Measurement of the receptor activation curve in the same experiment (in untreated platelets) showed an EC50 of about 10 nm, in agreement with previous findings with this method (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and with measurements using clamped NO concentrations (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, acute receptor activation and desensitization occur over similar NO concentration ranges. Single NO pulses of different amplitudes were administered, and at varying times afterward, the cGMP accumulation occurring over 2 s in response to a fixed (50 nm) pulse was recorded in the presence and absence of sildenafil. The aim was to differentiate changes in function of the receptor alone (test plus sildenafil) and the receptor plus PDE5 (test minus sildenafil). The net cellular response (comprising changes in receptor plus PDE5) altered radically. After an NO pulse as low as 2 nm (peak), the cellular response was depressed by 50% after 10 s but then recovered, apparently completely, by 2 min (Fig. 3A). NO pulses of increased amplitude (5, 10, and 50 nm) gave greater initial depressions whose amplitudes were graded with the NO pulse height, the largest causing effectively complete inhibition of cGMP accumulation 10–20 s afterward. In all cases, however, the responses recovered at similar rates, reaching an apparent steady-state value after about 2 min with a half-time of around 25 s. After the 50 nm NO pulse, the resulting steady-state amplitude was clearly depressed relative to the control (no pre-exposure to NO). When assayed in the presence of sildenafil, there was little obvious change in the receptor output over the whole time-course after pulses of 2–10 nm NO, but a 50 nm pulse gave ∼30% depression that lasted for the 10-min duration of the experiment (Fig. 3B). The foregoing experiment indicates that PDE5 activation makes a profound contribution to short term tachyphylaxis, whereas receptor desensitization becomes evident with larger pulses and has a longer-lasting role. To find out how long desensitization persists, platelets were given a sequence of 4 NO pulses (50 nm peak; 1 per min) to provoke tachyphylaxis, and then recovery was monitored over the next hour by periodically testing the response (2 s) to a 50 nm NO pulse in the presence of sildenafil. Controls included performing the test sampling in the absence of sildenafil (to check for possible changes in PDE5 activity) and the running of untreated samples alongside. The results showed that there was a slow but apparently complete recovery of receptor function, the half-time being near 16 min (Fig. 4). With the exception of the first test sample (assayed during the last of the conditioning pulses), there was little effect of omitting sildenafil from the test samples, consistent with PDE5 activity reverting quickly to its very low resting level. The recovery of the PDE5 activity in these experiments was unexpectedly rapid considering previous evidence from human platelets that activation of PDE5 can last much longer, being still evident 1 h after a 5-min exposure to 1 μm diethylamine NONOate (15Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Feil R. Thompson W.J. Hofmann F. Koesling D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). From studies on model cell lines, the enduring activity has been attributed to phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase of a serine residue on the PDE5 enzyme, resulting in a slowed dissociation of cGMP from its agonist site (19Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Friebe A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The much faster reversal observed in the present experiments, therefore, suggests either that PDE5 does not become phosphorylated with the pulses of NO used here (amplitude up to 50 nm) or that phosphorylation reverses much more rapidly than in human platelets. On monitoring the level of PDE5 phosphorylation by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A), no significant alteration was detectable during a 2-min period, after giving a 50 nm NO pulse. The same result was obtained when NO was present throughout the 2-min period in a clamped concentration of 50 nm when, as reported before (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), cGMP also rose only transiently (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when faced with a clamped 50 nm NO concentration in the presence of sildenafil (100 μm), cGMP rose to very high levels which were maintained over 2 min (Fig. 5B), in agreement with previous findings (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a trend toward increased PDE5 phosphorylation with time was evident in some runs (inset, Fig. 5A), but the mean levels were not significantly different from controls (Fig. 5A). When many more samples were analyzed, however, a 2-min exposure to 50 nm clamped NO in the presence of sildenafil generated a modest but significant increase in PDE5 phosphorylation (145 ± 17% of control; n = 13; p = 0.0027 by paired t test). As a positive control for the phospho-PDE5 antibody, HEK cells expressing NO-activated GC and PDE5 were challenged with 100 μm S-nitrosoglutathione for 5 or 10 min; mean increases of up to 700% of basal levels were observed (Fig. 5A), consistent with a prior publication using the same cells and methodology (19Mullershausen F. Russwurm M. Koesling D. Friebe A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4023-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The possibility then arose that the concentration of NO to which the platelets were exposed in the above experiments (50 nm) was too high, particularly in view of evidence that the concentration-response curve for NO-induced, cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP in rat platelets is biphasic, with NO concentrations higher than 3 nm giving progressively less VASP phosphorylation (13Mo E. Amin H. Bianco I.H. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26149-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exposure to a range of clamped NO concentrations (0.1–30 nm) for 2 min, however, did not lead to a significant change in phospho-PDE5 levels (Fig. 5C). As controls in the same experiments, NO produced the usual concentration-dependent increase in cGMP levels (EC50 = 10 nm; Fig. 5C) and increased VASP phosphorylation, with a maximal effect occurring at about 3 nm NO followed by a decline (inset, Fig. 5C). All these results suggest that the behavior of PDE5 in the platelets under the conditions of our experiments is largely uncomplicated by phosphorylation of the enzyme. The data obtained in the present study, when combined with the current scheme for NO receptor activation (14Roy B. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12185-12190Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Bellamy T.C. Wood J. Garthwaite J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Both components are represented as two"
https://openalex.org/W2055482990,"Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a lethal disease of cattle, characterized by vasculitis, necrosis, and accumulation of activated, dysregulated cytotoxic lymphocytes in various tissues. Ovine gamma herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) is a causative agent of MCF, which may trigger the disease through immunopathogenic pathways. Lymphocytes are the main target of the virus. However, the pathogenic basis of the disease is still mysterious.We hypothesized that the gene expression patterns of OvHV-2 and the relative abundances of host cell transcripts in lymphnodes may be used to identify pathways that help to explain the pathogenesis of MCF. Therefore, viral and host cell gene expression patterns in lymph nodes of animals with MCF and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray. Two regions on the viral genome were transcriptionally active, one encoding an orthologue to the latency-associated nuclear antigen (ORF73) of other gamma herpesviruses, the other with no predicted open reading frame. A vast number of transcripts related to inflammatory processes, lymphocyte activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected at different abundances. However, the IL-2 transcript was eminent among the transcripts, which were, compared to healthy controls, less abundant in animals with MCF. The ratio between CD4- and CD8-positive T-lymphocytes was decreased in the lymphnodes of animals with MCF compared to healthy controls. In contrast, the same ratio was stable, when peripheral blood lymphocytes were analyzed.The phenotype of mice with a deficient IL-2-system almost perfectly matches the clinical signs observed in cattle with MCF, which feature a significantly decreased IL-2 transcript abundance, compared to healthy cattle. This supports the hypothesis that immunopathogenic events are linked to the pathogenesis of MCF. IL-2-deficiency may play an important role in the process. Therefore, this work opens new avenues for research on MCF."
https://openalex.org/W2018949743,"WTAP (Wilms tumor 1-associating protein) is a recently identified nuclear protein that is essential for mouse embryo development. The Drosophila homolog of WTAP, Fl(2)d, regulates pre-mRNA splicing; however, the role of WTAP in mammalian cells is uncertain. To elucidate a context for WTAP action, we screened growth and survival factors for their effects on WTAP expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), a cell type previously found to express WTAP dynamically. This revealed that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) uniquely reduced WTAP abundance. This decline in WTAP proved to be necessary for IGF-1 to confer its antiapoptotic properties, which were blocked by transducing the WTAP gene into SMCs. WTAP down-regulation by IGF-1 was mediated by an IGF-1 receptor-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling axis that directed WTAP degradation via a nuclear 26 S proteasome. Moreover, by promoting the degradation of WTAP, IGF-1 shifted the pre-mRNA splicing program for the survival factor, survivin, to reduce expression of survivin-2B, which is proapoptotic, and increase expression of survivin, which is antiapoptotic. Knockdown of survivin-2B rescued the ability of IGF-1 to promote survival when WTAP was overexpressed. These data uncover a novel regulatory cascade for human SMC survival based on adjusting the nuclear abundance of WTAP to define the splice variant balance among survivin isoforms."

For oskar mRNA, the Drosophila posterior determinant, these spatio-temporal requirements remain opaque during its multi-step transport process. By in vivo covisualization of oskar mRNA with Staufen, its putative trafficking protein, we find oskar mRNA to be present in particles distinct from Staufen for part of its transport. oskar mRNA stably associated with Staufen near the posterior pole. We observe oskar mRNA to oligomerize as hundreds of copies forming large particles which are necessary for its long range transport and localization. We show the formation of these particles occurs in the nurse cell nucleus in an Hrp48-dependent manner. We present a more refined model of oskar mRNA transport in the Drosophila oocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2069991923,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in cells requires mycobactin siderophores. Recently, the search for lipid antigens presented by the CD1a antigen-presenting protein led to the discovery of a mycobactin-like compound, dideoxymycobactin (DDM). Here we synthesize DDMs using solution phase and solid phase peptide synthesis chemistry. Comparison of synthetic standards to natural mycobacterial mycobactins by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry allowed identification of an unexpected alpha-methyl serine unit in natural DDM. This finding further distinguishes these pre-siderophores as foreign compounds distinct from conventional peptides, and we provide evidence that this chemical variation influences the T cell response. One synthetic DDM recapitulated natural structures and potently stimulated T cells, making it suitable for patient studies of CD1a in infectious disease. DDM analogs differing in the stereochemistry of their butyrate or oxazoline moieties were not recognized by human T cells. Therefore, we conclude that T cells show precise specificity for both arms of the peptide, which are predicted to lie at the CD1a-T cell receptor interface."
https://openalex.org/W2091260004,"Dosage compensation in eutherian mammals occurs by inactivation of one X chromosome in females. Silencing of that X chromosome is initiated by Xist, a large non-coding RNA, whose coating of the chromosome extends in cis from the X inactivation center. LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons have been implicated as possible players for propagation of the Xist signal, but it has remained unclear whether they are essential components. We previously identified a group of South American rodents in which L1 retrotransposition ceased over 8 million years ago and have now determined that at least one species of these rodents, Oryzomys palustris, still retains X inactivation. We have also isolated and analyzed the majority of the Xist RNA from O. palustris and a sister species retaining L1 activity, Sigmodon hispidus, to determine if evolution in these sequences has left signatures that might suggest a critical role for L1 elements in Xist function. Comparison of rates of Xist evolution in the two species fails to support L1 involvement, although other explanations are possible. Similarly, comparison of known repeats and potential RNA secondary structures reveals no major differences with the exception of a new repeat in O. palustris that has potential to form new secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W2087796843,"Background Cellular contractility, essential for cell movement and proliferation, is regulated by microtubules, RhoA and actomyosin. The RhoA dependent kinase ROCK ensures the phosphorylation of the regulatory Myosin II Light Chain (MLC) Ser19, thereby activating actomyosin contractions. Microtubules are upstream inhibitors of contractility and their depolymerization or depletion cause cells to contract by activating RhoA. How microtubule dynamics regulates RhoA remains, a major missing link in understanding contractility. Principal Findings We observed that contractility is inhibited by microtubules not only, as previously reported, in adherent cells, but also in non-adhering interphase and mitotic cells. Strikingly we observed that contractility requires ubiquitin mediated proteolysis by a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase. Inhibition of proteolysis, ubiquitination and neddylation all led to complete cessation of contractility and considerably reduced MLC Ser19 phosphorylation. Conclusions Our results imply that cells express a contractility inhibitor that is degraded by ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, either constitutively or in response to microtubule depolymerization. This degradation seems to depend on a Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase and is required for cellular contractions."
https://openalex.org/W2031767356,"The Fourier space (reciprocal space) image of bulk polyethylene consists of lines superimposed on the coherent diffuse background. The mixed character of the image indicates the complex nature of these compounds. The inability in detecting full images of reciprocal space of polymeric substances without Compton radiation and the other undesirable diffuse scatterings has misled the structural analysis (structural characterisation) of these materials.We propose the use of anomalous diffractometry where, it is possible to obtain a real image of reciprocal space without Compton radiation and other undesirable scatterings. By using classical diffractometry techniques this procedure is not possible. This methodology permitted us to obtain the ""Direct Delta function"", in the case of polycrystalline substances that was not previously detected. A new procedure was proposed to interpret the image of reciprocal space of bulk polyethylene. The results show the predominance of the geometry of local order determination compared to the crystal unit cell. The analysis of x-ray diffraction images illustrates that the elementary structural unit is a tetrahedron. This structural unit illustrates the atoms in the network scatter in a coherent diffuse manner. Moreover, the interference function derived from the coherent diffuse scattering dampens out quickly and the degree of randomness is superior to a liquid state. The radial distribution function derived from this interference function shows bond shortening in the tetrahedron configuration. It is this particular effect, which stabilises polyethylene.Here we show by anomalous diffractometry that the traditional concept of the two-phase or the crystal-defect model is an oversimplification of the complex reality. The exploitation of anomalous diffractometry has illustrated that polyethylene has an intermediate ordered structure."
https://openalex.org/W1970505192,"Faces are arguably one of the most important object categories encountered by human observers, yet they present one of the most difficult challenges to both the human and artificial visual systems. A variety of experimental paradigms have been developed to study how faces are represented and recognized, among which is the part-spacing paradigm. This paradigm is presumed to characterize the processing of both the featural and configural information of faces, and it has become increasingly popular for testing hypotheses on face specificity and in the diagnosis of face perception in cognitive disorders.In two experiments we questioned the validity of the part task of this paradigm by showing that, in this task, measuring pure information about face parts is confounded by the effect of face configuration on the perception of those parts. First, we eliminated or reduced contributions from face configuration by either rearranging face parts into a non-face configuration or by removing the low spatial frequencies of face images. We found that face parts were no longer sensitive to inversion, suggesting that the previously reported inversion effect observed in the part task was due in fact to the presence of face configuration. Second, self-reported prosopagnosic patients who were selectively impaired in the holistic processing of faces failed to detect part changes when face configurations were presented. When face configurations were scrambled, however, their performance was as good as that of normal controls.In sum, consistent evidence from testing both normal and prosopagnosic subjects suggests the part task of the part-spacing paradigm is not an appropriate task for either measuring how face parts alone are processed or for providing a valid contrast to the spacing task. Therefore, conclusions from previous studies using the part-spacing paradigm may need re-evaluation with proper paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W1971127182,"Background While many authors have discussed models and tools for studying protein evolution at the sequence level, molecular function is usually mediated by complex, higher order features such as independently folding domains and linear motifs that are based on or embedded in a particular arrangment of features such as secondary structure elements, transmembrane domains and regions with intrinsic disorder. This ‘protein architecture’ can, in its most simplistic representation, be visualized as domain organization cartoons that can be used to compare proteins in terms of the order of their mostly globular domains. Methodology Here, we describe a visual approach and a webserver for protein comparison that extend the domain organization cartoon concept. By developing an information-rich, compact visualization of different protein features above the sequence level, potentially related proteins can be compared at the level of propensities for secondary structure, transmembrane domains and intrinsic disorder, in addition to PFAM domains. A public Web server is available at www.proteinarchitect.net, while the code is provided at protarchitect.sourceforge.net. Conclusions/Significance Due to recent advances in sequencing technologies we are now flooded with millions of predicted proteins that await comparative analysis. In many cases, mature tools focused on revealing hits with considerable global or local similarity to well-characterized proteins will not be able to lead us to testable hypotheses about a protein's function, or the function of a particular region. The visual comparison of different types of protein features with ProteinArchitect will be useful when assessing the relevance of similarity search hits, to discover subgroups in protein families and superfamilies, and to understand protein regions with conserved features outside globular regions. Therefore, this approach is likely to help researchers to develop testable hypotheses about a protein's function even if is somewhat distant from the more characterized proteins, by facilitating the discovery of features that are conserved above the sequence level for comparison and further experimental investigation."
