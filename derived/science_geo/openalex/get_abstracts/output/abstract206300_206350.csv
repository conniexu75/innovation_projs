https://openalex.org/W2071342520,"Certain improvements are described in the use of penicillin for isolating auxotrophic mutants of bacteria. By obtaining exponential growth before the penicillin is added, and by minimizing the duration of the treatment, cross-feeding is decreased and much denser populations can be screened. These modifications have made it possible to obtain, with regularity, mutants of Escherichia coli blocked in a desired step in arginine biosynthesis."

Two principal forms of crystals were found, the predominant type being of the same order of magnitude and shape as those found in bone, and showing the typical characteristics of apatite in selected area electron diffraction patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2033481301,"When cultures of cells derived from the entoderm of the chick embryo were infected with trachoma virus, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies composed of viral particles were easily demonstrated. The inclusions are similar to those found in stained smears from trachomatous eyes and they developed in a sequence characteristic for this group of viruses. This method of culture appears to offer a valuable additional tool for study of the trachoma agent."
https://openalex.org/W1978894409,"ALTHOUGH the tocopherols, and in particular α-tocopherol, are widely distributed in Nature, they have not so far been identified in micro-organisms. The only micro-organism that has been adequately studied is bakers' yeast, which has been found to contain no tocopherol, although it contains another substance with vitamin E-like activity1. In view of recent work connecting α-tocopherol with some fundamental cellular processes, such as the reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome c reductase system2, the regulation of succinate oxidation in rat liver mitochondria3 and the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate4, it was of interest to investigate the occurrence of tocopherols in a range of micro-organisms. The following organisms were grown in deep culture, using suitable media, the general composition of which is shown in Table 1: three strains of Esch. coli., 8196 and two vitamin B12-requiring mutants, N.I.R.D. and M200 (C181 strain) ; Streptococcus fœcalis R.; Bacillus cereus (strain 5) ; Staphylococcus aureus 4163; the nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Rhizobium leguminosarum 317 ; three sulphur-requiring, chlorophyll-containing bacteria, Chromatium 8379, Chlorobium thiosulphatophilum and Thiopedia; two chlorophyll-containing protozoa, Ochromonas malhamensis and Euglena gracilis; and one non-chlorophyll containing protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis."

If the block does not interfere with interconversions among adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine and xanthine, then any of the purines can act as a feedback inhibitor. If conversion of the other purines to adenine is prevented, then adenine becomes a specific requirement for inhibition; this indicates that feedback control operates at a level involving adenine or one of its congeners."

https://openalex.org/W2062243199,"OCCURRENCE of multiple haemoglobins has been reported recently in fish as well as in other vertebrates. In particular, Salmonidae was found electrophoretically to contain fairly close amounts of two or more components1,2. Some physico-chemical properties of the two components of blood haemoglobin in the salmon Oncorhynchus keta, which were prepared from haemolyzate by starch zone electrophoresis, have already been reported3. The fast-migrating component in the physiological pH region (designated component F) was more labile to heat denaturation, less soluble in concentrated salt solution, and behaved less anionically in electrophoresis than another component (designated as component S in view of its slow migration). Their behaviour in column chromatographic and absorption spectra in the Soret region were also more or less different from each other."

https://openalex.org/W2015823535,"PREPARATIONS of heparin have been shown to be heterogeneous by a variety of techniques1,2, but no method is available for the fractionation of bulk quantities of heparin or of other sulphomucopolysaccharides. These compounds carry a strong negative charge over a wide range of pH, and, therefore, it seemed possible that they could be purified on basic resins. Five anion-exchange resins (‘Dowex–1’, ‘Dowex–2’, ‘Dowex–3’, ‘Amberlite CG–45’, and ‘Duolite A–4’), each buffered at pH 6.0, readily adsorbed heparin, which was easily eluted with strong salt solutions, but the eluates differed from the original material in having greater absorption at 400 mµ than at 535 mµ in the carbazole reaction3. However, ‘Ecteola’4,5 (exchange capacity = 0.3 m.equiv./gm.) resolved a commercial preparation of bovine heparin (obtained from Nutritional Biochemicals Corp.) into four major and one minor carbazole-positive fractions (Fig. 1), each with maximum absorption at 535 mµ, and all showing metachromasia6. 90 per cent of the original material was recovered. Heparin-35SO4, extracted from a mast-cell tumour of the mouse7, gave only one peak on chromatography on ‘Ecteola’ (Fig. 2), and only 50 per cent of the material was eluted."

https://openalex.org/W2065461392,"EARLY experiments1 had shown that wild-type stocks of Drosophila melanogaster carry different wild-type alleles at the sex-linked, white-eye (w) locus. A more recent2 detailed genetic analysis demonstrated that the w+ loci of the Canton-S(C) and Oregon-R(O) wild-type stocks differ in the right-hand two of the four recombinationally separate w+ loci. Thus C, and O may be described by the notation CC, and OO, where each letter represents two of the four loci. Derived wild-types carrying the right and left halves of the two stocks, that is CO, and OC, have been successfully synthesized.1"

https://openalex.org/W2021013009,"WITH the importance of griseofulvin in the treatment of superficial fungous infections, it is imperative to know more about the toxic reactions especially if treatment is prolonged. Since the significant studies of Paget and Walpole1 on the interference with mitosis under massive parenteral administration of griseofulvin in rats, there has been continued interest in investigations of this phase of reaction in man. Our purpose was to develop a technique for studying possible local cytotoxic reactions in man from locally deposited griseofulvin."

https://openalex.org/W1989383337,"THE secondary disease observed in irradiated animals treated with foreign bone marrow is of general interest and importance. The basic question which remains unanswered is whether immunologically competent cells in the chimera originate from the donor, the host, or a combination of both. Erythrocyte life-span studies might be expected to throw light on whether this secondary reaction, in so far as it is reflected in red cell survival, is of host or of donor origin."
